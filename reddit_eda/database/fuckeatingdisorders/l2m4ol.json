  "selftext": "A big part of eating disorders is feeling \"not sick enough\", and even when we are mostly recovered or actively in recovery, those feelings can creep in.\n\nI hate it when I or someone else posts a win or celebrates their progress, a success, whatever, and the reactions are: \"Congrats! I can't do that, but it's great that you can.\" \"I could never do that but I'm so happy for you!\" \"I hope I can do that one day too...\"\n\nI don't know. I know it's meant to be positive... but it doesn't come off that way. It feels like my success is turned into another's validation of their sickness, and I feel like, huh, did I really have an eating disorder if I could do this thing, but this person *couldn't*? Was I truly ever sick?\n\nI know it's meant to be positive and I absolutely do not think they're meant to be harmful, but they do feel kind of... unhelpful. Once you are aware of your sickness, it is up to you to eat. You can't choose to not have ED thoughts, but you can choose to act against them. It's very hard, but at the very least, I wish people wouldn't respond in that defeatist way to others' successes.",

We're all in pain, most of us have that sense of competitiveness, and when you see others doing \"better\" than you it's really hard to sit with that discomfort. A lot of people also don't see that they're making it about themselves even though it might seem obvious.\n\nDoesn't excuse the shitty behavior, but remembering this and trying to have compassion has made it easier for me to tolerate receiving comments like that.",

I say variations of \"I hope to do that some day\" because I have no options for recovery right now, as no therapists are taking me in or anything.",
