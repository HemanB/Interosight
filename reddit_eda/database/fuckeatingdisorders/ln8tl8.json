  "title": "ONE YEAR INTO RECOVERY - 8 things I learned",
  "selftext": "This is just going to be an amalgamation of thoughts that I plan on organizing later so nobody let me submit this without editing but here's a random ass list of things I learned after finally eating enough food for a single year. (OSFED) \n\n1. Looking sickly and skinny is not as attractive as looking fit and well-fed. \n2. There were lots of people in your life that knew you had an issue but didn't say anything, probably out of politeness. \n3. Turns out I don't have chronic insomnia \n4. I'm starting to notice strange phenomena closely related to feeding yourself and then having the energy to go about your day. (More research required)\n5. I literally cannot imagine caring about my appearance as much as I used to. \n6. My body doesn't consume my hard-earned muscles when I'm eating enough. \n7. Yes, the bloating/water retention of refeeding eventually went away. \n8. Eating enough to survive is not the same as eating enough to live.",
