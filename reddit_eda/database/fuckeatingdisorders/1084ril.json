  "selftext": "It seriously fucked up my relationship with food and is a big reason why I\u2019m in this sub now. I hate it because:\n\n- The default number of daily calories it suggests is 1,200, and you only get half the calories back from exercise. That is extreme, but the app makes it seem normal.\n\n- it claims that \u201cno foods are bad\u201d and yet labels them as red, green and yellow, then basically shames you for going over your allotted \u201cred foods\u201d\n\n- the whole weighing yourself every day thing. You start off your day immediately thinking about your weight, about food. \n\n- its general tone is patronizing AF\n\nMaybe this works for some people who have no underlying disorders (ED or otherwise), but, especially after the pandemic, that seems rare. \n\nI wish I could block their ads everywhere because it\u2019s so triggering. I get so angry.",

      "body": "I tried it after gaining some weight attempting recovery on my own. Note, I had atypical anorexia, so my weight was higher and when I \u201cgained some\u201d I was put into the \u201coverweight\u201d and then the \u201cobese\u201d category later on. This felt like I was both a) failing at recovery because I assumed you weren\u2019t \u201csupposed\u201d to get \u201cfat\u201d again in recovery, and b) \u201cnot actually sick\u201d etc etc. But I was also super afraid of going back into the ED mindset full in, and I though Noom would be like, ED-proof weight loss.\n\nNope nope NOPE NOPE NOPE. Three days in I jumped ship. Would rather learn to be neutral with the body I have that give any of my time, energy, or forbid MONEY to that company.\n\nDespite consuming a huge amount of anti-diet media, I still get so many weight loss ads everywhere that I want to scream. It\u2019s no longer Noom but now Found (medicated weight loss), which I hate for different reasons. If they can track that I\u2019m \u201cfat\u201d now, they should also be able to track that *im wholly uninterested in their \u201cweight control\u201d ads*",

Most people probably lose a bit then gain a bit throughout the year, so that's totally meaningless.\n\nThis is excellent critical thinking.\n\nIt also means 22% of Noom users lose no weight at all in an entire 6 months - nearly a quarter of users. Considering that many people's weight fluctuates a little in either direction as you pointed out, for that many people to lose none at all in that amount of time is pretty bad.\n\nHowever, not everyone uses it to lose, some might be looking to gain or maintain. So there might not be enough information to judge either way.",
