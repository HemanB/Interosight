  "selftext": "\nTW: Talk of calories, exercise, the whole shibang\n\nFor all of the people who don\u2019t like reading a big block of text (I understand that, don\u2019t worry), I\u2019m going to say this now and proud; IF YOU ARE HUNGRY, THEN IT IS OKAY TO EAT WHATEVER AMOUNT YOU FEEL LIKE HAVING. Yes, overeating occurs, yes, sometimes you\u2019ll regret it, but if your body asks for food, give it food. It\u2019s telling you that it needs it!\n\nNow for the meat and potatoes of this post (no pun intended). I\u2019ve gained a lot of weight lately and I was talking with my therapist about it. I told that I don\u2019t feel comfortable and that I\u2019m encased in a wall of fat or something, and I also said I\u2019m still hungry regardless of how much I\u2019m eating (I don\u2019t track). I thought she was going to say something in the lines of \u201cwell your body needed the weight so it\u2019ll be okay and this is a good thing!\u201d No, instead she said \u201cwell you can eat more, but let\u2019s balance that with exercise and movement.\u201d I know she meant well, but come on! She\u2019s my fucking therapist! She should know that\u2019s incredibly triggering to me with exercise as I used to run 6 miles and walk another 3 every day all while fasting. This hit me so hard that I starved for the rest of the night, and my depression was so bad. I then told myself this is so stupid, and I had a breakfast (something I never do.) Anyway, what happened to me should NOT happen to other men/women going through this terrible disorder. Here me right now, and don\u2019t disagree.\n\nWhen you are hungry, eat. No if\u2019s ands or buts. Eat. If you want to exercise for YOU and not your disorder, then do it. If you\u2019re tired and just can\u2019t do today, then stay in your bed and read a good book to watch some YouTube. You do not have to \u201ccounteract\u201d your calories by exercising. Your body asked for the energy, it knows what the fuck to do with it.\n\nPeople don\u2019t understand these things, so here I am telling you that you are loved, and it\u2019s okay to indulge and eat when you are hungry. Have a great day. Stay strong.",
