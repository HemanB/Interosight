  "title": "My \"goal\" shorts no longer fit me",
  "selftext": "Truthfully, they never fit for longer than about a week and only in the mornings before I had eaten. Any attempt to wear them out would lead to me choosing between walking around in unbuttoned shorts or severe discomfort. \n\nThis morning I had a nice big bowl of oatmeal that would have previously shocked my digestion so badly I wouldn't have been able to stand. I'm about to go grocery shopping to buy some granola bars that I used to turn away because they were \"too many calories\". I might bring a jacket in case some places get chilly but I'm not preemptively bundled in my thickest hoodie in a tropical climate. \n\nI have gained weight. But more weight is the smallest thing that recovery has given me.",
