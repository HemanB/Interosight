  "selftext": "Even if your ED tells you to, even if you haven\u2019t eaten all day but don\u2019t feel hungry, even if you\u2019re experiencing extreme hunger and you *just ate* but want more, even if you\u2019re weight restored, even if you\u2019re binging out of hunger, even if you have BED, even if someone previously told you that you need to eat some arbitrary amount to maintain some arbitrary weight/BMI. \n\nFirstly, if you\u2019re binging due to hunger, then you\u2019re going to need to make sure you aren\u2019t restricting (aka listening to your body and honoring your hunger); restriction leads to reactive binging and the body wants to compensate for that; hense why those with restrictive EDs eat a whole fucking lot in recovery. And if you have ensured you\u2019re honoring your body\u2019s need for food but still experiencing relentless hunger, then look into other possibilities such as chronic health conditions, etc. \n\nSecondly, suffering from BED doesn\u2019t mean you need to restrict either (I *really* wanna address the one). BED isn\u2019t driven by hunger and restricting isn\u2019t going to fix the binging\u2014if anything, it\u2019s going to exacerbate it and make it worse in the long term. Not that I\u2019m saying it\u2019s easy, and I understand why restriction seems like a logical response to overeating in a society that basically encourages undereating, especially for those in larger bodies. It\u2019s hard when it feels like you can\u2019t trust your body and that food is the enemy. But if you want to stop binging then learning to cope with the emotional responses and reactions that lead to a binge and those that happen after a binge, hopefully with the help of a professional, is going to be a lot more effective than restricting to \u201cmanage\u201d them. Telling others who have restrictive EDs that they need to eat (and eat  *a god damn lot* if they are in recovery) according to their hunger isn\u2019t encouraging BED and tbh I\u2019m a little confused why some of y\u2019all are reporting comments for that.\n\nBottom line: I understand \u201crecommending\u201d a minimum number of calories to people, especially those who are still terrified of eating (regardless of your ED), might not sit well with others but if you\u2019re struggling with an ED and you\u2019re hungry, then you 99.9% of the time, you should eat. \n\nYou are absolutely allowed to believe that restriction would work for you or whoever else, but there are other subs more suited for that kind of talk so I don\u2019t really think this is the place for it and I am not going to argue with y\u2019all about it.\n\nSo\u2026 Thanks for coming to another one of my TED Talks. Good night.",
