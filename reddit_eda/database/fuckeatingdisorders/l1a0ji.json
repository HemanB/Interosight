  "selftext": "My thighs have begun to rub together a little when I walk and I don\u2019t actually mind as much as I thought I would. I have to keep reminding myself that my goal is weight gain and that to become the person I used to be I have to have the body I used to have. I don\u2019t want to waste any more life!!!\n\n(Also, this sounds horribly cringey and maybe insane but I\u2019ve begun talking to my new fat and telling it that I love it because it\u2019s keeping me alive.)\n\nI\u2019ve also taken on Tabitha Farrar\u2019s strategy of deliberately eating anything my brain tells me I shouldn\u2019t eat, so that I rewire the neural pathway that thinks weight gain is bad.\n\nAnd yesterday I gave away all the clothes I bought in my ED years and ordered some trousers with an elastic waist online instead. I deleted most of the body check photos on my computer (next I just need to delete the ones on my phone.) I told all my friends about my ED so I have whole groups of people to hold me accountable.\n\nToday is my birthday and I expected to feel kind of sad and hollow but I feel fine. Better than I have since I began real recovery two weeks ago. I even watched some anime today which I haven\u2019t done in two years because I\u2018ve been much more interested in \u201cwhat I eat in a day\u201d and \u201cepic cheat day\u201d videos.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m being optimistic but I think I\u2019m going to be okay",

I guess it\u2019s all part of the recovery experience, though. I\u2019ve never met anyone who recovered from their ED without first going through a quasi recovery stage. \n\nDefinitely agree that neural pathways are HARD to break down and rebuild. I used to watch a lot of \u201chealthy\u201d weight loss Youtubers so it\u2019s been excruciatingly difficult to remember that \u201chealthy\u201d for them is not healthy for me. Still, my mindset is changing more rapidly than expected! As I mentioned, I only went all-in two weeks ago but I\u2019ve been fully committing and honouring my hunger cues so that\u2019s probably speeding up the process. Thanks for the encouragement!!",
