  "selftext": "And you can trick anyone else into thinking that it's really just because without a meal plan you \"wouldn't know\" how much to eat and \"you wouldn't remember\" to eat enough. But deep down you know that's not true. What you really, truly, genuinely mean to say is that without a meal plan you wouldn't know how to eat enough **and still not eat too much**.\n\nIt's really really easy to eat enough. And it's also really really easy to eat more if you're in doubt you haven't eaten enough and you're ready to eat more. You don't need any meal plan for that. If you don't do that it's because your ED makes you choose not to. It's not because you don't know how.\n\nIf you're unsure whether you've eaten enough or not, you could just eat more. The only thing stopping you from doing just that is your ED.\n\nThe only exception might be patients with extremely severe anorexia who are so underweight that their whole brain is literally unable to think clearly. But if you're out of any immediate danger, you **know** how much is enough, but a meal plan makes you feel safe that you won't go \"over\", or you won't gain weight \"too fast\".",

When we stop restricting, that\u2019s a coping mechanism being taken away. It\u2019s very common to start a new coping mechanism like bingeing. The meal plan and dietitian will help the person recovering learn the difference as extreme hunger is very often confused for a binge. The person is taught to listen to hunger/fullness queues and use those to guide eating big still hungry after eating a lot they will continue. That\u2019s likely extreme hunger.

Binges are emotionally driven and have nothing to do with physical hunger as the person bingeing will push themselves to continue eating past the point of physical fullness. Extreme hunger only happens when we deprive our bodies of food for too long. That generally can\u2019t be avoided and should be expected when recovering from a restrictive ed. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s what\u2019s being prevented. Bingeing, however is sometimes started as an extra coping mechanism or ed behavior. When we stop restricting, that\u2019s a coping mechanism being taken away. It\u2019s very common to start a new coping mechanism like bingeing. The meal plan and dietitian will help the person recovering learn the difference as extreme hunger is very often confused for a binge. The person is taught to listen to hunger/fullness queues and use those to guide eating big still hungry after eating a lot they will continue. That\u2019s likely extreme hunger. When bingeing is the case, the person likely wouldn\u2019t feel physically hungry after eating a lot of food and knows to stop. The meal plan gets them back on track after a binge.",

When we stop restricting, that\u2019s a coping mechanism being taken away. It\u2019s very common to start a new coping mechanism like bingeing. The meal plan and dietitian will help the person recovering learn the difference as extreme hunger is very often confused for a binge.

This kind of sounds like the argument that you can \u201cjust eat.\u201d Which I think everyone hear knows how much that sucks because I literally could not just open the fridge right now and just do that. \n\n\n\n\nThere is a risk of going to the opposite side of the spectrum and developing bed or some type of binge eating from anorexia regardless of whether or not you\u2019re underweight. Meal plans help mitigate that risk because generally that would make things worse. \n\n\n\nI also think meal plans help with macro and micronutrient distribution. Sure you can eat a lot of food, but if you\u2019re not picking the right ones and right amounts of each you\u2019re not going to replenish your body with the things it needs. \n\n\nI actually also think you wouldn\u2019t remember to eat enough or to eat at certain times. My ed has me conditioned to never start eating before a certain time each day. So after so long of doing that I don\u2019t get hungry until before that time and literally feel nauseous if I try to think about food too early. So yeah, if I were to go about my regular life I would forget about eating until a certain time and then it would be difficult to fit all of my exchanges before I go to sleep. \n\n\n\n\nI think it\u2019s easy to eat enough if you don\u2019t have an ed.

But to be honest, it's really and I mean really hard to believe that someone with an active ED can genuinely, truthfully, honestly just \"forget\" eating.\n\nSee my answer above: I'm not being condescending and I don't enjoy calling people out for shit and giggles. What I do believe, though, is that in order to recover we first have to be fully honest with ourselves instead of finding excuses. Which is what I also do on a daily basis - \"forgetting\" to eat, \"genuinely not knowing\" how much to eat, thinking that I'm somehow the exception and so on.",
