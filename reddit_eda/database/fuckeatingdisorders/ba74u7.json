  "title": "The Fat",
  "selftext": "Sometimes it feels like fat is a cancer.  A living mutant organism making its home on my body, on my belly, on my hips, on my face.  A parasite using my structure like loam uses rock to propagate and spread, disordered, uneven.  A semi-sentient entity with will and preferences distinct from mine-and, indeed, counterprogramming my attempts at resistance and eradication.  Altering my palate, my hunger, my cravings, my impulses solely to guarantee its own existence:  more fat for more fat.  Contemptuous of my small calorie plans, of my half remembered athleticism.  The fat seeks to multiply.   The fat seeks plenitude.  The fat wants cream, chocolate, peanut butter.  The fat wants every bite I take to be hurried and wolfen.  The fat wants to rip through the experience of eating, so anxious to ensure its long-term survival it takes from me even the pleasure of gluttony.  \nA loveless baby. \nA hateful master.",

      "body": "Adipocytes (fat cells) can never undergo apoptosis (natural death), but maintain the ability to grow in size and sometimes multiply into new permanent offspring. Interestingly, this potential for regrowth is exactly how muscle cells exist too. There are at least three types of adipocytes, of which two burn their trigylcerides to keep you warm. These forms, namely brown and beige, are much less prevalent than white adipocytes, which are not directly metabolically active. However, it is in your control to influence how many fat cells are brown/beige and how many are white through chronic cold exposure, low insulin dietary choices, and so on.\nBTW, the reason I'm sharing this is because my fears of my body have always been driven by my ignorance of it. The more I learn, the more control I feel over my self. Hopefully, you have found something that will lighten the darkness, whether that be logical, emotional or a combination.",
