  "title": "I ORDERED PANCAKES AT A RESTAURANT!!!",
  "selftext": "I ordered blueberry pancakes at a restaurant. I put strawberry preserves and maple syrup on top. I normally never order pancakes (let alone put on toppings), since they are a fear food. I haven\u2019t had pancakes in four years; yet today I did, and I throughly enjoyed them!!! They were delicious. The best part of the whole experience is I did not feel the need to purge them as soon as I got home; I would normally feel the urge to purge foods like pancakes after I eat them, due to the intense anxiety they cause. I\u2019m so proud of myself. I thought I would just share on this forum because I\u2019m secretive about my ED in my personal life, but I wanted to share this major accomplishment with somebody.",
