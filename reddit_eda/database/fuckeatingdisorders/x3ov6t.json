  "title": "Stupid Dr's office told me my weight",
  "selftext": "Ugh... I haven't weighed myself in over SEVEN YEARS. I knew I had gained some weight. I've been doing weight training and generally become much stronger and more athletic since the last time I weighed myself. Now I can exercise because it's fun and I like to challenge myself, it's no longer a punishment for eating. My body has changed a lot as a result though.\n\nIt's a new Dr. and I specifically told them I needed to face backwards on the scale and I didn't want to know my weight.  But the printout they gave me with follow up care had it in BOLD. What the shit?! Very careless on their part. \n\nI'm fucking angry right now. It's sending me into a tailspin and I'm freaking out over seeing the highest number I've ever seen associated with my weight. \n\nI was doing really well. Seven years without any disordered eating behaviors, and honestly feeling not great but okay about my body. I just can't believe how much I weigh. I am technically overweight by about ten pounds but what fucking ever. I'm not going to hurt myself to lose ten pounds. None of my physicians has said I need to lose weight for medical reasons.\n\nI hate that my ED was right there under the surface waiting at this chance to rear its ugly head. And I'm just flooded with the negative self talk. \n\nI know losing weight doesn't cure negative body image. I don't want to do any stupid shit to lose this 11 pounds I've gained. \n\nBut fuck this! Fuck everything about this. I'm trying to let this be a small battle I'm losing, and that tomorrow is another day and this doesn't mean I'm losing the war. \n\nSo fuck you, ED. You made me scared and cry today, but I'm so much fucking stronger than I was seven years ago. This version of me can run ten miles in the woods, at my current weight. I couldn't do that last time I was being held down by this stupid disease, even though I weighed less. So fucking come at me, ED!! This is a small slip, but it is not a relapse and I will not harm myself to get skinny. I will not. And I will absolutely not let you take running away from me. This will not become something I do to burn calories or lose weight. This will continue to be something I do to bring me joy. You can't have this, ED. \n\nI will love myself. And I will be grateful for the things my body can do, regardless of how it looks or its relationship to Earth's gravity. That's all this number is. \n\nBut also: uuuurrrrggghhhrrhdyegyxhdiksjdehzz!!!",

One thing I\u2019ve learned, and had to come to terms with tbh, is your body wants A LOT of food, but i have found my performance is off the charts when I just fucking eat properly and don\u2019t restrict. This may seem obvious to a non ED person, but always nice to hear bc I\u2019m so messed up in the head. I\u2019m sure a sports nutritionist will help too",

      "body": "Thanks so much! I've never done a multi pitch, but I do climb outside sometimes, and regularly in the gym. \nI think I've had a really hard time landing on the right spot in terms of what my body wants. If I do a 9 mile run, I do have 900 calories I need you refuel. But sometimes I make bad choices because \"I'm a runner, I will burn it off.\" I haven't been eating very healthy recently. I think if I try to see it as \"fuel my body with healthy foods\" I'll get there. Where I struggle is on those long run days. I can't bring myself to eat 900 calories of salad. But I also don't need to eat 1800 calories of pizza and ice cream. I think talking with a sports nutritionist will help me get on the right track. However, she doesn't have appointments until November. So that's cool.",

But it didn\u2019t really hit me as hard as last time and I felt sort of at peace with it but I definitely needed to lose the extra weight so I\u2019m doing it like normal people do it and it works, even though it\u2019s slow I\u2019m satisfied and I\u2019m not going to bed hungry anymore like before. I feel like I\u2019m recovered but like you said, I\u2019m situations like this at some point it does rear it\u2019s ugly head\u2026 persevere and I will too.",

I don't think I can do it in less than 20 weeks in a healthy and safe way. The priority is health and safety, not weight loss.",

I\u2019ve lost about 11 pounds doing it heathily and I feel satisfied and happy and not miserable\u2014 it\u2019s amazing how different it feels and how not obsessed I am because I\u2019m trusting the process even though it\u2019s slow it isn\u2019t taking over my life like it did before.",

I've never run at this volume consistently before and I think I'm undereating something and overeating something else. I'm going to contact a sports nutritionist. Hopefully if I set a goal of fueling properly the extra weight will come off.",

          "body": "Hey OP, I\u2019m basically in the same boat as you but maybe not quite as triggered by my weight - also ok but not great about my body. I do weight myself sometimes tho I prob shouldn\u2019t lol. I wanted to tell you that I\u2019m stoked for you!  Enjoy your life! I also find joy in exercise and do it for me and not for my ED. I hope time heals this for you and you are able to move forward. I also do endurance sport (a lot) bike tours, multi pitch climbing, etc so if you want any tips feel free to ask on here. One thing I\u2019ve learned, and had to come to terms with tbh, is your body wants A LOT of food, but i have found my performance is off the charts when I just fucking eat properly and don\u2019t restrict. This may seem obvious to a non ED person, but always nice to hear bc I\u2019m so messed up in the head. I\u2019m sure a sports nutritionist will help too",
