  "title": "Repost: On Caloric Intake Before and After Recovery",
  "selftext": "**Repost because for some reason the original was not letting me reply anymore or even edit the post.**\n\nSo I initially posted this as a comment, but I feel it\u2019d make a pretty relevant topic due to the influx of posts to this sub regarding intake. Many people are asking how much they need to eat and often eat too *little*. \n\nRecovery minimums are going to range anywhere from 2500-3500 based in age, sex and height.\n\n\u2022AFAB individuals younger than 25 between 5\u20190\u201d and 5\u20198\u201d (152.4 to 173 cm) will need a minimum 3000 kcal/day; 25+ individuals will need a minimum of 2500kcal daily. If you are taller, you\u2019ll need a bit more; shorter a bit less.\n\n\u2022For AMAB individuals under 25 between 5\u20194\u201d and 6\u20190\u201d (162.5 and 183 cm), you will need minimum 3500 kcal daily. 25+ individuals will need 3000; once again, if you fall outside of the given heights, accommodate by adding or removing an average of 200kcal.\n\nKeep in mind that these are minimums you will likely naturally fall into after recovery as well according to age, sex and height. I understand that some people claim counting calories in recovery holds them accountable to hit their minimums so I\u2019m not going to argue that, however don\u2019t rely too heavily on calorie counting as you progress into recovery. Regardless of whether you choose to go all in or take a slower, \u201cmore structured\u201d approach, the end goal should be to eat without shame, guilt or anxiety.\n\n**These guidelines apply regardless of your weight.** The intake values are confirmed averages for \u201caverage height and weight.\u201d Most people fall within this range\u2014almost everyone will reside within a BMI of 21-30, with the absolute peak being around 27.\n\nHere is an article regarding recovery minimums and why they are the same post recovery as well: https://www.edinstitute.org/orientation-basics/phases-of-recovery-part-four?rq=Phases\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nNow, we will get into the doubly labeled water method that has documented the above calorie needs in many peer reviewed studies and even influenced the FDA\u2019s initial 2350-2400 calorie guideline.\n\nDLW is the gold standard method for assessing daily metabolic rate of a living things over a period of time. So, what is the doubly labeled water method, exactly? The DLW technique measures total carbon dioxide production by observing the differential rates of elimination of a bolus dose of the stable isotope tracers, 2H (deuterium) and 18O\u2026 in simpler terms, regular sampling of heavy isotope concentrations in body water, by sampling saliva, urine, or blood,  measure elimination rates of deuterium and oxygen-18 in subject over time. \n\nThe caloric intakes reported are always higher than the \u201c2000 caloric guideline\u201d among those who don\u2019t restrict. And, interesting enough, non restricted groups were reported to have less body mass as well. Let me be clear, though restriction will always lead to*more* weight gain long term, you don\u2019t need to lose weight if you happen to be in a larger body; you aren\u2019t a failed thin person and you are fine just the way you are. \n\nHere are the studies: https://p302.zlibcdn.com/dtoken/6be0e20b2ca1347ea71e94271858156a (pg 84)\n\nhttps://academic.oup.com/jn/article/129/10/1765/4721939\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMany of you have been being up the fact that many people claim to eat much less than the intakes mentioned above, or that they \u201cloosely track\u201d their loved ones\u2019 intakes (please stop doing that, by the way, it\u2019s still disordered) and noticed they eat fat less. Many studies have concluded that individuals, *especially* women, tend to underreport because they believe their peers will judge them. Women who are more concerned about their social status, if you will, were reported to underreport their intake by **507 kcal/day**, compared to those who cared less about their \u201csocial desirability.\u201d\n\nRegarding underreporting of caloric intake: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12495831/\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12372163/\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nLastly, I can\u2019t find the original document anymore (I had posted the link to a comment in this sub last year, though it seems to have been swallowed by the void), but I still feel it\u2019s very relevant to this discussion. The FDA has been pretty open about the fact that 2000 calories isn\u2019t enough for both men and women; intially 2350 was the baseline as reported by USDA survey data and doubly labeled water fast experiments, but received a lot of fucking backlash both from the public and medical professionals, mostly rooted in fatphobia, so the reduced the guideline to appease the masses who are more concerned with weight gain over and individuals properly feeding themselves.\n\n&gt;The FDA proposed using a single standard of daily calorie intake--2,350 calories per day, based on USDA survey data. The agency requested public comments on this proposal and on alternative figures: 2,000, 2,300, and 2,400 calories per day.\n\n&gt;Despite the observable fact that 2,350 calories per day is below the average requirements for either men or women obtained from doubly labeled water experiments, most of the people who responded to the comments judged the proposed benchmark too high. Nutrition educators worried that it would encourage overconsumption, be irrelevant to women who consume fewer calories, and permit overstatement of acceptable levels of \"eat less\" nutrients such as saturated fat and sodium.\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/08/why-does-the-fda-recommend-2-000-calories-per-day/243092/#:~:text=The%20FDA%20proposed%20using%20a,and%202%2C400%20calories%20per%20day.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nRemember that you are not going to fall into some clean cut intake, and you\u2019re going to eat more on some days and less on others. These are not hard numbers you absolutely have to follow, but it\u2019s important to understand that you still need a lot of food both during recovery and afterwards.\n\nIf you have any questions, I\u2019d love to try and answer them to the best of my ability. If need be, I can always add in more sources. I am also open to having a civil discussion but we are in no way making fatphobic remarks or encouraging restriction. Thanks. \u2764\ufe0f\n\n**Edit:** I always hear the same complaint regarding Olwyn that she isn\u2019t an ED specialist and thus her advice is moot (even though she is a researcher and patient advocate with thirteen years' experience in general practice, chronic gastrointestinal illnesses, allergies and intolerances). But\u2026 neither is Tabitha Farrar, and I\u2019ve yet to see the same argument had about her despite their recovery methods being virtually identical. Both back their claims up with peer reviewed studies and confirmed scientific data\u2014ya absolutely don\u2019t have to like them or their methods, but you can\u2019t just deny the science.\n\nAnother thing worth addressing: someone pointed out that you should always try to see a professional. Olwyn has never advocated against seeing a professional and neither have I. If you have the luxury of seeing someone, do it. **But not everybody has that**; some aren\u2019t financially well off, insurance doesn\u2019t cover treatment, or experiencing weight bias has turned individuals away from professional help. Many of us are forced to recover on our own. Just something to be mindful of.\n\n**Edit 2:** I said I wasn\u2019t going to tolerate fatphobia, but I\u2019m still going to loosely address the concern. If you say you can\u2019t eat these minimums because you will gain weight, well\u2026 y\u2019all aren\u2019t gonna wanna hear this, but you need to gain weight. If you were at a higher BMI prior to your ED, you\u2019re very likely gonna be at a higher weight post recovery. Not going to argue set point with y\u2019all, but if you\u2019re constantly having to monitor what and how much you eat to maintain some arbitrary weight, you\u2019re not recovered. I said what I said. You can\u2019t continue the same behaviors that kept you sick and call it healthy this time around\u2014that\u2019s not how restriction works, your body gives fuck all about what weight you *want* to be at and it\u2019s going to act accordingly. Hense why I\u2019m always telling you guys that [intentional] weight loss is not compatible with recovery.",
