  "selftext": "I saw a post from someone who is in palliative care from eating disorder, on death's bed. Reading through their testament was heartbreaking, painful, and mortifying, especially knowing that eating disorders aren't THAT bad until they are. It seems like no one who suffers from it ever sees it coming until it's in your face. \n\nI've had people comment to me lately on my thin body, which has baffled me because I'm not that thin (so my head thinks). Body dysmorphia is weird as fuck. But it made me realize, I might be closer to that person than I can even comprehend, and I won't know it until it's too late, until my organs are dying. I want to avoid that, I want to get better. \n\nBut at the same time, in the completely opposite direction, after several months of recovery and weight restoration, I started to get scared of it. Other things happened and triggered my ED again, and now I can't imagine gaining ANY more weight at all. I have been actively trying to lose it again because I am just as afraid of recovery as I am of dying from not recovering. \n\nIt's like having one foot on the brakes, and one on the gas pedal full throttle. My wheels are spinning but I'm going nowhere. I'm torn as fuck and conflicted as hell and I don't understand it at all. My health team seems to think it's anxiety disorder, but I don't fucking know what it is. I'm stuck in this horrible, horrible spot, and I don't know how to get out. Nothing is helping... I'm just scared. Scared of gaining, scared of losing, scared of winning, scared of dying, scared of battling, scared of caving... I don't feel like myself. I feel like a ghost of whoever I used to be, and I'm not sure how to get out of it.",

I\u2019ve started restricting again because without my ED I don\u2019t even know what to do with myself every day. It feels like I lost everything even though I know that I was miserable with anorexia. I\u2019m on that slippery slope of thinking I can just lose a tiny bit of weight and then stop, but I know that it doesn\u2019t work that way. I\u2019m in a better place now than when I was fully in my ED, but I\u2019m still not doing that well. It\u2019s very frustrating that I\u2019ve been in and out of treatment for almost ten years, but I\u2019m still struggling. I worry that my life will always be a recovery and then relapse cycle.",

Recovery is 100% possible and I\u2019ve made tremendous strides. \n\nEveryone responds differently to different types of treatment, so even if a treatment center isn\u2019t effective, that does not mean there\u2019s nothing that will be. I\u2019ve met so many people who have recovered and although they still have ED thoughts sometimes, they are able to let them go and continue on with their lives. It doesn\u2019t dictate everything for them. \n\nOP, recovery is really fucking hard and there will be lapses and relapses along the way, but never give up! Like I said, I\u2019ve been battling this for almost 10 years, but I\u2019m in a much better place and am actively doing things every day in service of my recovery. I never would have thought that I could get out of the spiral, but I\u2019m crawling my way out and even though progress is slow and I\u2019m explains my struggles on here, I\u2019m still fighting the good fight.",

I\u2019m not trying to be an asshole. It is just sad and scary that you spend so much time in treatment and come away still restricting or going back to old habits. I can\u2019t see how treatment might work, if that happens. :/ It seems like that happens to everyone. Go to treatment, come out with determination to undo everything, go to treatment again, etc... It\u2019s a vicious cycle that makes me highly doubtful of any \u201ctreatment\u201d centers, or the ability to even recover from something debilitating like this. I hope I didn\u2019t offend you. I\u2019m very sorry if I did. I\u2019m in a very shit place mentally right now (as if that wasn\u2019t obvious).",
