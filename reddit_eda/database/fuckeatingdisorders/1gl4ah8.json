      "body": "Real, it doesn't do shit besides make you feel like shit. Absolutely nothing about your life will change let alone improve for depriving yourself of food, rather the opposite, your health turns to shit and you suffer, all for nothing. Nothing was ever going to come of derailing yourself, you've set a booby trap against yourself and you've walked right into it. What did you benefit of it? You're just crippled on the ground in pain and have to nurse yourself better from the injury of your own trap, against yourself. Mission accomplished? What tf was that even for? What was the purpose of setting up an elaborate sabotage plot that you'd inevitably be hurt by, and only you? Why?",

I can't believe so many people independently came up with the idea of not eating or food limitation.  \nAlso, even if it is some genetic bug of a particular person, no one around raises a red flag when they see a person restricting their food.",
