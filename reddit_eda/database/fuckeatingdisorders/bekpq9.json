  "selftext": "It's like I'm constantly stuck between these two modes of thought and I just want the recovery one to win one of these days. I'm better for 1-2 months and have like NO issues and then one thing goes wrong (even just putting off groceries a little too long, or not having the money for the bougie cereal and bread) and I just spiral again. \n\nI felt better since I broke up with my shitty now ex boyfriend in February and since like 2 days ago I've been spiralling again. I think it's partly because a lot of my safe foods are just really cheap foods and I didn't have a lot of money for groceries this week, but I think another part of it is trying to one up my ex with a \"revenge bod\". \n\nSo yeah, who else is caught in this hell cycle of thinking they're better for like 2 months and then having it ALL *destroyed*?",

      "body": "True! From my experience and what I\u2019ve learned from my therapists and dietician, relapses/slips are really normal and sometimes even helpful. My therapist told me to think of recovery as an upward incline. Without slips, you can increase in progress very quickly, but when one happens, you lose your footing and can slide all the way back down to the very beginning. But when slips happen along the way and you accept them and keep going, it\u2019s like each slip you deal with becomes a little stair, so the next time you slip (if you do), you only fall back down to the last stair rather than slide back to the very beginning of recovery. In other words, they help build your resilience and help increase your tolerance for what you can handle. I liked the metaphor and I find it holds true for me. \n\nHaving said that of course, repeated, long term slips that you can\u2019t seem to come back from could reinforce that recovery is intolerable/impossible, etc etc, and the best course of action would be to consult an ED therapist and dietician for support and advice on your specific situation. Good luck!",

I wish this was easier and the choice wasn't find strength to self-recover or have a lifelong ED that might kill you. Therapy workbooks can be found online for under 25 dollars, but I know that isn't a real solution. There is a lot of info and self-therapy techniques on the internet for free, but it shouldn't be like this, you should have access to ED therapy and the help you need.",
