      "body": "This definitely resonates. I so, so wish I never became so well-versed in the calorie content of nearly everything. Like, I want to just eat and not care. I want to not care about my body the way that I do. There are so, so, so many more important things than this. But everything I'm eat I'm bombarded. Everytime I look in the mirror it's cacophony. \n\nI dream of traveling and eating and not caring. Of eating a birthday dinner of whatever the hell I want and just enjoying it. Dietary restrictions makes it hard, my ED makes it impossible (or feels like that).",
