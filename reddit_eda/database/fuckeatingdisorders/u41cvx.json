      "body": "I was a peer counselor for a girl with anorexia when I was in college. She had been forced to abandon her own degree and craft business at the same college years earlier due to her ED. She was 26 and her reproductive system had shut down. She had lost all her friends and never been in a relationship. Her only relationships were with her family, which was strained due to the toll the ED took on everyone, her doctor, her dietician, her therapist, and me. All she did was go to the gym, go to appointments, go grocery shopping, and spend time alone in the apartment she shared with family - constantly fighting with them when they were together.\n\nI tried to be supportive but she said 'You're young and you don't realize how hard it is to pull yourself out once you've let it get this far.'\n\nShe wrote beautiful poems and journal entries about a recovery she had no idea how to actually access. She was extremely talented and caring but no one saw it.\n\nI looked her up recently and she had passed away of a heart attack before turning 30. She had spent the last years of her life in and out of treatment, seen only by medical staff and her distraught family. And that was it.\n\nI can't explain how I felt after seeing that. It's such a lonely, painful life with such a sad end.",

      "body": "Not sure how old you are.  But recall a number of years back there was the \"It Gets Better\" movement for LGBT youth?  There should be a parallel movement for people with EDs.  The \"It Gets Worse\" project.\n\nLiterally everything gets worse, the longer you go.  I was on the road to alienating my husband, children, parents, and friends with my bizarre behavior and extreme paranoia.  I wasn't emotionally present for my children, and it's only by the grace of God that I recovered while they were young enough, because if they remembered me like that in their older years I'm sure I'd never have an adult relationship with them.\n\nPhysically it gets worse too.  Teeth, bladders, constant earaches, weak bones, nerve pain, hair sucks, no sex drive.  You'll waste your youth on this stuff and if you survive you'll wake up middle aged and if you recover you'll know you spent your youth feeling like death for literally nothing, NOTHING at all.  And I wasted all that time, only to recover to the same weight that I was right before I started.  There was nothing to show for it but physical agony, a terrible personality, and damaged relationships. \n\nIf you want to have children (or do have children) you will either 1) not be able to or 2) alienate them with your horrible behavior and anger.  If you want (or have) a romantic relationship, you will eventually alienate that person too.  You will end up alone and isolated as friendships as all your thoughts and actions serve your ED.  You will be so, so selfish.\n\nEverything will feel hard, all of the time.  You will always be exhausted.\n\nNow that I recovered literally all of that is gone, all of it.  I still have a few chipped teeth but that's it.  It took a while, but I feel physically 100% better.  My relationships with my children are normal and I even had more.  My marriage is great.  I do wonder if the damage I've done to my relationship with my parents can ever be fully healed though, and I really regret that.\n\nDon't let it take another day from your life.",

No matter what you do from this point forward, you can\u2019t go back. \n\nYou are going to be hung up on an image of yourself that isn\u2019t real. To body standards and arbitrary rules that ultimately mean nothing, because no one else gives a shit. You are going to hold yourself prisoner to a cycle of thoughts that you don\u2019t have to act on at all. \n\nYou are going be too tired or weak, both mentally and physically, to have meaningful relationships, a fulfilling career, pursue your passions and hobbies, have a social life, successful marriage, house, kids, travel, etc. (if this is all something you want, that is). If you have kids, you\u2019re likely going to pass your disorder onto them, too, whether knowingly or unknowingly. You are going to be sad or angry or irritated all of the time. You are going to struggle to think. You will be a shell, a ghost, of the person you once were. When you look in the mirror, you may see someone smaller, but there will be no light in your eyes. \n\nYou are going to turn down experiences and fun activities and bonding moments all because they involve food. \n\nPlease take a moment to try to step outside of yourself and your perceptions and try to understand how that sounds.\n\nYou are going to watch the world move on without you, because this life waits for no one. You will sit on the sidelines and you will see everyone else around you achieving their dreams and being happy.\n\nAnd you\u2019re going to be counting calories.\n\nYou are going to be trapped in this cycle, a prison of your own making. Never changing. Never moving on. \n\nAnd anyone who\u2019s trying to help you will likely eventually just get tired of it \u2014 possibly resentful, bitter, or short-tempered \u2014 because they can\u2019t help you if you don\u2019t want to help yourself. When you\u2019re unable to do anything for yourself, you will be dependent on others in every way \u2014 physically, financially, mentally, emotionally. But they can\u2019t all light themselves on fire just to keep you warm. And it\u2019s so painful to watch a loved one injure and slowly kill themselves for seemingly no reason at all.\n\nNo one else cares. Why are you destroying your life for this? Why are you spending your limited time on this earth in suffering? Why do you think you deserve so little? \n\nBy not recovering, you are sending a message to yourself and to everyone around you that you don\u2019t care, you don\u2019t want to get better, and you are allowing yourself to get worse and eventually succumb to this disorder. \n\nThere comes a point where you need to value your own life and happiness over this disorder. You need to give more of a shit about yourself than this disorder. (And if you don\u2019t, you need to ask yourself why the hell that is.) You need to say, \u201cFuck this disorder\u201d because you\u2019re tired of this shit, and you are worth more than this. You are not this. This is not who you are. Life is so much more than this. You are not your disorder and your disorder is not your life.\n\nAt the end of your life you want to look back with minimal regrets. You will regret everything you didn\u2019t do, not what you did. When someone asks you what you\u2019re most proud of, your greatest accomplishments, what you did in life \u2014 I sincerely hope each one of us are able to answer with whatever means the most to us individually.  And everything we were able to accomplish because we recovered from our disorders. Not \u201cI counted calories and starved myself.\u201d \n\nNone of this is even accounting for the very real physical effects you will feel and experience throughout your ED. A lot can be healed through recovery, but some can\u2019t. \n\nDo something about all this. Stop throwing your life away.",

Sorry, just have a lot to say...\n\nTo be honest what scared me wasn\u2019t \u201cif ur not recovering ur dying\u201d it was basically \u201cif ur not recovering u have to live like this for the rest of ur life\u201d because i literally did this as a form of passive suicide and i was PISSED that it was taking so slow and turning me into a living corpse, the worst of both worlds. If I didn\u2019t start recovery\u2026\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI\u2019d have to get a pacemaker at age 21 or deal with the heart palpitations, or slowly die. Ironically what scared me about this was inherently disordered, that I'd have to take six weeks off the gym. I have to take off the gym right now regardless, but the marks of the  \u201ctitty stickers\u201d from the heart monitor stay four months later and remind me of what happened. I joked about it with my friends and worked out in a sports bra and shorts with the stupid heart monitor tucked into my bra for two weeks and dear god was i terrified of how i looked, like a skeleton with abs, but i still wasn\u2019t \u201csick enough\u201d or \u201cthin enough\u201d to recover. And yea i joked about being a \u201crobot\u201d with my friends\u2026 they didn\u2019t find it funny.\n\nI was actually studying for finals when I got the call to go to the hospital at 10 pm bc my EKG showed my heart rate was 39. I had to drive MYSELF to the hospital\u2026 and they make u pay for parking. My friends were busy going out that day because it was a Friday and didn\u2019t answer my texts, my dad did but just thought my heart was just \u201cfit.\u201d I was there all alone, but the hospital let me go bc the anxiety increased my heart rate to 43 and that meant to them that I wasn\u2019t sick enough, so I carried on for the weekend until my cardiologist appointment. What was most scary to me was the IV, that shit HURTS.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA week later, Christmas Eve, I was smoking weed with my friends and they asked me why I never drank.\n\n\u201cDo you wanna know the truth? I\u2019m afraid of the calories, i don\u2019t like to drink my calories\u201d\n\nMy friend hugged me and started crying, saying \u201cyou\u2019re so tiny, oh my god you\u2019re gonna die.\u201d\n\n\u201cno i\u2019m not, i\u2019m fine, i\u2019m recovered i promise\u201d\n\ni sincerely believe this because i stopped weighing my food and only loosely counted calories, despite losing 10 lbs from the start of \u201crecovery.\u201d\n\nI ended that night sleeping in my friends bed. I believe drugs open up what you're hiding from yourself, so of course I had raging anxiety. I measured my heart rate STANDING, 41. I was starving, but too afraid to eat in front of people. I ended up eating a small meal, and no one judged but I was sobbing. I was too scared to sleep alone in the guest bedroom because I thought I would die in my sleep, and no matter how suicidal I was I just thought \u201ci\u2019m not fucking done yet, i\u2019m only 20. i\u2019m not done\u201d\n\nFast forward to my birthday less than two months later. I was almost all in, just learning about what it means and basically binge watching Tabitha Ferrar. I was finally ready to drink alcohol but i was STILL afraid to eat in front of people. So I skipped lunch and a few snacks because I didn\u2019t wanna \"inconvenience\" others by eating. So, I had super low blood sugar and almost passed out in the middle of the street in an unfamiliar city in the dark. My friend left me while waiting for me to get back from the liquor store (for unrelated reasons she had boy troubles and school stuff and wanted to go home) and when she came back, she was just annoyed that yet again I was on the floor hyperventilating and instead walked a block ahead of me. Maybe she was embarrassed or maybe she didn\u2019t care or maybe she was just dealing with her own issues, i don\u2019t know. My arm was numb and I thought I was having a heart attack. I drove her home and it took 40 minutes but in the end my arm was still numb and my face started to become numb too. I went to get food bc I was ravenous, read that if your left arm is numb it's a sign of a stroke or heart attack, and I was too scared drive myself to the hospital again so I fell out of my drivers seat onto the pavement and started begging someone to drive me to the hospital. Of course everyone thought i was drugged because it was a Saturday night on a college campus, but all I could yell in response was \u201cno!! it\u2019s my 21st birthday and i\u2019m completely sober and i think i\u2019m dying!!\u201d Thankfully a group of girls calmed me down and I got home safe.\n\nThen the following weeks i kept having panic attacks. Yes, obviously I have anxiety, but what was the main culprit? For whatever reason, being afraid to eat in front of others or not having access to safe foods. Basically, I was hungry and had low blood sugar. For an entire month before recovery, I was having panic attacks once or twice a day, the longest one lasting twelve hours. I couldn't focus on school and I almost flunked. If I didn't have understanding teachers and the excuse of \"coming back to in person classes during a pandemic,\" I almost certainly would have. Ever since eating consistently, my panic attacks have gone down, and I haven't gotten one in a month since I started eating more often.\n\nWhat really got to me was the fact that the list of safe foods kept getting smaller and smaller and I was too afraid to eat in public. How can you when all you can eat is egg whites, protein power, quest bars, and applesauce?\n\nNow, onto bones. I've been asking for a DXA scan since I lost my period four years ago, but I was never \"underweight enough\" or \"too young\" or \"I was an athlete.\" Anyway, I have osteoporosis in my lumbar spine and osteopenia in my left hip. Okay, creaky bones, who cares right? If you have weak bones, your spine will contract and you're gonna get shorter. If you fall, you're at risk for a stress fracture in your hip and you may become immobile. The thing that got to me most was getting shorter. I'm 5 foot 6, so I'm not that tall nor am I short. But combined with the fact that EDs make you a bitch, and you're gonna get shorter?? You're gonna be a chihuahua?? That's what made me take a break from exercise, deadass. I'd rather scream and cry from the mental anguish lack of exercise gives me than become short and potentially break my spine from squatting 225.\n\nThe break from exercise actually made me realize I have basically no interests outside of food and exercise. I mean, I do, but they've become numb. I'm super interested in history, philosophy, sociology, learning languages, creative makeup, etc. but I find it hard to focus. My memory's improved since recovery and I hope to god I get my photographic memory back, but who knows? I also can't watch TV or youtube videos anymore. My youtube feed was full of food and workout videos, especially the stupid anabolic diet and volume eating and how to become \"shredded.\" Since I've cleaned that out, all I have left is Tabitha Ferrar, and that breaks my heart.\n\nI looked at my schedule I created for the semester, to be super busy all the time to not have time to eat food (the most annoying part of recovery is working around this... but I've figured it out) and how I've filled my time with pointless activities, and accidentally finished a major I despise and kept up a pointless internship and gone through ten pointless jobs just because it keeps me busy. And how I fit in 1-2 hours a day specifically for exercise, skipping club meetings or homework to make a workout. I have one year left of college, and damn do I hope to make the most of it.\n\nNow onto the other side of EDs, the outsider's perspective. One of my friends of ten has an ED, and she's become a total bitch because of it. We had a huge fight at the beginning of the school year, and while some of it wasn't about ED behavior, a lot of it was. And I can't blame her because she's obviously malnourished just like I was, but damn did it turn her into a total fucking bitch. It was over stupid shit that happened four years ago, she even broke up with her girlfriend over a granola bar once. She said my simple presence triggered her, since she knew I had an ED, so I told her to fuck off.\n\nThis is a lot and I apologize but if you read all of this, thank you. Truly, no one gives a shit about your ED, or how \"good\" you are at it, or even your workouts. When I talk about food for too long, my friends always go \"okay can we talk about something else we've been talking about this for way too long.\" There's more to life than this shit. I'm not afraid to die from this illness, I'm afraid to be a living corpse who's obsessed about food and refuses to admit she has a problem.",

      "body": "kidney stones. seriously. the worst thing that I ever had to go through was passing two kidney stones.\n\nI was chronically dehydrated for probably around two decades. I rarely drank water (because I thought it'd make me bloat), I abused alcohol, I worked out a lot at times and I was bulimic. All things that contribute to chronic dehydration. and if you think you'll notice being dehydrated... guess what, your body won't necessarily let you know before it's too late.\n\nanyways; I woke up one morning, went for a run and had, what I thought, light spotting. it was weird because I had my menstruation a week prior but it was irregular af (because of my ED) so I didn't think too much of it.\n\nfast forward to the evening... I was in excruciating pain. nothing in my life ever hurt as bad as when the kidney pain began - or so I thought. I was rushed into the hospital with an ambulance, I couldn't even walk straight. in the hospital they needed a urine sample and it was pretty much all blood by then. I thought I'd either pass out or vomit when I went to the toilet both from pain and shock.\n\nand then the real pain started. I can't even describe the pain that encompasses your body when a kidney stone or two pass into your urinary tract... I honestly screamed out loud and cried because it was unbearable. I felt like dying and actually wanted to die because the pain was too much. my body was shaking, I was so damn dizzy I thought I'd really pass out then. no matter how I tried to sit (standing was impossible at that point) the pain would only intensify.\n\nthat pain lasted for about an hour or so but it felt eternal.\n\nI recovered and the kidney stones passed by themselves (that actually didn't hurt) a week later, but the doctors wanted to operate on me (which I declined fortunately) because they weren't sure they'd make it out by themselves.\n\nI will never forget that pain, ever again. I talked to other people who had kidney stones and some women told me that they'd rather have a complicated childbirth again than a kidney stone.\n\nI really turned my life around after that and went into recovery. it was the best decision of my life. I may not look like I did back then but I feel so so so much better. my depression lessened, my skin is glowing again, my joints don't ache anymore, I have so much more energy and can think more clearly.\n\ndon't wait until it's too late. there's so many worse things (including death) that can and eventually will happen.",

I\u2019ve been trying like hell to follow my team\u2019s plan, but the ED voice is so loud.\n\nAnd not just to me. It effects my husband more than anything, and  that pisses me off. My ED makes me a callous bitch, who has the ability to say extremely hurtful things I never would say in my right mind, and my poor husband always gets the brunt of it. And he is THE most supportive and patient person on the planet. Last night there was a blow up so bad that he broke down crying, saying he felt like he\u2019s living with an abuser, because the ED is running the show. He wasn\u2019t calling me an abuser, but he said when the ED has taken over to this extent, every day feels like he\u2019s living through abuse and gaslighting. I can honestly say I never realize/intend for it to happen, but hearing him say that as he broke down in tears last night absolutely destroyed me and made me want to fight like hell to never make him feel that way again. I may be the worst wife ever, but I\u2019m determined to get back to the version of me he fell in love with years ago.

I grew up with the scale determining your worth in my grandma's eyes, someone who is supposed to love you. But she can't see past her own ED. Every time we entered the house she would weigh us and make it into a fun game, that would determine what was \"appropriate\" to eat for the closest time we ate. I've struggled with an ed since I was really young and wasn't able to get help because it was encouraged and normal. I'm now 25 and deal with constant relapses and feeling like I'm unworthy of love unless I'm constantly checking my weight and trying to be smaller. \n\nHer attitude at the root of her Ed that everything has to look perfect to outside people has literally lead her to almost kill me before (long story but trust me I'm not being dramatic). She has now been erased from my family tree and she has lost three grandkids, a son, and a daughter in law because of her actions. Eventually she may die alone.\n\nI've had relapses where I legitimately thought I was going to die, because I was shaking and cold and sweating on the floor, my body was so nauseas I was dry heaving but didn't have anything to come up. I couldn't move and my dog looked terrified. But I couldn't get off the floor, I'm glad I live in an area that I could order food for delivery because I couldn't get food myself.\n\nTldr: if you don't at least try to recover your Ed will run your entire life, and possibly fuck up multiple generations after you, lose people you think could never leave, and possibly die alone. \n\nThese are the things that help me to keep trying to recover, I hope it helps.

No matter what you do from this point forward, you can\u2019t go back. \n\nYou are going to be hung up on an image of yourself that isn\u2019t real. To body standards and arbitrary rules that ultimately mean nothing, because no one else gives a shit. You are going to hold yourself prisoner to a cycle of thoughts that you don\u2019t have to act on at all. \n\nYou are going be too tired or weak, both mentally and physically, to have meaningful relationships, a fulfilling career, pursue your passions and hobbies, have a social life, successful marriage, house, kids, travel, etc. (if this is all something you want, that is). If you have kids, you\u2019re likely going to pass your disorder onto them, too, whether knowingly or unknowingly. You are going to be sad or angry or irritated all of the time. You are going to struggle to think. You will be a shell, a ghost, of the person you once were. When you look in the mirror, you may see someone smaller, but there will be no light in your eyes. \n\nYou are going to turn down experiences and fun activities and bonding moments all because they involve food. \n\nPlease take a moment to try to step outside of yourself and your perceptions and try to understand how that sounds.\n\nYou are going to watch the world move on without you, because this life waits for no one. You will sit on the sidelines and you will see everyone else around you achieving their dreams and being happy.\n\nAnd you\u2019re going to be counting calories.\n\nYou are going to be trapped in this cycle, a prison of your own making. Never changing. Never moving on. \n\nAnd anyone who\u2019s trying to help you will likely eventually just get tired of it \u2014 possibly resentful, bitter, or short-tempered \u2014 because they can\u2019t help you if you don\u2019t want to help yourself. When you\u2019re unable to do anything for yourself, you will be dependent on others in every way \u2014 physically, financially, mentally, emotionally. But they can\u2019t all light themselves on fire just to keep you warm. And it\u2019s so painful to watch a loved one injure and slowly kill themselves for seemingly no reason at all.\n\nNo one else cares. Why are you destroying your life for this? Why are you spending your limited time on this earth in suffering? Why do you think you deserve so little? \n\nBy not recovering, you are sending a message to yourself and to everyone around you that you don\u2019t care, you don\u2019t want to get better, and you are allowing yourself to get worse and eventually succumb to this disorder. \n\nThere comes a point where you need to value your own life and happiness over this disorder. You need to give more of a shit about yourself than this disorder. (And if you don\u2019t, you need to ask yourself why the hell that is.) You need to say, \u201cFuck this disorder\u201d because you\u2019re tired of this shit, and you are worth more than this. You are not this. This is not who you are. Life is so much more than this. You are not your disorder and your disorder is not your life.\n\nAt the end of your life you want to look back with minimal regrets. You will regret everything you didn\u2019t do, not what you did. When someone asks you what you\u2019re most proud of, your greatest accomplishments, what you did in life \u2014 I sincerely hope each one of us are able to answer with whatever means the most to us individually.  And everything we were able to accomplish because we recovered from our disorders. Not \u201cI counted calories and starved myself.\u201d \n\nNone of this is even accounting for the very real physical effects you will feel and experience throughout your ED. A lot can be healed through recovery, but some can\u2019t. \n\nDo something about all this. Stop throwing your life away.",

My friends were busy going out that day because it was a Friday and didn\u2019t answer my texts, my dad did but just thought my heart was just \u201cfit.\u201d I was there all alone, but the hospital let me go bc the anxiety increased my heart rate to 43 and that meant to them that I wasn\u2019t sick enough, so I carried on for the weekend until my cardiologist appointment. What was most scary to me was the IV, that shit HURTS.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA week later, Christmas Eve, I was smoking weed with my friends and they asked me why I never drank.\n\n\u201cDo you wanna know the truth? I\u2019m afraid of the calories, i don\u2019t like to drink my calories\u201d\n\nMy friend hugged me and started crying, saying \u201cyou\u2019re so tiny, oh my god you\u2019re gonna die.\u201d\n\n\u201cno i\u2019m not, i\u2019m fine, i\u2019m recovered i promise\u201d\n\ni sincerely believe this because i stopped weighing my food and only loosely counted calories, despite losing 10 lbs from the start of \u201crecovery.\u201d\n\nI ended that night sleeping in my friends bed. I believe drugs open up what you're hiding from yourself, so of course I had raging anxiety. I measured my heart rate STANDING, 41. I was starving, but too afraid to eat in front of people. I ended up eating a small meal, and no one judged but I was sobbing. I was too scared to sleep alone in the guest bedroom because I thought I would die in my sleep, and no matter how suicidal I was I just thought \u201ci\u2019m not fucking done yet, i\u2019m only 20. i\u2019m not done\u201d\n\nFast forward to my birthday less than two months later. I was almost all in, just learning about what it means and basically binge watching Tabitha Ferrar. I was finally ready to drink alcohol but i was STILL afraid to eat in front of people. So I skipped lunch and a few snacks because I didn\u2019t wanna \"inconvenience\" others by eating. So, I had super low blood sugar and almost passed out in the middle of the street in an unfamiliar city in the dark. My friend left me while waiting for me to get back from the liquor store (for unrelated reasons she had boy troubles and school stuff and wanted to go home) and when she came back, she was just annoyed that yet again I was on the floor hyperventilating and instead walked a block ahead of me. Maybe she was embarrassed or maybe she didn\u2019t care or maybe she was just dealing with her own issues, i don\u2019t know. My arm was numb and I thought I was having a heart attack. I drove her home and it took 40 minutes but in the end my arm was still numb and my face started to become numb too. I went to get food bc I was ravenous, read that if your left arm is numb it's a sign of a stroke or heart attack, and I was too scared drive myself to the hospital again so I fell out of my drivers seat onto the pavement and started begging someone to drive me to the hospital. Of course everyone thought i was drugged because it was a Saturday night on a college campus, but all I could yell in response was \u201cno!! it\u2019s my 21st birthday and i\u2019m completely sober and i think i\u2019m dying!!\u201d Thankfully a group of girls calmed me down and I got home safe.\n\nThen the following weeks i kept having panic attacks. Yes, obviously I have anxiety, but what was the main culprit? For whatever reason, being afraid to eat in front of others or not having access to safe foods. Basically, I was hungry and had low blood sugar. For an entire month before recovery, I was having panic attacks once or twice a day, the longest one lasting twelve hours. I couldn't focus on school and I almost flunked. If I didn't have understanding teachers and the excuse of \"coming back to in person classes during a pandemic,\" I almost certainly would have. Ever since eating consistently, my panic attacks have gone down, and I haven't gotten one in a month since I started eating more often.\n\nWhat really got to me was the fact that the list of safe foods kept getting smaller and smaller and I was too afraid to eat in public. How can you when all you can eat is egg whites, protein power, quest bars, and applesauce?\n\nNow, onto bones. I've been asking for a DXA scan since I lost my period four years ago, but I was never \"underweight enough\" or \"too young\" or \"I was an athlete.\" Anyway, I have osteoporosis in my lumbar spine and osteopenia in my left hip. Okay, creaky bones, who cares right? If you have weak bones, your spine will contract and you're gonna get shorter. If you fall, you're at risk for a stress fracture in your hip and you may become immobile. The thing that got to me most was getting shorter. I'm 5 foot 6, so I'm not that tall nor am I short. But combined with the fact that EDs make you a bitch, and you're gonna get shorter?? You're gonna be a chihuahua?? That's what made me take a break from exercise, deadass. I'd rather scream and cry from the mental anguish lack of exercise gives me than become short and potentially break my spine from squatting 225.\n\nThe break from exercise actually made me realize I have basically no interests outside of food and exercise. I mean, I do, but they've become numb. I'm super interested in history, philosophy, sociology, learning languages, creative makeup, etc. but I find it hard to focus. My memory's improved since recovery and I hope to god I get my photographic memory back, but who knows? I also can't watch TV or youtube videos anymore. My youtube feed was full of food and workout videos, especially the stupid anabolic diet and volume eating and how to become \"shredded.\" Since I've cleaned that out, all I have left is Tabitha Ferrar, and that breaks my heart.\n\nI looked at my schedule I created for the semester, to be super busy all the time to not have time to eat food (the most annoying part of recovery is working around this... but I've figured it out) and how I've filled my time with pointless activities, and accidentally finished a major I despise and kept up a pointless internship and gone through ten pointless jobs just because it keeps me busy. And how I fit in 1-2 hours a day specifically for exercise, skipping club meetings or homework to make a workout. I have one year left of college, and damn do I hope to make the most of it.\n\nNow onto the other side of EDs, the outsider's perspective. One of my friends of ten has an ED, and she's become a total bitch because of it. We had a huge fight at the beginning of the school year, and while some of it wasn't about ED behavior, a lot of it was. And I can't blame her because she's obviously malnourished just like I was, but damn did it turn her into a total fucking bitch. It was over stupid shit that happened four years ago, she even broke up with her girlfriend over a granola bar once. She said my simple presence triggered her, since she knew I had an ED, so I told her to fuck off.\n\nThis is a lot and I apologize but if you read all of this, thank you. Truly, no one gives a shit about your ED, or how \"good\" you are at it, or even your workouts. When I talk about food for too long, my friends always go \"okay can we talk about something else we've been talking about this for way too long.\" There's more to life than this shit. I'm not afraid to die from this illness, I'm afraid to be a living corpse who's obsessed about food and refuses to admit she has a problem.",
