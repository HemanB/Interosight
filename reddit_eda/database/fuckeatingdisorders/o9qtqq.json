  "title": "Why do so many Instagram ED recovery pages post so many pics of their bodies?",
  "selftext": "I\u2019m just wondering. I made a new Instagram account to focus on recovery and follow more inspiring pages (like body positivity and recovery pages). I\u2019m going through trying to find pages to follow, and so many of them post a lot of pictures of them showing off their stomachs and abs and whatever else. \n\nWhich is disappointingly triggering to me I guess. It just doesn\u2019t really make sense to me why recovery pages would post so much of that. I know people can post what they want, I\u2019m just venting. \n\nIt makes me feel like I\u2019m not sick enough because I don\u2019t get to start my recovery at a low weight and gain muscle and abs the way they do. I don\u2019t know if that makes sense. I\u2019m considered \u201chealthy weight\u201d and my body is soft and squishy.",
