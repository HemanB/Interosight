  "selftext": "My beautiful 34 y.o. niece passed away unexpectedly on Fri morning. She had anorexia nervosa. She had been battling the illness since at least age 16. She was a wonderful loving mother to my 3 yo great niece doing the very best she could. She also battled severe OCD. She has had thoughts of suicide off and on through the years. Her husband took care of all three of them. She and he were both in denial. My sister first took her to a leading specialist when she was 16. We think she had a cardiac event but are waiting for all of the results. She was such a beautiful soul and I\u2019m devastated. We did everything we could to surround her with love. She was seeing a psychiatric nurse practitioner but I don\u2019t know how honest she was with her. I didn\u2019t know where else to turn so I hope this has not triggered anyone. I\u2019m so sorry\u2026.",
