I hate this. I just want to see a bagel as a bagel and not the FUCKING NUMBER 250. Or a banana as a banana and not 130.\n\nI thought that life would be sOoOoO much better after I uninstalled MFP but I guess these numbers are stuck with for life\n\nAlso, I tend to eat more when I count my cals so it's basically making me fatter anyways\n\nI just want to go back. Why did I ever listen to r/1200isplenty? I was literally losing on almost twice that amount and living my life to the fullest. By now, I would have been thinner anyways if I never counted. Goddddd",

After listening to the following interview with [Sandra Aamondt](http://everybodypodcast.libsyn.com/ep-04-neuroscientist-explains-why-diets-make-us-fat-sandra-aamodt) (and reading her book), I really couldn't believe how much time I have wasted doing this fucked up math. She very rightly points out how, especially restaurants, labels do not have any logical reason to give accurate calorie estimates and they are not required to do so. Customers are likely to want lower numbers so they give them lower numbers; it doesn't make it true.  All this helped me let go of counting, and realize that my body probably will learn how much it actually wants--my brain (doing calorie math) certainly never led me right :p",

I think it can be up to a 25% difference from the actual amount of cals it contains. Not to mention the differences in metabolic/digestive processing that was discussed in this article. Damn.\n\nEdit: https://youtu.be/hE2lna5Wxuo this video explains the discrepancies, but TW, since the actual numbers are generally higher than the labels, which can actually be triggering to some, but to me it personally helps to know that calorie counting is fake news.",

It may only last a short period of time, maybe long enough to put a meal together (based on what I would like to have, not what I \"should\" have), but then when the numbers bubble up, push them away, distract distract distract.
