  "title": "it\u2019s around one year in recovery for me, so here\u2019s a list of things i\u2019ve gained besides weight",
  "selftext": "*1.) an amazing relationship with everyone around me.*\n\ni was very isolated in my ed, and while recovering i\u2019ve regained relationships with everyone i really care about. no more hiding things, no more having to feel alone.\n\n*2.) a healthy relationship with the gym*\n\ni use the gym as a form of stress relief now. no more doing cardio that i always dread and not even feeling accomplished afterwards.\n\n*3.) loving my body for once*\n\nin my ed i never thought gaining weight would make me more confident in my body, but it really truly has. i can look in the mirror and genuinely like what i look at. obviously i have my bad days, but if i do, im not focused on my body all day. i move on from the bad thoughts because they simply do not matter.\n\n*4.) enjoying activities besides things involving food*\n\nin my ed nothing interested me if it didn\u2019t involve food. now i can paint, write, read, watch tv shows, and play games and be perfectly entertained. in my ed i never thought this was possible. i thought i was addicted to food but that\u2019s not the case.\n\n*5.) finding my style*\n\nin my ed i was constantly cold so i was always wear a sweatshirt and leggings or sweatpants. now i can wear jeans and cute shirts because im not constantly freezing.\n\nif gaining weight is holding u back from recovering, let go. gaining weight will give you your life back.",
