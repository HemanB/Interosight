  "title": "Took this week to face a couple of fear foods that I\u2019ve been craving for far too long. Ham and cheese sandwiches and a full serving of PB on a sandwich. I\u2019m kind of over them now and I thought I\u2019d never see the day.",
  "selftext": "A couple weeks ago I was salivating at the thought of these favorite sandwiches of mine. This week I said fuck it, might as well TRY to recover in quarantine. First day I ate 3 sandwiches of each lol. The. The next day, just one. Then after, open faced sandwiches because I wanted to make room for more veggies and not just eat sandwiches all day. Now, I have them prepped in the freezer but I honestly want to make a frittata. I might just eat one though with the frittata.\n\nThis is great. The feeling of my body knowing it\u2019s there and it isn\u2019t \u201cforbidden\u201d which would make me eat all or nothing. \n\nMy next fear food to accomplish? Maybe donuts. That will definitely be a hard one though.",

Like, 3 mouthfuls can be glorious and then it just becomes boring. I don't know who I am. :D It made some stuff more ok for me to really enjoy them. Once in a while a really stodgy pizza is just ace. Or a hot pudding with ice cream. But it's not like I go around constantly wanting it. It's a very weird experience!",

For myself, I have found that I have maybe 3-5 \"challenge\" days per week where I have something that is scary and I let myself have as much as I want, very much listening to my body and not the ED part of my brain.  Sometimes on the following days I feel a bit overwhelmed so yeah, I may not want to challenge myself again. However, I also often no longer crave that particular food because I allowed myself to have it and I know it is not going anywhere (pop corn kernals really go a long way).",
