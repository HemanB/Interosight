  "selftext": "I had a really strong craving for something very sweet before bed, probably because of pms. I like googling my cravings to know if it can mean something like a lack of a nutrient or something different I did throughout the day. so, I ended up in quora where someone asked \"is it natural to crave sweets just before bedtime?\". top answer? \n\n\n\"No.\n\nCraving anything isn\u2019t normal. If you are craving sweets it means you\u2019re addicted to them. Craving foods that are actually healthful, like spinach for instance, might mean your body is low in certain nutrients.\n\nKick the addiction to sweets by not eating or drinking them. That includes ALL sweets with the exception of whole fresh fruit (consumed in moderation). Get rid of the artificially sweetened stuff as well.\n\nIt takes anywhere from a few days to several weeks to lose the cravings. If you go back to eating sweets, it will come right back again.\"\n\n\n\nlike dude \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d calm down. sounding crazier than my ED now. anyway, I had 2 chocolate bars and didn't die lol",
