I feel bad for those people that still live in the diet culture world, or in any of it really.  It is super hard to deal with, but at some point you just have to realize that they haven't figured it out yet (and maybe never will), and that you are doing the work to get to a better place, no matter how hard it is and how much others in the world don't understand.  Keep your head up, it is rough out there when you are trying to grow and recover, yet everyone around you seems like they are still stuck in the same patterns.",
