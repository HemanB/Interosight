  "selftext": "Hey all. I found this this morning online and it resonated with me so I thought I\u2019d share. \n\n\n\n\u201cI remember one time when I was in an eating disorder treatment center and struggling to finish a particularly hard meal, a therapist kneeled down next to me and said, \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to prove to me that you\u2019re in pain.\u201d \n\nI could feel some emotion starting to come up and I tried to push it away. She said, \u201cTell me about the pain, Lindsay. Use you words, not your body.\u201d That\u2019s still one of the most powerful things I\u2019ve been told when in my eating disorder. There have been times, even subconsciously, that I\u2019ve used ED behaviors as a way of showing people how much pain I\u2019m in, telling them that I am not okay inside.  There are still days when I\u2019m tempted to take out my emotions on my body, to make my internal pain visible. But sometimes I think about this therapist and it makes me pause, even for a second, and remember that I don\u2019t have to destroy myself to prove my pain to anyone. It is valid and real whether I look \u201csick enough\u201d or not.\u201d",
