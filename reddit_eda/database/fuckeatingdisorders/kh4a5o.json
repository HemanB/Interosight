  "selftext": "Basically the title.\n\nI\u2019ve been in recovery from a restrictive ED for 2 months and I still want to eat the whole house down most days of the week. I try to compensate for a couple of days by restricting but then I decide I can\u2019t take it anymore and binge like no other. The cycle repeats. I really just feel like I am making excuses for myself to eat like this bc I don\u2019t have to anymore. I\u2019m well into the healthy range and I really don\u2019t want to increase my weight anymore but this keeps happening. \n\nI want control so so bad. I feel out of control and like I\u2019m seriously going from a restrictive ED to a binge ED. I can\u2019t wait for this to end bc I seriously feel even more depressed than I did when I was restricting.",

Most recovery coaches like Tabitha Farrar (check out her site & Youtube videos if possible!) address this exact thing, and that overshoot weight is totally necessary because your body is trying to heal. It\u2019s not binging, it\u2019s \u201creactive eating\u201d *because* you\u2019ve been restricting! What you\u2019re feeling (out of control) is totally valid but you need to keep eating if that\u2019s what your body is telling you what to do. If you honor your extreme hunger it will eventually go away & your weight will level out, but it will take time. What I\u2019ve read up on it may take a year or more. Don\u2019t panic! Restricting does so sooo much damage to your body & it\u2019s just trying to heal itself. Get yourself some loose comfy clothes so you don\u2019t feel uncomfortable & know that people aren\u2019t judging you on your appearance. Everyone that knows you just wants you healthy & happy - All of is here do, and *I* do \u2665\ufe0f",
