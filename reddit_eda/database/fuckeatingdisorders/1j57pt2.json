It\u2019s the little things that make me realize that this is the best decision I\u2019ve ever ever made. Just being able to laugh with my friends is something I couldn\u2019t do before, now it happens every night and is the best part of my day. I\u2019m able to actually make more friends now because I want to spend time with people and have the energy now. \n\nI can\u2019t explain in words how much of an impact recovering has made on me. I genuinely feel like I have my life back. Yes I have bad days still but I\u2019d so much rather have a few bad days and the amazing life I\u2019m currently living, then ever going back to where I was. \n\nI really missed myself. It makes me so happy to have her back. ",
