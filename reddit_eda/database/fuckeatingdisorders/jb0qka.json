I have had all sorts of eating disorders since I was about 12 (I'm 20 now)  but the one I couldnt get rid of was bulimia.

Like take it week by week, and you'll realise that eating like a normal person won't make you disgusting. Practice self love and positive affirmations and if possible find someone you can trust fully and completely and tell them how you feel when you are having a hard time. Saying it out loud helps. I really wish the best for you!! \n\nI got discharged from therapy after 4 years s few months ago and for the first time in my life I feel happy. I still have hard days but I never thought it was possible to be in the head space I'm at now. Good luck and persevere, you can do it and  life is so much better without an eating disorder!!",
