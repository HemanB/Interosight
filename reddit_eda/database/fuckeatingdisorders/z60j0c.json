  "selftext": "Before we mark my post as promoting something wrong, hear me out.\n\nA lot of times we shame ourselves for our experiences. We place the blame on ourselves for struggling. But a reminder: This is NOT your fault.\n\nEDs, disordered eating, whatever you're experiencing is A.) 100% valid and B.) Not some sort of wrongdoing on your part or some kind of punishment for anything you did.\n\nThis leads me to the title of this post. ED behaviors are often a way to cope with hard things. It's a way to feel in control of at least 1 thing in your life when everything else feels chaotic.\n\nAnd here's the part people don't wanna talk about: ***It can be an effective coping mechanism in the short-term.*** It helped you survive when you didn't have anything else to turn to.\n\n**So don't shame yourself for what you did when you were in survival mode, AND recognize that now you're going to have to take ownership for your healing.**\n\nThat doesn't mean you have to do it along. It DOES mean that you're going to have to make changes & take action. You can do this with compassion.\n\nForgive yourself. You did what you had to do to develop a sense of safety - and then, head towards healing: with patience, trust, and kindness.",
