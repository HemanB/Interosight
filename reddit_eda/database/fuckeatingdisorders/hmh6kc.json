  "selftext": "So as of this month I have been in recovery for 1.5 years and since none of my family or friends really knew about my ed or my recovery, I didn't know where to share this other than here. I still struggle with old behaviors sometimes and since I did it without any therapists or ed specialists (not to take away from anyone who did, just couldn't afford it), it took me a long time to figure out what worked to actually get better. I know this post is kind of pointless but let me just say, even if you feel like this eating disorder will be a part of you for the rest of your life, even if you don't have anyone supporting you or money or access to therapists and specialists, there is a way out. There is happiness out there in this world waiting for you.\n\nedit: grammar",
