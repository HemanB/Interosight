  "selftext": "Related to a comment on someones post I just saw - please do not tell someone who is new to recovery (literal weeks) their extreme hunger could be binge eating disorder!!!\n\nI'm sorry but if I was any less fixed and motivated for recovery a comment like that would make me give up. IF YOU HAVE RESTRICTED YOUR FOOD/PURGED/DIETED in the past YOU DO NOT HAVE BINGE EATING DISORDER.\n\nIt is your body reacting to the restriction, it is extreme hunger. I am not saying its impossible to develop binge eating disorder, but majority of people who do, have never restricted before and it is very rare for people in recovery to do so. Please take the time to question if your comment could hurt/upset/derail someones recovery. it is unfair to indulge in peoples worst fears of recovery.\n\nGive yourself time, honour your hunger, and be kind to yourself.",

Most often people who come from restrictive backgrounds and say they \"got BED\" actually have still some sort of restriction going on, either actual straight up restriction - like, fasting/purging or eating overly healthy for days after a binge - or mental restriction (feeling extreme guilt and shame around food, etc.). So in those cases I would actually say they have bulimia or ednos, but who am I to judge.\n\nI do believe that actually transitioning from restriction to BED is a very rare occurrence that honestly shouldn't be a real concern for most of us. I mean, our body DOES have self-regulating mechanisms that DO work if we listen to them, and it just makes no sense that we just keep binging endlessly if we didn't use to do it before our restrictive ED kicked in.\n\nNow, I am also one that feels I \"got BED\" after eating an extra slice of turkey and I will DEFINITELY be the rare exception who will just binge into oblivion, but that's because I'm a fucked up hypocrite. And yes, the posts you're referring to are indeed extremely scary and demotivating because they feel like a validation of all my darkest ED fears.

It\u2019s terrible to watch because no one is taking it as seriously as restrictive EDs and everyone just indulges her and she\u2019s destroyed her health and body. I don\u2019t think BED comes with restrictions of any sort. She immobilized herself and it\u2019s fine by everyone but the moment my parents figured out I was restrictive eating, lobbed in a psychiatric hospital. It\u2019s HAES but not sugar coated.",
