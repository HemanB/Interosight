I\u2019m 20 now and I was reading the back of a soup can and I decided to read the little text on the side where it said the general recommended amount was 2000 cal. a day. I thought sure but I\u2019m short and a female so like nah it must be less for me. I always thought it was 1200. I looked it up. Needless to say that\u2019s definitely not the case. And I\u2019m having this jarring realization that I think 1200 might have been one of my earliest like restriction goals from when I first started developing an ED and somehow I just lost all knowledge and awareness of the actual daily amount. I feel stupid but also just wow. EDs just completely take over the brain in so many ways..",

Nearly all diet plans for women have a max of 1200 no matter your height or weight, those calorie tracking apps try to put 1200 as your daily calories and on social media it's expected that if you are female, you should be around 1200 or eventually work yourself down to it. It's the minimum and very few people should be eating that little, but it's treated like the maximum and if you eat anything over, you're overindulging.",

The thing is, long term deficits will have your body consuming it's own resources regardless.

It won't matter that you hit your protein needs then \u2014 Even if, on paper, your eating enough for your muscle to be spared, the reality is that you're still at an energy deficit so energy's gotta come from SOMEWHERE. And then, the breakdown of muscle can put you at a deficit of certain minerals and micronutrients too. It's a process too sciency for be to explain it but that's the gist of it.\n\nThat's going to happen with other processes and other tissues too. Bottom line is: I'm, theoretically, hitting my (restriction) macros and micros consistently. My exams still shows that amenorrhea is eating away at my bones & that my defenses suck. And I was told that I'm LUCKY that's all I have, thanks apparently to my orthorexia.",
