  "title": "What can you do now being in a heavier body that you couldn\u2019t do being \u201ctHiN\u201d and with an ED?",
  "selftext": "So I know someone had made a post about who recovered into an overweight body and it has got me thinking about all the things I can do now being the heaviest I have ever been, compared to during the entire span of my ED. I know many of us are struggling with our new bodies, so let\u2019s take a moment to brag about the things we are capable of now and trash the idea that you somehow need to be in a smaller body to achieve these things. We deserve to feel proud of our bodies, damn it!\n\nHere are a few of my own:\n\n1. I am adding 15 lbs a week (5 lbs 3 times a week) to my squat, and about 5-10 lbs a week on every other lift. Back in 2019, my anorexic ass could barely handle any weight on the bar, and despite not eating \u201ccLeAn\u201d I am making steady progress for the first time in years and it feels amazing.\n\n2. Super simple but\u2026 I can go up my apartment steps without feeling like I\u2019m gonna faint!\n\n3. TMI mentions sex >!i can be intimate with my partner in ways that feel good to *me* (being underweight often made sex uncomfortable and even painful, sometimes for the both of us); I have the best sex life despite being my heaviest and my partner even says he prefers me at this weight than before\u2026 plus I outpace him lmfao.!<",
