I just got in from work and she's eating, she says \"oh I got you a burger, it's in the fridge.\" \n\nNO.\nNO NO NO NO NO!\nHow many times do I have to fucking tell you not to offer me food!? It's not that I'm restricting, on the contrary I am finally eating my meal plan and not purging, but a God damned Whopper would be my undoing. \n\nI know eventually I'll be ok and I'll be able to eat triggering foods but right now I'm crying. \n\nDay 5 purge free.",
