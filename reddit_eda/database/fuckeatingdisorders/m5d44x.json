  "title": "Why Do Shows Have to INSIST on Incredibly Underweight Actors",
  "selftext": "It\u2019s so annoying to try to watch any show on netflix without seeing people with ribs and spines popping out. It\u2019s just absolutely frustrating to see unhealthy bodies presented as beautiful or the norm. Where are the normal weight or even overweight main characters? I\u2019m in recovery, but everytime i see them flashing their bodies, the ED  instantly gets this weird jealousy and my own head instantly gets a painful memory of how awful being in a body like that was. It\u2019s just so, immensely annoying that society acts like being a skeleton is normal or even attractive. \n\n(And ps- I\u2019m not talking about naturally skinny people, there are plently of naturally skinny people I\u2019m friends with/know of, and what\u2019s on netflix is FAR from that)",
