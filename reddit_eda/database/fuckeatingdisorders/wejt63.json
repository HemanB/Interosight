  "title": "reasons to recover RIGHT NOW!",
  "selftext": "this post is mainly intended for u/Zealousideal-Top377, but i decided to make it into a post so others can see it, and cause it was so long haha. \n\nYOU WILL DEFINITELY DIE IF YOU DONT GAIN WEIGHT!!\n\ni apologize if this post is triggering, but i have to say this. you have to recover NOW or you\u2019ll die\n\nwhen i decided fuck it and started recovering, I BASICALLY HAD NO OTHER CHOICE THAN DEATH! \n\nthings i have suffered due to anorexia:\n\n1- **MY TAILBONE CAME OUT OF MY BACK!** literally. this was basically what mainly pushed me to recovery. i was going downstairs at a hospital, was so tired i missed a step and fell onto my butt down each stair. idk why i passed out after and my mom had to carry me into the car. at home, my mom noticed a huge blood stain on the back of my shorts (i thought i got my period, how funny\ud83d\ude39) and found out that my tailbone literally punctured through my skin. had that fixed but now i have a permanent scar in my asscrack\ud83d\udc4d\n\n2- **MY GRANDMA WOULD CARRY ME INTO CARS/UP STAIRS/SIDEWALKS!** i literally reached a point where i could not walk for more than 5 mins without blacking out and my 70 YEAR OLD GRANDMA would help me do basic human functions like opening/closing my car door and helping me take a step up a sidewalk. \n\n3- **SEVERE BRAIN FOG/ MEMORY LOSS!** like i genuinely do not remember a single specific memory at the time i was malnourished, just general periods of time (this improves DRASTICALLY with recovery, a new world opens up!!) i also could not keep up a conversation for more than a couple mins as i would get so exhausted. \n\n4- **I HAD NO BLADDER CONTROL!** i literally don\u2019t know why but i\u2019ve pissed myself so many times while on the way to the bathroom, cause when my bladder was full it would literally empty itself on its own. (embarrassing) \n\n5- **BRUISES FROM SITTING/SLEEPING!** i reached a point where even laying down on a mattress would cause my ribs/bones to bruise and turn blue (ouch)\n\n6- **DIGESTION PROBLEMS!** everyone says this but you either shit pure water for days (i would still refuse to eat starch to help\ud83d\udc94) or not shit for a month, no in between. \n\n7-**EXTREMELY LOW HEART RATE!** my heart rate was in the low 30s even when i would walk and my parents would check up on me while sleeping since they were scared i would die in my sleep!\n\n.\n.\nthere are MUCH MUCH more terrible things and ed can cause. i will definitely try to add more if i remember other stuff. also feel free to comment more shit your ed has caused!!",

      "body": "1. My ED messed up my hormones and my thyroids. I now have hypothyroidism.\n\n2. Also, periods. I don't wanna have kids right now and I'm not sure if I ever plan on having kids, but it would be nice to at least have the option to. But, like many others, I haven't had my period in a while (around 6-7 months now). And I know that can't be healthy.\n\n3. Hair and nails. My nails are so brittle, I break one every day. And my hair has gotten a lot thinner and I feel like it doesn't grow at all.\n\n4. It's embarrassing to admit, but I am gassy a lot of the time and I can't hold in my farts. It just happens. And it smells dreadful. It's even more embarrassing when it happens at work... I'm pretty sure everyone around me noticed, but they don't want to seem impolite by calling it out...\n\n5. Kind of similar to your brain fog argument, but I also noticed that I can't concentrate on anything. I can't watch movies anymore, because I start getting bored/losing focus after half an hour. I also can't pursue my hobbies anymore. It sucks. It has improved a bit though. Maybe my brain is still healing.",

      "body": "Warning: long comment\nedit: fixed typos\n\n1. No period. Although i don\u2019t want kids, i know i need my period. Because the anxiety of knowing you are at risk for heart issues and osteoporosis when you are not even old yet, is terrifying.\n\n2. Hurts to sit on hard surfaces. Even though i was never \u201cunderweight\u201d at my lowest weight it hurt my bones  to sit down in my shower to shave my legs :/\n\n3. Always have to pee\u2026all the damn time. Because of drinking too much water and fluids bc \u201chunger and thirst are confused \ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude44\u201d and to fill up the void of not having enough food, i constantly had some kind of beverage going down my throat and they all just went right through me. I had to pee every hour of the day \n\n4. Hair and nails don\u2019t grow. My hair has always been thick and \u201chealthy\u201d and never lost too much hair, but it wouldn\u2019t grow for the life of me. I last bleached my hair at the very beginning of 2019. Only 2 weeks ago did i finally grow it all out back to my natural hair! 3 1/2 years!! Just to grow out my hair again \ud83e\udd2f and my nails can never get past a certain length, they would always be brittle and break, they never used to be like that. I didn\u2019t even take care of them before but they could grow strong and healthy when i ate enough.\n\n5. Always cold, so not being able to look forward to winter holidays or going anywhere even somewhat cold. Christmas is my absolute favorite time of year! In fact i just love fall and winter in general. Seeing snow makes me so happy. Only did my ED convince me to stop looking forward to winter and hating it. In the summer i was already cold in my house using a blanket when it was nearly 100 F / 37 C outside, so the thought of winter every year terrified me because i constantly had my door shut with the heater on, had 2 layers on, and a blanket. I even would get so mad at my family and yell at them if they ever left my door open and let the heat out. They did not deserve that. Going to the store was so scary as well just because the store is always a bit cool, but to me it was freezing. I would avoid going to the store in the winter as much as possible \ud83d\ude1e\n\n6. No brain space for anything fun or productive. All i did besides obsessively thinking about food and my next meal, or planning it, was finding ways to pass the time between meals. Literally i did was mindlessly scroll all day after i finished my work, or i would sleep. I had no motivation or energy to do anything and i dreaded everyday, i was constantly sad and bored but couldn\u2019t bring myself to do anything. I could barely keep myself playing a game or watching a show because i was starving\u2026\n\n7. Literally did not shower. Yeah I\u2019m not going to sugar coat this, it\u2019s absolutely gross and one of the worst parts. I absolutely dreaded showering. Standing for that long and sitting to shave was horrible because it hurt my bones, and i would get dizzy from being so hungry. Watching my hair fall out\u2026also the no energy part again, i couldn\u2019t get myself up to do much of anything. I had gone like a week without washing my hair or showering more than once and i cried a lot. I always isolated myself because i was dirty, ashamed, and no energy \n\n8. Losing your friends. I didn\u2019t have much to talk about with them, i refused going out because i had no energy and food anxiety at anywhere but my home, and i was always in a bad mood and started fights for no reason. Especially when they were just asking about my well being. This just worsened my depression and ED.\n\n9. Digestive issues. Always constipation, bloating, diarrhea, or gas! Eat anything I\u2019m not used to? I will look pregnant and have such bad gas i can\u2019t be around anyone. Eating at night after conditioning myself not to for 5 years? Indigestion, acid reflux, cramps, and insomnia! My bowel movements were unpredictable af and always were painful in someway as well.  \n\n10. Intermittent fasting. All I\u2019m gonna say is \ud83d\udd95\ud83d\udd95\ud83d\udd95it helped cause and make every problem on this list 10x worse! \n\nAnd all of this\u2026All for what? To be skinny? Attractive? Hm? Someone who is filthy is not attractive or cute, no energy to do anything meaningful is not fun or cute, and someone who has nothing to talk about because all they think about is food and the next time they will eat, is not fun, cute or attractive! You know what is though? Being able to enjoy your food without having horrible pain, going out and making memories with people, and having actual hobbies and brain capacity! The ED is never worth it no matter how much it convinces you it is. Recovery is not easy at all, but it has opened my eyes to how much life is actually worth living again!",

Probably my body in panic mode. I am so much more chill just 6 weeks into recovery.\n\nSuch a tiny world. Just narrowing my life more and more to accommodate my eating habits and not having energy to do much more than manage my eating and workouts. No joy",

      "body": "1. Not getting headaches constantly\n\n2. Trips and hang outs with friends and family no longer have to be ruled by planning and counting and anxiety over what I\u2019ll eat and eating it at the right time and trying to inconspicuously exercise \u201cenough\u201d. I can just sit back and enjoy things (well, I\u2019m still working on it, but that\u2019s the end goal)\n\n3. The BLOATING AND STOMACH ISSUES. This is a big one (for me). My IBS has been so much better the last few months, and the bloating from storing food and from not digesting things properly goes waaaay down\n\n4. Not getting dizzy and lightheaded every time I stand up. Still working on this one for me, but I hate when my vision goes dark when I first get up in the morning.\n\n5. The mood swings and irritability. I was so cranky when I was deep in it, and aside from how it affected me socially, it also just SUCKS to feel so down and/or agitated ALL. The. Time. My mood has improved a lot recently (but I also started taking mood stabilizers a few weeks ago). I still get hangry, but at least it\u2019s not CONSTANTLY.\n\n6. I actually have energy and motivation to do things now. I can ENJOY things again and it\u2019s great. It makes every in life feel so much more worth it.\n\n7. I know this one gets mentioned a lot, but seriously the concentration/brain fog. I hated feeling so useless and dumb in the middle of conversations, trailing off and not being able to think of anything to say to carry on the conversation, which is already bad enough with my ADHD. I also don\u2019t have to worry about how it\u2019s going to impact my schooling and grades anymore because I can actually compute and retain things now\n\nEdit: 8. And being uncomfortable sitting or laying anywhere!!",

I even would get so mad at my family and yell at them if they ever left my door open and let the heat out. They did not deserve that. Going to the store was so scary as well just because the store is always a bit cool, but to me it was freezing. I would avoid going to the store in the winter as much as possible \ud83d\ude1e\n\n6. No brain space for anything fun or productive. All i did besides obsessively thinking about food and my next meal, or planning it, was finding ways to pass the time between meals. Literally i did was mindlessly scroll all day after i finished my work, or i would sleep. I had no motivation or energy to do anything and i dreaded everyday, i was constantly sad and bored but couldn\u2019t bring myself to do anything. I could barely keep myself playing a game or watching a show because i was starving\u2026\n\n7. Literally did not shower. Yeah I\u2019m not going to sugar coat this, it\u2019s absolutely gross and one of the worst parts. I absolutely dreaded showering. Standing for that long and sitting to shave was horrible because it hurt my bones, and i would get dizzy from being so hungry. Watching my hair fall out\u2026also the no energy part again, i couldn\u2019t get myself up to do much of anything. I had gone like a week without washing my hair or showering more than once and i cried a lot. I always isolated myself because i was dirty, ashamed, and no energy \n\n8. Losing your friends. I didn\u2019t have much to talk about with them, i refused going out because i had no energy and food anxiety at anywhere but my home, and i was always in a bad mood and started fights for no reason.

Eat anything I\u2019m not used to? I will look pregnant and have such bad gas i can\u2019t be around anyone. Eating at night after conditioning myself not to for 5 years? Indigestion, acid reflux, cramps, and insomnia! My bowel movements were unpredictable af and always were painful in someway as well.  \n\n10. Intermittent fasting. All I\u2019m gonna say is \ud83d\udd95\ud83d\udd95\ud83d\udd95it helped cause and make every problem on this list 10x worse! \n\nAnd all of this\u2026All for what? To be skinny? Attractive? Hm? Someone who is filthy is not attractive or cute, no energy to do anything meaningful is not fun or cute, and someone who has nothing to talk about because all they think about is food and the next time they will eat, is not fun, cute or attractive! You know what is though? Being able to enjoy your food without having horrible pain, going out and making memories with people, and having actual hobbies and brain capacity! The ED is never worth it no matter how much it convinces you it is. Recovery is not easy at all, but it has opened my eyes to how much life is actually worth living again!",

      "body": "Honestly everyone is different but for me after the health scare of losing my period, at the beginning of this year i started trying to recover by just eating more overall. i was still definitely super disordered though and only ate around \u201cmaintenance\u201d or a bit over (which was not really my maintenance, TDEE calculators suck and cause useless anxiety) and i was still avoiding a lot of foods. But this summer is whenever i really got serious about my recovery. I stopped eating most low cal safe foods and trying to incorporate a lot of fear foods, sugar, high calorie foods and more fat into my diet. I have been going all in for about a month and a half and honestly i think it was the best option. There are times so far when i have not eaten enough in the day and so i ate so much at night i was extremely sick and had bad insomnia. There have been days where i literally ate all day every hour. And there have been days where I\u2019m not paying much attention and just eat whatever, whenever, however much and feel fine. The best way to go i think is to eat consistently throughout the day though. Eat whatever you want whenever you want no matter how much. At first this is hard bc you will just not want to stop eating at all, and I\u2019m still going through this bc i have a really bad scarcity mindset still, but your body doesn\u2019t think it will get food again so it just wants you to eat while you can. Just give in, it gets better. Now i have been working on eating consistently all day long rather than kind of restricting during the day, bc trust me although i still eat A LOT every night, eating thousands of cals like i have been doing feels so much better when done all day long and not all at once before bed if it can be helped. Bc i would eat so so much at night i would not be able to sleep and my heart rate would go up, i would not be able to move etc. you will be really bloated either way and these things will still happen, also i am always gassy. So this is just stuff to expect, but it\u2019s all so much better and manageable if you just eat consistently throughout the whole day. So far it has been getting a lot better for me. Once i start eating, it\u2019s still hard to stop bc I\u2019m super hungry and like i said, bad scarcity mindset, but it\u2019s so much better now. Since i have been showing my body that food is available anytime, even though i still eat so much now i don\u2019t have to gorge myself on food until i am sick and vomit (not on purpose though) as often anymore. and also don\u2019t try to find a reason to eat or be hungry. You don\u2019t need a reason. If you are thinking about food and want something just eat, it doesn\u2019t matter if you have physical hunger, or what time of day it is. Eat whatever you want whenever regardless of the time of day or the reason you are eating. There is no such thing as an invalid reason to eat especially in recovery. Also i think the only \u201cright\u201d amount of food to eat is eating everything you want when you want it. It\u2019s not easy and i won\u2019t say it is. Each day is a struggle for me and i really struggle with disordered thoughts still, but i fight them full force as much as i can. i also don\u2019t have anyone to talk about this with in real life, but if you do it will help a lot. But it really does keep getting better. You will slowly be less scared, less bloated and sick, more energy and happiness etc. i am so happy i can eat now and that i chose recovery despite the hardships. I know this is kind of rambling, and wayyyy too long (sorry) but i wish you luck and hope maybe this helps you in some way.",

      "body": "A lot of the replies have good answers that don't just apply to severely underweight people but... even being mildly underweight is a concern. Your ED can kill you at any weight. There have been obese and fat people who have died from starvation, as well as purging. \n\nI was only ever \"mildly underweight\" before I went into recovery, and only for a short period, not even when I did recover, but I still have long term consequences of my ED. \n\nI chose recovery because my heart was struggling, it would skip beats or start beating really fast and my chest would hurt and i'd get faint, struggle to stand. i also struggled with consistent fainting spells for the entirety of my ED. \n\nI also chose recovery because yeah, it hurt to sit, and I was miserable and everything ached and my head always hurt and man, was I irritable. The hanger really gets to you. But so does the exhaustion. All I wanted to do was sleep, and I was not fun to be around. My friends and I became distanced because I was too starved to do anything. I lost all my hobbies and my studies weren't doing well either. It was a constant cycle of waking up, counting calories, starving, feeling miserable, overworking myself and then going to bed.\n\nThis one's kind of gross but I also had HORRIBLE gum disease. I would brush and brush and brush but because I didn't have the energy to spare, my body couldn't fight off the infection in my mouth. Which was kind of embarrassing, especially when you get lectured at the dentist about it. I just had an appointment with my dentist for the first time since I started all-in recovery, and \"somehow\" the severe inflammation and gum disease of SIX YEARS is almost completely gone. \n\nOutside of the gums, I was constantly sick because I couldn't fight much off. I literally had a consistent illness for MONTHS because of stress, exhaustion and starvation. Your body can't manage or clean itself out if it doesn't have the energy. That includes your memory. My memory is also ass because of ADHD and CPTSD, but memory processing is one of the first things to go. Even if you have a good memory now, a lot of people end up losing those memories in recovery because they simply aren't strong enough to retain.\n\nBut the most important reason I chose recovery is because I actually developed reactive hypoglycemia. Everyone associates diabetes and blood sugar issues with eating too much or obesity, but... anorexia can make that happen too. I'm lucky that I've only got reactive hypoglycemia, and not pre-diabetes or diabetes itself. But I still have to manage my blood sugar and prick my finger and be concious about my food choices and eat almost every 2-4 hours so my blood sugar doesn't drop too low and I don't die. I have to make sure I eat the right things for dinner so I don't drop in the middle of the night, and my god, I have food in my car and I eat every time before I drive because if my blood sugar crashes while I'm behind the wheel, I would probably end up in a different type of crash.\n\nIt's much better now in recovery, since I'm actually eating, but I do have to be concious about it still, and I'm sure if I wasn't, I would be a lot worse. I've been dealing with this for about two years now. I was off my typical \"diet\" for a few days while on vacation laat month, and my blood sugar was CONSTANTLY dropping. \n\nI hope this isn't too preachy, your original point is true, I feel like a lot of ed symptoms are usually focused on the aspect of being underweight, but malnutrition really fucks you up. Its cheesy but calories are energy, and without energy, your body can't function the way it's supposed to, and has to \"adapt\" to a new way of surviving, which drains you, and eventually will kill you if you don't make the switch to recovery. \n\nIt's definitely easier said than done, I knew I was struggling and likely going to die for a long time before I chose to recover, but I hope you can get there. I hate to throw in another cheesy line, but the cheesy bullcrap is often true so... some of the best decisions in your life will often be the hardest ones to make - this is one of them.",

I don't wanna have kids right now and I'm not sure if I ever plan on having kids, but it would be nice to at least have the option to. But, like many others, I haven't had my period in a while (around 6-7 months now). And I know that can't be healthy.\n\n3. Hair and nails. My nails are so brittle, I break one every day. And my hair has gotten a lot thinner and I feel like it doesn't grow at all.\n\n4. It's embarrassing to admit, but I am gassy a lot of the time and I can't hold in my farts. It just happens. And it smells dreadful. It's even more embarrassing when it happens at work... I'm pretty sure everyone around me noticed, but they don't want to seem impolite by calling it out...\n\n5. Kind of similar to your brain fog argument, but I also noticed that I can't concentrate on anything. I can't watch movies anymore, because I start getting bored/losing focus after half an hour. I also can't pursue my hobbies anymore. It sucks. It has improved a bit though. Maybe my brain is still healing.",

I felt unhealthy if i didn\u2019t do it \ud83d\ude44 but it literally caused a lot of these problems and just multiplied them and made them much worse. Like my digestive and bowel issues, low energy, being cold etc. Idc what anyone says, doctor or not, i think humans are not meant to fast long term. Just enjoy your life and eat food. Life is too short to go without it. Humans are supposed to eat or we wouldn\u2019t want to, our bodies are not stupid like we have been made to believe",

          "body": "Warning: long comment\nedit: fixed typos\n\n1. No period. Although i don\u2019t want kids, i know i need my period. Because the anxiety of knowing you are at risk for heart issues and osteoporosis when you are not even old yet, is terrifying.\n\n2. Hurts to sit on hard surfaces. Even though i was never \u201cunderweight\u201d at my lowest weight it hurt my bones  to sit down in my shower to shave my legs :/\n\n3. Always have to pee\u2026all the damn time. Because of drinking too much water and fluids bc \u201chunger and thirst are confused \ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude44\u201d and to fill up the void of not having enough food, i constantly had some kind of beverage going down my throat and they all just went right through me. I had to pee every hour of the day \n\n4. Hair and nails don\u2019t grow. My hair has always been thick and \u201chealthy\u201d and never lost too much hair, but it wouldn\u2019t grow for the life of me. I last bleached my hair at the very beginning of 2019. Only 2 weeks ago did i finally grow it all out back to my natural hair! 3 1/2 years!! Just to grow out my hair again \ud83e\udd2f and my nails can never get past a certain length, they would always be brittle and break, they never used to be like that. I didn\u2019t even take care of them before but they could grow strong and healthy when i ate enough.\n\n5. Always cold, so not being able to look forward to winter holidays or going anywhere even somewhat cold. Christmas is my absolute favorite time of year! In fact i just love fall and winter in general. Seeing snow makes me so happy. Only did my ED convince me to stop looking forward to winter and hating it. In the summer i was already cold in my house using a blanket when it was nearly 100 F / 37 C outside, so the thought of winter every year terrified me because i constantly had my door shut with the heater on, had 2 layers on, and a blanket. I even would get so mad at my family and yell at them if they ever left my door open and let the heat out. They did not deserve that. Going to the store was so scary as well just because the store is always a bit cool, but to me it was freezing. I would avoid going to the store in the winter as much as possible \ud83d\ude1e\n\n6. No brain space for anything fun or productive. All i did besides obsessively thinking about food and my next meal, or planning it, was finding ways to pass the time between meals. Literally i did was mindlessly scroll all day after i finished my work, or i would sleep. I had no motivation or energy to do anything and i dreaded everyday, i was constantly sad and bored but couldn\u2019t bring myself to do anything. I could barely keep myself playing a game or watching a show because i was starving\u2026\n\n7. Literally did not shower. Yeah I\u2019m not going to sugar coat this, it\u2019s absolutely gross and one of the worst parts. I absolutely dreaded showering. Standing for that long and sitting to shave was horrible because it hurt my bones, and i would get dizzy from being so hungry. Watching my hair fall out\u2026also the no energy part again, i couldn\u2019t get myself up to do much of anything. I had gone like a week without washing my hair or showering more than once and i cried a lot. I always isolated myself because i was dirty, ashamed, and no energy \n\n8. Losing your friends. I didn\u2019t have much to talk about with them, i refused going out because i had no energy and food anxiety at anywhere but my home, and i was always in a bad mood and started fights for no reason. Especially when they were just asking about my well being. This just worsened my depression and ED.\n\n9. Digestive issues. Always constipation, bloating, diarrhea, or gas! Eat anything I\u2019m not used to? I will look pregnant and have such bad gas i can\u2019t be around anyone. Eating at night after conditioning myself not to for 5 years? Indigestion, acid reflux, cramps, and insomnia! My bowel movements were unpredictable af and always were painful in someway as well.  \n\n10. Intermittent fasting. All I\u2019m gonna say is \ud83d\udd95\ud83d\udd95\ud83d\udd95it helped cause and make every problem on this list 10x worse! \n\nAnd all of this\u2026All for what? To be skinny? Attractive? Hm? Someone who is filthy is not attractive or cute, no energy to do anything meaningful is not fun or cute, and someone who has nothing to talk about because all they think about is food and the next time they will eat, is not fun, cute or attractive! You know what is though? Being able to enjoy your food without having horrible pain, going out and making memories with people, and having actual hobbies and brain capacity! The ED is never worth it no matter how much it convinces you it is. Recovery is not easy at all, but it has opened my eyes to how much life is actually worth living again!",
