  "selftext": "today's christmas eve and i'm feeling a very strong urge to >!restrict and do compulsive exercise!<, so i'm writing this up to remind myself why i chose to recover.\n\n\u2022 my skin, hair, and nails have never been healthier (thanks to dietary fat)\n\n\u2022 i can think much more clearly since my brain has the calories to use\n\n\u2022 i can sleep without waking up in the middle of the night feeling sick with hunger\n\n\u2022 i don't feel like i have to turn down events because of the food being served there\n\n\u2022 i can dance and run and jump whenever i want without feeling lightheaded\n\n\u2022 i have more room in my mind and in my life for things unrelated to food and exercise and numbers\n\n\u2022 i'm not constantly constipated and/or bloated from too much water and fiber (tmi, apologies)\n\n\u2022 my family and friends aren't constantly worried about me\n\ni will add to this list if i think of anything else. merry christmas/ happy holidays everyone i love you all and we are not restricting today or tomorrow.",

Do not invite your eating disorder to Christmas!\nI will add a few of my own! \n- I can have Christmas cookies without guilt or needing to compensate\n- I can wear what I want to Christmas instead of feeling the need to show off my body/cover-up \n- I am not severely depressed or anxious, but rather can enjoy the holiday season authentically\n- I am able to do crafts and be creative with making gifts this year because my brain has the ability to think creatively instead of thinking about calories\n\nMerry Christmas OP!!
