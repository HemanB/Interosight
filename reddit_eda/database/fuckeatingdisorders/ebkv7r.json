  "selftext": "I told myself I\u2019d never let my mothers eating disorder influence me. I was so wrong. All the years I spent sitting in bed filled with fear and disgust at the sound of my mom\u2019s nightly ritual I told myself, \u201cI\u2019ll never fucking do anything like that. How can she fucking shamelessly do this every night knowing that I can hear her?\u201d. I was so fucking wrong. I told myself that no matter how much I hated my body I\u2019d never take dangerous measures to lose weight... I was so so wrong. Unlike my mother, it\u2019s not bullemia that I\u2019m suffering from, it\u2019s anorexia. Instead of hoarding food to save for a binge like she does, I hoard capacity for my body to gain weight that it probably never will (\u201cWell, I should be 120, but I\u2019m going to keep it at 110 just to save a little room in case I decide to eat a little more one day). As time goes on people have gone from congratulating me for my weight loss to making comments like, \u201cjesus christ, are you sharpening your elbows every night?\u201d or, \u201c... are you okay? It seems like you\u2019re getting sick.\u201d. The other night when I was planning to lose a little more weight for what I call \u201cweight gain insurance\u201d all of this finally hit me. I started thinking about my life and all of the ways my mother influenced it. We never had food around the house. You always had to buy your own food and tons of it. Don\u2019t forget to eat it quickly before the other bingers in the house get to it. I had to get used to food being a very aggressive and sensitive topic in the house. Every time I\u2019d go to the fridge, no matter where my mother was in the house, she\u2019d suddenly appear right behind me (the sound of the fridge opening would always trigger the same response from her, \u201cWhat are you eating? What are you eating?\u201d), and peer over my shoulder in disappointment as I got my meal and ate it (she still does this a lot). Recently, when I finally told her I fucking hate when she does that she just said, \u201cBut... you\u2019re finally getting so thin, I don\u2019t want you to mess this up.\u201d. That\u2019s another thing, she constantly comments on the status of my weight and others. Every single day she rants and raves about how thin and beautiful I am now, a stark contrast to when she used to call me on the phone when I was gaining weight and say, \u201cI can\u2019t have a fat kid, (my name), I just CANT!!!!\u201d. All of these things, along with \u201csticky bathroom\u201d (I\u2019m sure most of you know what I\u2019m talking about), are things that I\u2019ve had to grow up with all of my life and is now drastically affecting me in my early adulthood. I\u2019m losing weight very rapidly, if clothes don\u2019t fit over my hip bones I want to kill myself, I\u2019ve been working on training myself to feel rewarded by the sensation of my stomach growling and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be able to stop. My mom has told me straight up that she is never going to stop throwing up and there\u2019s nothing I can say that will stop her. She\u2019s grown completely numb to the look on my face when I go into the bathroom and can smell and see that it\u2019s been freshly vomited in and she still has the AUDACITY to lie to me and say she didn\u2019t. \n\nThe main thing I want to say? Please, if you have  children, try to control your eating disorder at least for their sake. Please don\u2019t project your body dysmorphia onto them. I\u2019m starting to resent my mother for what she\u2019s helped shape me to become and every time she\u2019s called me \u201cskinny girl\u201d I just want to scream and cry.",

No child deserves to grow up in such a toxic environment. And no child deserves to grow up hating any part of themselves :(. I can't imagine the pain that was passed onto you.\n\nI don't talk about it much, but my mom's ED was more hidden- but I think that made it worse for me, I didn't understand the severity of it and thought our eating patterns were normal. She would hide food in her room (\"goodies\") and would binge while skipping proper meals and sleep for days at a time. I would rarely see her up during the day, and her cooking anything was a rare sight. I still struggle with a lot of habits she helped create. I didn't even know I had an ED until a year after she died, and tbh, her death has made my recovery flourish, as fucked up as it sounds.",

You can\u2019t fix your mother (not right now), and she doesn\u2019t seem to want any sort of help unfortunately. Focus on yourself and YOUR story, your life; start thinking about how sustainable this type of life is (I used to think I could\u2019ve kept going on forever after 10 years, but I\u2019m starting to get so tired... and pregnancy opened my eyes even more) and most importantly, about the possibility of becoming more and more like her.
