  "title": "Anyone else uncomfortable with pictures?",
  "selftext": "Hey guys! I've been in recovery for 2ish years, and would say at this point I'm doing fairly well. Definitely still have rough periods, but for the most part I'm much more comfortable in my body that I ever have been. But yesterday, my mom took a picture of me when I wasn't expecting it, then showed it to me later because she thought it was super cute. I literally almost started crying because I hated the way I looked so much.\n\nIt's so frustrating to me because I feel like I've come a long way in accepting my body no matter what it looks like, but then things like that happen and it feels like I'm back to square one. It's really affected me today, too, and I think I was subconsciously restricting because of it. Does anyone else struggle with seeing themselves in candid (or even non-candid) pictures?? Any suggestions for dealing with the emotions that follow?",
