  "selftext": "like a lot of us, i used to purposely find triggering content like 'anorexia recovery' videos where they document through pictures their weight loss. thankfully I dont watch them anymore but I still have them recommended to me and nothing angers me more than youtubers who put the underweight images in the THUMBNAIL so I have no choice but to see them and be triggered even if I choose NOT to watch the video.\n\npurposely choosing to consume triggering content is a choice and once a viewer clicks onto a video they know will trigger them, it stops being the creators responsibility to protect the viewer. HOWEVER I did not choose to have that video recommended to me and I am actively avoiding such content so in my view, it is definitely the creators responsibility to make the thumbnail non-triggering.\n\nits the little things eh...",

A way of almost trying to brace themselves against people they assume will be aggressively invalidating their disorder and trying to \"prove\" in advance that they were emaciated enough to fit the idealized version of an ED.
