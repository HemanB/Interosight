  "selftext": "I\u2019ve noticed this seems to be a recurring theme in this sub lately so here\u2019s your friendly reminder that you don\u2019t have to conventionally exercise if you don\u2019t want to\u2014like it\u2019s literally not a requirement. You don\u2019t just have to lift weights or so cardio or walk >!10,000!< steps every day, you don\u2019t have to burn >!1,000!< calories daily, or maintain a \u201ctoned\u201d or thin physique. You can work out for 20 minutes or 5 minutes. You can take rest days, or rest weeks or even months or years if you don\u2019t enjoy the \u201cacceptable\u201d forms of exercising. If it\u2019s detrimental to your mental health, it can\u2019t be all that healthy, can it? If you walk a lot (or even a little) at work, guess what? That\u2019s exercise. Running errands or cleaning your house? Exercise. Movement and exercise should feel easy to want and perform. It should feel good, not like a chore, an obligation.\n\nYou also don\u2019t have to restrict to be healthy. And you don\u2019t have to lose weight to be healthy either, nor to be worthy of love, respect and self confidence. You are more than a body and fuck anyone who tells you otherwise.\n\nThanks for coming to my TED Talk.",

An ED is just totally ravaging- mentally, physically, internally (I can't even eat a salad anymore without MAJOR bloating for at least a day after). What do you miss the most about not having an ED?",

You don't HAVE to exercise if it's hurting your recovery. The exercise you get in day to day life is often enough. What I feel I've learned is that we'll always tend toward a healthy life.

I wouldn't be afraid of running in certain places or doing certain kinds of exercise or eating certain foods. I was on a softball team for some time before my ED and while I was \"obese\" by stupid BMI standards, I was strong as fuck because I was eating a good amount and i had the brain space to throw myself into my studies/sport entirely. I could throw 20kg around with ease! as soon as my ED anxiety became a thing, I quit team sports, my anxiety never really left since and has morphed into different kinds of anxiety. what I like about recovery now despite the immense anxiety is being able to enjoy food with my friends again, and even being able to enjoy food on a purely sensory level alone.",
