How is it that 'food freedom' bloggers are all over my feed with their 'lunch ideas' that are literally 300-350 calories for a 'meal'??? How is everyone scared of bagels and sandwiches (as in 2 slices of bread) when they are the most socially acceptable restriction meal? Does anyone actually stay full on that????? How am I supposed to believe that anyone ever eats more than 1500 calories a day if they eat lunches and dinners under 400 fucking calories?? I want to d*e. I know I could eat 3 meals, snacks and have 1 of those meals be 800+ calories and still eat too little... but looking at everyone else I'm doubting that??? Do I really need more than 1400 or so??? On the go wraps and salads and sandwiches etc are all super fucking low calorie...",

I know when I used to count calories, I'd eat like 3 times a day plus dessert (always a tiny bowl of ice cream) and it was like 800-1000 calories. I had it down to a science where I could measure out the cereal and milk, or 2 white bread slices and the thinnest ham slices, and it would stay under like 250 cals. And of course I was hungry again like 2-3 hours later cuz that is not a lot of food! I ignore all those bloggers. They usually give bad advice based on the latest fad diet.",

It\u2019s also just pretty damn harmful to individuals *already* struggling to eat enough or going through extreme hunger and eating more than double, sometimes triple, that in a single day and reading \u201cthis is plenty,\u201d especially when they will get the same damn comments from diet subs that contribute to their disorder. \n\nI\u2019m sorry, but from the hours or research that I have done\u2014whether or not you think it\u2019s accurate\u2014that intake is *not* enough. It\u2019s honestly really not fair to suggest that I am only using \u201csmall\u201d studies to make a point, like fuck my knowledge, right? The Doubly labeled water method is known for its extreme accuracy and there are more than just a few small studies on it. It is something the FDA based it\u2019s initial 2350 calorie guideline from. It has been proven to be more accurate than other methods of determining nutritional and energy needs.\n\nI also want to point out that most ED sources are drenched in outdated, fatphobic rhetoric and of the mindset of \u201crecover, but not too much\u201d that is harmful to the majority of ED sufferers who either recovery into larger bodies or were never underweight to begin with. They also lack knowledge on overshoot, extreme hunger, fat distribution, etc. so no, I would not like to read anymore clinical guideline textbooks that repeat more of the above aforementioned issues. There is a reason relapse rates are significantly high among ED sufferers, and a large part of that is because treatment often involves maintaining on a caloric amount that simply isn\u2019t enough to sustain a human body, let alone one in recovery that needs a substantial amount of food.",
