  "selftext": "I don\u2019t want to trigger anyone who does keto if it actually works out for you and keeps you happy and healthy. So if you\u2019re one of those people, pls don\u2019t read further because I\u2019m about to vent about how much I personally dislike it. \n\nHOLY CRAP FUCK KETO. I\u2019m sorry but it\u2019s the stupidest fucking diet trend I\u2019ve seen in the past few years and I will actually scream if I see one more keto influencer pretend like eating cream cheese and iceberg lettuce every day is satisfying. I hate it so much I can\u2019t even put it into words. I hate diets that restrict massive food groups like that. I don\u2019t understand how it\u2019s healthy. It\u2019s so triggering to me when people suggest I do keto or IF or one of the other many poopy diet trends out there. The quality of my day goes down slightly whenever I\u2019m grocery shopping and see some keto-branded food item. Am I the only one who hates the keto fad this much? Maybe I just have some personal issues to work out because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s normal to get this worked up over keto \ud83d\ude02 Goddamn. Like yes honey let me just pack my lunch of plain ground turkey wrapped in lettuce and cream cheese stuffed peppers. Like holy fuck that sounds like hell. I would rather eat box macaroni every day for the rest of my life than cut out carbs completely. \n\nI think what bothers me the most is how people will just automatically recommend keto to anyone and everyone as a weight loss method. Like no, get out of my face with that. I\u2019d rather enjoy life thank you. \n\n I feel like in a few years we\u2019re going to start hearing of health complications people are getting from this stupid fad considering it was originally for epileptic people, not your aunt trying to shed a few pounds after hearing about keto on Dr. Oz.",

I used to have a coworker who would point at my lunch and analyze when something I had wasn\u2019t keto despite me telling her I wasn\u2019t doing it alongside her lol it\u2019s also funny how lots of the folks who do diets like that are also claiming \u201corganic\u201d and \u201chealth and wellness culture\u201d when in reality to get pre-made keto snacks and keto foods such as low carb breads or sugar free ice creams you have to process the shit out of the food to get it up to par. which i don\u2019t think is an issue i just find it interesting the overlap between \u201cketo is healthier\u201d and the folks who preach \u201corganic whole food living\u201d \u2014 Idk. i also can\u2019t stand it at all just because it\u2019s sold as this one solution cures all. It\u2019s so restrictive it\u2019s one of many diets that if not done carefully is absolutely a slippery slope into a full blown ED in my opinion",

I'm legitimately concerned for his health but I don't want to overstep.\n\nI also agree with the above poster. Like according to keto you have to only have a tiny bit of fruits and vegetables?

Idk it feels like anyone is on keto and it's so weird because to me it's obvious it's a fad diet. Like it's clearly just the new fashion and people would slowly move away from it and start demonize some other food, at this point probably protein.\n\nAlso the fact that keto as an actual history as a medical protocol for certain problems probably made these people worse because now they all believe themselves expert on literally any subject: nutrition, medicine, history, anthropology, you name it and they know the answer because they've read the title of some paper online and they literally believe keto cures everything. \n\nA pet peeve of mine is when they always talk about \"our ancestors\" girl wtf are you talking about you don't even know what your grandmother was eating and you want to talk about cavemen. These people know nothing about nutrition and evolution and they want you to believe they are expert. I'm not saying that today we are the epitome of health (though we certainly live better than cavemen) but if you want to be less unhealthy you only have to look at your great grandparents, you don't have to bother those poor cave people.",

Obviously people see results in diets that restrict food groups, but I don\u2019t think that a lot of people understand that\u2019s the reason they\u2019re losing weight. Carbs in particular can cause water weight- but that\u2019s most of what I suspect is lost.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFunny thing about keto products is that I\u2019ve found some that are astonishingly high in carbs, while say, the same item from the same brand-just not the keto-version, is lower in carbs and higher in protein. Isn\u2019t keto supposed to be avoid carbs and prioritize protein? I unfortunately burst out laughing in the store when I saw that the first time. That said, there are some \u201cketo\u201d products that I really love. I\u2019m also grateful for all the almond flour foods now because I have either gluten or fodmap sensitivity and while exploring, I found that I just genuinely love almond flour lol.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI just hate diets in general. The popularity of them makes it very difficult to co-exist  with people while trying to recover too. Keto, GF used as a diet(for reasons unrelated to celiac or general GI upsets), and intermittent fasting have a special place in hell for me honestly. I especially hate IF and find it extremely triggering to see all over magazines at the grocery store. I\u2019m just over here minding my own business picking out some foods that I want to be friends with and **bam** IF all over every magazine at checkout. Idk how that one ever became so widely acceptable.",
