  "selftext": "I'm a few months into recovery and have although haven't seen too much change in weight, mentally I've come a long way.\nI realised today that I was meant to divide the portion of tofu i had prepped into 3 but forgot and halved it. Didnt realise as I ate, or when I had my next snack, it took hours. When I realised, the urge to calculate calories came and the number almost made me cry. Why? It's just a number? \n\nMy body didn't notice, my mind almost didn't notice. I've been eating more lately. I've also been eating out a lot more. That doesn't matter. My life's gotten better as I've recovered,  this fear I'm feeling is a sign of good things to come.",
