  "title": "Posts about not needing to gain weight/not feeling satisfied",
  "selftext": "I've seen a lot of posts on here lately about people not feeling like they need to gain weight because they aren't underweight. I have also seen a lot of posts about not feeling satisfied or still being hungry while eating a very low amount of calories (less than 2,000). Some of these people have deleted their posts when I responded that they most likely needed to gain weight or eat more, even though they weren't underweight. \n\nRecovery is never going to be an easy task and oftentimes that means weight gain is necessary, whether you think you need it or not. You cannot dictate to your body what weight it should be. If you are having to do anything compensatory to stay at a certain weight, you are still giving in to your eating disorder. Many people have posted about losing a significant amount of weight and still being \"within a healthy weight range\" (dictated by BMI, which is BS anyway). If you lost weight through restriction or other means, you NEED to gain at least some back because it is very unlikely the weight you ended up at is your natural weight. \n\nI loved the person that posted on here a while ago about needing to hear the hard things in recovery. I have had anorexia for 13 years and what finally occurred to me when I was in residential treatment in December through February was **YOU CANNOT CONTROL WHAT YOUR BODY IS GOING TO DO AND YOU CAN'T PREDICT WHERE YOUR BODY WILL END UP WHEN YOU ARE FULLY RECOVERED.** It was a tough pill to swallow, but it has allowed me to really achieve recovery after 13 years. Giving up all control and allowing myself to remember how much I enjoy food and not counting calories is the only thing that has worked for me this far. \n\nMany people on here also ask about weight redistribution, metabolic restoration, overshoot, etc. In order to take away power from your eating disorder, you need to let the process happen and try not to focus on the future or conjecture about complicated concepts. I am not saying any of this is easy, but our bodies are really smart and they are built to try to keep us alive. You do not permanently damage your metabolism with an eating disorder, but you can create irreversible side effects from continuing to engage in your eating disorder (osteoporosis, heart issues, GERD, etc.). \n\nI have been through every level of treatment for my eating disorder and I was always trying to somehow recover and still maintain a level of control. I've since learned that this isn't possible. That is not to say that I eat inordinate amounts of food now, but I allow myself to enjoy eating and accept that sometimes eating occasions may be spontaneous. \n\nI hope that anyone that reads this will do one hard thing against their eating disorder today and allow yourself to give up even one tiny amount of control. Everyone has the capability to recover, but it will not come without doing hard things. I am a testament after 13 years that all is never lost. :)",

It went great, even though it was hard. I tried listening to my body, and it seemed to work. My weight was stable (I was overweight) for the whole year. Let's mention I ate high calorie and triggering food on the daily. I frequently ate platain chips, the whole bag, mug cakes, fried potatoes with mayo. \n\nI started handling my anxiety by going on walks instead of B/P. \n\nI relapsed, due to something major happening in my life. My weight was still the same. \n\nAfter some months, I decided to go see a registered dietitian. She told me I needed to stop all exercise (I ONLY walked), and encouraged me to emotionally eat. She insisted that I was resrricting even when I wasn't. \n\nAfter some months, I started feeling bad. Not with how I looked, but how I felt. My cholesterol rose to dangerous levels. I was hungrier and hungrier. I'd sometimes eat 3 times in the afternoon. All my meals were semi-binges. I felt reallt tired and exahusted all the time. \n\nI weighed myself for the first time in months, and I was 22lbs higher. \n\n\nHonestly, the fact that I didn't gain weight when I was first recovering, and I was still eating as much as my body asked me to, helpt me a lot realizing that I could eat, and I wouldn't balloon up and become morbidly obese. I have hypothyroidism too, and that will always be a challenge.\n\nNow I'm very obese for my height and I'm struggling to get back to a body I could MOVE in, without relapsing.",
