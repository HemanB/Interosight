Nobody starts this because their life is so great. Even though it seemed like I \u201cchose\u201d to restrict in the beginning, it was because I was at the end of my rope and just didn\u2019t see any other options. I could do that, or - I didn\u2019t know what else I could do to cope. At the time I thought of it as a choice, and I think it\u2019s a lot easier psychologically if you think you\u2019re choosing it. Once it doesn\u2019t feel like a choice, once you realize you can\u2019t cope otherwise, then restricting (in my experience) becomes a lot more distressing whereas before you could convince yourself you were strong for restricting.

I did choose to skip my first few meals, but very quickly it became not a choice.\n\nThere are lots of people who skip meals, either due to dieting or just really busy, but they don\u2019t develop an eating disorder. It\u2019s the same as people developing alcohol or substance use disorder; they might choose to take the first drink or the first drug, but they didn\u2019t choose to develop substance use disorder. And there are people who are able to take a few drinks or medication for injuries who don\u2019t develop issues. \n\nWhile we might have first chosen to use ED behaviors, that doesn\u2019t mean we chose what came afterwards. Because of genetics, environment, or a mixture of the two, we were probably more susceptible to it getting out of hand than in others who choose to use behaviors. \n\nSo, basically, it\u2019s a both/and proposition. Yeah, I chose to restrict, but I was predisposed to developing an eating disorder. Had I not chosen to restrict at first, then maybe I wouldn\u2019t have developed an ED, but had I not been predisposed by genetics and trauma, then restricting probably wouldn\u2019t have developed any further.",

Nothing could have prepared me for the fact that it will stay with me or that it will take up years off my life. \nI compare it to any other addiction - alcohol, drug use, self-harm - because you don't decide on your own to make yourself miserable and fuck your mental health up additionally, you need to cope. If you do choose it there is still a reason and it still wasn't fully your choice, but you were pushed in that direction by the circumstances. If that makes sense? \nYou never choose what youre doing, you're just looking for a way to cope or get attention (which is normal!!! and another sign of different mental illnesses unfortunately lol)",

Then I grew up and realised that people who choose it or do it for attention are STILL mentally ill. Nobody who is happy and mentally healthy commits to behaviours like starving themselves, at least not long term.\n\nIn my opinion, unless you are psychotic or out of reality in some other severe way, you are always responsible for your mental health. And yes, I do think some behaviours are \u2018chosen\u2019 in that some people starve themselves, some people cut themselves, some people use substance abuse and some people do other things. But a pattern of self destructive behaviour overall isn\u2019t really a choice but symptomatic of an illness - whether you \u2018choose\u2019 to do it or \u2018want attention\u2019 or \u2018want to use it to manipulate\u2019 or whatever. If you consistently and compulsively hurt yourself for ANY reason you are mentally ill, and that illness isn\u2019t really a choice even if the way it manifests may feel like you\u2019re \u2018choosing\u2019 that behaviour.\n\nBasically if I hadn\u2019t punished myself and felt relief through starving myself, getting smaller and occasionally cutting I would have just found other ways to hurt myself. So even though I chose not to eat because it short term made me feel a bit better about myself, my severe depression, low self-esteem/self hate and anxiety wasn\u2019t a choice - that was just how it manifested for me.",

I stumbled upon a group on a social media platform that is now dead, it was an ED group where everyone shared posts about how much weight they lost, what they ate, body checks and thinspo etc. After I read all the posts in the group and joined a few other groups, I started to immediately become obsessed with the topics they posted about and began thinking in disordered ways as well. I started to participate in the group, counting calories, restricting them, posting about how much weight I lost so far. \n\nIt was terrible. And I was immediately sucked into it. That wouldn't have happened if I didn't already have issues in my life to begin with. If a healthy minded person found those groups, they would have been appalled at what they saw.

I was overweight, so I didn't have body dysmorphia and thus it was just a bit of a drastic diet, I thought. (Honeymoon phase PLEASE come back </3) Only years into my ED I started to realize what it was, but I still feel like a fraud. **The symptoms make the disorder and they're obviously not a *full* choice (or there would be no disorder). The decision to engage for disordered behaviors in the first time is already a symptom of something.**\n\nI didn't choose to be raised fat, but you could say I chose to put food in my mouth. I didn't choose to love and romanticize underweight bodies since I was literally a toddler, but I did decide to download MyFitnessPal. I didn't decide to count calories while screaming the reverse alphabet, but my brain still did, because of my past choices?

The behaviors are due to maladaptive coping skills, and do not make it some easy thing you just choose and then get over. If that were true, eating disorders wouldn\u2019t exist. So sure, I chose to give into those behaviors but I was already sick.

Being miserable now, I sometimes wonder what I'm going to be nostalgic for from 2021 in like ten years. ill forget this pain, and reminisce on the good things. And I always wonder what those things will be, and when I am presently living those moments, I wonder if im forming the happy memories ill look back on. \n\nLike, ED is making me suffer right now and it always has. But if I get better for a while like I sometimes do, I'm gonna look back at 2021 and only miss looking good in that black dress, while forgetting how much my limbs were tingling while I took the photo. \n\nSorry for the tangent im very high.",

But you may use it to cope with whatever is happening in your life, and start to develop an eating disorder(s). \n\nWhen I was about 15 and I went about online seeking for a way to rapidly lose weight, I was already struggling with BED, Depression Anxiety, CPTSD, and an abusive person in my life who was bullying me at the time. I stumbled upon a group on a social media platform that is now dead, it was an ED group where everyone shared posts about how much weight they lost, what they ate, body checks and thinspo etc. After I read all the posts in the group and joined a few other groups, I started to immediately become obsessed with the topics they posted about and began thinking in disordered ways as well. I started to participate in the group, counting calories, restricting them, posting about how much weight I lost so far. \n\nIt was terrible. And I was immediately sucked into it. That wouldn't have happened if I didn't already have issues in my life to begin with. If a healthy minded person found those groups, they would have been appalled at what they saw. They would have clicked away and felt disgusted, maybe even sorry for the people on there. They wouldn't continue to look and start to obsess over it, and then participate in it.",
