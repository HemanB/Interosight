  "selftext": "Hi everyone, I keep going in and out of having lots of nostalgia for my ED, which I know is quite common here. Lets start a thread of uncomfortable truths/unromantic aspects of having an ED. To be clear you don't have to have all or any of these symptoms for your eating disorder to be bad or to count as an eating disorder. This is not meant to trigger, if your list is different to mine that's normal and okay. Eating disorders are truly infinitely varied. Anyways:\n\n\\-I was constipated all the time.\n\n\\-I had insomnia and when I could sleep, I had nightmares.\n\n\\-I was a massive bitch to people (especially people who tried to help me, so basically especially to nice people.)\n\n\\-I was moody and unkind.\n\n\\-I was competitive with others\n\n\\-I was scared of dying\n\n\\-Time slowed down (in a bad way) every minute passed more slowly which was excruciatingly dull\n\n\\-I used to sit around for hours doing nothing, just waiting for it to be the next day so I could weigh myself again. Literally not focusing on anything else.\n\n\\-My body started eating itself (Wasn't underweight, this just happened because of restriction)\n\n\\-Body ate the fat cells in my brain, couldn't stay awake in class and failed my GCSES\n\n\\-People misunderstand you even when you're dying, they think you're stupid and probably won't understand your ED. If your restriction is an unconscious non-verbal outreach for support, it might fall on deaf ears (I know this one sounds really mean, but this was my experience, there are better ways to seek support or cope with trauma or stress than an ED.)\n\n\\-I had no freedom\n\nNow here are some romantic aspects of my life with my ED in remission:\n\n\\-Never/rarely constipated (yay)\n\n\\-Not moody and mean to people who are trying to help me\n\n\\-Not competitive and obsessive with others.\n\n\\-Have a life, interests, friends, etc outside of ED.\n\n\\-Feel healthy and fit.\n\n\\-Have cognitive function and focus\n\n\\-Have freedom\n\n\\-Have been able to research my ED and really understand it even though it was misunderstood by others when I was younger (yay)\n\n\\-Feel relaxed and calm about food, body image. Not panicked or despairing. Don't get triggered by thinspo.\n\n\\-Know that I am more than my body, appearance, diet, or ability to restrict.",
