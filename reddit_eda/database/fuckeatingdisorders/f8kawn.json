I corrected myself and said \"getting well, I want to be healthy\"\nHe decided it was ok to say \"yeah you were getting pretty big, it's ok to admit it\". \n\nThis is someone who knows I've been in treatment twice. I'm so fucking furious right now. It's been hours and I'm still hurt and angry. It's never ok to comment on someone's appearance, period.",

I have ADHD myself and have said some really stupid stuff (not related to other individuals bodies but still really dumb). \n\nI can definitely empathize though as my parents have made comments about my body when I've been seriously underweight and when I've gained weight. I've been in treatment twice and even well meaning comments can be really cutting (e.g. \"You look really good now\" or \"You're looking too thin how much do you weigh?\"). \n\nI'm actually visiting them this week and I'm so worried about comments because I've gained about 11lbs since I saw them. I was underweight before but now I'm at a normal weight and I'm just dreading it bc I already feel so uncomfortable about my body.\n\nI'm truly sorry though, that was really uncalled for and I hope that you can find a bit of relief from that asshole comment as time passes.\n\nAlso, if you ever need to talk you can always pm me.",

And he said, \u201ccause you used to be more puffy... I can tell in your arms and stuff.\u201d Granted he was drunk so he didn\u2019t have a filter but it was so uncomfortable.",

If you can bear to, I think talking to him and telling him exactly why what he said was inappropriate and that you are really hurt and angry would be a good idea. It's one thing someone mindlessly making comments about weightloss, as that's a \"coveted\" thing in society and seen as a \"positive\" comment so understanding why it can be harmful is a bit more difficult for people to wrap their heads around, but making comments about someone gaining weight is far more socially taboo, so he should know better than to make comments like that to anyone, let alone someone who has been on your journey. What an idiot.",
