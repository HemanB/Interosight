  "title": "Found out my weight after a year",
  "selftext": "I have a yearly doctor's appointment where he always tells me my weight even though I don't want to know. Last year he told me I was \"fast on the way to becoming obese\" (spoiler: I was not). This year he wasn't a dick about it but still told me.\n\nAnd I didn't spiral. I went home and ate lunch. And when I tried the new meds and I lost my appetite from them, my first thought was \"oh crap I should tell him thats not good\". In the past I would have KILLED to lose my appetite but now my first thought was to contact him.\n\nYall. I lost most of high school and all of college to this bs. But it finally feels okay. It's possible. I still have work to do, but holy crap.\n\nI just needed to tell someone this since I don't tell people in my real life about this kind of stuff. Thanks for listening",
