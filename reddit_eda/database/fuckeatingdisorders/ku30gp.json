  "selftext": "I haven\u2019t eaten all day. I made a small meal maybe 20 minutes ago and I already feel sick to my stomach. I feel like I can feel the weight being gained each bite. And afterwards I feel like I\u2019m 500x heavier than I actually am. I checked my weight and it hasn\u2019t moved but I swear it has. I swear I\u2019m just packing on the weight. I feel like I\u2019m rotting from the inside out because of the food I\u2019m eating. But it\u2019s just food. And it pisses me off that I can\u2019t get over this.",

It was exhausting to look in the mirror and feel uncomfortable in my own body, and then hours later kind of like what I see. Then find a flaw and be back at square one. The mental back and forth fucking SUCKS. But eventually I got over it by learning healthier coping skills. When I had those feelings, I forced myself to face reality and then I'd distract those feelings by doing something I enjoyed. I knew I wasn't gaining weight as soon as I ate, and I knew my body was attempting to trick me so my ED would take hold again. \n\nYour brain learns to trick itself into doing the things it's come to see as 'feel good' activities. Your brain actually releases serotonin and other feel good hormones when you have an ED, so you literally come to be addicted to your ED. Just like a drug addiction, your brain is going to do what it can to get you to give it its normal dose of feel good hormones. But eventually your brain will learn to function again, and the hold of your ED will lessen. \n\nPlease don't give up. Over time it will get easier and easier to get over this.",
