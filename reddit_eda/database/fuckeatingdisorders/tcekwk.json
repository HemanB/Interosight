They may be \"recovering\" still but they are far from their claim of being recovered. I find it way easier to ignore them and find solace here where people are more serious about recovering and are honest about their journeys",

Flaunting the fact that you have remained thin\u2014often *very* thin\u2014is just another way the disorder shows itself. It feeds off validation, and the age of social media really exacerbates this. That\u2019s why pro-Ana sites exist. That\u2019s why this content is the bulk of recovery hashtags\u2014not because it\u2019s actually healthy.\n\nRemember that eating disorders are competitive illnesses. Unfollow these \u201cinfluencers\u201d and if you truly want some real recovery content your best advice would be to follow fat positive influencers and anti diet influencers. Expanding your social media to include a variety of bodies is going to help you accept yourself that much quicker.",

The first step that helped me is basically just affirming that these people are hyper posting for validation - they know the image of recovery theyre perpetuating. The thing is, if theyre that dogged abt painting that image, there is minimal chance that they\u2019ve actually ever recovered at all.\n\nThe second was distance. I can\u2019t change how these people act. They are likely the same people who posted thinspo on pro ana sites. They will continue to play this validation game in a more acceptable \u201crecovery\u201d framework. The best bet is to block them.
