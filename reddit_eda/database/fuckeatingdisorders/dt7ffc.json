  "selftext": "Hello! First time posting here. I just wanted to say that I was severely bulimic for 5 years, spent a month in residential treatment and then 2 months in PHP outpatient.\n\nThis was in the summer between my sophomore year and junior year of college (summer 2016).\n\nI am now healthy and I just began a job as a Counselor at a different women's residential treatment facility.\n\nRecovery is possible and can lead to advocacy! Anything is possible, LIVING on the other side of ED is so worth it :)\n\nIt's such a good feeling trying to help other women recover!\n\nFEEL FREE TO MESSAGE FOR SUPPORT!!!",

I had 4.5 years in recovery before this relapse and would have loved to have that type of volunteer opportunity. \n\nCould you speak to or email staff at the center about your concerns to see what they think about your readiness to volunteer as a recovery coach? If you have a therapist, dietician or other supports currently, talk about it with them. If you feel like you are struggling with your recovery, maybe you could call the center you attended and see if they had any recovery coaches who could work with you for a while? Let them know that you are interested in giving back to someone else when you are in a better state of mind. If they aren't able to offer a recovery coach to you, they might be able to tell you where to find one.",
