  "selftext": "I would have never believed that would happen. \n\nI just ate my \u201cbreakfast\u201d, after having a reactive eating episode (due to restriction) late last Night where I emptied more than half a jar of biscoff Creme after a bunch of cornflakes and a chocolate bar. \nAnd I did not compensate for it today. I ate my breakfast and I was for the first time in forever satiated! I did not even thought about getting more food - despite being home alone. Who would have thought that. \n\nLike all of us I thought I am somehow broken and could never get back\nto a place where I would feel contempt with what I ate. \nJust wanted to share that. Maybe it can help some of you get some motivation to eat breakfast as well!",
