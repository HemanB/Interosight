  "title": "Eating disorders go so much deeper than food",
  "selftext": "20 years into recovery from anorexia/restrict binge cycling, and I can honestly say I've mastered intuitive eating. (It took a long ass time.)\n\nBut I still get tripped up. Being unreasonably mean to myself when work doesn't go well. Being mean to myself over bad parenting moments. Overinflating my ego over small victories (just like back in the day being on cloud nine when restriction was going well) only to have it come crashing down at the slightest setback.\n\nIt's deep work. For me, it might be a lifetime of work. It's not about food at all, it's about unconditional self love and letting go of ego. It's every human's journey, and it's absolutely worth it. Even if we never quite get all the way there.",

And I'm lucky enough to have a supportive mother who cut herself off from food criticism and actually apologizes for \"doing this to\" me. I would never be able to figure out for myself what's going on when I can't get my shit together to eat, but they see it and they do the work with me.",
