I worked at a somewhat major coffee chain (not Starbucks) for a while a few years ago, and my roommate would always be making snide comments implying that none of the customers are actually drinking coffee. But in reality, our brewed coffee was the main seller by a lot - it was a constantly changing array of beans from different countries, brewed and disposed of every half hour. Of *course* we were all drinking coffee. And some coffees taste great black and unsweetened, some have flavors that pop with sugar, some lend themselves perfectly to cream - it's okay to like whatever you like however you like it, and being a snarky little shit about it benefits no one, but invalidates so many.",
