  "selftext": "TW/ triggering comments  \nI was left so annoyed after a conversation with a classmate yesterday that I wanted to rant on here. A girl was having a meal replacement bar, some fruit and a chocolate bar for her lunch. She even said before hand that she had ran out of bread so she was having that instead for her lunch. It was totally fine, it didn\u2019t even concern me. Another classmate turned to her and was like, \u201cwow, you\u2019re so skinny! Is that what you eat for lunch? I wish I was like you!\u201d My friend just explained that she didn\u2019t have any bread in (she has a sandwich everyday and she\u2019s naturally just a petite build) and the classmate responded \u201cu literally eat nothing, I actually wish sometimes I had an ED so I could look good!!\u201d \n\ni was absolutely\u2026.. fuming!!?? Baffled!!! I decided not to even say anything since it\u2019s best to ignore f\\*cking idiots like that in those situations. But oh my god, I was so pissed off. I can\u2019t believe someone actually thought and said those words out loud!?It\u2019s like my struggles meant nothing. I\u2019m so much better now so before this would have triggered a relapse. But I could have thrown the entire lunch table at them.   \n\n\nBut it\u2019s other things I hear too. It\u2019s when people pretend they have mental illnesses when they don\u2019t that honestly makes me so angry. I\u2019m diagnosed with Borderline personality disorder and psychosis, BPD is one of the most misunderstood disorders ever. People are like, \u201coh, I get so sad when my friends don\u2019t respond I must have BPD!\u201d Or \u201cI feel sad this morning omg I have depression haha I wanna die lol!\u201d Or \u201cIm so delusional haha omg I think the weirdest things I\u2019m schizo omggf watch out I\u2019m crazyyy!!\u201d   \nWill people shut tf up!! Stop pretending you have something and especially stop pretending you wish you had something because honestly what the f\\*ck! People are so stupid!",

Dissociative identity disorder is the most severe form of ptsd and alters or parts of the personality dissociate away from the original core or hosts personality at a very young age due to repeated and severe childhood trauma it's a trauma disorder and not a quirky fun roleplay like the people who fake it lead people to believe it leads to misinformation and stigma to the point some professionals aren't taking it seriously anymore, faking mental illness is serious, ANY mental illness",

People who are like, \u201cI had an out of body experience hahaha lucid dreams lol sleep paralysis demons omgggg I get that hahahahah!!\u201d I\u2019m like shut up. Only people who have dissociated know the feeling. It\u2019s so indescribable. It\u2019s horrible! So I know how you feel. The panic that comes with it too, like, I can feel it coming on slowly, like I\u2019m slipping away and my bodies disappearing. And people want that! So, so stupid.\n\nedit: grammar",

There\u2019s so much misinformation online about illnesses and they\u2019re always portrayed in a way that\u2019s desirable. For example, there was some Netflix show with a character that had ana (of course, because there\u2019s only one ED in the world) and she was portrayed as this beautiful model that everybody loved but she was insecure about herself, but she shouldn\u2019t have been because she was so bEaUtIfUL and everyone wished she was her. I mean, why!!?? Or characters in programmes are wrote with \u2018mental illness\u2019 but everyone loves them around them and they\u2019re considered great for it. It\u2019s so annoying. They\u2019re not glam, or cool, they\u2019re deadly. It\u2019s a disease, not a quirky choice.",
