  "title": "I literally got my food taken away from me after I told my friends I was in recovery.",
  "selftext": "Last night I was brave enough to go out and get some drinks with my friends. Everyone had some sort of problem with their lives and we were sort of supporting each other, talking, laughing and all was well. Then I made the mistake to talk about my recovery from bulimia and I was met with ridiculous responses such as \u201cbut do you feel sick?\u201d. \n\nAnyway, as the night went on, everyone got hungry so we sat down to this place to get some sandwiches and while we were eating, one of the girls snatched (yes literally) the half eaten sandwich from my hands, saying that this is enough and I don\u2019t have to eat in excess. \n\nIt was like a slap in the face. I shut down the rest of the night. When I came home I cried in my husband\u2019s arms until daybreak and now I can\u2019t eat. I would run, but I\u2019m not sure that I won\u2019t collapse since it\u2019s a bad idea to do so in an already dehydrated state. Within a few hours I regressed back to the point where if I don\u2019t run, I can\u2019t eat and it took me months to get out of this mindset.\n\n\nI have no questions.\n\nI just wanted to rant.\n\nEdit: I just wanted to mention that we were all between 29-32 years of age, not middle schoolers.",
