  "selftext": "One year ago, I accepted the fact that I had a problem. I was miserable, cold and tired. One year ago I decided that I could no longer live like this, that I needed help. It took another few month until I got a therapist and really started this journey, but I never expected it to last that long.\n\nI thought that the things, about malnourishment and brain capacity, did not apply to me, because I was aware that I had a problem, because I could (kinda) do my uni work and talk to people. That it would be over in what 2-3 weeks and everything would be back to normal, after this 1 1/2 year.\n\nFast forward a few month into quasi-recovery and the game of gaining a bit maintaining, and than gaining a bit more, took me just barely into a \u201chealthy\u201d weight again. Being stuck in a binge-restrict cycle.\n\nThe last 2 weeks however my body was tired of fighting for so long and decided that it no longer wanted to play the game of the ED voice. So I ate and no matter how much the voice mentally begged  to restrict, I was just incapable of doing it. \n\nNow I am no longer malnourished and yeah it turns out (again) science is right. The malnourished brain is indeed not capable of realising a lot of things. It indeed is necessary to gain the weight.\n\nIt feels like a curtain has been lifted from my brain, ever since I reached the \u201cmedical-not-longer-malnourished\u201d phase of fuelling my body adequately every day. \nI feel so much more like myself it\u2019s crazy. I can laugh and mean it. I get more emotional and I swear the world seems even a bit more colourful. I am no longer in this weird floaty state which is hard to describe and I did not even knew I was in. \n\nBut also I had another realisation. Another thing that I thought I already knew, but suddenly really sunk in to me.\n\n EDs just fill out a space in your brain that was previously preoccupied, by another problem and as soon as the ED starts to get smaller the space is open for the problems to re-enter again . But it is also the moment that we could start to rewire. Instead of letting the dark material fill the void, it could be filled with so much more bright thoughts and love. It does not have to end up the same. It could be the start of something new.\n\nBut ultimately it\u2019s you that has to make that decision. To take on the driver seat. No one else can do it. It\u2019s hard. It\u2019s against everything that you know. But \u201cnothing changes if nothing changes.\u201d\n\nToday I ate breakfast after having one of the worst mental hunger eating \u201cbinges\u201d in the middle of the night, after a week of eating way way past calorie minimums and I am terrified and proud and every emotion that you can think of, but I try to clench my fists and look forward. At least for today. One step, one breath at a time.",
