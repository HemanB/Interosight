  "selftext": "For a long time I convinced myself that I needed to hit \"rock bottom\" to deserve to recover- that one day, I would have a dramatic revelation and suddenly believe that I'm worth the effort. That mindset kept me sick for years. \n\nWhen I finally did enter recovery it was for no other reason aside from being utterly fed up with my life. I made the decision on a random Monday; no hospitalization, no come-to-jesus with a loved one, no arbitrary \"sick enough\" goal met. If you have a part of you that wants to live, no matter how small, that is more than enough. I desperately wish I could go back to the version of myself who spent so long postponing that initial leap and tell her that it is SO WORTH IT. \n\nThere is no perfect time to start recovery, and there is no wrong time either. You don't need to prove your suffering to anyone- ESPECIALLY not your eating disorder- before you deserve to take action. You are worthy of so much more than this life. I hope each and every one of us is able to find peace.\n\n(Sorry if this was overly preachy- I was just reflecting on my progress today and feeling sappy \ud83e\udd79)  ",

There isn't a use in waiting to start recovery, because even something like rock bottom might not be enough for some folks.\n\nWish I had half your strength, stay well!",
