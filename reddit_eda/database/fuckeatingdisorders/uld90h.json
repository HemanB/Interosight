  "selftext": "So I\u2019ve recently pulled myself out of a bit of relapse, and I\u2019m working mainly on body image. I\u2019ve really tried to get into the mindset of body neutrality and i genuinely cannot recommend it enough because it has CHANGED ME. Like I just have a body. It looks a certain way. It does what it needs to do and I put it through a cheeky bit of anorexia so it really deserves a bit of freedom. I give it the food it wants and it does with it as it pleases and it deserves to be left the fuck alone for a bit. It looks how it looks and giving a fuck about it is simply too time consuming so whatever. Genuinely telling myself these things has changed me. And obviously I have some bad days where I hate being in my own skin but I just tell myself to get my head out my ass and suck it up bc I have better things to be doing and wallowing in sadness bc I don\u2019t like the literal vessel that keeps me alive is boring as hell. Anyways I will advocate for body neutrality until I DIE because it\u2019s great",
