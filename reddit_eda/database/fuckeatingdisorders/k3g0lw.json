  "selftext": "was going through this forum and almost getting annoyed at how many people think they're eating too much or are wondering if it's possible to avoid some hard parts of recovery etc. to be fair i was like that once, but basically my point is that RECOVERY SUCKS. you will probably overshoot. you will probably binge. you will probably eat (loads of) junk food. you will probably cry. should this scare you from recovering? NO. because the life you're living with during your ed is way worse. so u need to get over it and just trust that recovery be worth it. \n\njust felt like someone needed to be blunt about that.",

That\u2019s how I know I\u2019m recovering is that I\u2019m going through uncomfortable situations. For example, if I binge, I feel guilt until I purge, but if I acknowledge that guilt but don\u2019t act upon it and go on with my day, that\u2019s one step away from my Ed behaviour. Things that are worth it usually cost something in return, in this case, it\u2019s our comfort zone.",

I hate half assing anything I do, so I basically used that towards recovering.\n\nI never under why some girls in treatment would try to be the sickest and talk about how they were the sickest, etc.\nI remember telling 2 of them that I wanted to sit by myself during meal time because they were triggering.\nMe and the other girl who told them they were triggering always called them out because they both flaunted their ED and were only there because they knew eachother prior and both came in at the same time just to hangout.. it was very frustrating.\nLike I obviously get that it\u2019s not that simple but it\u2019s a lot better pushing through than continuing to suffer.\n\nI am thankful everyday that I have the insightfulness and motivation that I have towards getting better.. it sounds harsh and not compassionate but like, it\u2019s reality and it gets very hard seeing people flaunt their ED\u2019s when you\u2019re just trying to get closer to a normal life.\n\nI can\u2019t even enjoy social media platforms anymore to help me get through hard shit because there\u2019s always something triggering or competitive with eating disorders popping up out of nowhere.\nI\u2019ve tried getting new accounts and everything and yet non-recovery related shit comes up all the time.\nSorry for ranting but I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not the only one who gets the point in this.",

I still don\u2019t count calories or macros and I still allow myself to eat foods I\u2019m craving, but I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m craving the junk foods constantly anymore. I did lose a little bit of the excess weight over the course of the last two years, but I still am bigger than I\u2019d like to be. However I\u2019ve accepted that expecting my body to change overnight is unrealistic, and expecting to perfectly like my body when it is much bigger than it used to be is a hard sell. But I\u2019ve found a lot of joy in appreciating what my body can do for me \u2014 its capabilities, so to speak. I took a Jiu Jitsu class and started cycling and these are things my anorexic body could never have done. So while I still am not super happy with how I look I\u2019m much more happy with how I feel. And I\u2019m on a journey that will continue on throughout my life. I\u2019m not going to lie, I\u2019d still like to lose some of the excess weight I am carrying. But I\u2019m much more accepting of the time it takes to see those changes. Slow and steady I go on.",
