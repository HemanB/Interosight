  "selftext": "The problem is the eating disorder. We cannot romanticize these things anymore. Anyone who\u2019s been through multiple relapses knows that this stupid shit is not worth it. It makes everything worse. Life is awful when ED behaviors control your every thought, every move, everything you put or do not put in your mouth. Your body was never, EVER, the problem. The reason why people are so worried about you is because what you are doing to yourself is wrong. The only reason it ever feels right is because this is a real illness that clouds your sense of judgement. You do not need to change. You never did anything to not deserve to live the same life as the girls you\u2019re jealous of. Eat the oatmeal. Make the pancakes. Bake the fucking cookies. The little things in life matter. Food matters. You deserve it. You are good. You are okay. I promise.",
