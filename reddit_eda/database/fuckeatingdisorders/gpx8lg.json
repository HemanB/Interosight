All of that calmed down significantly later in recovery; I actually can't even remember the last time I had peanut butter.\n\nMy understanding of it is the following: 1) We crave calorie dense, high fat foods to help repay the energy debt caused by under eating. 2) Most of us suffer with digestive issues when we start eating, and peanut butter is processed to it's most easily digestible form. Somehow our bodies know this food is the quickest way to absorb the calories, fats, and protein we need to get better.\n\nNow that I am thinking about it, it also might be why it is such a stable for young children. They need a lot of resources to keep up with the fast pace of their growth, while we need energy dense stuff to help with internal repairs.",
