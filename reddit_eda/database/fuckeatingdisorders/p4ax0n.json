It\u2019s worse in the evening after dinner. Last night I had a salmon salad (a very substantial portion, out with friends) and I literally thought about food the entire rest of the night, from like 8pm onward, while we went out for drinks, until I was in bed, lying awake, thinking about food. Just feeling the urge to eat more. WHY. I wasn\u2019t hungry any of that time. What is wrong with me. I\u2019m so over it.",
