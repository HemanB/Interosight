  "selftext": "so it happened. i ate. the damn felt like it broke and it flooded open. i was at a chinese food restaurant, smth i had known abt for weeks and been stressing abt for weeks since my mom first told me. i researched the menu, studied it and the calories and chose the things i would eat days before. i got there stressed and tired and hungry. i was exhausted today. and for weeks before coming home i was telling myself i would use this chance to get better but knowing id never do it. little did i know they werent serving my \"safe food\" options due to the holidays. so i was beginning to have a quiet meltdown and everyone saw the tears start to well in my eyes. but then my dad said something to me that hurt worse than the stupid food i was crying over. i was picking at my plate. barely eating green beans. i was so sick of this and my self. disgusted with what ive become. i was well past this point but in that moment i was particularly angry at myself. and my dad made a comment. he just said. \"eat!!\". the way he said it was just so....hurt. he told me i looked bird like and the reality hit more than anything of how bad i look and how stupid i looked shaking at a plate of green beens. seeing your child like that must be agonizing. so i ate. i ate everything ravenously. and i couldnt stop smiling because i was so full by the end. and then i got hot chocolate with my family and didnt look at the menu. and then i got home and ate more dessert. the floodgates OPENED. ive never been so hungry. like i KNEW i was hungry but actually honoring it? feels like a dream. u cant imagine how good mac and cheese tastes. right now im battling the aftermath of being so full. fighting the urge to run tomorrow. to starve myself to make up for the food i ate tonight. but instead im focusing on breakfast since i think if i eat anymore tonight i'll burst. but im going to have waffles tomorrow. with syrup and butter. and im going to have coffee that is not black. im focusing so hard on that because right now i feel like i have to roll myself to bed im so full hahaha. i love my dad so much he has no idea that the way he said that simple phrase mightve saved me. that restaurant has no idea their greasy salty food mightve saved me. im just tired of hurting. my body is in pain. its exhausted. im exhausted. of course its hard, the mental part. but i can do it. the reality sunk in after my first real meal in months that im going to have to commit to this. that i have to eat again, and again, and again. i have to keep eating everytime im hungry. everytime the voice tells me i should run or i should starve or i shouldnt eat this or that. i have to eat everytime. because i cannot let the eating disorder win. i want to be like how i was when i was a kid. being w my family and watching old videos tonight reminds me of that. in that moment at the restaurant i had a choice. to either hurt my dad, let him down like i let my niece down, and my friends, and countless others, or eat the fucking food. i was so angry with the ed voice i ate out of SPITE. i ate for my dad, for my niece, for myself, and most of all for my child self that i admire so greatly for how they ate. im terrfied. scared shitless right now. but my body will sort itself out. its smart. it knows best. i have been living like this for way too long. years of denial, of downplaying it, and then my attempts at recovery that was just more restriction in different forms. im over it. i want to live. i dont want to look at myself in the mirror and be disgusted anymore. i dont want to look half dead anymore. i want my period. i want to be warm again. i want my life back. to be in love someday. im so sick of doing anything and everything to suppress my hunger. im sick of missing out on life because im stuck at home living my sick little routine over and over. im just so done. i posted here about hitting my rock bottom a week or so ago. my ed tricked me and told me i needed to get worse before i could eat. well i dont want to get any worse. im sick enough. if i broke a bone i wouldnt wait until it was \"broken enough\" to go to the doctors. im so done waiting. i just want to be well. im ready to live. im really loving the name of this subreddit because tonight was one big FUCK YOU to my eating disorder.",
