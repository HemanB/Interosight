  "selftext": "Somehow found myself in fatlogic, because I was bored I guess, and just\u2026 browsed. And tbh I find most of the shit they post there super disordered and it really feels like encouraging disordered behavior. Obsessively counting calories, cutting down to super restrictive amounts, avoiding whole food groups, \u201cfasting,\u201d giving moral value to food, etc. it\u2019s literally all of the things I did when actively anorexic. It\u2019s what I encouraged people to do because society told me it was \u201chEaLthY.\u201d\n\nObviously not saying every single person who diets has an eating disorder but I find it really weird that we label these behaviors as \u201chealthy habits\u201d if you\u2019re heavier or \u201chave weight to lose,\u201d despite the fact that restriction affects all bodies the same regardless of weight. Idk, just something that\u2019s been bothering me.",

It works great, short term, but there's no research for it being successful long term let alone a permanent solution for the vast majority of people. CICO worked great for me the first year but after that I started binge eating, losing hair and constant insomnia, but I still stuck to it. I put up with all that for another year before I had enough and threw in the towel. I wasn't feeling \"healthy\" and didn't care about being as small as I can if I couldn't sleep more than 4 hours. All those issues went away.\n\nYou keep saying it works but the vast majority will not experience any permanent reduction in weight? Around half of all adults are currently dieting, that's billions of people, and 20% of those are strictly counting calories. Based on the data again, most won't experience any long term reduction in weight, are all those people all too stupid or too lazy to figure out a food scale and MyFitnessPal? Also with so many people dieting for so long you would think we would have a method with at least a 50% success rate by now. There's no study that shows anything close to that. Everyone keeps saying \"It works! It works!\" when there's no evidence. It is delusion at this point.",

          "body": "The problem a lot of people have is that they think because they've achieved short term weight loss(within 6 months to 1 year), that that is considered a success and the diet worked. But any study that goes beyond 1 year, 2, years, 5 years, shows almost no one keeps the weight off and a lot of people who regained put back on even more weight. This mostly happens by the 2nd year. Also every diet is ultimately CICO so I don't know why you're trying to separate it from the others. Diet companies like WW actually don't share the data of their customers because it would show their customers are lifelong customers and in constant weight loss/regain, never settling at any weight nor their goal weight. Take note of weight loss posts you come across online they're almost all some variation of \"In 6 months I lost\", \"A year ago I was x amount of lbs\"\n\nOur definitions of success when it comes to dieting are ultimately different. If a diet worked, it would work, there should be less people dieting overtime and the population should be shrinking but that's not the case at all, dieters are always dieting and people are getting heavier. There is actually some research that shows a predictor of people getting heavier over their life is due to dieting. That once they rebound + gain overshoot weight their body now settles there and each time they diet they push their weight higher and higher. The \"solution\" to the overweight problem could be making people fatter. I know for myself, I was much smaller, before I ever dieted and naturally maintained that weight without much thought or effort. All the dieters in my family are much heavier than the non-dieters(most of them are still around the high school weight), it's a very clear delineation as my siblings and cousins were all very slim as kids and throughout high school.\n\nSo again when I say diets don't work, I mean they don't work, and these are the criteria I'm going by.\n\nHere's an article if you'd like to read more by a researcher in the field.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/05/04/why-diets-dont-actually-work-according-to-a-researcher-who-has-studied-them-for-decades/",
