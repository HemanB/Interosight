  "selftext": "I've been in recovery for around 7 months and here are some wins to keep me motivated :) \n\n- I can now eat 3 meals a day and snacks\n- I can eat out with friends/family\n- peanut butter <33 \n- I can have more than one fruit with breakfast \n- I have my period back\n- I can (mostly) eat chocolate \n- I can eat the baked goods I make \n- I can cook with my bf without having to track everything \n- I can actually read (I used to be too tired to even comprehend what I was reading on a page)\n- I don't have to force myself to exercise (thank god!)\n- I don't measure my food anymore \n- I can eat rice by myself \n- I can buy my own groceries \n- spaghetti \n\nI was having raisins with my breakfast this morning and realised how far I'd come. I remember literally crying over eating grapes only a few months ago because I saw them as \"unnecessary calories\" and now i can snack freely on raisins. I wanted to remind myself of what I've achieved and how I never want to go back to the way I was. My life has become so much bigger since letting go of anorexia. I still have a lot of things I want to challenge but it's good to see what I've achieved so far instead of focusing on everything I'm still yet to do.",

Maybe you could keep a calendar or journal, and record new successes on it? You can look back on it during times of struggle (they will happen) and keep your motivation going. \n\nI'll always remember cooking myself my very first fried egg, at 25 years old, with google directions on hand. I neglected food for so long, I wasn't even a functioning adult in many ways. That was 4 years ago!",
