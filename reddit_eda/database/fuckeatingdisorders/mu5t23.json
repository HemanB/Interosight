It was also the punishment and satisfaction from feeling hungry and pushing myself to be \u2018better and better\u2019 by being thinner.\n\nI hope you have come through it and feel better about yourself now. Your face is a face just like my body is a body - it doesn\u2019t owe anyone anything or make you any more or less valuable. The men who told you those things are vile.",

My ED now absolutely extends to the rest of my body, but it\u2019s almost like, as a way of checking the progress for my face, if that makes sense? \n\nFor your last sentence, I think sometimes the logic feels like I just want a \u2018different\u2019 face, like I just wanna swap my face for another one, and seeing as I\u2019m not gonna get plastic surgery, and makeup comes off at night, maybe losing weight will change my reflection? I\u2019m also obsessed with skincare... keep thinking that maybe if I can just get that glowey-glass skin, it\u2019ll be the missing link?!!",

I knew I couldn't change my face, but my body was something I could control and I wanted to make it \"perfect\" to make up for having an ugly face. But now my body image issues have evolved and now it's more about my body than my face, lol. My ED started because I wanted to be thin and change my body. But now isn't really about controlling my weight so I can be skinny, but I use it as a coping mechanism and to feel in control. I still have body image issues but not ED related, I guess? Idk if this makes any sense lmao",

      "body": "I relate to it not being \"about the body\" in that I didn't start restricting \"for\" my body (and I also relate to having way more insecurities about my face than my body). For me, my behaviors developed out of a very tumultuous and stressful personal life that just felt to be getting out of control. When my partner pointed out his worry for me, leading me to Google anorexia, I immediately identified with the notion of needing control, of using restriction just to feel centered and grounded about at least one thing in life. Not to mention its self-harming aspects. I do remember seeing the weight drop and not wanting it to worsen, yet always being attached to the new number (\"OK, it can't get lower than this, but I can't let it go back up, either\"). I've been in recovery for 2.5 months now and I'm so thankful that I started \"early\" (like so many others in this sub, I really fought myself over whether I was \"sick enough\" for help). I can look back on the recent past with so much more objectivity now, and therefore more easily direct where my behaviors came from and how I can combat them. Not that I'm fully recovered, haha, but recognizing these things, like how much the body plays a role, is an important step.",

And I agree it can be abou thing that aren't your body. For me, it was more about not feeling deserving of food and whenever I felt like a failure, I would just restrict food to 'punish' myself. And him telling me I cannot achieve that body and basically making me out to be too lazy to work out enough to get \"fit\" made me feel even worse and more worthless.  \n\n\nI know it isn't like that for everyone but in a sense, it is a struggle for control over my own body for me.",

Whenever I feel loss of control or mentally insecure in my jobs and tasks, and when I get \u201ctoo busy\u201d.. it triggers lapses/relapses.\nWhich makes the honesty about it more frustrating because so many providers only view it as a body image and weight insecurity.. but for me it\u2019s really about feeling the need to keep control of my body and fear of losing that control again.
