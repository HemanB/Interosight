  "selftext": "I got rid of the batteries in my scale in an effort to recover and eat more intuitively. I just got back from a visit to the city to see my mum and weighed myself there and, as the title says, I'm in the green on the BMI chart for the first time in forever. \n\nI feel so... Curvy. Feminine. I'm one BMI point away from underweight so I'm not exactly other people's definition of curvy, but fuck em, this isn't about them. I have a butt, I have breasts. I feel so beautiful. I got to go wedding dress shopping with my mum and love my body and dress it in the most glamorous things I've ever worn. I got to look at the mirror and not see joints and bones and hollow eyes staring back. I got to see me! My mum got to see me!\n\nI mean absolutely no disrespect to those thinner than me, this isn't a put down on thin bodies. I am just healthy and happy for the first time in a long time and needed to share. I really feel like I've made headway and I'm so damn proud of myself and comfortable in my own skin and entering married life as a healthier partner. It's a beautiful thing.",
