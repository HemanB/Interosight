  "selftext": "At 7 am. While still in the grocery store. Idk what came over me, I tried one and couldn\u2019t stop. I just stood there shoving grapes in my face. It\u2019s like some demon sugar craving goblin is in my brain. \n\nNow I\u2019m walking home and I\u2019m spiraling. I\u2019m scared my blood sugar is gonna crash after that. I\u2019m annoyed because I wanted to eat some apricot later as my daily fruit but now I feel like I can\u2019t and I\u2019ve wasted my daily fruit on something high calories I didn\u2019t even enjoy bc I ate them so fast. I almost want to skip breakfast bc a whole bag of grapes is a lot\u2026 do I really need breakfast?? I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll be bloated later. Idk I woke up in a good mood and now I\u2019m spiraling and so mad at myself for ruining my day.",

Long story short, eat bags of grapes but make sure to have room for substantial food alongside it. And enjoy multiple fruit a day. You deserve it!",
