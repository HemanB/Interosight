I try to remember that to fully recover, this will be part of the process, whether I like it or not. I know if I don\u2019t honor it now, then I truly won\u2019t be able to move forward in recovery. Of course, all this is easier said than done. Some days after eating all I feel is guilt and I want to do is cry. But I remind myself that this is exactly what my ED wants.

For me, some days are easier than others. I found that what works for me is as soon as I feel hungry or crave something, I immediately go and eat it, which gives my ED voice less time to try and talk myself out of it or find an excuse not to eat it. I try to remember that to fully recover, this will be part of the process, whether I like it or not. I know if I don\u2019t honor it now, then I truly won\u2019t be able to move forward in recovery. Of course, all this is easier said than done. Some days after eating all I feel is guilt and I want to do is cry. But I remind myself that this is exactly what my ED wants. Gotta piss that ED voice off until it goes away :) Best of luck in your recovery <3",
