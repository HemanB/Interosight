Those are funny and make me feel seen bc I too will eat nachos and then cereal and then a pb&j plus some carrots or whatever and call it girl dinner. The ones where people are like, here\u2019s an egg and a cheese stick I\u2019m just like, noooo babe that\u2019s not dinner, that\u2019s bragging.",

Of course it does appeal to my ED but the intent is purely non ED. It's been a running joke btwn of for long time. But yeah, this trend is triggering.",

But those are my struggle *struggle* days where even throwing that together is a humongous effort.

I already have my brain trying to lie to me about how snacks can be a meal, I don\u2019t need to see it plastered everywhere else as some sort of bonding activity \ud83d\ude14",
