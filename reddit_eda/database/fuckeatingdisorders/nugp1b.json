  "selftext": "The gross aspects of ED that remind me I need to fucking cut this shit out: \n\n\\*\\*\\***Potential trigger**/this is mostly a vent/attempted motivation\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Floors covered in crumbs and food bits and condiments that I don't notice and/or don't care to pick up or vacuum that accumulate over weeks because I just can't bring myself to give a shit. \n\n\\- The rings and stains of black mold and fuzzy looking things that build up inside the toilet bowl that, again, I can't bring myself to clean but get reminded of every time I look at it. \n\n\\- The seemingly permanent stench coming from the garbage disposal from episodes.\n\n\\- The permanent stains from leaky trash bags of rotted food and vomit that lead from my doorway all the way down the stairs to the dumpster. It's been years and the stains never go away. \n\n\\- Tidbits of memories over the years like having to fish out a ring that slipped off my finger from a soup of vomit and toilet water in the bowl. \n\n\\- 30 minutes of drool and thick mucus covering my mouth and fingers during an episode and the cloth that gets coated in it when I wipe it off. \n\n\\- The mouth ulcers. \n\n\\- The grainy, almost sticky feeling in your mouth for hours after an episode. \n\n\\- The accumulated garbage before I work up the motivation to clean. \n\n\\- Bowls of vomit waiting to be dumped because I'm too fucking lazy to leave bed to find a trashcan or toilet etc. \n\n\\- Cracked lips.\n\n\\- Stained clothes.\n\n\\- The taste of regurgitation. \n\n\\- The gooey toothbrush after using it as a gagging utensil because your fingers can no longer reach far enough. \n\n\\- Teeth stains. \n\n\\- The sticky hands after an episode.\n\n\\- The overall feeling after it's all said and done. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR;** Compilation of little things that remind me that EDs are fucking disgusting and I have to cut this shit out. Living alone with an ED is hard when you never have guests or motivation to clean.",
