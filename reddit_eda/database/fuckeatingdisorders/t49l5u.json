  "selftext": "Two days ago I weighed myself after feast eating, honouring my hunger, however you want to call it, and freaked the fuck out (it was just water weight, btw, but I\u2019m dumb). I made the mistake of ranting to my mom, who had noticed I was eating sweets the day before. So, she replied \u201cjust lay off the sugar, you\u2019re eating too much\u201d. I can\u2019t get those words off my mind, yesterday I restricted and today my mom told me she\u2019s not going to keep junk food in the house anymore. I feel guilty as shit",

I'm sure she thinks she's helping, but she doesn't understand ED and carries a lot of the misconceptions most people do around what makes us sick. Unfortunately bringing those misconceptions into your home can really undermine your recovery, and you're going to need to draw some boundaries with her. I would slide some materials her way, maybe just send her some links to websites you think have good and helpful explanations so she can begin to understand why, if she wants to help, demonizing foods and telling you to \"eat less\" is the opposite of helping. The problem isn't the food. The problem is the compulsive need to control and restrict in order to feel ok - and the overwhelming fear of what will happen to our bodies if we're not controlling and restricting that is terrorizing our lives. \n\nMaybe start by saying, \"you know Mom, I've been thinking about what you said about keeping junk food out of the house and I think what might actually be more helpful than removing the food from the house, is removing the SCALE from the house.\" I found it really helpful to stress to my family that my recovery goals were not about my weight in any way, but about healing my relationship to food so I can eat when I'm hungry and not be stressed around meals. Fixating on my weight as it fluctuated in recovery was not only not helpful, but was a huge obstacle to making the right choices for my health.",

I\u2019m putting my health and well being above everybody\u2019s opinions because this body is mine, not theirs. \nI know It\u2019s hard to just get up and ignore those kinds of people, but I\u2019ve found a healthy support system within my friend group or even communities like this, so always focus on people who see you as a person, not just a body to be marketed. Honour your hunger and your cravings, it is your body that does so much for you to keep you going on the daily basis and you only get it once",

If I had one penny for every time someone told me \u201cdiet & exercise will cure your ED, just eat healthy and work out all the time!!\u201d I\u2019d own a goddamn planet by now. Our relationships with food are not in line with diet culture\u2019s calls for restriction of any kind, nor its food guilt or shaming. Even if your mom means well, she doesn\u2019t have the background knowledge to advise in a way that\u2019s helpful, and that\u2019s a best case scenario. I say just totally ignore her and focus on what your body actually wants and needs. She has no way of knowing what will help right now because she doesn\u2019t understand what you\u2019re sick with, even if she raised you and fed you before you were sick.

I understand you, my mom knows about my ED, she knows how it affected me, but whenever I get triggered and tell her about it, her solution is always weight loss, even though my weight gain was due to Cushing's Syndrome as well (elevated cortisol), so it is not even physiologically possible for me to lose weight. And I don't even want to, because I'm in recovery and because weight loss is against all my values. If I tell her about how people talking about calories make me want to restrict and hyperfocus on calories, she tells me that I don't have to do it, I just have to eat less. Like it is not the same fucking thing. Why don't people understand that you can't solve a problem with the cause of the problem?",
