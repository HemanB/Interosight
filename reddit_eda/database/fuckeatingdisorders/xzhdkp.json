  "selftext": "the first time i went inpatient, we were not allowed to eat above our meal plan and the nurses and dieticians would be so rude and mean whenever i told them that i am hungry and neeeed more food. \nand eventhough the second treatment center i went to was wayyyy better, they never taught us anything about extreme hunger and my dietitian was super confused when i told her that i am starving an hour after ever meal. \n\nmy sister told me that her dietitians would always gaslight her and tell her that she can\u2019t be hungry, because she already has a high meal plan etc. \n\nbut on ed spaces on social media it is such a big topic and everyone seems to know about it. i was wondering if anyone knows why that is? i mean, anorexia has always been a common disease so it can\u2019t be a new phenomenon, right? \n\nthe thing that annoys me the most is that my ed is trying to use this as an excuse to not eat\nand it makes things so so so much harder. :(",

They\u2019re literally trained to discourage eating and [tOo MuCh] weight gain. But this isn\u2019t just an ED recovery issue\u2014it\u2019s a nutritional and dietetics issue at its core. Many nutritional studies are riddled with design errors, their participant pool is often never randomized, and the collected data from these studies are almost always kept private\u2026 basically, most nutritional and weight studies are extremely biased, which is why you will see thousands of contradicting studies about this super food, or why you should avoid that food, this is the best diet to lose weight, but if you do xyz you\u2019ll gain weight, etc. A good example of harmful and fatphobic dietetics practices was released earlier this year, suggesting pretty severe restriction for those who are considered \u201coverweight\u201d by BMI standards.\n\nExtreme hunger\u2014scientifically known as *post-starvation hyperphagia*\u2014has been documented numerous times, however it contradicts everything we are told regarding CICO and weight gain/loss. When you are told that the desire to eat a lot of food is problematic and emotionally driven, it\u2019s going to lead the majority of people to assume that they have a binging problem after restriction\u2014especially if you are in a larger body. We are societally wired to fear eating a lot, without actually understanding that our bodies need quite a lot of food to function optimally every single day.\n\nTbh treatment surrounding EDs is really fucking shitty specifically due to not just a general lack of understanding, but an utter *refusal* to understand the human body as a whole. Relapse rates are so high *because* we aren\u2019t educating patients on what they\u2019re bodies are experiencing and why it\u2019s so important to honor hunger (once medically stable enough to do so, of course). It\u2019s why so many people opt to recover on their own or simply not recover at all.",

The number-based part of me wants so bad to find any equation or sense to it. I\u2019m trying to embrace the unknown and the uncalculatable though, and trust the process.
