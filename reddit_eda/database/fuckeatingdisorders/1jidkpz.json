  "selftext": "Ever since i started recovery and therapy i slowly but surely started noticing just how disordered society is now days. It took me the LONGEST time to understand that i had a severe eating disorder, all because so many things regarding weight loss, messed up diets etc. are so normalized, that it felt almost unnatural to NOT want that. I barely know anyone who doesn\u2019t sometimes mention that they should lose a little weight or they need to watch what they eat etc. and it makes me soso sad, because 9/10 times it\u2019s clearly not coming from a place of concern or actual discomfort, but almost feels like a promise that they\u2019ll try to fit the standard better so they don\u2019t have to fear people\u2019s judgement. \nTruth is- so many people do the absolute most to be something that we\u2019re clearly (naturally) not meant to be, it feels almost silly when you think about it.\nBut you don\u2019t have to let other people\u2019s internalized fears and disordered thinking determine YOUR life. \nLosing the weight of other peoples opinions was honestly the best weight i\u2019ve ever lost. \nRemember that it\u2019s HEALTHY to have a certain amount of body fat. It\u2019s NECESSARY for weight to fluctuate. It\u2019s NORMAL for bodies to change over the years. You are NOT your body & your body will NEVER determine your worth!!\nPlease know that your people love you - for sooo much more than your body or the food you eat to feel happy and energized!\n(and keep in mind that you probably don\u2019t even want those superficial people in your life anyway lol)\nLet this be your reminder that it\u2019s okay to eat your favorite food. It\u2019s okay to snack until you\u2019re happy and satisfied. It\u2019s okay to go for seconds. It\u2019s okay to want takeaways. \nEVERYTHING on this planet is so much better than a failing heart and a self destructing body, i promise.\nPlease go fuel your body, everyone deserves it!!",

When I explained that I eat all foods and consider sugar a 4th food group (lol!), they looked at me askance. This was AFTER I explained I was in recovery from Anorexia. To their disbelief I said, I'd rather eat sugar than die of an ED. It's a recovery superpower - to see Diet Culture for what it is.",
