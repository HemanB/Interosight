  "title": "I\u2019ve been wanting a meat pie from this bakery next to my apartment, so I got one, got full off half, and now the other half has been hanging out on my dining table for like 3 hours and it\u2019s not taunting me? I\u2019m not fighting myself to not eat it? Who am I",
  "selftext": "A recovery queen\n\nLol jk not even close. After giving in to my extreme hunger 2 months ago and gaining some much needed weight (still need to get to a healthy BMI but at least I\u2019m not severely UW anymore) I don\u2019t feel the need to devour the entire kitchen anymore. I haven\u2019t felt extreme hunger for like 2-3 weeks which might be too early to tell, but i absolutely forgot how being full feels so I\u2019m extremely happy that the fullness cues started coming back. I swear I never thought this day would come. I thought everyone that kept telling me \u201cextreme hunger will go\u201d was lying because I\u2019ve been hungry 24/7 for as long as I can remember. Thinking about food all the time. Dealing with my \u201cblack hole\u201d of a stomach. Practically eating every box of pastries when I\u2019m at my mom\u2019s house, so I would avoid every type of pastry because I\u2019ve accepted the fact that I couldn\u2019t control myself around them. \n\nWhat could possibly happen that I could ever not be hungry? Well obviously, giving into my damn hunger. \n\nI only got one meat pie because I was afraid of devouring the whole box had I gotten more. But I totally could have. Now my husband will come home from work asking where\u2019s his after seeing my half still there. Next time I\u2019ll grab more and try other pastries and flavors :) I\u2019m fucking ecstatic tbh",
