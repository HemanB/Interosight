  "selftext": "I like my body currently, I don\u2019t love it but I\u2019ve never loved my body and although I find myself being far more critical and getting a lot more up set when dressing every morning than I used to it\u2019s something I could deal with. However I hate literally everything that comes along with having an eating disorder, I hope none of this makes me sound like I\u2019m faking anything but I genuinely hate having to restrict, having to exercise when it hurts and doesn\u2019t feel good at all, hate having to be cold all the time, be grumpy, tired, having to withdraw from social situations, and just having a really low mood all the time. \n\nThe ED served it\u2019s purpose, sometimes it still seems to serve a purpose, but for the most part I\u2019m really over it. The only thing that really holds me back is my body. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready to look healthy again, I\u2019m think I have extreme mental hunger and I\u2019m convinced that I\u2019m just going to eat into oblivion, I\u2019m convinced that all the energy I consume is going towards solely fat gain and not also towards repairing the damage I\u2019ve clearly done after a full year of restricting and over exercising. I\u2019m scared because I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to recover into my pre-ED body, I don\u2019t know what the end point looks like. I know that part of recovery is letting go of controlling your weight and body shape, but it\u2019s still something I struggle with and have no professionals around to help me deal with these things. \n\nI struggle with the fact the last month where I was sort of recovering I found it really easy, I know it\u2019s because things that should have been challenging weren\u2019t because I listened to my ED, I restricted before and after this meals, I wouldn\u2019t allow myself to go over a restrictive calorie number and I honestly thought it was fine because I was gaining weight, but I was unhappy because as much as I wanted to just let go and eat whatever I feel guilt for finding it so easy. I\u2019m at a point where I miss food so much and I\u2019m so hungry that allowing myself to eat is a massive wave of relief, being able to go to a supermarket and pick out whatever I want and not have to hoard it under my bed for months and months is exciting and wonderful. I love food, I always have, I love cooking and baking. My whole family loves meat and I\u2019ve hated the taste and texture of most meat since I was young so I love taking the recipes my mum makes and trying to turn them into vegetarian meals. My ED hates me for admitting it but I find so much pleasure in cooking, in trying new foods, in having food because I enjoy it and not because it\u2019s a number. \n\nI wish I was motivated to recover, and that I wasn\u2019t stuck in a recover/restrict cycle which is where I am at now. I wish that my body image, and the guilt of giving up my ED and allowing myself to be kind to myself wasn\u2019t so strong, I wish that I could gain weight and not feel bad about how others would perceive me. It\u2019s all so overwhelming when I can see all o really want deep down is to not live this way anymore, I\u2019m tired and so ready to throw in the towel. I don\u2019t know why I can\u2019t.",

Honestly I think this is extremely typical of anorexia for anyone who is past the first few months of romanticizing the disorder. Think about it, no one actually likes the feeling of hunger or enjoys the process of their body breaking down or losing their relationships to fellow humans. If humans genuinely could like the feeling of starvation and medical damage and becoming isolated from others, we wouldnt have survived to this day as a species. People like exercise but when their bodies are screaming for energy and the exercise is drawing down on already-insufficient energy stores and damaging the body, they obviously do not like it. I blame mainstream portrayals of anorexia that make the disorder look effortless and quirky as if we're just eccentric dancers/models who love the condition like it's some cute little accessory.  \n\nIf you speak to people with enduring EDs, almost all of them are sick of or resigned to this kind of self-abuse, but sometimes we pick shitty conditions we feel familir living with, than to let go and not know where that lands us. It's a very human thing to do.  \n\nWhat you say about quasi-recovery where you managed to gain but still count calories, also doesnt make you fake. I could have written that part word for word too lol. EDs are not just about weight but control. Full recovery frightens me so much because of losing that feeling of control I desperately need, since I feel like I have no control over many other things in life.\n\nMy endo was actually unsurprised that I could gain weight initially from my LW. He had this vibe like he was waiting for the other shoe to drop. He's seen many patients with EDs by the way. He was far more surprised when I passed a certain weight and still managed to gain.

To me, this could mean that many patients he has seen have a level of weight gain they feel is \"acceptable\" and that they can tolerate, except that in true recovery you dont get to decide for your body exactly how much that gain is. So yeah you really arent alone or faking, many of us can gain some amount from LW until we cant/wont let ourselves. And as you say, it's easier if you still engage in the control aspect of the ED, which is why I always use \"weight restoration\" and \"recovery\" as separate terms.",

I remember the day I hit my LW I knew that I needed to change, earlier that week I had been told it was unlikely I\u2019ve make it to my 18th birthday if I continued on the path I was going (which in a few weeks at that time, also I did make it and I\u2019m forever grateful and proud of myself for that). It\u2019s easy to forget that weight restoration and being able to maintain a healthy weight is not the end goal of recovery, it\u2019s really just one of the first major goals, especially when my treatment team was so focused on numbers and weight before I had to quit treatment for various reasons. I hope things will get easier, for both of us. I hope that one day we can both find peace within ourselves and our bodies.

I was with adolescent services in my area for 4 months, but they refused to offer me therapy as I wasn\u2019t weight restored, and because I was so close to turning 18. When I turned 18 a month ago adult services offered to see me, but I was labelled as \u201cdifficult to work with\u201d and \u201cnon-complaint\u201d as I refused to work with them and all their rules around weight gain. I was told that I would have to weigh myself every week because of COVID, being weighed in general was a massive trigger to the point where my adolescences team stopped making me have weigh ins because the only time I was able to increase the amount I was eating was when I didn\u2019t have to go in for a weigh in. I was told that I had to gain x amount of weight every week and if I didn\u2019t then I would be at risk of losing appointments with my therapist and possibly being asked to leave the program. Plus a bunch of other rules that made zero sense to me and made me feel uncomfortable about my care. \n\nI could pay to go private, but finding a therapist would works with EDs is really hard and I\u2019m currently unemployed due to my mental health so can\u2019t really afford it.

Just full out sobbing near a group rushing their final projects. My mind broke through the fog again and was like yo this some screwed up shit lol. \n\nHonestly, i've asked people who have maintained dangerously low weights for years, if this sort of angst and suffering and desire for change ever goes away. If they ever stopped caring about everything they lost to their ED and accept it. To my surprise, they said no. Not unless they felt like they were moments from death so truly nothing can be done. Otherwise, they still had moments of hoping they could be stronger and change things. They still had moments of grief and anger over what they lost. It showed me that, yeah most ED people have a weight they cant sustain and they decide to gain a controlled amt of weight from there, but even for those who long term maintain very low weights, they have moments of sanity and grief and desperating wanting to change, because human hope and human desire for survival is that strong. The idea that they always love their ED and how it makes them skinny and that they entirely accept the costs of that ED- that's the fake part.",

I remember the day I hit my LW I knew that I needed to change, earlier that week I had been told it was unlikely I\u2019ve make it to my 18th birthday if I continued on the path I was going (which in a few weeks at that time, also I did make it and I\u2019m forever grateful and proud of myself for that). It\u2019s easy to forget that weight restoration and being able to maintain a healthy weight is not the end goal of recovery, it\u2019s really just one of the first major goals, especially when my treatment team was so focused on numbers and weight before I had to quit treatment for various reasons. I hope things will get easier, for both of us. I hope that one day we can both find peace within ourselves and our bodies. Thank you again, I\u2019m so glad that I was given the opportunity to read this and wish you the best.",
