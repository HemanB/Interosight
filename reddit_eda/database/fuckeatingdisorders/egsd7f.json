  "title": "A list of the worst things my eating disorder made me do",
  "selftext": "So, I've been dealing with restricitve behaviour since the beginning of january this year, which slowly spiraled into horrible binge and restrict cycles and bulimia. As I started out overweight and haven't lost 'too much' weight because of not constantly restricitng, I don't look thin or like I have an eating disorder. The fact that I don't look like it and my diorder is invisible to everyone sometimes makes me feel like I'm not sick and forget about all the horrible things I've done and went through. I decided to somehow validate that yes there is definitly something wrong with me and this is not normal behaviour. Also to look back on and motivate me to not end up in those dark places again, as I'm trying my hardest to recover. Here we go.\n\n\\- went for a walk with my brother and we ate some apples picked straight from the tree which were delicious but I wasn't supposed to eat that afternoon so I spend the rest of the day crying in my bed - because i ate an apple??!\n\n\\- accepted some of my coworkers homemade cookies just to secretly throw them away a few seconds later, then proceeded to steal and eat like six more later when she left the box unattended\n\n\\- canceling plans with my then boyfriend all the time because i knew it would involve food\n\n\\- refusing to even let him hug me because I couldn't bear being touched and he would feel how fat I had gotten\n\n\\- breaking up with said boyfriend (over text because I am a horrible person) because I was in a horrible mental place and couldn't deal with the added stress of trying to maintain a relationship\n\n\\- eating an entire pack of sliced bread that was supposed to last my whole (finiancially unstable) family a week while my mom was with me in the kitchen yelling at me that I was just doing all of this to get back at her and make her life even worse (because sure mom, me literally destroying my body and being depressed and self harming for years is all about you, everything is just always about you, isn't it?)\n\n\\- not being able to make myself throw up with my finger when I first started purging, so I used my sisters' disposable razor and put it back afterwards WTF\n\n\\- being late to work because I went to  buy binge food \n\n\\- missing my last bus home because I went to the gas station to buy some chocolate and having to call my mum to pick me up in the middle of the night\n\n\\- binging on expired, already sorted out food in my work places stockroom, literally shoving disgusting stale chocolate down my throat while crouching in a corner, then hiding the empty wrappers under my shirt to throw away somewhere later to not raise suspicion\n\n\\- smuggling some of this expired food out of work to binge on later in a public bathroom\n\n\\- missing so much worktime because I was busy purging on the toilet (but my coworkers get cigarette breaks so its fine, right?)\n\n\\- stealing food that was clearly labeled with a name from our work places fridge and eating it hidden in the bathroom, generally taking sooo much food that was not particularily meant for me from everywhere\n\n\\- while looking for food in this fridge,  I dropped some tupperware on the floor with food going everywhere and I scooped it up from the dirty floor, and put it back in the container... i have no words\n\n\\- starting to smoke in a desperate attempt to surpress my hunger with nicotine (spoiler alert, it didn't work)\n\n\\- purging in the forest near my house in the freezing cold because I didn't want my family to hear me\n\n\\- using the sleeve of my jacket to clean up the vomit, snot and tears from my face and continuing to wear that same jacket for the rest of the day\n\n\\- being secretly happy when there's a stomach virus going around, because I want to catch it so I have an excuse to not eat and throw up\n\n\\- eating all the chocolate that was supposed to be a present for my sister\n\n\\- when i first went vegan, my sister went out of her way to get me some vegan sweets for my birthday and i felt like the worst person because just the day before, I binged on a shit load of non-vegan food because in \"binge-mode\" I just didn't give a fuck about the animals for a second\n\n\\- going on really long walks (4 hours+) with my brother, but not to spend time with him, just to burn calories and being a cranky, moody asshole the whole time because I hadn't eaten in forever\n\n\\- refusing to eat anything my mum cooked because she uses too much oil and \"unhealthy\" ingredients\n\n\\- ghosting my best friend and basically ruining our friendship because I just wanted to be alone and couldn't bear to explain what was going on \n\n\\- being stupidly proud of fitting in my sisters jeans when I secretly tried them on because I finally wasn't the fat one anymore\n\n\\- giving all the sweets I got as presents to my brother which is a shitty thing to do because he is overweight and has his own struggles with food and I shouldn't encourage him even more\n\n\\- forcing myself to go running, then tripping over a root in the forest and spraining my ankle which meant I couldn't run anymore for months\n\n\\- getting up in the middle of the night and binging on tons and tons of plain sliced bread, just sitting there alone in the kitchen in just my underwear, feeling so fucking disgusting\n\n\\- baking a cake and eating the entire thing myself later in the day, and yes it was fucking awkward to explain where the cake went that my whole family watched me make and was waiting to eat\n\nSo yeah, these are some of the shitty things that I did this year. I most definitly forgot about some specific things, but honestly, most of the last months are just a blur in my head, and lots of it feels far away and unreal, like it happened to a different person. As you can probably guess, I am more than ready to leave all of this mess behind and try my best to regain a normal relationship with food again, because it's just not worth it. If loosing weight means I lose myself and my values and become a horrible person in the process, then I guess I'll never be skinny. I don't know why I just confessed all of this shit to the entire internet, but it actually feels really good to get this of much chest, some of which I've not told a single person in my life and I am ready to keep fighting!",

You've probably heard this a million times and I myself am still having trouble to come to terms with it, but I really think the only way to stop this stupid cycle is to stop restricting and eating intuitivly, like actually responding to your hunger and how certain foods make you feel and not completely illiminating any \"bad\" foods. Of course this isn't going to magically fix anything overnight and I still am at the very beginning of recovery, but it definitly helped me gain some sanity back and allowed me to be (slightly) less obsessive about food. Maybe you can try to make this journey less about losing weight and the way your body looks and more about the way you feel in it?
