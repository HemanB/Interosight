  "selftext": "How to NOT FUCKING RELAPSE\n\n- NO FUCKING STEP COUNTING OMG bane of my existence. I do NOT need to walk 15k a day. \n- Hunger cues ARNT A FUCKING SUGGESTION. It\u2019s not \u201cfake hunger\u201d. That\u2019s bs my ED tries to tell me. But it\u2019s fucking bs. My body needs food so listen to it!!\n- SATIETY CUES aren\u2019t fucking suggestions. No \u201coh eat till you\u2019re 80% full\u201d bs.\n- If thoughts come back 3 MEALS AND 3 SNACKS no questions asked. \n- NO GOOD OR BAD FOODS. If I\u2019m craving something JUST FUCKING EAT IT. It\u2019s not scary. It\u2019s literally just food. If my friends are eating something just for enjoyment I CAN TOO. I don\u2019t have to be starving to deserve to eat. \n- FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THINGS HOLY DO NOT STEP ON THE SCALE. No number would make me happy. It\u2019s always gonna be too high and never too low. \n- STOP BODYCHECKING. My biggest addiction. When I notice myself body checking step away from the mirror. Stop doing the stupid wrist checks and so on it\u2019s so fucking stupid it literally has zero impact on who I am as a person. \n- REMEMBER WHAT RECOVERY FEELS LIKE. Finally being free from the obsession is such a relief. I can finally enjoy what I love. I can be present in the moment instead of obsessing over stupid fucking thoughts. Also remember how hard recovery was. \n- STOP buying into the \u201chealthy eating\u201d and \u201cexercise is good for mental health\u201d shit. Yes it\u2019s good for people WHO ARENT IN RECOVERY. For me it always causes relapse. You know what\u2019s healthy? NOT FUCKING RELAPSING. \n- Should probably start therapy to work on all the bs that led me to this illness in the first place. I\u2019ve already dealt with this shit for two years I\u2019m not going to waste another two. Even if that means not liking my body. Because guess what? I\u2019ve always fucking hated it. No matter what I look like. Because I\u2019m a perfectionist at heart and the truth is there\u2019s no such thing as a \u201cperfect\u201d body. If I was on a deserted island I wouldn\u2019t give a flying shit what my body looks like. It\u2019s only because of society\u2019s bs standards that I do. \n",

Even after gaining it back, I was still malnourished because I was not getting enough of all of the vitamins and minerals.\n\nA blood test from your doctor (or if you are in the US,  you can order one yourself,  just do a websearch for blood test iron panel without a doctor's order) can tell you if your iron levels are normal or low or high.\n\nIf you are low or low- normal on iron, it's likely that you are low on other things too, like choline, B-vitamins, zinc,  selenium,  and more.\n\nOne way to see if you get the rdi of nutrients from food is to log a day's food on [myfooddata.com](http://myfooddata.com)\n\nI don't do that every day,  but when I try it once in a while,  I can start to see patterns for what I tend to fall short on. For me it's usually vitamin C (surprising because I love fruits and veggies-- I just don't always get to eat as much of them as I'd like), at least one or two of the b vitamins, although different ones each day, choline, iodine, often selenium.\n\nPlus I suspect that I don't absorb iron or zinc all that well, and my copper intake is high (usually about 300% rdi) and zinc and copper are needed to balance each other, I take supplements to make up for all of this (b-complex, vitamin C, vitamin D,  iron, and soy lecithin granules in the morning,  zinc at night)\n\nNutritional deficiencies can definitely lead to weaker hair, nails, and skin, as well as trouble with moods and anxiety (I had trouble with all of these)",

You will be much happier in the long term trust me. Even if your weight is above a \u201cnormal\u201d bmi that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not healthy or beautiful. BMI is bullshit. Trust me everything will end up ok :)",
