  "title": "Not caring about calories anymore makes me feel like I learned how to fly",
  "selftext": "This is going to sound silly but since I made progress in my recovery I think calories truly mean nothing to me anymore. Sure old habits die hard so I check some things from time to time but the absolutely smothering, suffocating obsession with calories that literally dragged me down, made me feel anxious and in total despair all the time ... it\u2019s finally gone. I feel so weightless, like I can fly. I just let go and now I\u2019m floating with a bunch of balloons in the air and I can breathe...\n\nI know it\u2019s not always going to be so easy. I struggle with weight gain and my body changing. But now when I look at old pictures of me at my LW I don\u2019t see body goals or thinspo, I see my tired, sad eyes. I tortured myself and I am so sorry... the only thing I can do to make this right is to keep fighting and be kind to myself.\n\nWhen I see people on diets or counting calories I feel sad and sorry for them - but I also feel relief because I am not wearing these chains anymore.",
