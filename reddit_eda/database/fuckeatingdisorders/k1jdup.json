When you're in the height of it it is unbearable, it's all you can think about it consumes your every thought. Like the spray, it's soooo strong. But recovery is like taking the baths to wash it off. For some it takes fewer baths to get rid of the smell, some more. The thing about being sprayed by a skunk is you can get phantom smells of it later (even if you got all the oils off) and the experience is embedded in your brain. In other words it sticks with you years later. But it's nothing like how it was when you first got sprayed, it's a memory something you observe (ex. \"Oh, I smell skunk\" is like \" hey, that once triggered me years ago, these are the thoughts I used to have, hmmmm interesting.\") \n\nThere are soooo many more vectors/layers to EDs and mental health (like hormones, environment, drugs, other mental health problems etc...) But knowledge and growth in yourself is a weapon against it and when you get stuck in the black and white thinking of recovered vs. not, you miss everything that could help you. \n\nPlease, take a big breath, envision that mental stop sign, get off the cyclical thinking rollercoaster and talk to someone you trust/mental health professional. There is soooo much to live for. Please, please, please.",

It's getting more normal, and the longer I have the easier it is to decide to live freely. It's harder in the short term to make that choice, it can be uncomfortable, but it's so fucking worth it. What's getting easier is the willingness to choose to live a life without my ED in any way. I guess every day I get to choose, the more time I get the more automatic that feels that I just am becoming this weird foreign person who is able to feel and cope with their feelings more and more\n\nI really hope this brings you some hope dude.

When you're in the height of it it is unbearable, it's all you can think about it consumes your every thought. Like the spray, it's soooo strong. But recovery is like taking the baths to wash it off. For some it takes fewer baths to get rid of the smell, some more. The thing about being sprayed by a skunk is you can get phantom smells of it later (even if you got all the oils off) and the experience is embedded in your brain. In other words it sticks with you years later. But it's nothing like how it was when you first got sprayed, it's a memory something you observe (ex. \"Oh, I smell skunk\" is like \" hey, that once triggered me years ago, these are the thoughts I used to have, hmmmm interesting.\") \n\nThere are soooo many more vectors/layers to EDs and mental health (like hormones, environment, drugs, other mental health problems etc...) But knowledge and growth in yourself is a weapon against it and when you get stuck in the black and white thinking of recovered vs. not, you miss everything that could help you. \n\nPlease, take a big breath, envision that mental stop sign, get off the cyclical thinking rollercoaster and talk to someone you trust/mental health professional. There is soooo much to live for. Please, please, please.",
