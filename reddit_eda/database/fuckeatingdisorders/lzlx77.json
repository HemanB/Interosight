  "title": "Trigger warning! Ed death, and it's consequences on others.",
  "selftext": "Trigger warning: ED death and it's triggering consequences. I just need to talk. But please don't read further if it could trigger you. That's the last thing I want from this.\n\n*A little background: I grew up with an ED-NOS mom with periods of anorexia and bulimia. I was a chubby kid and started my EDs in my late teens. I sought help at 22, and never stopped... NEVER STOPPED getting professional help.\n\nI NEVER wanted to lose my life or quality of life to these diseases. It's robbed me of almost everything. But I have ALWAYS refused to give it my life.\n\nI will never stop going to treatment until I'm old. I will always be in some stage of recovery. Even if I were to become anorexic again, I'd do it under the watchful eye of an outpatient team to prevent my heart or brain or other organs from going. I would never refuse supplements or testing or therapy. But here I am now. In some sort of never- ending limbo of Ed-NOS/recovery dance for years and years.\n\nI'm currently 42 ED-NOS, and \"obese\" (same set point for 10 years but I've been ED-NOS with a little bit of every ED ruining my metabolism and doing too much overeating) but 20 years ago I was a seriously ill purging-anorexic who bounced between inpatient, residential, partial, day treatment, and outpatient.\n\nI eventually gave up anorexia as I have been borderline recovering for the last 22 years and try to eat every day at least one good meal. I haven't been inpatient or in residential in about 10 years since I was intensely bulimic but I have been in and out of other treatments ever since. I'm probably about to go into partial again due to my currently chaotic rapidly cycling ED behaviors and depression post-covid recovery if insurance will cover (I had Mono-like fatigue for 6 months after Covid infection).\n\nMy life now is that I've been on SSDI (social security disability) with Medicare since a long inpatient/residential stint in 2011. I was immediately approved by a state board instead of the drawn-out federal decision making body because of how long I had been institutionalized. I had even become homeless at one point because my parents wouldn't enable me anymore. So thank God for SSDI.\n\nSo now I'm going to be 43 next month. I work part-time and get my SSDI to pay for my apartment with my pets. I'm not married, no kids... no career, not even my college degree... I had to drop out a year shy. I have none of those things because I gave into E.D.'s voice before I was even an adult.\n\nPLEASE DON'T BECOME ME. JUST NEEDED TO SAY THAT.\n\n\nWhich brings me to today's need to talk.\n\nI was being dumb and watching an Intervention episode on an anorexic I think to thinspo myself into fasting for the weekend (I've been doing some long fasting again). Anyway, the girl reminded me of my best friend in the longest inpatient/ residential stint I had at 23. It was for about 9 months bouncing around. But the constant was my friend \"A\".\n\nI loved her very dearly, but not at first. She was so sick coming from a medical facility to our inpatient unit that she was still the lowest weight on the unit and it triggered EVERYONE.\n\nShe was much more sick than any of us. I, too, was triggered as I was at my low-weight and honestly my body would have given out wayyy before she had gotten to her \"stable-enough\" weight that let her get into our unit from a medical hospital. She had already put on 20 lbs. I mean to this day I don't know how she was even alive then.\n\nTime goes on. She becomes my best friend. And we're the same age! Similar dreams and desires! I leave the hospital and I bounce to and from various facilities with some relapsing and we ended up in residential at the same time together 6 months later since she finally got out of inpatient, and I was coming back and then we were moved to residential around the same time.\n\nShe was my roommate and bathroom buddy. We were always together. I truly thought she was working recovery. We helped each other distract from after-meals and ignored the unit drama together. She was being tube fed on the residential unit because she was still quite underweight. They would kangaroo feed her while we slept.\n\nI slowly restored weight and looking back at my discharge photo I have never looked healthier or happier. My skin glowed, my hair was shiny and thick, my eyes were bright with happiness, hopes, dreams, and the ability to FEEL my life.\n\nUnfortunately right before that picture was taken, my best friend betrayed herself, me, and our entire unit. She was using a lot of tricks I won't repeat, but she took advantage of me to do some of them unbeknownst to me. The staff was on to her the whole time due to her lack of weight restoration and some loss, and she was kicked out of residential. She did come clean at the end. I was very hurt and just so very sad. I knew then that we were very very different...\n\nI was never going to let myself die directly from these diseases but she would. I knew she would. This was her third serious treatment and her parents had sold their house.\n\nI tried to maintain contact. I loved her so so much. More than anyone I've been in treatment with before or since. But when I got home and was trying to work my recovery and she was merely dabbling at it, it was way too triggering to talk to her.\n\nI eventually told her all this and she understood. I loved her to the moon and back but for my own safety I couldn't maintain contact unless she was working in a professional treatment of some sort.\n\nI never talked to her much more again. I always wanted to get back in touch, but having recovery be so borderline for me for so long, I never felt strong enough to reconnect. I was also even MORE SO afraid to find out she had passed away from ED. She was always holding the Grim Reaper's hand with her sickly fingers, and everyone could see it. Her parents had accepted her death awhile ago. She had a sibling with children and people she loved that she wanted to see grow up, but she couldn't stop. Just could never stop.\n\nI emailed her today, I still had that in my phone. I decided that if my yearly obituary search hasn't found anything yet that it was actually safe to say she HAD gotten better. It finally occurred to me that she couldn't be borderline sick for all these years without dying. We're just too old for our bodies to handle that at our ages. So she was probably doing well!\n\nI emailed her and then did a name search. I figured I might find something about her becoming a teacher or at least living on Social Security like me at home enjoying time with her nieces, and nephews and enjoying some kind of valuable life. At least we would have each other to understand the life- long struggles. Realizing it's getting too late to have kids thanks to this fucking disease.\n\nWell, I guess I had been spelling her name wrong (I had gotten rid of her contact info after I had to cut off contact).\n\nWell... I found her obituary today and saw a photo of her headstone. She died in 2011. I called the funeral home and it was MY 'A' and she did die from anorexia. I'm going to write to her family via the funeral home, but I can't go to her funeral and I never said goodbye.\n\nShe died the year I went from homeless back to residential, giving up two dogs that I loved like children because I had no other choice. The year the government formally decided I was too sick to work probably ever work again because I lost too many jobs (from fainting at work or \"borrowing money\" to get food because I wouldn't bring any with me on my week long fasts and I broke down, to just too many sick days.)\n\nI guess it's a small blessing I didn't find out that year. We were both 33. I was clinging to life and she was already gone.\n\nBut today is not a good day either. I was already on the admit list to ED partial or mental health partial if I don't qualify due to insurance (I was denied last week for ED partial and refused MH partial).\n\nI am trying to stay out of treatment desperately. I never thought I'd go again. But getting my own place 2 years ago and then going though the stress of Covid has messed me up. (There is a theory that it has caused brain inflammation affecting my mental health besides the fatigue and shared sociatal depression).\n\nAnyway, I had a panic attack after I got off the phone with the funeral director and called the ED clinic and talked to the MD on call. She is going to touch base with my therapist.\n\nI don't know what happens to me now.\n\nDo I give in to temptation because fuck it? Do In let myself get sicker so I can qualify for treatment? Obviously I'll keep fighting but that's my ED screaming right now. \n\nI probably need at least MH at this point but who knows.\n\nI feel like I'm about to go to anorexia all over again. I can't be pushed into treatment \"right now\" since I don't qualify, I could lose some weight, and I could feel that HIGH we get, PLUS I can take a break from the stress of eating as much as I make myself. I can take fasting vacations and restrict and not deal with the stress of eating, overeating, or purging. I can just do nothing.\n\nAnd that's where I'm at. Today was not a good day in my recovery to find out I lost her.\n\nPLEASE DON'T DIE. EVEN THAT IS FUCKING TRIGGERING.\n\nIf you read all that, sorry it was so disjointed and awkward... I'm on a lot of Klonopin (Dr let me have extra) and I'm writing on mobile so it's not edited. Normally it'd be better written but you get the gist.\n\nJust... if you are younger. Please don't die at 33 or look back at your life at 42 and realize this has taken everything from you.\n\nJust fucking get better.\n\nThat's all.\n\nI'll update once I find out what's going to happen to me.",

But today really is a much better day. \n\nI took my puppy to the dog park, opened the windows in the apt, and having been enjoying the fresh air and sunshine.  I think I really needed that. I'm gonna take a little nap with my pets and wake up and try to eat a good lunch... for 'A'.\n\nIt would make her sad to know that she triggered me in any way.  But it was the depression and grief talking and how do we deal with negative emotions?... stupid ED. Well fuck that voice and this disease...\n\nI'm gonna fight today. \n\nLove all that responded! And thank you so much for your thoughtful post!  \ud83d\udc95",
