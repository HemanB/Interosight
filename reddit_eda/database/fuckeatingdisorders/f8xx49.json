  "selftext": "I've (24f) been suffering from an eating disorder for almost 14 years. It started out as anorexia, then bulimia, and, the most recent relapse (~2 years), anorexia purge-type. \n\nLast October, I quit purging cold tofurkey. I was having constant chest pains, my teeth were starting to look awful, and my stomach was M.I.S.E.R.A.B.L.E. I couldn't eat ANYTHING without the worst bloat and stomach pains. \n\nThings slowly started to get better after I quit purging, I noticed my teeth looking much better and getting whiter, chest pains were subsiding, and I was generally feeling *slightly* better (still feeling shitty because of restricting). \n\nOn Friday, my bf and I had our normal pizza dinner. When I'm with him (weekends) I eat semi-normally, and I was pretty excited cuz... Ya girl loves pizza. But what typically comes with eating pizza? That's right! Severe bloating, pain, constipation, and feeling like death. Except...\n\nI didn't feel any of that. No bloating. No pain. No constipation. No gas. Nothing! I felt *normal*. I thought this was a fluke. I *always* have pain when I eat! I *always* bloat! This was the world playing tricks on me!\n\nThe next day, I ate pretty normally again and, once again, no pain, no bloat, no gas, just *normal*. \n\nY'all. I'm *finally* seeing progress! I don't have to be terrified of the pain of food in my stomach! I don't look like I'm 5 months pregnant after eating an apple! \n\nI could cry!",

When you look at the big picture during recovery, all you can see is the end result and it's so frustrating when it's not instant relief. But when you focus on the little bits of progression as time goes on, you get little boosts of inspiration :) \n\nMake sure you take probiotics (gummy ones are the best, they're easier on the stomach!) and other vitamins to help ease recovery pains!",
