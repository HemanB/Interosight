  "title": "Fuck my dad for giving my mother shit about weight gain while she had cancer",
  "selftext": "The first time my mother got cancer, I was 11 and settling in to some of my foundational ED behaviors. She went for chemo and she was one the rarer ones who gained weight during treatment instead of dropping it like a stone. *I remember this being a big deal in my family.*\n\nWhat the fuck, guys? The woman's got goddamn *cancer* and my dad's still resentful of her weight gain. She'd had binge eating disorder prior to this and would for the remainder of her life. \n\nDon't get me wrong, she's no saint, but that man made weight and eating and dieting a fucking thorn in my side from early, early childhood. My grandfather was even worse.\n\nFuck them. Fuck him for dehumanizing my mother for gaining weight while she was doing the things you do to, y'know, not die from cancer. Fuck these people. We deserve better.",

He started doing weird cleanses and tried all this extreme orthorexic stuff before he actually allowed doctors to get involved. Those treatments and IVs alone can make a person very puffy and to give a single fuck about somebody\u2019s weight or appearance when they are so ill is really wrong. I\u2019m sorry that happened and I\u2019m sorry you were so young.",
