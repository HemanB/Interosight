  "selftext": "TW: Mentioning of numbers (dieting-related)\n\nIdk if anyone keeps up with this stuff. Personally, I love looking at the outfits and whatnot.\n\nAnyway, Kim wore Marilyn Monroe's \"Happy Birthday\" dress and was interviewed about it. Turns out she lost 16 lbs in 3 weeks to fit the dress. And she proudly said as if it's an accomplishment. I don't think the interviewer even asked about it, she just interjected with this bullshit. Like, I don't give a shit if you lose weight to fit a dress, that's your choice whatever. But to say it with such pride to the public?? That's fucked up.\n\nLili Reinhardt though called her out on it over her IG stories, thank God for her.",
