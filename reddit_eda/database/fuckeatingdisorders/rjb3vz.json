  "selftext": "One thing that terrified me about recovery was my \u2018insatiable\u2019 appetite. I\u2019d eat copious amounts of voluminous low calorie meals like fat free yogurts, cereals with almond milk and vegetables with lean proteins. I thought to myself, this is normal eating why am i eating so much compared to everyone else? \n\nAfter experimenting with cooking and incorporating in foods i actually WANTED , rich chicken pot pies, cookies, pasta dishes and more desserts i discovered, volume wise i actually don\u2019t need that much food when i eat what my body actually wants and needs - calorically dense satisfying foods.\n\nAnd now eatings not such drama - i leave meals no longer wanting and i actually feel good about myself - because the foods i want to eat, others want to eat too because ykno they\u2019re tasty so eating is much more social and i feel so much less alone in my recovery.\n\nInitially i didn\u2019t know what i wanted and eating all these \u2018scary\u2019 foods seemed pointless because i genuinely craved my safe foods and felt like i was missing them if i didn\u2019t have them every day - but the more you widen the types of food you\u2019re familiar with the fixations on certain foods seem to diminish because you teach your brain they aren\u2019t the only source of sustenance and all around us is an abundance of food and none of it is off limits!",
