I can really only speak to ig, I'm not that active in using tt. imo, most of those ppl aren't fostering positivity, most of the content I see either strikes me as performative or ppl in (at best) quasi recovery and posting triggering bs. \nthere are 2 ppl (the grand total) in recovery from an/restrictive eds who I follow and actually find helpful/comforting as I try to recover myself. \nfrankly, wieiads feel entirely unhelpful. even if someone posts one that is a comprehensive/'normal' amount for recovery or with a goal of gaining - not to imply all of us in an recovery necessarily will be uw/need to gain - those posts still feel unnecessary. and if someone touting 'recovery' is maintaining what can be obviously determined as an uw body without change for, as you said, months on end, that's pretty damn triggering too. \npersonally I find it difficult to navigate my own early recovery completely on my own (in terms of peers/social support, etc.) but the line between supportive Internet personalities in recovery and ppl claiming recovery but doing damage is very fine. \nI can understand what you're saying about things like posting incredibly minimal wieiads or crying/struggling to eat x food, but I don't feel its my place to speak on that. if I were a 'recovery account' on ig, I would likely be doing similar - part of why I won't start a 'recovery account'. I know I'm in the minority of 'ppl who adhere to an/restrictive ed stereotypes' and I know most ppl are not benefited from that, or content around that specific experience. \nit feels like so much of these recovery communities retain much of the competitive and comparative aspects of active eds. and obv, there is more nuance than I can describe, but that's not news to anyone. \nI hear what you're saying and you're not wrong. there are very few truly positive influences in recovery communities, and a lot of bs that invalidates or triggers us in various ways.\nsorry ro ramble - just my thoughts on this.",

I also remember seeing a girl posting the difference between \"mental health\" and \"mental illness\", mental health being usual things we do to relax and feel better and mental illness, was a video of her in the hospital with IVs. And she had a lot of posts kind of saying that if you are not diagnosed with one, you don't have an ED, you're just exaggerating. It also made me doubt my ED. There are a lot of people suffering from mental disorders and a small percetage of them is hospitalized. I've been diagnosed with several disorders, but I treated all of them without hospitalization (thankfully). This message, that only very concerning forms are real disorders (and even so, not everyone with such forms will be hospitalized), is extremely harmful and will stop people from accepting that they have a problem and from reaching for help. It's invalidating and mental disorders should not be a contest. Most non-professional people should not do education on social meadia, I swear. But I also know professionals that don't do a good job, either.",
