My mom has anorexia, she almost died (went into full cardiac arrest) as a teen and now toes the line between ED and regular disordered eating\u2026 the woman eats a tiny cup of ice cream and some almonds for a day. I grew up thinking all of this was normal, as well as her literally crying to 12 year old me about how fat she was (when she has never been anywhere near overweight, especially not then). She bragged my whole childhood about not getting stretch marks from pregnancy and being 100 lbs after she had my brother. I genuinely think after 35+ years of anorexia my mom has irreparably harmed herself. She\u2019s not underweight now, but she has fucked her body so hard that at some point she will have major issues. I know this.\n\nI did not realize how it affected me til the past few years in my own recovery. I was constantly surrounded by thin=happy mentality. \n\nI\u2019ve gained weight and am considered weight restored, but i have to live with parents who make horrible comments about anything I ever put in my mouth. I know they don\u2019t mean to be psychopathic dicks, but it feels like the damage is long done at this point. I went through a long period of not even being able to eat in front of my family. I would eat at work or at 2am, that\u2019s it.\n\nThese comments may be fine as a joke for someone who doesn\u2019t have ED, but when you have ED anything can set you off. You\u2019re hyper aware of food and your body. Goddamn, even scrolling through Instagram could set me off for a long time. Not just seeing skinny bodies, but comparing mine to anyone and everyone else\u2019s.\n\nPlease know it gets better. It\u2019s something that takes tortuous time. Get the therapy, see the doctors, try to distance yourself from your family\u2014I know you live with them, and sometimes (like in my case) nothing can be done for that immediately\u2026 but time and self care will start healing this wound, no matter how unhealable it feels. It feels like pure torture when a parent is this insensitive to you\u2026 I know. The problem is with them, not you. That\u2019s the best place to start. And know success isn\u2019t linear. You will have good times and really bad ones. Ones where you just want to jump back into the worst habits. This isn\u2019t you, your body is not the problem\u2014it\u2019s just the easiest way for you to take control of the problem. But with slipping back into ED, you are hurting yourself by placing the issue on your body, the thing that keeps you alive.",
