I was absolutely suffering.\n\ndon't ever think you're faking your illness or that your not 'sick enough'. forget about what the media or society think about what an ed sufferer 'should be', you are sick and you deserve help.\n\nEDIT: I would just like to add that I used to believe I wasn't sick enough, like most people, but after a few months in recovery, I have no doubts anymore. I am sick. recovery gives you a clear, thinking mind, so when I read the diary entries I wrote when I was really suffering, it makes me cry because I am finally realising for the first time how much pain I was in. you may not believe you're suffering enough now, but one day your eyes will be open to all the pain you are living through.",

I actively told the doctor I starved myself and I was only ever diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety disorders. Not that I didn\u2019t have those too but it took me years to be able to not let my eating disorder take over my behaviour and I got zero specific help to learn that for my ED (I thankfully had CBT for depression/anxiety and managed to apply that successfully to my ED behaviours as well).\n\nLike I was hospitalised for a suicide attempt at 16, told the doctor I had started starving myself a few months before and had dropped 3.5 stone in about 3 months (this was confirmed by my mum to them and she was openly very concerned about what was clearly an eating disorder), told them I had gone a week on a single Mars bar, I honestly couldn\u2019t sleep due to the physical state my body was in from the starving, and I got nothing.

No referral, no help, just told me it was normal to feel like that and left me to it. I went through with my suicide attempt a few days later partly because I did everything people told me to (\u2018tell someone if you are suicidal and you will get help\u2019) and I literally got nothing. Why carry on and keep trying when you do everything right and still don\u2019t get anywhere? Like it was a logical decision to end my life at that point.

NHS is terrible at treating mental health disorders but eating disorders is one of the worst, because they refuse to recognise it until you\u2019re physically very unwell. Which only happens when you\u2019re far into your disorder and it\u2019s way harder to get yourself better. It\u2019s a joke.\n\nI hope you are doing better now or finally in some treatment that is helping.",

I struggled with restrictive eating/starving myself between the ages of about 16-22 (I\u2019m now nearly 30) but I was never diagnosed with an eating disorder due to my BMI hovering around 18.5 at its lowest. I actively told the doctor I starved myself and I was only ever diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety disorders. Not that I didn\u2019t have those too but it took me years to be able to not let my eating disorder take over my behaviour and I got zero specific help to learn that for my ED (I thankfully had CBT for depression/anxiety and managed to apply that successfully to my ED behaviours as well).\n\nLike I was hospitalised for a suicide attempt at 16, told the doctor I had started starving myself a few months before and had dropped 3.5 stone in about 3 months (this was confirmed by my mum to them and she was openly very concerned about what was clearly an eating disorder), told them I had gone a week on a single Mars bar, I honestly couldn\u2019t sleep due to the physical state my body was in from the starving, and I got nothing. Literally got \u2018well you\u2019re not really underweight so that okay\u2019. When I was IN HOSPITAL for a serious suicide attempt and outright telling them I lost a crazy amount of weight really quickly and was really struggling with starving myself/hating my body.\n\nThey wait until you\u2019re physically shutting down to help and then shocked Pikachu face everywhere when recovery from eating disorders turns out to be super slow/hard work for patients and relapse is a really high risk. Like idk call me crazy but maybe people find recovery extremely difficult cos you don\u2019t diagnose and therefore treat people until they are extremely deep into their disorder. Maybe recovery rates would be better if you actually intervened at an early point and when people are reporting these behaviours/thoughts rather than going \u2018nah your body is not damaged enough yet\u2019 and then suddenly going \u2018OMG your body is dying quick you need sectioning and a feeding tube!!\u2019\n\nLike it blows my fucking mind and makes me angry like nothing else.",
