  "selftext": "I\u2019m two years in and my weight hasn\u2019t really shifted at all since i weight restored. While I don\u2019t really care, I have noticed people saying that it will redistribute with time\u2026 and while that\u2019s a nice notion, we don\u2019t actually know if that will happen to every single individual. I look absolutely *nothing* like I did preED despite weight restoring a year ago; a lot of the weight still sits around my stomach and back, and my arms and legs look chunky like that of a toddler\u2019s.\n\nI know there are others in this sub whose weight also didn\u2019t redistrubute (just not yet or never will) and idk, I feel like it\u2019s never talked about. It\u2019s just something to keep in mind because I\u2019d *hate* for someone to say \u201cyeah, it will totally redistribute!\u201d And then you\u2019re two years in like me and it hasn\u2019t even budged and you feel like you\u2019ve done something wrong.",

She definitely has some sort of ED for sure, yet refuses to acknowledge that she has done harm.\nMany girls with EDs have done all in expecting to have results like her because she promised that weight restabilizes naturally ,just like appetite, when in reality she was secretly restricting behind the scenes, photoshopping pictures and never getting better. She is constantly preaching about freedom yet all she does is take naked pictures and talk about food.\n\nI understand wanting to educate and share. But influencers have immense power and people WILL emulate them regardless of disclaimers. If she acknowledged the need for mental health support and hired a dietitian it would have been better for everyone.",
