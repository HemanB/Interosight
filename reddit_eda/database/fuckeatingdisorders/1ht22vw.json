  "title": "a reminder about extreme hunger",
  "selftext": "you are not developing bed. i have experienced both \"traditional\" binges and extreme hunger, and trust me, there is a major difference. extreme hunger is insatiable. it's eating a massive restaurant meal and your stomach feeling empty 10 minutes later. it's not being able to be functional in any way since all you can think about is food. it's a body that's essentially been through a famine begging to be fed. \n\nwhen i've binged before developing anorexia, i wasn't out of hunger. it's having a bad day and saying \"fuck it\" and powering your way through a quart of ice cream. it's emotionally driven. i would feel stuffed and sick afterwards, trying to numb any negative feelings i had.\n\nthis is going to sound blunt, but it's what i needed to hear in my recovery. imagine seeing a prisoner of war be freed and finally have access to food after being starved for a period of time. it would be genuinely insane to accuse them of developing bed if they started to eat loads. it's kinda common sense that the body needs a lot of food after being starved. there's a massive deficit to make up for.\n\nit's definitely harder than it sounds, but try to view yourself as you would other's in your situation. be gentle with yourself too, you deserve a break considering what your body has been through.",

      "body": "i think it's also important to acknowledge that not every response to extreme hunger is going to be pretty. there have been times where i also have felt this way. but if you have restricted for any length of time, \"binging\" is not a sign of bed, no matter how \"ugly\" the binge is. you also  don't have to be underweight for your body to be in a major energy deficit, so you definitely aren't \"making it up.\" \n\nwhen i find myself uncomfortable or have eaten past satiety during my extreme hunger (which has been very often) i try to be very gentle with myself. don't beat yourself up. your body is begging for food for a reason. any sort of extreme guilt or restriction of food will only make the process more difficult and drawn out. \n\ni understand it's hard to trust the process, i'm struggling with that too, but i truly believe that if you fully commit to recovery and surrender to any hunger you may have, it will one day subside. there are too many success stories out there for me not to believe that it's possible. in just my own experience, i've attempted traditional, slower forms of recovery before. sure, i gained weight during those attempts, but was still very mentally sick. with just 1 month of \"all-in\" i feel like i have shattered my eating disorder. i'm not even fully weight restored and the guilt and food noise and obsession is almost entirely gone. my fear of weight gain has decreased significantly. my relationships with friends and family have improved. i'm actually present in each moment, and not distracted by all the background noise of an eating disorder. \n\npoint is, be kind to yourself, and trust the process. whatever is on the other side, it will be better than the life an eating disorder has given you.",
