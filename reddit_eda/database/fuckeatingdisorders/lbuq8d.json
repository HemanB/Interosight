  "selftext": "\u201cThe truth is, you don't really have control--you just have anxiety. The desire for control is about safety, but you don't really feel safe in your body.\u201d\n\nHoly fuck. That\u2019s it. I keep doing the same shit that helped me survive a long time ago, but instead of just developing better coping skills I\u2019m repeating the same pattern of starvation and anything else to change my body, because there\u2019s that part of me that keeps saying, \u201cwhat happens if you aren\u2019t striving to be as small as humanly possible?\u201d And that scares the absolute fuck out of me... if I can\u2019t control my body, what do I control? I never felt safe in my body, so why do I continue with behaviors I know never make me feel safe?",
