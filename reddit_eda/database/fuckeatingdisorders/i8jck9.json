  "selftext": "I have had my 2 meals and 2 snacks today as well as I ate Chinese!!! :) I was given a really small portion to start with, had a bit of a wobble but something just snapped in me (tired of hearing the ED) and I ate until I felt truly satisfied and the ED thoughts went away to prove to my ED that I don\u2019t give a shit, I never thought I could have my meal plan and a takeaway in the same day :) \n\nI know I will feel absolutely shit later because I know my next snack is due which makes me very anxious and regretful but I\u2019ll just have to sit with the discomfort and not restrict tomorrow",

I remember the first time I nervously ate my favorite thai food during recover, I was so scared but so proud, and now I can eat anything without worrying! :) I hope you get there someday too!!!!",
