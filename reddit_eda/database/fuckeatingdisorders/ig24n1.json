  "selftext": "This might seem like a really small thing to be happy about, but hear me out!\n\nI relapsed into a pretty brutal mixture of anorexia and exercise bulimia (which I didn\u2019t know was a thing until I was diagnosed) late last year. I already have cardiac issues and in February I passed out at the wheel briefly because of said issues being made worse by my EDs. I was at a red light, thankfully, but I was still scared out of my mind. I got quarantined, and have been able to avoid driving ever since because Uni is online and all of that. \n\nBut today, for the first time since then, I was able to drive again! It was a short drive, but I missed the independence and the freedom so very much. And even better, I drove to the store to get ice cream. \n\nSo yeah, it\u2019s something really small but it carries a huge impact for me. I don\u2019t have anyone to share this celebration with so I thought I would leave this here. I feel so happy about it. Even though I\u2019m still struggling, this is a sign that things are going in the right direction and that my body has recovered some. I feel like an adult for the first time in months and I\u2019m ecstatic. I feel hopeful that I might get my life back.\n\nHang in there, everyone. I\u2019ve had disordered eating all of my life and kicking it is harder than I could describe with words. I never thought I would even make it this far, but somehow I did. Baby steps!",

It\u2019s strange but it\u2019s grounding haha. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re still able to drive! Every time you do, it\u2019s a victory! And thank you very much! :)",
