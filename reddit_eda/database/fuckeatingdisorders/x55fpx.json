Great job, you're so skinny\" or \"I know you've been feeling insecure because of your weight gain\" when I've literally not said anything and sometimes didn't even gain weight (not like it matters either way)\n\n\nMy late grandmother did the same thing. My dad and one of my brothers also regularly talk about whatever diet or weight loss trend theyre trying, so the disordered eating in my family runs deep\n\n\nIf you have a comfortable relationship with any of your family members, I'd recommend telling them that this type of speech bothers you and you don't want to hear it. You don't owe anyone an explanation as to why - if they're a decent person, they should respect that. I've had luck with saying this with friends and my sister-in-law, but not everyone has been receptive -- I'd still say it's worth a shot if you have a safe and comfortable space to do so \n\n\nI'm really sorry you're experiencing this regardless and hope that you realize that recognizing this type of speech is fucked up is a huge feat in itself, not that this makes it any better \u2661",
