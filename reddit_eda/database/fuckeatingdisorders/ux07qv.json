  "title": "Mental ED symptoms that are at least partly linked to being (chronically) hungry",
  "selftext": "From my experience, as someone who has nearly recovered but continues to slip every few weeks and then notices things like these. I still struggled with some if not most of these while eating enough but I now understand where that came from because when restricting it's so much worse.\n\n\\- Not knowing what to eat. For real! Normally I either get slight cravings or just kinda eat whatever I have at hand that sounds kinda good. When I'm starving (even when I accidentally delayed a meal for too long while genuinely trying to recover), nothing sounds good even though I desperately want something. Choices get so hard!\n\n\\- Liking every food. Although we may convince ourselves we don't like our fear foods, often everything looks appetizing. I was picky as fuck before my ED and whilst I luckily won't be like that ever again, I'm finding out there are foods that taste like shit to me, *especially* the crap I was filling up on during restriction but I also used to hate Biscoff spread as a kid, loved it in the tiny amounts I allowed during anorexia, hate it again now. \n\n\\- Wanting your food to taste perfect\n\n\\- Wanting your food to look perfect\n\n\\- Food hoarding and getting anxious when you're low on anything\n\n\\- Feeling absolutely horrible about any food waste\n\n\\- Feeling the strong urge to take and share pictures because of this ethereal thing we call food (even when it looks like shit)\n\n\\- Being intensely uncomfortable when other people see you eat\n\n\\- Having a huge interest in what other people are eating\n\n\\- Thinking other people's portions would never be enough for you, even though you are eating way less on purpose. This ties in with the way many disordered people get super upset when they see other people have starbucks coffee for breakfast or skip it altogether when, although this is not healthy at all, those people are probably not doing it for disordered reasons and probably don't feel like shit. They were just not chronically hungry. \n\n\\- Genuinely craving lots of fiber???? when really chronically hungry???? explains the oatmeal obsession of all the fake recovered influencers and a lot of people who are genuinely recovering. I had it for the longest time in recovery and still ADORE oatmeal but I will eat a different breakfast and just go on with my day. I used to feel anxiety at not eating oatmeal in the mornings during quasi even when the other breakfast I planned didn't scare me by itself. it also explains the way some of us in the depths of our ED's weren't lying when we claimed to genuinely love salads. I only started craving little to no vegetables when I was solidly into recovery. Guess it has something to do with never ever being satiated, so at least we try to be super full as a sad substitute.\n\n\\- Strangely enough: feeling the need to eat less the next meal or day\n\nof course the obvious, but I'll note some of them down for a reminder: \n\n\\- Loss of interest, concentration, emotion and creativity *for those who genuinely think they are no one without their ED. even if you have depression or other issues, I promise your ED is the main reason nothing matters to you rn. you can spontaneously develop interests in a nourished body* \n\n\\- Thinking about food\n\n\\- Watching a lot of food videos\n\n\\- Being upset when someone takes a little bit of your food \n\n\\- Not wanting to be around others; isolating yourself",
