  "selftext": "In this sub yesterday, I was asking how to tell my parents that I have an eating disorder. I was so, so nervous but I decided to just do it. My mom was extremely supportive and now she\u2019s looking into treatment options for me.\n\nHonestly, I haven\u2019t felt this relieved in years. Telling them was by far the hardest thing I have done in a long time but now I feel like a huge weight has been taken off my shoulders. I feel it\u2019s time that I can finally move on with my life and start to do all the things I couldn\u2019t do while obsessing about weight and food.\n\nI\u2019d be lying if I said a part of me wasn\u2019t guilty or ashamed of telling them, but I\u2019m choosing to be proud of myself instead. Overall, I\u2019m just so ready to move on from this chapter of my life. \n\nThank you all so much for the support you\u2019ve given me. I\u2019m so extremely grateful to everyone here.",

ED's thrive on shame, so feeling that is totally normal. But know that you are not alone and you have nothing to be ashamed of - and so much to recover for. You can do this!",
