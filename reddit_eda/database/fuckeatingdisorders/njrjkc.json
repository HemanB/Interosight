  "title": "(TW: scales and gaining) Had to weigh myself, felt neutral at the number instead of hating myself",
  "selftext": "My damn cat scared the crap out of me today by eating my toxic houseplant. I needed to know her weight to tell the vet on the pet poison control hotline, so I borrowed my super sweet neighbor\u2019s bathroom scale and weighed myself and my cat, then myself alone to subtract the weights and get the weight of my cat. \n\nI haven\u2019t weighed myself in over a year, and I even turn around at the doctors office to avoid looking at the number. I\u2019m currently struggling to recover from my second bout of anorexia, and I\u2019ve gained a very small amount of weight back over the last month, partially muscle and partially fat. I feel ok about it other than the return of my period. \n\nI\u2019m pleased to report that I felt super neutral when I saw the number on the scale. It wasn\u2019t as low as I expected it to be, which wasn\u2019t quite triggering because I know I NEED to gain weight.  \n\nAnyone else have any experiences or tips about getting over being triggered by numbers/scales?  I feel like it was a huge step for me today to not have that sinking, disgusted feeling when the number on the scale wasn\u2019t as low as my ED wants it to be.",
