  "title": "A meal is whatever the fuck you want it to be",
  "selftext": "Someone said earlier that banana bread isn\u2019t a meal. I\u2019m sorry, but who the fuck died and made you the arbiter of what is and isn\u2019t a meal? If you want banana bread for dinner, then eat the fucking banana bread. Just make sure you\u2019re actually satisfying your hunger if you do so.\n\nA meal is whatever the fuck you want it to be. Sometimes, a thing of hostess donuts and a latte is a breakfast for me. And nine times out of ten, lunch and/or dinner is a snack platter because I have ADHD and cannot commit to \u201cbalanced meals.\u201d I certainly did not follow the logic behind such a term in my own recovery\u2014am I less recovered, less healthy, because I ate what and when I wanted rather than sticking to a specific number of carbs, protein, and fats for each meal? Why does it matter if I was satisfied at the end of the day?\n\nNot to mention not everyone has the luxury of meeting whatever the fuck defines a balanced meal, anyway. Health is *also* a privilege for many. Let\u2019s not ignore these things.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that if you want a protein, carb, and fat source with every meal you\u2019re doing something wrong\u2014one or the main takeaways of recovery is to eat how you want and learn to listen to your body to the best of your ability. There is no wrong answer as long as you are challenging yourself and learning to listen to your body\u2019s needs and, yes, even its wants (once more, to the best of your ability).\n\nWe need to keep in mind that in early recovery especially, the body tends to lean more towards sugary/carb-heavy foods because they are quickly digested into energy the body *desperately* needs for repairs. And that is *okay*. Again, that doesn\u2019t mean eating other foods is discouraged (no food source should be outright discouraged, assuming it is safe for you to consume\u2014i.e., allergies, intolerances, certain health conditions, etc.), but for fuck\u2019s sake if someone is eating a lot of sugar or carb heavy foods, the last thing they need to hear is \u201cXyz isn\u2019t a meal. Eat more balanced.\u201d\n\nThe entire point is to unlearn harmful beliefs and ideals regarding food. For many of us, in early recovery at the *very* least, \u201cbalance\u201d is a synonym for restriction and control rather than a form of gentle nutrition. \n\nThanks for coming to my latest TED Talk.",

I feel like my therapist gets on my case at times when it's really uncalled for.\n\nFor instance, it's a long trip (about two or three hours depending on the connections) to therapy and back, it involves a lot of changing to different buses, and eating is not allowed on the bus. Therapy happens to end around 11 usually, and I'll be home around 2 or 3 which means that having an actual lunch is quite a challange on that day. So sometimes I'll just eat two or three date bars for \"lunch\", because that's the only nutricious thing I can shove down between buses. Then when I get home I might have something more, but then it's not lunchtime anymore, so \"I should have eaten that around 12\". \\*eyeroll\\*\n\n  \nEDIT: My therapist is really very nice, it's just that this bothers me sometimes. Because life happens, and we can only do the best we can.",

A difference in opinion doesn\u2019t mean you get to go on someone\u2019s post and tell them that banana bread isn\u2019t a complete meal and they should try for more balanced meals. Additionally, you don\u2019t really get to decide what someone else\u2019s body needs\u2014you don\u2019t know what it needs and you shouldn\u2019t pretend to know more than their own body. You only know what *your* body needs. Personally, my body *didn\u2019t* need a lot of protein, it needed a lot of carbs and sugars, as well as fat in any form. Not to mention that I still met my protein needs eating what I wanted, when I wanted in spite of not having what would be considered a complete meal. All food has macronutrients. If I\u2019m trying to force my body to have what it doesn\u2019t want, then how was I supposed to learn to trust it? \n\n*Again*, if you want to eat \u201cbalanced meals,\u201d which is extremely nuanced and vague at best, then you are free to do so, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. But why come on here and make people feel bad for doing something different than you? It\u2019s wholly unnecessary. Just don\u2019t say anything if you disagree or have a different approach to recovery, at least in the context of how you think they should be doing things.\n\nEdit: considering your post history, I can see where your current perspective stems from. You\u2019re definitely free to have those opinions regarding food and your body, but we are not going to agree on this and therefore I\u2019m not in the business of arguing, have a good day.",
