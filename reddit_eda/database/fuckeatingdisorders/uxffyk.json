  "selftext": "I recently started seeing a new therapist who specializes in eating disorder recovery. She shared this exercise where you complete the statement \u201cI want to recover, but\u2026\u201d\n\nThese are mine:\n1. I want to gain muscle and not fat (Which she reworded as, \u201cI want to control how my body looks during recovery\u201d)\n  \n2. I don\u2019t want to be eating all the time\n\n3. I don\u2019t want others to see me and think I\u2019ve let myself go\n\nI was having trouble understanding why I was struggling so much to recover, but this exercise made it a lot easier to understand my hang ups and devote attention to where it\u2019s needed. For example, tackling my deeper self-esteem issues for 1 and 3, and for 2, finding calorie-dense meal options so that overall volume is a bit less. \n\nI hope others find this helpful as well.",

Most likely, they'll tell you to talk to your GP who will refer you to someone with behavioral health and then after an intake they'll likely refer you to an eating disorder specialist who will diagnose you and determine what level of care is appropriate and then find within-network programs for you from there. If they give you a choice between several different programs (more likely you'll just go to whoever is taking new patients in-network), then do some research on the programs and see what sounds best for you. Then, you'll do an intake with the program and they'll tell you what to do from there. It might take a couple of weeks or even months, depending on your insurance company.",
