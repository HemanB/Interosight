  "selftext": "This is something I've been keeping in mind lately that I've found helpful.\n\nMy dog weighs 62 pounds.\n\nShe is *not* active.  She's a low-energy breed, spends maybe 40 minutes a day walking at a very relaxed pace and the rest of the time lying down.\n\nHer brain is smaller than a lemon, and about 1/3 the size of a human's relative to body size.  It is much less expensive to run than a human brain.\n\nWith all that in mind, my sedentary, lemon-brained dog needs to eat 1300 calories a day, minimum.\n\nThe idea that I (or you), a much larger animal with a much more energy-demanding brain, could subsist on that amount or less is profoundly ludicrous.  *Of course* I need way more food than that!  Even if I'm small and short for a human.  Even if I don't exercise.  I need more food than a lazy dog.",
