  "selftext": "I won\u2019t say that I don\u2019t feel bad at all because that would be a lie but I\u2019m proud of myself for standing my ground against my ed while waiting in the queue. \nI\u2019m currently trying to eat just normally again without these periods of undereating and overeating. I honestly have no idea how much food my body needs because I sadly got out of touch with my feeling of satiety again so I now mostly eat according to a meal plan. But today I decided to eat freely. My ed basically now can sneak in wherever it wants and already made me feel like I already ate way too much for breakfast and I can\u2019t really estimate if I did so but I stood my grounds against potential undereating and got this donut! I am beautiful the way I am!",

You deserve to enjoy delicious food, including donuts, just like anybody else. Your ED might disagree. But it was delicious and that\u2019s a wonderful thing!!",

It\u2019s good if it makes you feel good but I\u2019ll have to learn to listen to my body again. Thank you for bringing me back to that thought :)",
