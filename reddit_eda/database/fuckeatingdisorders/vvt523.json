  "selftext": "i remember going to the sushi bar with my friends when i was actively restricting and instead of my favorite rolls i\u2019d always get the tiniest ones filled with nothing but cucumber,, like four pieces as well\u2026since they were \u201clow calorie\u201d. meanwhile my friends enjoyed themselves, ordered what they wanted and didnt even think abt the food or calories. i was sitting there jealous of their food with my stomach rumbling (who wouldve guessed that those four pieces didnt fill me up) and not engaging in any conversation. \nright now i ordered myself a pretty big portion of delicious rolls despite having raging body image issues today.. and enjoyed them all!! when my ed starts messing with me, i fight back and dont give in (i\u2019m sorry for being cringe lmao)",
