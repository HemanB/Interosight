  "selftext": "due to start university in 165 days after dropping out last year due to anorexia. I desperately miss being sick, I fantasise about restricting all the time, I really really want to lose weight, I've been holding on to anorexia for so long.\n\nit's been 5 years, it's time to get better.\n\nno more putting off recovery. if I can't go to uni this year I will be devastated, but despite this I don't want to recover? that is just madness. no more delays, no more restriction, no more meal skipping.\n\nI WILL recover, I will always have anorexia as part of my past, I do not need it in my future. I won't let my life stand still any more. \n\nI have 165 days to get better, to at least be stable. I don't expect myself to ever fully recover, really. but stable and functioning is good enough, for now.\n\nit's so difficult to let go, as terrible as it is, and even though anorexia has taken everything away from me, it's my only relief, I genuinely enjoy losing weight, but it just isn't fucking worth it. \n\nconsider this a sign to recover.",
