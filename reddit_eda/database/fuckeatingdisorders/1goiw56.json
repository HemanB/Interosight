  "selftext": "No, you won\u2019t gain an infinite amount of weight when recovering. No, you won\u2019t become bed-bound. No, you won\u2019t become ugly. No, you won\u2019t develop BED. No, extreme hunger isn\u2019t forever. No, people won\u2019t stop talking to you because you\u2019re in a larger body (and if they do that\u2019s their loss and something they need to heal within themselves to be so hateful so better for u if that\u2019s the case tbh). No, you won\u2019t be constantly obsessing about how you look, and yes you\u2019ll stop caring so much about how you look. No, you aren\u2019t a failure for going against your ed, nor did you lose self-control. No, you aren\u2019t unhealthy for eating \u201cbad/junk\u201d foods, or more than what\u2019s \u201cacceptable\u201d. And most of all, you won\u2019t be less worthy if you exist in a body that society deems \u201cunacceptable\u201d. You\u2019re already worthy and acceptable. Your body is a vessel that\u2019s there to help you experience life. Ironically, you\u2019ll gain more control when you choose recovery. It\u2019s so unbelievably worth it, even if it doesn\u2019t seem like it right now. I\u2019m not fully recovered and I still have a ways to go, but I\u2019m doing a million times better than when I was deep in my ed, and when I started recovery at the beginning of this year. I hope that with this, I can help at least one person. You\u2019re worthy of help, no matter what weight you are. It isn\u2019t a weight-disorder. You\u2019ve got this \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79",
