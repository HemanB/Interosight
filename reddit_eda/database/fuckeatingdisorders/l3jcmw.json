You are definitely right, but what I meant *was* a more gradual approach, so like replace all the oil with applesauce the first time you bake (esp if scared to face other fear foods like sugar or flour then it helps), then only replace some of the oil with applesauce the next time you bake, then use more oil and less of the applesauce the third time, and fully oil and no applesauce the fourth time, etc and so on, so just increasing it in gradual increments to get over the fear slowly by exposing yourself to the oil gradually and working up to eating it in the full normal amount in the recipe! That\u2019s why I said to increase the ratio of oil to applesauce each time to work on the fear slowly!",
