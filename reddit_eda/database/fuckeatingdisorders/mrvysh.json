      "body": "I\u2019ve weirdly enough recently commented on a few threads over on the UK sub about BMI being used as part of the diagnosis. It is crazy and really doesn\u2019t make sense to me at all.\n\nMy BMI always hovered around 18.5 so I was never diagnosed with an eating disorder, even though I restricted a lot, sometimes made myself sick and lost weight very quickly. This was all reported to both my GP and hospital staff when at 16 I tried to kill myself, but I never got any treatment or help except 6 \u2018counselling\u2019 sessions (not even CBT).\n\nWe know eating disorders have one of (if not the) highest mortality rate of mental disorders. We know under 50% of sufferers of both anorexia and bulimia ever go on to have true, full recovery. People act like these are just facts of the illness but they aren\u2019t - they are because we leave people to be literally dying before we intervene.\n\nI actively struggled with my eating disorder between the ages of 15-22. I have been struggling again recently but am fighting it. But to get any kind of diagnosis and therefore help through the NHS, I would need to weigh less than 110lbs. Were I ever to reach that point, I would probably have to actively struggle with my eating disorder for at least a year or longer. Starving myself for a good year only ever got me to about 119lbs so god knows how far I\u2019d have to go to get to that point.\n\nYes, we need triage to ensure people who are physically dying get priority treatment, but the reality is with mental health care (at least in the UK) this means other \u2018less unwell\u2019 individuals are ignored. Even when diagnosed with an ED, you are often on waiting lists for a good year unless your BMI is something like 13 and you need immediate inpatient treatment.\n\nIt is one of the only mental illnesses where we tie the physicality of somebody to their diagnosis. In fact it\u2019s the only one I can think of, all the rest are purely on mental and emotional symptoms, as they should be. At the moment it\u2019s like somebody having an assessment for chronic depression, saying they feel awful, want to die all the time and have been self harming, but unable to be diagnosed with depression unless their cutting has been deep enough to hit an artery.\n\nI do think weight has a place in triaging but it shouldn\u2019t mean anyone over a certain BMI CANNOT be diagnosed. It\u2019s also a problem that many doctors seem to only diagnose anorexia or bulimia, and if you do not fit severe criteria of one of those two EDs you will not be diagnosed with one - even though many more exist.\n\nWe know people die of it, we know people struggle to recover, but unlike other mental health illnesses by the nature of its diagnosis including BMI we leave people to get deep into eating disorders before we intervene. Sorry for the rant but it\u2019s fucking insane to me.",

The first time i tried reaching out for help, when my behaviours were at their worst but my weight at its highest, i was essentially told i was 'too fat to have an eating disorder and be treated'. And that seriously fucked me up. When it once again reappeared over the past few years and people finally realised and forced me to go see my GP, he completely validated me, even though i don't think I'm 'sick enough' now. He believes that I've had an eating disorder all along, and he's absolutely livid about what was said to me back then. \n\nI suppose for me in the end, the risk was worth it, not that i was given much of a choice in the matter. I had to get help because everyone was going on at me, but it's worth trying, just speak to someone different this time, especially seen as apparently BMI and weight aren't part of the diagnostic criteria these days (not that it stops the obsession).\n\nWow i really do go off on one as soon as i start speaking/typing, sorry!",

I'm not familiar enough with the healthcare system in NZ to offer specific advice on getting treatment, but I will just tell you I can relate, and encourage you as much as I can to not give up and keep pushing for help. \n\nI was in a very similar situation where nobody thought I was \"sick enough\" for treatment because I was always within a normal weight range - even though I had multiple overuse injuries, nutrient deficiencies, and irregular periods.   It took me over 10 years of being in my ED for me to find a doctor who was able to guide me to treatment (although to be fair, I didn't think I was sick or want help until the last year)\n\nIf you can't get diagnosed with an ED, potentially try and find a therapist for depression who has experience with EDs (if you can get that approved at least), or maybe even try to start recovery on your own if you can.  As frustrating as it is, please please do not give up.  I waited way too long and ended up doing permanent damage to my body - I'll be living with the consequences for the rest of my life and don't want that to happen to anyone else!",

I was never mad at him, but unfortunately he got the brunt of most of my frustration. I remember after however many assessments they did of me to only reject me for treatment, one of those letters said to re-refer me if I met the BMI threshold for the ED service.\n\nI was sat there when my doctor brought up the NICE guidelines that say BMI should not be used as a single measure to determine if someone should have treatment. He then sent a letter to them asking what the threshold was, and they responded saying there wasn't one.\n\nI felt so hopeless. I was killing myself, my BMI was way underweight, and yet I still was being pushed away. They wanted me to get sicker before helping. The only reason I decided to recover was because I met someone that made me realise I didn't want to live like that.\n\nThey did offer me to speak to someone a few weeks after I saw my doctor about the BMI situation, but I had already gained a little weight and was doing slightly better. I do regret not taking it though, since I'm teetering on a relapse now. But who knows if they would've helped enough.\n\nBut it's utter bullshit how they decide who should be treated.

Don\u2019t get me wrong, I think eating disorders are dangerous and do come with inherent health risks that other disorders like depression and anxiety do not due to the behaviours associated, but I also think if we left people with depression or anxiety or any other mental illness to \u2018prove\u2019 their illness was serious before we acted like we basically do with ED, the mortality rate of those illnesses would also skyrocket.\n\nSo when people are like \u2018so many people die of EDs and don\u2019t recover isn\u2019t it sad\u2019 I\u2019m like well yeah it is sad but a huge contributing factor is that we intervene far later than with any other mental disorder.

At the moment it\u2019s like somebody having an assessment for chronic depression, saying they feel awful, want to die all the time and have been self harming, but unable to be diagnosed with depression unless their cutting has been deep enough to hit an artery.\n\nI do think weight has a place in triaging but it shouldn\u2019t mean anyone over a certain BMI CANNOT be diagnosed. It\u2019s also a problem that many doctors seem to only diagnose anorexia or bulimia, and if you do not fit severe criteria of one of those two EDs you will not be diagnosed with one - even though many more exist.\n\nWe know people die of it, we know people struggle to recover, but unlike other mental health illnesses by the nature of its diagnosis including BMI we leave people to get deep into eating disorders before we intervene. Sorry for the rant but it\u2019s fucking insane to me.",

It really is tragic.\n\nI can't help you with your search for a therapist but I will tell you how I found my social worker therapist. I was broke but desperately needing someone to talk to. I googled for therapists in my area. Her name popped up as someone who offered group sessions. I contacted her and bless her, she offered cost-adjusted sessions. She asked me what I could afford and accepted the $35 a visit I could pay. Then it turned out that she gave me private sessions after all because she didn't have a group I could fit into. I wound up seeing her privately for well over a year at $35 a session (once a week). She did not specialize in ED but worked with me on problems that contributed to my ED.\n\nDon't give up just because it hasn't worked for you yet. Call directly to therapists offices and see what they offer. Some will be ridiculously expensive but some may refer you to a therapist they know who might work out for you. Don't feel like the therapist must be an ED specialist. ED is a mental illness and has root causes in many areas. \n\nUtilize ED boards online but try to find ones that actively help you work on your problem and make useful suggestions. Read everything you can about ED and body neutrality. I'm not gonna lie, it's hard work to change the brainwashing, but it can be done.\n\nAgain, please don't give up on yourself. You can and will survive this.",

The way my body is built I could never get below a certain weight and I was not considered underweight. And I was eating NOTHING. Just Slimfast all day long. \n\nYour therapist was wrong and uninformed. You need to find someone else to talk to, it doesn't have to be a specialist in ED. My first psychiatrist was freaking amazing and she was the one who put me on the path to recovery. Remember that control is a big part of what causes eating disorders. You can't control outside events or trauma so you focus on your body, something you believe you CAN control. \n\nI am almost 57 and I spent most of my life hating my body. Don't do that to yourself. You are so young still and you CAN overcome this. It's not easy and you will work at it for a long time, but the sooner you begin addressing the core issues, the sooner you will find happiness with yourself.\n\nYOU ARE WORTH IT. Get yourself another therapist and if you don't feel a groove with the new one, keep looking. I have had several in my life and some were better than others. The best one I had was a social worker who did therapy sessions. She's the one who taught me about boundaries. They don't have to be expensive or fancy to be good. You just need to click.",
