  "selftext": "This is the first time in years that I've had a streak longer than a week. It's shocking to realize I've had bulimia for SIX YEARS. I've spent six years destroying my body and mind. The gravity of realizing that made me decide to be in recovery before/during my next birthday, and I'm now one month in :)\n\nI can't share this IRL because I've shielded my friends/family from it, so this is the next best thing!!",
