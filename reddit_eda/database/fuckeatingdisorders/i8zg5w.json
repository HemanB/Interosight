  "title": "The truth about saying \u201cfuck it\u201d to your eating disorder.",
  "selftext": "The truth about saying \u201cfuck it\u201d to and ED is that it is not a one time thing. it\u2019s about saying \u201cfuck it, I\u2019m doing this\u201d and then later saying \u201cyou know what, I feel really upset/guilty/angry that I disobeyed my ED thoughts, but fuck it, I refuse to allow myself to just sit with this feeling.\u201d  \u201cfuck it, I kow this feeling will pass and it will be okay.\u201d ,\u201dfuck it, I\u2019m going to distract myself, draw, play a video game, write, rant to strangers on reddit because fuck my ED. I am going to allow myself to have and acknowledge these negative feelings, but I am not going to allow myself to sit in them.\u201d\n\nThe most important thing that I have learnt about recovery, or possibly not even recovery in but just fighting your ED day to day when you decided to challenge rules in the name of getting even a tiny bit better. Is that it is not one moment of commitment, it\u2019s not just saying \u201cfuck it\u201d once and then suddenly your in recovery, doing amazingly well and now never have to deal with the negative thoughts or physical and emotional feelings that come along with the ED. It\u2019s about committing over and over again. \n\nTake my morning as an example:\n Every morning I get up and my ED tells me \u201cjust have tea you don\u2019t need to have food for breakfast\u201d \nand I say \u201cfuck it\u201d and then walk into the kitchen and begin making the breakfast I know my recovering body needs.\n \u201cI should leave the milk and sugar out\u201d I think as I start making my cup of tea, \n\u201cfuck it\u201d I say as I put milk straight from the carton (no measuring of course) and two sugars into my cup. \n\u201cMaybe I should measure that yogurt to make sure I\u2019m not eating too much, and also leave the honey out I don\u2019t really like it THAT much, and swap the granola with puffed wheat cereal, it\u2019s not many calories then.\u201d\nNo, \u201cfuck it, I can recognise this as an ED thought and I refuse to engage\u201d then I pour as much yogurt as I damn like into a bowl, and top that with as much honey as I damn like because I do like my yogurt sweetened and it is not an unnecessary extra, next I\u2019ll add as much granola as I damn like because puffed wheat might be less calories but it\u2019s not nearly as tasty and satisfying as granola. But I\u2019m still hungry after that yogurt,\n\u201cOkay that\u2019s enough, now I have to wait 3 hours until I can eat again\u201d.\n\u201cfuck it, I\u2019m hungry, I\u2019m listening to my body and feeding it the energy it needs and is asking for\u201d \n\nI continue to say \u201cfuck it\u201d every time I get the urge to measure, or skimp/skip an ingredient, to intentionally spoil the food, to throw it out while I make some toast. Afterwards I feel a little fuller than I expect, even a little sick and uncomfortable. \n\u201cWell look what I\u2019ve done now, I\u2019m just so greedy and horrible I shouldn\u2019t have eaten that, now I just feel guilty and physically sick, I might as well go and exercise or purge because of this...\u201d \u201cfuck it, this is an ED narrative that I refuse to engage with\u201d and so I proceed to sit down and wait the negative emotions and physical feelings out, I know they will past, I distract myself, I refuse to allow myself to torture myself by stewing in the negativity. I\u2019ll play a video game or watch TV. Ten minutes later I\u2019m so absorbed by the distraction that I barely notice the ED thoughts at all, and I can feel the fullness and discomfort start to pass. \n\nAs you can see I\u2019ve said \u201cfuck it\u201d to my ED and committed to recovery 10+ times before 9am, this whole process happens over and over from the second I wake up to the second I go to bed. \u201cFuck it, fuck it, fuck it\u201d I tell myself every time I hear an ED thought. It\u2019s not easy, it\u2019s tiring and sometimes I do give in to the urges I\u2019m only human after all. It\u2019s also taken me months to get to a point where I\u2019m able to achieve this success at least 70-80% of the time. \n\nThe truth about saying \u201cfuck it\u201d is that it doesn\u2019t mean that suddenly your ED will disappear, it doesn\u2019t mean that suddenly you know longer have to endure negative feelings surrounding food, body image, and anything else in your life that your ED impacts - After all you are still an individual with an ED, a moment of commitment towards freedom from this does not negate that fact. You\u2019ll need to find your own healthier coping mechanisms to deal with this (are really that is the first part of saying \u201cfuck it\u201d. The truth is while saying \u201cfuck it\u201d may not have instant gratification, it may not take away the shit that is begin human and living with an ED. However what it does do is empower you, if you can say \u201cfuck it\u201d and eat that fear food, or miss that run, or not act on your urge to purge, or really whatever behaviour it may be - even just once. It puts you in control, it proves that you have the power and the ability to say \u201cfuck it\u201d again and again.\n\nSaying \u201cfuck it\u201d the first step in letting the ED go and reclaiming your life back and I urge you all to give it a go, take a chance, who knows, maybe (actually most definitely I can attest to that fact it will be) your life will be better with a few more profanities thrown in.",
