  "title": "Tips to help you through extreme/mental hunger",
  "selftext": "I\u2019m sitting at the airport, finally free to actually make this post! I\u2019ve been wanting to do this for a few days but I\u2019ve been so busy with, well, life. But I digress! I\u2019ve noticed lately that many of us here are struggling with the symptoms that accompany honoring extreme/mental hunger. In turn, I\u2019ve been thinking about all the things that helped me when I was in deep, so I thought it\u2019s time for yet another list! Let\u2019s get started:\n\n1. **Heating pads or hot water bottles.** eating so much so frequently made my stomach *crazy* sore and tender, bloated, bubbly, and just overall not very happy. Resting a hot water bottle (I didn\u2019t have a heating pad) made constantly resting a bit more cozy and helped relieve some tenderness.\n\n2. **Peppermint tea.** *Now, this is going to really depend on the individual as I know some of us used teas as a means to restrict, so be mindful of this tip.* That said, peppermint tea is great for digestion and I really personally loved the cooling sensation it had in my [sore] mouth, throat, and constantly full stomach. If nothing else, it\u2019s very soothing.\n\n3. **Gas-X, or similar OTC products**. This goes without saying, but early recovery is\u2026 gross af hahah. I was soooo gassy, it was not even funnyyyyy, I\u2019d literally run my boyfriend out of our bedroom, RIP to that poor man. While Gas-X wasn\u2019t a cure-all, it did help alleviate some pressure and offer me little physical relief.\n\n4. **Baths.** Honestly, shout out to Epsom salts for being there for me during that first year of recovery when the entire trunk of my body was so sore and swollen from constantly needing to eat. Not only did it help with some of the soreness but it was nice to just relax and take my mind off eating for even *just* 30 minutes. Highly recommend.\n\n5. **Don\u2019t cover your mirrors.** This one is going to be difficult for some of us, I\u2019m sure, but hear me out. We know that our EDs are a product of neural pathways we\u2019ve created, which thus lead to a negative response. Removing or covering your mirrors because your recovering body triggers you is simply going to result in a phobia of mirrors that will be difficult to unlearn later on. This is *especially* true if you struggle with Body Dysmorphic Disorder like I do. I made the mistake of not looking in any reflective surface three months in and now, two years into recovery, I cannot bring myself to look at my own reflection without feeling panicked. Do not recommend.\n\n6. **Avoid high fiber foods, and instead focus on easily digested foods like simple carbs and fats.** I mean, if you enjoy fibrous foods, more power to you, however, keep in mind that in the case of early recovery the digestive system has slowed to extract as much nutrients as possible. Fiber is going to lead to bloating, and thus uncomfortable fullness without actually leaving you satisfied, as well as gastrointestinal distress. Of course, you can always add these foods back later! Or if there are certain foods high in fiber that you happen to be craving that\u2019s absolutely okay, just bear in mind that they *may* contribute to some discomfort\u2026 but recovery is already uncomfortable, so you do you.\n\n7. **keep some snacks by your bed when you go to sleep at night\u2026 or just in general.** Okay, so lots of you have been bringing up waking up in the middle of the night absolutely *ravenous*. If you\u2019re too exhausted to get up, just keep something high calorie that you can eat when you wake up. And this can apply even during the day, when we\u2019re prone to take hours-long naps too. \ud83e\udd70\n\n8. **If you\u2019re thinking about food and/or WANTING food, even if you don\u2019t feel physical hunger, you need to eat.** Mental hunger is there to get us to eat in times of famine, and is even present when we aren\u2019t in an energy deficit. Have you ever heard the saying \u201cdon\u2019t go to the grocery store hungry\u201d? That\u2019s mental hunger.\n\n9. **Remember that honoring your hunger means honoring ALL cravings.** Yes, even if \u201cnOtHiNg BuT sUgAr,\u201d yes even if you\u2019re not eating \u201cfull meals,\u201d or getting all three macronutrients in the way you (read: your ED) would like. Even if it\u2019s something so fucking weird that you\u2019d never even consider it if you weren\u2019t so god damn nutrient deprived (I was obsessed with Lime tortilla chips in vanilla icecream). Even if you are at a \u201cnormal\u201d weight or higher; only 6% of ED sufferers are underweight\u2014weight is irrelevant to whether or not you can experience EH. You are valid and worthy of eating how much you want regardless of your weight. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nI might add to this when I have time so if you wanna add to this list, or just have a question, feel free to comment! Love you guys, and I\u2019m proud of y\u2019all.",

Big bowl of oatmeal, big bowl of cottage cheese with trail mix, 3 eggs, some fruit. Felt okay for an hour then started to feel a little snacky and peckish. Then I got ultra busy and by the time I had the chance to look at my thoughts again the urge to eat completely went away and I didn't feel like it anymore.\n\nWhat would one do in this situation? What I DID notice was that when I went out for lunch I still wasn't that interested in food when I was going through the line, but when I took a bite I got real hungry, real quick.\n\nI know we're supposed to even honor mental hunger - but if that mental hunger goes away should you \"make up\" for mental hunger you had earlier in the day? \n\nI guess what I'm trying to ask is: how to approach when business and stress cloud hunger signals",

Despite having an interest to eat being a sign of hunger, the opposite isn\u2019t necessarily true; a lack of interest to eat is not the same as losing hunger, that hunger is still there.\n\nI have ADHD and I get that way too sometimes when I hyperfixated on certain things for hours and forget to eat and the \u201cdesire\u201d to eat isn\u2019t there. But i notice hunger through other means\u2014irritability/crankiness, nausea, low blood sugar (shakiness, weakness, etc.).

Like I said, I\u2019m not claiming it\u2019s impossible, simply that a malnourished body is going to gravitate *toward* high calorie foods (which is clear via your cravings for fatty meat).

Your body does need a lot protein to repair damages so that\u2019s probably why, and for me personally I crave fatty protein like steak as well, which makes sense bc the body also needs fats to repair. \n\nAs for fiber, yeah it\u2019s rough. I truly love, crave and enjoy fruits and veg (AND SWEET POTATOES OMG they were my recovery OBSESSION) but obviously I can\u2019t eat plates and plates of broccoli and be comfortable lol. 50g fiber is generally what I get a day without trying or thinking about it, and is actually a pretty healthy amount (IMO the DRV of 25 is way too low) but in one sitting? And in ED recovery? Might be a biiiiit hard on ya. \n\nSo I think while it makes sense that you\u2019re craving foods with a high nutritional content that you also enjoy, maybe also practicing a liiiitle gentle nutrition in paying attention to how your body FEELS after that amount of fiber/protein snd maybe adjusting a bit. \n\nLol this is partly why I\u2019m hesitant to go all in bc I know I\u2019d be out here eating pounds of fruit, broccoli, and steak/meat and I already have GI issues \ud83d\ude02",

Like I said, I\u2019m not claiming it\u2019s impossible, simply that a malnourished body is going to gravitate *toward* high calorie foods (which is clear via your cravings for fatty meat). Not that it is *only* capable of craving these things. But due to our tendencies as disordered individuals, I simply think it\u2019s best to err on the side of caution when claiming to only crave low calorie, high fiber foods. I don\u2019t think textures would be considered disordered, it\u2019s when you only eat specific foods and nothing else due to the textures is when it becomes concerning.",
