And even if cavemen did go periods without eating you don't think that thousands of years with food at our fingertips we haven't evolved past that by now?\n\nIt's such a toxic, harmful culture that has somehow swept over the internet. Trying anything to limit their hunger so they can stay as small as possible or lose as much fat as possible.\n\nFuck everything about it",

It\u2019s eating disorder behaviour re packaged as intermittent fasting- and as soon as anyone calls someone out on it they get kicked out of the group! They competitively do long lasts (like 48-72 hours), or do OMAD where they show their one meal as a tiny burrito that they only managed half of because they \u201cfelt too full and too amazing after fasting for so long\u201d. \n\nThere\u2019s one woman who pretty much does daily accountability posts who is pretty toxic tbh- if you call her out on some of the behaviours she\u2019s promoting or pointing out that something is dangerous- she quotes \u201cresearch\u201d (a YouTube video everyone MUST watch), that she is doing this for longevity and autophagy benefits and not for aesthetic reasons  (but posts side by side selfies every day and photos of her scale and weight loss graphs)- and worst of all- boasts about going to theme parks and holidays with her kids but being able to \u201cstay strong\u201d and not \u201cindulge\u201d by not eating with them and that everyone else should remember to not break their fasts because they\u2019re stronger than that\u2026 I do wonder what those kids will internalise about eating when they remember that mummy only ate once every 2-3 days even on holiday\u2026\n\nOk.
