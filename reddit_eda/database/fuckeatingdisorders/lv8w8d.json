  "selftext": "I've been in recovery for 6 months. I reached, (surpassed) and then maintained the goal weight that my dietician set about 3 months ago. And last week, my boyfriend broke up with me. At almost any other point in my life, this would have sent me spiraling back into restriction, hating my body and myself. But I feel like I can think and see properly, in a way I never could when I was starved. My boyfriend and I were emotionally incompatible, I'm not a bad person for it, and it had NOTHING to do with how I look. \n\nI've never felt better about how I look. I have curve and muscle, which I've never had before (I developed ED during puberty). My skin is finally clear, my hair is thicker and shinier than it has ever been, and I just take care of myself better in general. \n\nI know recovery is a mental game, and appearance is only a small aspect of the disorder. But I want you to know, recovery is possible, and it feels amazing. I can think properly, I can see past the body dysmorphia, and I can cope better with my emotions. And honestly? I look better than I ever have before.",
