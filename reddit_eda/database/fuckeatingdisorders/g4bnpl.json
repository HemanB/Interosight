  "selftext": "At first, I was definitely running as more of a compulsive-compensatory behavior, but then I remembered why I fell in love with running to begin with, and now it's actually *really* encouraging me to eat more. Like, I want to be a good runner! You can't be a good runner when your diet is shit! \n\nAlso, like...I'm just so happy that I can still run. I thought for sure I'd hurt my body too badly, but it's actually bouncing back very well as long as I eat regularly and reasonably. \n\nThe other night was really my breakthrough. I cut my run short because I was tired - I'd enjoyed it, but my body was done. My ED was angry, but I was happy, and now, running feels less like a trap and more like the privilege that it is.",

Plus you feel like you\u2019re flying, and like you said, you don\u2019t get to experience that if you\u2019re not fueling your body properly",
