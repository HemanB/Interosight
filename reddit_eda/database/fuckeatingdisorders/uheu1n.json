I had the urge to relapse because malnourishment was always a great way to stay infertile, a form of effective birth control. A way to look ugly to keep unwanted advances away. \n\nOh, what a time to be alive\n\nAnyway, I ate a wonderful breakfast today. How am I gonna vote or protest without energy?",
