  "selftext": "Yall, we post about how we can never be satisfied with \"normal\" amounts of food, \"normal\" kcals, etc. \n\nWe can be. But you gotta pull yourself out of restriction first. You gotta eat fats, not just protein and carbs, because your body *needs* fat and if you don't eat any, you're just gonna be hungry because your body will tell you to keep eating with the hope that eventually you'll do something other than yeet celery or carrots or apples into it. If youre working out for 1-3 hrs a day (and believe me, I know some of yall do, hell, sometimes *I* do, for sure) then no, 1600-1800-2000 whatever kcals IS NOT ENOUGH. Yall keep saying \"I ate 1800 kcals today and ran for an hour and ohmygodiatesomuch\" and either a) you know thats bullshit or b) you do now, bc I'm telling you that it is BULLSHIT. \n\nYou're never gonna be satisfied when you're deprived of what your body needs. If you want to be satisfied on \"normal\" amounts of \"normal\" food, you have to eat NORMALLY, and by normally, I mean ENOUGH. THAT MIGHT BE A LOT, especially if you've fucked up your body! Or if you work out! \n\nPsa over. If you want to stop feeling like OHMYGODIJUSTWANTTOEATANENTIREJAROFPEANUTBUTTER, STOP PUTTING YOUR BODY IN A PLACE WHERE IT THINKS IT NEEDS AN ENTIRE JAR OF PEANUT BUTTER.",

Recovery isn't fun but it's important. I spent my recovery eating a jar of cookie spread AND a jar of peanut butter AND at least one jar of chocolate spread in two days. Then I'd go back and do it all over again, for at least three months (now I can't eat any of these things without feeling very, very sick). That loss of control is petrifying; giving in to your body's requests is the last thing you want to do, but the first thing you have to do.  I was running 10km+ daily and probably eating an average of 4000 calories a day for three months, gained 20kg rapidly and then my body was like \"okay cool, we're recovered now. You can eat like a normal person\".\n\nIn the end, the only way out IS through. It's fucking tough, but it's going to be just fine.",
