  "title": "scary side effects from anorexia that don't get talked about much",
  "selftext": "We all know the typical side effects of anorexia nervosa. Osteoporosis, heart problems, digestive issues. But there are other complications that are often not discussed or not talked about. These complications are common, but are often not talked about enough. years ago, I didn't even know things like this could happen. Frequent, painful urination is one huge complication of anorexia nervosa. this is the worst complication of anorexia I have ever experienced. It is truly miserable. and I have been to several doctors and they cannot fix it. and it is so painful. anorexia nervosa can cause bladder issues, and nerve damage. There is something called autonomic neuropathy which causes damage to your nervous system, your digestive system and your bladder. Apparently anorexia can lead to this condition for some. anorexia can cause damage to your kidneys and other vital organs. Your immune system becomes weaker when you are anorexic, which means you may get sick more often, and you may not be able to fight off infections and common sicknesses that otherwise healthy people could. for example, I became sick with a common cold once, and it made me so incredibly ill. it was the worst feeling ever. I felt so sick and weak. and I was so relieved when I finally got better from the cold, even though it took forever for my body to feel better. My friend who was anorexic for years, got sick with pneumonia and she died from complications. the anorexia was a contributing factor in her not being able to get better from pneumonia. and she had actually tried to get better throughout her life so many times. she was in treatment for her eating disorder several times. and it makes me sad to think that she got sick and her body couldn't fight it. anorexia nervosa is really serious. and the complications listed here are things you don't want to happen.",

I am going to see one to see if they can help me. every time I do a urine test, my doctor thinks the pain is from a uti, and it's not. pretty sure it's from nerve or organ damage. I am really hoping the urologist can give me some hopeful advice. even if doctors are dismissing you, I would highly recommend you keep trying. keep seeing doctors and get different opinions. don't let anyone make you feel like your pain is invalid or your problem isn't serious. I know it can be so frustrating. I really hope you find some answers",
