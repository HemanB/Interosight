  "selftext": "After like a week of avoiding the kitchen in my dorm and letting my questionable eating habits run wild, I decided to bite the bullet and make some mac n cheese. \n\nI was already patting myself on the back for pulling such a boss move on my ED and social anxiety at the same time, however when I went to the fridge, I discovered that somebody drank my fucking unopened carton of milk. They even covered they tracks and trew the empty carton away. Rip milk 2022-2022\n\nYes, it was partially my fault cause this one time I didn't write my name on it, but I was crushed none the less. I was really looking forward to my mac n cheese. I hyped myself up and now I was back at my room and crying over some stupid milk. My brain was instantly in \"it's free restriction!\" mode and I felt so dissapointed in myself. I wanted to do better and because somebody can't keep their hands off something that isn't theirs, my plans where ruined.\n\nAfter some time I calmed down a bit and decided that I shouldn't let my ED and social anxiety win. I was going to order pizza. And I did. It was delicious, I survived talking on the phone to a stranger and I even managed to stop eating when I was full.\n\nI hope you also had at least one small win today <3",
