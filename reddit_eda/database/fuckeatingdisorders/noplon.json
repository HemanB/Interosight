Ever. At all. Ever. EVER.\n\nThen I keep the ill-fitting item in my closet, because \u201cit\u2019s my size\u201d and \u201cmaybe I\u2019m just having a fat day,\u201d and I never wear it until three years later when I throw it away. \n\nEnd scene.",

      "body": "Oh, I 10000% know that sizes are different. I know my REAL sizes in the various stores I shop in, and by now I can pretty much guess when a certain item (fabric, cut, etc) is going to run a little small or a little large. \n\nWhat I'm describing is the intentional choosing of items that are too small, simply because I define myself as someone who wears size (whatever). Wearing (the next size up) is unacceptable to me, because it doesn't fit my idea of myself. The clothing is physically the same size as (above mentioned ideal size), which I can empirically see and prove. But it doesn't matter. I refuse to buy (the next size up) because that would mean I am \"person who wears (the next size up).\" \n\nYour explanation is super logical, and I appreciate what you're saying. Ironically, I'm a very logical person in every other aspect -- but when it comes to my body / shape / size / perception, logic doesn't matter. I'd RATHER spend $40 on a cute pair of shorts with the correct number on the tag, which I'll never be able to wear, and which I'll throw away or give away or pack with me and bring to each new residence for the next six years, -- than spend the money on a pair of shorts that actually fits, looks cute, is wearable, and is physically the same size as all of my other shorts -- but has the wrong number printed on the tag. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHence the title of this post.     / clown emoji",
