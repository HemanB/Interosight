  "title": "[rant] The rise of the Instagram body is infuriating",
  "selftext": "The 90's gave us lovely heroin chic, stick thinness as a trend. Luckily I was only a baby back then so I wasn't terribly effected by that. The early 2000's was the age of low rise pants and crop tops with flat stomachs.  \n\n\nNow we're somehow almost done with the 2010's and we have the new body standard, the Instagram body. Big boobs, impossibly tiny waists, huge squat booties, and legs that are curvy yet somehow still thin. People act like it's empowering that the  a e s t h e t i c is now a bit thiccer and more strength focused but it is just another way that society is telling us to manipulate our bodies into something they don't naturally look like.   \n\n\nTo get Instagram bodies, women are getting Brazilian butt lifts (which btw can be dangerous and have bad health effects) and fat transfers from their midsection to their hips and butt and thighs. They're facetuning their waists to look unnaturally tiny compared to their \"squat booties\" which they claim are empowering cause going to the gym and weightlifting is a man's world. Going to the gym and squating heavy weight to have a nicer butt is no different than crash dieting to try to have the 90 heroin chic look. It's just trying to fit the mold of what is attractive right now.  \n\n\nHuman bodies are not fucking trends. No one can be expected to completely change the shape and size of their body every 10 years to meet what is currently considered attractive.  \n\n\nIt just makes me so mad because right now the body type that is \"in style\" is often not even physically possible. If you want to have enough fat to have an insta-booty your waist gets bigger too, which is absolutely fine, however, instagram models facetune their waists smaller to make up for it. Or have the small waist from surgery.  \n\n\n  \nRecovering from an eating disorder is hard enough without getting bombarded by #strongnotskinny #instafit #fitfam posts every 2 seconds. (For the record, I deleted instagram about a month ago and it's made these feelings less intense but I still get mad) ",

It's just that isn't really a realistic situation the average human can be in, or can be in healthily. Yet I still find that dark place of my mind thinking 'Okay, that's the maximum amount of jiggle your body can have.'\n\nAnd don't even get me started on ED recovery inspo accounts, heh \u00ac_\u00ac It seems to either be... 'fit' people who are possibly-maybe-kinda-not even recovered from obsessive eating habits and exercise habits who are also posting pics of their food all the time instead of just eating it, or plus sized ladies who still naturally have big boobs and hips and stuff. And pretty faces and good make-up skills and all that, of course.\n\nMy body doesn't look anything like any of that. I find myself obsessing over whether I still have this 'recovery tummy/shape' I hear about a lot where all the fat goes to your trunk and face at first, or whether my body is just shaped like this and I really am just a monster for not recovering into either a fit-beautiful or plus-size-beautiful type of body. \n\nAnd somehow I'm supposed to stop caring. Like shit, people without EDs find it hard to stop caring, how am *I* supposed to stop caring? :( I don't even have insta and avoid places where pics like that are shared, but it's still everywhere!

I could never have a 20's flapper girl body, but there are women who look like that naturally. The Instagram body could only be achieved via invasive plastic surgery procedures and/or photoshop. I don't know any woman irl who has naturally skinny legs and huge butt; women with huge butts usually have legs that are in proportion. And even the Instagram face isn't one that exists in the real world. I find that looking like a real human being makes you plain looking at this point. And if you look like one of the Instagram models, you aren't special because there are millions of them and they all look the same. \n\n",

Does he think that someone will see that and say \n\"I feel so inadequate that I don't weigh as much as she does. I should go buy a whole box of donuts and eat them in one sitting so I could look like her someday\"?  People who say that plus size models \"encourage obesity\" just hate fat people. \n\n",

I believe it is because for people in larger bodies, they don't have a lot of positive media representation.  \n\n\n  \nI don't think obesity will ever be trendy(in the near future). Fat-phobia is real and many people, especially men on reddit, will not hold back on their cruel comments about fat people. ",
