For example I see everywhere in recovery guidelines to do 3meal/3snacks spaced AT LEAST 3 hours apart or some things say just to eat every 3-4 hours. With your recovery do you have any rules about when you can eat etc? \n\nThis is something I\u2019m personally really stuck on because I\u2019m not sure if it would be doing the \u201cwrong\u201d thing to eat say every hour etc etc and if I should just \u201cwait it out\u201d till next meal after the last one especially as I\u2019m just thinking about food and not physically hunger ever",
