  "title": "I swear, feeling full and satisfied after a meal and not feeling like I could eat that meal x10 again is one of the best feelings ever.",
  "selftext": "Before recovery (malnourished, underweight):\n- I would be so scared of eating (especially out and with others) because I knew if I started, I couldn\u2019t be able to stop.\n- I would eat way more than everyone on the rare occasions that I\u2019d eat out.\n- I\u2019d often finish my food, look at others food and want to eat off their plate (I didn\u2019t, unless it was my husband, embarrassing though)\n- I was NEVER FULL. I only realized this was because I was in a calorie deficit for so long and it was my body\u2019s way of trying to get me to gain weight and be healthy. Not because I have a black hole of a stomach.\n- all I could think and fantasize about was food. All the food I wish I could eat. Looking at yelp photos of restaurants. Blocking food accounts because looking at them was torture.\n- during thanksgiving and Christmas, I legit ate for a family at 10... I wasn\u2019t getting full no matter the amount of servings I\u2019d have. It was fucking crazy the amount of food I could fit in my stomach.\n- this lead me to a horrible binge/restrict cycle to maintain UW.\n\nNow (7 months of self recovery and gaining to a healthy weight)\n- I\u2019m not scared to eat out. I know I\u2019ll get full.\n- I can share a meal out with my husband and enjoy it. Not be a bitch about sharing, or being so aware of how much he\u2019s taking vs. me. Being UW made me so \u201cgreedy\u201d with food, maybe because my body thought it was the only time it was going to eat.\n- I can have a pastry or HALF! without going overboard. I never thought I\u2019d see the day.\n- energy levels, mood, libido, period, everything back. No more weird chest pains or extreme coldness.\n\nAs much as I am still not comfortable w my recovery body, getting my fullness cues back has been one of the best things.",
