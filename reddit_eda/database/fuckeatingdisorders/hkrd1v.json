  "selftext": "Wanted to share a technique that works for me. My ED thrives on planning. It makes me plan not to eat, and hold myself to my plan, and feel guilty when I \"fail.\" Instead, I've learned to use the ED's logic against it by doing the opposite - I'm planning to eat, I'm going to hold myself to my plan, and I'm going to feel successful when I succeed.\n\nFor those of us in the US, it's a holiday weekend. Holidays can be tough, especially when a lot of the ways we celebrate is through food and drink. To combat that, I'm giving myself full permission right now to eat and enjoy it this weekend, guilt-free. Hopefully if I state that intention now, I can look back on it if/when I do feel guilt, and remind myself that it's okay, because I stuck to my plan. I succeeded.\n\nFood can be fun. We're allowed to enjoy it. Kicking the weekend off now with a sugary cocktail, because it's goddamn delicious, and feeling good because it's all part of the plan.",
