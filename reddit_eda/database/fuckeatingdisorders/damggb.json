  "selftext": "Eating disorder education is ineffective and problematic.\n\nI\u2019ve been bulimic for 7 years and I never would have thought about purging food until I learned about someone else who was bulimic.\n\nThey taught us about eating disorders in high school and they talked about the physical consequences. They talked about how it sucked but I naively believed that I could just stop. I thought I\u2019ll just lose a few pounds and be better. Like every other teenager I both didn\u2019t think the consequences applied to me and I didn\u2019t care. \n\nNo one talked about how you lose friends, fun and money. That every encounter with food is stressful. Your whole life is consumed. No one told me that your ED owns you. One told me that I sold my soul when I started purging. \n\nSome white middle aged man teaching health class is useless. \n\nAlso how the fuck does everyone think that a couple of discussions about ED is enough when our whole society is cultivating them. The irony is thick. When the same health class that was supposed to stop this made me run off the calories from our snacks to make sure we understood the consequences of our eating choices.\n\nTo all of the adults who were in 13 years old me\u2019s  life, fuck you. Instead of helping me you taught me know to bottle my stress, anxiety and emotions inside so well that they will destroy me from the inside out.\n\nFuck this. It\u2019s not fair!",
