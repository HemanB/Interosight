  "selftext": "I have gained a bit over 50 pounds, most of which I put on in 4 months. Even though my weight hasn't changed much in 6 months now, it's still difficult for me to accept the body that I currently have. I have to fight the thoughts of relapsing constantly. I just don't know how to accept myself. I was thin a year ago, now I'm obese. It may change, it may not. It's just scary looking like I do now; this was my biggest fear my whole life, I had an eating disorder for 12 years, and now I'm fat. How do you accept the new you if the new you is something you used to be so afraid of? \n\nPS: I still don't regret recovery. I may be fat, but at least I finally feel alive.",

      "body": "Your body will level out over time. Everything takes time. Especially when recovering from an eating disorder, you need to learn to accept your body - in the beginning, your body doesn't really know what the fuck to do with the nourishment, it's normal to be storing a lot of fat in your stomach which is good in recovery! Overtime, and I'm talking atleast a year, things will start to \"level\" out. Bloating won't be as bad, your body may or may not redistribute fat, there are so many factors this all depends on. \n\nMy suggestion is to maintain a healthy diet - and by healthy I don't mean *just*  fruits, vegetables, lean meat, etc. I mean eat what you want, when you want, as long as it's balanced...  you should honor your cravings as well. Be sure go outside as well, trust me, it helps! :) Exercising is different for everyone, sometimes the healthiest option is to *not* exercise at all for a while, and that's okay. \n\nRemember, there's nothing wrong with your body. It's just your ED trying to tell you there is something wrong with it. What helps me is to look at the bigger picture... life as a whole. Does it really matter what my BMI classifies as? We have so much to live for.\n\nSending my love! Be kind to your body :)",

My therapist is also having me do radical acceptance and recognizing when my thoughts are cognitive distortions (i.e., I\u2019m disgusting and everybody hates me). Radical acceptance has been most helpful to me to come to terms with my recovering body.",

I know this isn't healthy, but I've been avoiding seeing my reflection while naked.\n\nNow that it's been two years my stretch marks are faded, but I still dread seeing people I haven't seen for awhile or taking pictures with friends. I'm going to be a bridesmaid next month and I am DREADING the pictures.\n\nAnother thing that was been very helpful is following a lot of plus size models on social media. It helps me rationalize my thoughts, because if I think they look beautiful, why can't I say the same about myself? \n\nIt's hard. I wish I had a more concrete answer for you. But these are the things I've found helpful. \n\nP.s I'm afraid of exercise now, especially exercising in public. I'm terrified of being seen out of breath.
