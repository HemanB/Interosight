  "selftext": "Why does no one talk about the phase with eating disorders when ur maintaining ur weight or not fully engaged in every unhealthy behaviour? People act like the whole duration of having an eating disorder ur loosing weight and hardly eating but if that were the case we would all be dead. It\u2019s so fucking invalidating, ur eating disorder isn\u2019t cured if ur maintaining ur weight, it isn\u2019t cured if ur at a healthy weight, it isn\u2019t cured if ur eating above a certain number of cals, it isn\u2019t cured if u eat common \u201cfear foods\u201d doing any of these things doesn\u2019t mean ur not sick or u don\u2019t deserve recovery. You can still be just as mentally unhappy, miserable and sick doing any of those things and ur body can still be extremely physically struggling aswell.",
