  "selftext": "I\u2019m just gonna get straight to the point\u2014we have seen way too many posts lately bashing the mods, and frankly, it\u2019s gotten ridiculous. So let me lay things out clearly\u2014because apparently, some people still don\u2019t get it.\n\n##1. The rules are non-negotiable.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter whether you agree with them or not. The rules are there to keep this community safe and functional. Mods enforce them. Members follow them. If you break the rules, you\u2019ll get a temporary or permanent ban, depending on how severe or repetitive the issue is.\n\nIf you\u2019re confused about a rule or why your content was removed, that\u2019s fine\u2014**ask us**. We\u2019re more than willing to clarify or even reinstate posts/comments when there\u2019s a genuine misunderstanding. Plenty of users can confirm that reaching out via modmail often leads to a resolution, especially if you\u2019re willing to edit your post to follow the rules. But if you choose to complain publicly instead of reaching out, that\u2019s on you.\n\n\n##2. Moderator discretion applies to everything.\n\nYes, **everything**. Every post. Every comment. No exceptions. If a mod decides your content isn\u2019t appropriate, it\u2019s not staying up. Period. You don\u2019t have to like it, but that\u2019s the way it is.\n\nIf a post isn\u2019t approved or re-approved after review, it\u2019s because we decided it wasn\u2019t safe or appropriate for the sub. This isn\u2019t a democracy\u2014it\u2019s a community we work hard to manage for free, for your benefit. If that\u2019s a problem for you? There are countless other subs. No one\u2019s forcing you to stay here.\n\nWe\u2019re not here to cater to people who just want to stir up drama, promote harmful behavior, or dodge the rules under the guise of \u201cjust expressing themselves.\u201d If you actually care about the community and feel a removal was unfair, you\u2019d contact modmail like a reasonable person. But the ones who skip that and go straight to public whining or harassing us? Yeah, you know who you are.\n\n##3. Public mod-bashing = permanent ban.\n\nLet me be clear: if you make a post or comment complaining about the mods instead of taking it to modmail, you\u2019re getting permanently banned. No warnings. I\u2019m done. We\u2019re done.\n\nThe mod team puts in an absurd amount of unpaid time and energy to keep this space safe, and the reward lately has been nonstop harassment, insults, and even threats. It\u2019s disgusting. You don\u2019t have to like us, but you will respect the work we do to keep this place from turning into a dumpster fire.\n\nIf that\u2019s too much to ask, then seriously\u2014go find a different sub.\n\nThis community exists because people work hard to keep it functioning. If you can\u2019t handle that, maybe the problem isn\u2019t the mods.\n\nThanks for coming to my TED Talk, have the day yall deserve. \ud83e\udd70",

Like....i get it, EDs are scary, and frustrating, and folks are used to  \"recovery spaces\" that are really just poorly disguised, pro ED cesspools. I'm very active on this sub as a recovered person and I've had lots of comments removed! Guess what? That's an opportunity to learn. To do better.\n\nI hate the growing trend of bashing and abusing group moderators. I've been seeing a big uptick in other subs. \n\nI appreciate you all so much.",

Cool to know we can email yall through mod mail - wasn't sure how to reach out in the event of being confused about something being taken down.\n\nThanks again \ud83d\ude4f this space has been a life saver, for real.",

They think putting, \"TW,\" in the title excuses it. It's toxic and I feel badly for anyone struggling that follows it hoping for help and support.
