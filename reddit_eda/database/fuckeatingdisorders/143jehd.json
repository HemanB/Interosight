  "title": "It feels like recovery has truly opened my eyes to just how completely fucked up diet culture and weight loss advice is.",
  "selftext": "It\u2019s insane to me that I\u2019ve spent over a decade of my life absolutely terrified of eating without tracking calories. Most weight loss advice and CICO subs act like it\u2019s not only normal, but necessary, to be hyper-vigilant around food. Diet culture really treats bodies like a machine with perfect calorie-to-weight inputs and outputs.\n\nNow that I\u2019m further along in recovery and eating pretty \u201cnormally,\u201d it just feels like I\u2019m finally seeing all this bullshit for what it is. I don\u2019t track, but I am still aware of the calorie content of most of what I eat from the years of disordered eating. I\u2019m past EH and am weight restored, but I still have days where I eat 3xxx+ calories just because, as I\u2019m learning, that\u2019s a normal ass thing to do. My body on and after those days doesn\u2019t look any different than on days I eat less. \n\nI\u2019ve gained weight in recovery (since that was obviously the goal), but since hitting a range my doctors are happy with, I honestly have kind of stalled out - not intentionally, just like\u2026 I eat enough to not lose and stay full and my body just kind of doesn\u2019t change (granted, I don\u2019t weigh myself, but I\u2019ve stopped outgrowing my clothes the way I did at the beginning of recovery before weight restoration).\n\nIt\u2019s just weird to me that so much advice surrounding bodies is dedicated to this extreme calorie counting and body vigilance when not doing that has led to a much happier and stable relationship to my body. I\u2019m not my smallest, sure, but my smallest was so miserable to maintain and deleterious to my health that it just wasn\u2019t worth it. Now I just look the way I do, feed myself, and my body doesn\u2019t fluctuate like crazy. Seriously, I absolutely housed pastries AT NIGHT (huge ED fear for me was night eating) on top of my normal meals yesterday and I\u2019m less bloated today than I was most days with my ED. And even when I do bloat, I don\u2019t hate it so much because I know my body stops being bloated eventually. Like I just have so much more patience for myself now.\n\nNot really sure why I\u2019m sharing this, but I guess it\u2019s in part because of how annoyed I am for creating all these long-term health ramifications when eating without tracking is so much more peaceful. I know my ED wasn\u2019t my fault, but I still feel almost in disbelief that eating could ever feel this normal. Not perfect mentally, by any means, but compared to where I was at the beginning of the year, I\u2019m fucking crushing it. The fact I can have consecutive days of not thinking about my body is insane.",

I feel at peace and comfortable and although my EH is definitely not yet over, I stopped gaining so fast/at all. Its amazing how bodies can regulate themselves. I cringe so much at diet culture, especially the posts that are like \"if you use x instead of y, you save 50 calories!!\" \"Eat xxx calories less and you're gonna lose x pounds in x days\" Like shit, the body doesn't care about 50 calories and it's not a calculator. If we would need the same amount of energy every day, how come that intuitive eaters (like you and me seem to be) have a steady weight despite eating differently every day? We should complicate things that are actually natural...",

      "body": "I feel this so much. I was a huge CICO-path when I was actively bulimic. It was so self defeating IMO.\n\nNow that I\u2019m just eating normally\u2026 I\u2019m not spiraling and permanently gaining weight like I thought I would. To be clear, I had zero weight restoration to do so, even if you do gain weight, it\u2019s totally fine.\n\nAnyway, diet culture made my problem so much worse. It justified my ED. Post diet culture, I sometimes dip into these subs and see how crazy some of the advice is. Someone will say they ate a larger portion of dessert or something and someone else is like \u201chave you tried this ultra synthetic, volumized version of that thing instead? It\u2019s sooooo good.\u201d I\u2019ve lived that life. Volumized food is not as tasty or satisfying as its normal counterparts.\n\nI used to be a \u201cweigh myself everyday\u201d person, too. Weighing yourself everyday is totally pointless for most people because weight fluctuates so much day to day. And I\u2019m at the point where I don\u2019t care. I cared for a decade and no number brought me peace.\n\nAnyway, congratulations on your journey, OP - and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re seeing it all for what it is!",

      "body": "YES! Oh my god, my early recovery bloat was so bad I went to the hospital thinking I was having a heart attack because of the chest pressure - but nope, just severe bloat! I was coming off of 7+ years of laxative abuse, and my body was just losing it. \n\nI was carrying like 10+ pounds of JUST water in addition to actual weight gain for about two months. It was miserable. I cried constantly. Having to eat thousands of calories when I was that bloated and constipated made me want to give up, but I didn\u2019t. I stopped laxatives entirely and haven\u2019t relapsed since.\n\nAround the three month mark, it got significantly better. By five months, I\u2019d say the excess bloat was completely gone. The biggest thing that helped me was eating, consistently, and intentionally adding fiber to my diet. I also weirdly found that ice cream helped me a lot? I don\u2019t know if that was real or not, but something about downing a pint gave me relief from my IBS-C the next day which helped with the bloat.\n\nIt\u2019s ultimately a waiting game, but it does get better. Even if it feels like it never, ever will, it does. Even if me saying that feels like a, \u201cIt worked for her, but I\u2019m not her,\u201d it does. I recommend finding comfy, loose clothes and living in them. I wore dresses exclusively during early recovery because they allowed for the bloat without any tightness.",
