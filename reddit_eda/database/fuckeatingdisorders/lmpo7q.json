  "selftext": "I'm sorry.\n\nI know it's hugely unpopular, and I know some of you do it. But honestly, I don't believe it. I think it's just one of the many excuses we put together. I believe that in the vast majority of cases we *know* what's the bare minimum. We *do* have an idea. We're just scared of accidentally eating more than that, so we count calories to actually make sure we don't eat too much. \n\nNow, there are certain people, especially those who are very young and very deep into AN, who genuinely might have impaired cognitive capabilities and might truly not be able to recognize what's a \"sufficient\" amount of food. But usually those are looked after by professionals, so let's just say I'm not referring to them. I think that really most adults do have an idea of what a portion size is and don't need to count calories for that.\n\nLet's say you have doubts that you haven't eaten enough. What's stopping you from just going and eating more? Maybe you don't feel ready to do so, don't feel brave enough to do so, which is totally okay and absolutely normal, but it's a different issue.\n\nOr let's say that you have no guidance and just feel scared and overwhelmed and don't even know where to start. Say you struggle with binging and purging and just want to be stable for a while. You can try and visually guess what a minimum amount of food is by looking around. Look at what others are putting on their plates during meals. Look at fast food portions. Think about what you'd feed another person with. Imagine you have a child to take care of and that child comes home after school and you have to make lunch for him. Or imagine you have a friend over for dinner. Would you count calories in that case? Or maybe you would just estimate? I'm sure it's in your ability to do so.\n\nAlright my little rant is over :)\n\nEDIT: apparently some people felt upset and invalidated by my comments. That absolutely wasn't my intention - I believe what I wrote is true in most cases, but I do respect everyone's personal experiences.",

      "body": "If counting calories was part of the eating disorder, continuing to count will make it impossible to learn intuitive eating. Our bodies need a different number of calories at a given time. I really liked how my treatment program did it\u2014 we just had to have a certain number of servings of each food group at each meal, for example two carbohydrates and a few ounces of protein and a fat. \n\nBut, even that became something to be rigid about eventually. Eventually I had to take the training wheels off and trust my body to tell me when it was full or hungry. I learned to do that by journaling about my hunger/fullness cues at every meal (I had been doing that ever since entering inpatient treatment). In early recovery, I felt like a 1 (extreme hunger) before every meal and a 10 (extreme fullness) after every meal. As my body started to trust that it would get the appropriate amount of food, I felt more like a 3-4 hunger before every meal and a 7-8 fullness after every meal. \n\nAlso, if eating disorder behaviors are being used, I.e. occasional purging or excessive exercise, it will not be possible to accurately determine the body\u2019s hunger/fullness cues.",

If I don\u2019t plate with similarly sized plates and composition as my structured meal plan, I still have a really hard time telling what\u2019s an appropriate quantity.

      "body": "I would just note that portion measuring is a great way to start to distance yourself from calorie counting if you\u2019re really struggling to know what the correct amount to eat is.   In many treatment facilities, you essentially learn how to portion, and it\u2019s very easy to do at home.  Step 1 is to measure everything (cups, grams, etc) to make sure you\u2019re getting enough.  Step 2 is to \u201c reverse portion\u201d - try to portion on your own without measuring, and then check yourself after, and adjust if needed.  Step 3 is to \u201cfree portion\u201d, where you trust yourself and can portion without checking.  \n\nIt\u2019s hard to learn, but it was hugely helpful to get me to stop thinking of food as a set number of calories you get for the day.  If you think at each meal, I need 3oz of protein, 4oz of carbs, 1 cup of veggies, 2tbs of fat (or whatever your portion size is), you\u2019re less likely to restrict or have your meals impacted by what you previously ate or didn\u2019t eat.",

      "body": "Everyone is different. In my case I was vastly overestimating how much I was eating. I had to track to make sure I got enough. Once I started doing that I was able to increase calories appropriately and the extreme hunger went away. I strongly suspect that many of the people here who struggle with extreme hunger are eating more, (just enough to turn the digestive system and hunger back on) but not enough to be healthy. The result is incessant, inhuman levels of hunger. It\u2019s awful and feels like it will never stop. Think about this: in eating disorder inpatient no one is ever hungry. I thought they were over feeding me but I put on very little weight. My perception of what a lot of food is was incredibly distorted, but I couldn\u2019t see it because I was already eating a lot more than at my low point.\n\nThe problem with trying to recover on your own is that you still have the bias of your disordered mind.
