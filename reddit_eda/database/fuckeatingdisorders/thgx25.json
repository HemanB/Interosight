  "selftext": "So I did my yearly check up and was so afraid. I am fat and recovered from a life long eating disorder where I eat keto the last decade\n\nThe first time in recovery I eat like 10000+ kcal/day, then like 5000 and now around 3-4 maybe?? Dont know. In the beginning I eat like alllll fun foods and now I eat someting everyday and dont think about \u201dclean food\u201d anymore.\n\nI was soooo scared for the check up. Scared to be prediabetes, inflammed and like cancer everywhere\u2026 but DA FUCK??? I was HEALTHY! Everything was FINE!! My inflammation marker has SUNK with over 75%????? Wtf!!? Sugar, bloodpressure, cholesterole.. FINE! \n\nI thought that all the fun food would kill me but no\u2026 my health is better compared to just eating clean\u2026 i feel so fooled by the dietindustry now",
