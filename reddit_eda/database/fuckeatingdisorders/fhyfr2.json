  "selftext": "Just a friendly PSA \u2014and more than anything a good mantra for myself\u2014 if you get sick, whether it be with Coronavirus, the flu, ANYTHING, you have to keep eating. I know that there\u2019s been a lot of panic about stocking up on food and water, but remember that if any of you get sick you have to take care of your bodies. Your bodies will be fighting hard to fend off any virus you get, it will be working really hard for you, even if you\u2019re not feeling like it is. Remember to treat your body kindly for working to keep you alive if you get sick. Don\u2019t worry about exercising; don\u2019t let a poor appetite become an excuse for your ED to wiggle its way into your head. You are stronger than your ED and you have to keep your body strong to fend off illness. All of you deserve to eat, all of you deserve to be healthy and stay healthy, and if you get sick all of you deserve to rest and get better.",

      "body": "yes please! i got a really really bad case of this flu this winter and i only made it worse by restricting and then purging while i had a fever. Try and be kind to yourself when youre sick and remember you NEED food and water and electrolytes to keep your body to fight through this. The flu was the worst thing to happen to me in a long time and i only made it worse by not taking care of myself and it made me sick and miserable for weeks after when i was still weak and recovering from a sickness i didnt try and help myself get through the first time.",

Do whatever you can to give your body fuel in whatever way it can handle it in that moment. \n\nI had a nasty sinus infection at the start of this year and the thought of food made me very nauseated, both because of being sick and then because of the antibiotics. I literally lived off of Orgain for a few days until I could manage other foods. But fueling myself in whatever way I could I think made my recovery quicker than it would\u2019ve been had I not found a tolerable way to get nutrition.",
