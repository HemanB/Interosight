  "selftext": "So, I live in Norway, about a 2 hour drive away from Sweden. A family tradition is to take a day trip with my family to Sweden to buy cheap food, clothes, electronics and most importantly, candy! Due to covid and ED I haven't been there for 3 years. I always used to buy 1+ kg of assorted candy, and that was always a highlight of my summers.\n\nFast forward till today, I went to Sweden again with my Dad, but also my ED. We did some shopping, and ate a delicious pizza for lunch, and I ate the whole thing. Then, I went to the candy store: literally being a kid in the candy shop! There are hundreds of different candies, chocolates, caramels, fudge etc. and I went absolutely insane! I picked all the candies I wanted (literally so much chocolate and fudge), and filled my bag with 2,3kg of candy! Not only that, I bought 2 large toblerones, 360g each, so in total over 3kg of candy :-)\n\nSo now for the next weeks I'm going to thoroughly enjoy my 3kg of chocolates. And also, dinner today is going to be pizza even though I ate pizza for lunch. Screw you ED, I'm the winner now, and I'm still going to eat all my normal meals on top of the candy!",
