  "selftext": "My phone isn't full of body check pictures, it has pictures of my pets and joyful moments captured. I have the mental capacity to Christmas shop for personal and creative gifts for my loved ones(last year I was too disordered and depressed to put much thought into anything). I can paint and actually enjoy it and lose myself in the problem solving aspects. \n\nI'm thankful for the mental capacity i have for things that matter to me. Relapsing isn't worth losing all my freedom. Recovery is brutal and challenging and an unending job, but fucking fuck is it worth it.",
