What made that lesson even worse was that my biology teacher **knew** I was in recovery and weight restoring and didn't ask me if I felt comfortable sitting in for the lesson or give me an option to spend that class time in the library. \n\nIt's such an outdated thing to teach in that way, especially with what we now know about eating disorders and the literature coming out of research in that field. I was 16 when I started weight restoring, and 17 by the time I had completed treatment. In that one year I had changed so much and it surprised me that I was so confident and proud of my body afterwards, and that I didn't care about other people's opinions anymore. \n\nI'm 24 now and I have 8 years of recovery behind me.

I'm super observant and these traits (as well as other physical ones I haven't heard anyone talk about) are how I noticed my friend was actively starving herself too. She had made a few semi concerning jokes on her social media, I started paying attention and found out. A few months later she suddenly told all her followers.",
