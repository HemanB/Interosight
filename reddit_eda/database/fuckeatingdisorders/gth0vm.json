  "selftext": "After I broke down crying yesterday, he told me I need to take real steps to recovery, like eating 3 meals a day and throwing out the scale.  He warned me he was going to do it. I told him \"I'd do the same if the situation was reversed but Im still probably going to throw a fit\"\n\nAnd this morning, its gone. My ritual of weighing in the morning is gone. I know its for the best, i know this is what I need to get better. I won't buy another one and the soonest I'd have access to a scale is in August when I go back to work.  I hope by then I'm strong enough to not weigh myself.\n\nThings have gotten so hard. After 6 years and of cycling relapse and recovery I'm afraid that I'll never get it to stick.  But I have to try, because life is fucking hard and its harder with an eating disorder.",

And in my experience, though you probably won\u2019t all of a sudden love and accept your body, not being able to do it can feel like a relief. \n\nIt\u2019s never easy to make changes, but it\u2019s a great step. Best of luck!",

It worked out for the best as since then I\u2019ve finally gotten proper help (now that we can afford it) and consider myself well on the way to recovered. You can do it too but it\u2019s ok if you need to panic for a minute! You will move forward and it sounds like you\u2019ve got solid support behind you.",

I stood my ground when they insisted they needed to weigh me. I asked them why is it that I am always hearing \u2018your weight doesn\u2019t matter\u2019 yet the first thing you all want to do at the beginning of every single appointment is have me hop on that cold metal square? If it doesn\u2019t matter than why weigh me? I told them I have been seeing them long enough that they can all tell the minute we are in the room together how I am doing. They can feel the energy and vibe I\u2019m giving off, no scale needed. I can manipulate a weight anyway. They said we need it as a measurement of your progress. A measurement of my progress? Really? Can a scale measure the joy on my sons face as we toast our subway sandwiches before taking a bite? How about the happiness on my kids faces when I ask them to play a board game? Can it measure the strength I feel from not giving in to an urge? Or how about the amount of love and support I have around me? There are many ways to measure progress without using a damn scale.",

I also complied and relinquished my scale to my therapist, she came to my house and we went through and I gave her anything that was behavior related. I still have urges or maybe a curiosity to weigh; but as long as they stay true to their word I promised to stay true to mine.",
