It's a huge load off. Like one semester I was asking for advice on course load because I was being evicted and they suggested I take it easy. I still did amazing in my classes and had to correct them when they assumed that meant I wasn't evicted after all. \n\nThe over-compensated extraversion I have where I casually mention Heavy Shit I've been through makes it easier to just say, \"my life is a Disaster and I was in the hospital. If I could get an extension that'd be fab. Let me know if I need to get a doctor's note.\" And they are generally understanding and don't really need much from me about it because they've kind of been primed to know that I'm surviving hell and still expressing some kind of effort.\n\nI am really strategic about making sure I get courses with professors I Vibe With though. It's easier to find them teaching courses I'm interested in (social justice oriented ones). I realize not everyone has that privilege.\n\nAnyway. What you're going through sucks and I'm sorry it's not a thing you're socially able to talk about in this situation.",
