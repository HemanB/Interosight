  "selftext": "I woke up around 5am and felt so hungry. Part of my brain was just telling me to wait until breakfast time, it's not that far away. But I was hungry then and there, and thought \"why wait?\" I went down to the kitchen and made myself a delicious snack. It was so satisfying and it felt like I was taking control rather than my ED. Midnight snacking and eating at irregular times is such a fear of mine, I feel so abnormal doing it but I know that it is something so many people do, and my intake does not have to be the same everyday. Needless to say, it felt good to counter my fear and listen to my body. But yeah, keep fighting against your ED, it'll be worth it in the long run.",

But reading this post reminded me that that\u2019s restriction and I NEED to eat when I\u2019m hungry!",
