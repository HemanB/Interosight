  "selftext": "365 days of recovery. One year of trying to recovery and successfully doing it. I never thought I would be able to talk about my eating disorder(s) in past tense but I do now. My love for all kinds of food has strengthen and my mental health has been so good.\n\nRecovery feels amazing and it is very possible. Eating disorders are rough and exhausting so is recovery but that is worth it. Finally I consider myself happy and still in recovery but semi-recovered.\n\nWishing you all well",
