  "selftext": "Do you ever get triggered by recovery youtubers? And I don't mean \"recovery\" youtubers, I mean actual recovery youtubers.\n\nFor some reason I find myself to be always so triggered by Megsy Recovery. She always said to never restrict yet she rigidly followed a meal plan - how can you not restrict AND follow a meal plan? Do you just magically feel full with average portions? - and sometimes even stated out loud that she'd gladly eat her breakfast all over again. (But she didn't, for some reason) She also somehow managed to never binge. Plus she recovered in this perfectly sized beautiful body that I'd never ever in one million years possibly get if I truly stopped restricting. Basically she looks like the poster child of recovery and I cannot relate.\n\nAnd she's not the only one - I see so many youtubers that \"stop restricting\" and \"recover\" while following a meal plan and being apparently satisfied with that approach, and staying lean and fit at the same time. And here I am with my messy extreme hunger, my over the top binges and my bloatedness and weight gain, feeling even more lonely than before.",

A person who still has restriction, but they think because the portions look visually larger, it's not restriction. This is typically like eating a large amount of fruits and vegetables (which are great but low cal), or restricting their diet to \"clean\" food only (which we would recognize as orthorexia. Their bodies are not skeletal, but are still much slimmer than average (usually BMI 19-ish).\n\n2. A person who has \"swapped\" a restrictive disorder for a binge disorder. These are the people who \"boast\" about the *unnecessarily large meals* that they consume. It is a \"normal portion\" to eat part of a pint of ice cream. It is not \"recovery\" to eat an entire pint of ice cream after a large  fast food meal. This is binge eating, not recovery. Their bodies are typically larger, BMI 25 or higher. \n\nFor anyone who \"just\" starts recovering and finds it \"easier than I thought\", I would suspect it's one ED traded for another. Recovery is difficult and messy, and typically it's management rather than \"yeah I'm totally 100% recovered\" because ED's are mental disorders and the research seems to indicate that they cannot be \"cured\" (but can be managed...like diabetes, for example). Anyone who is chugging through recovery-management would explain how difficult it is, then offer some ideas that worked for them on how to address each difficulty.

She talked about not restricting but then in a vlog slipped up and refused to eat something because 'I'm saving it for a full day of eating', and it dawned on me that the reason I was watching her was because I wanted to keep my skinny eating disorder body while not restricting just like her - except when the camera was off, she WAS restricting.",

These youtubers are obviously are still in the full grip of their disorder otherwise they wouldn't be obsessively logging, filming, and recording every god damn thing they eat. Recovered people don't behave like that. They have shit to do. And it's damaging and potentially dangerous, triggering content for disordered people to consume.\n\nA recovered body is not slim and athletic.

I had watched others like Tabitha Farrar, etc who talked about extreme hunger, and eating unrestrictedly using a meal plan as a minimum. I stopped watching here videos however after noticing things similar to what you stated in your post, in one video she even talks about how she would become obsessed with foods that she had to allowed herself in her ED during recovery and crave them all the time, however she would allow herself to have them regularly (only one a day) in order to not binge. To me that sounding like restricting - if I want pancakes all the time, I\u2019m going to follow all the other advice I\u2019ve been given and eat pancakes for every damn meal that day if that\u2019s what my body is asking for. \n\nI always see so many others praising her, but I can\u2019t understand how she can be seen as a role model for real recovery when she still seems to engage in slightly disordered behaviours. Sometimes I wish my recovery was as perfect as she made it seem in a lot of her videos. She reinforces the idea that I will never been happy when I\u2019m not mirco-managing my intake, that I will have to continue to restrict even in recovery to hold on to my happiness and a body that is deemed acceptable by society.",

I had to plan every meal ahead of time and everything had to be extremely healthy and nutritious.

          "body": "There are two things I've noticed in the \"recovery social media\" group:\n\n1. A person who still has restriction, but they think because the portions look visually larger, it's not restriction. This is typically like eating a large amount of fruits and vegetables (which are great but low cal), or restricting their diet to \"clean\" food only (which we would recognize as orthorexia. Their bodies are not skeletal, but are still much slimmer than average (usually BMI 19-ish).\n\n2. A person who has \"swapped\" a restrictive disorder for a binge disorder. These are the people who \"boast\" about the *unnecessarily large meals* that they consume. It is a \"normal portion\" to eat part of a pint of ice cream. It is not \"recovery\" to eat an entire pint of ice cream after a large  fast food meal. This is binge eating, not recovery. Their bodies are typically larger, BMI 25 or higher. \n\nFor anyone who \"just\" starts recovering and finds it \"easier than I thought\", I would suspect it's one ED traded for another. Recovery is difficult and messy, and typically it's management rather than \"yeah I'm totally 100% recovered\" because ED's are mental disorders and the research seems to indicate that they cannot be \"cured\" (but can be managed...like diabetes, for example). Anyone who is chugging through recovery-management would explain how difficult it is, then offer some ideas that worked for them on how to address each difficulty. Someone who goes on about it being easy, or pretends it's all smooth sailing, that person hasn't recovered.",
