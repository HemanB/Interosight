I've silenced every word that has anything to do with edtwt and still the pro-ana sh*t manages to get on my feed. \nI was trying to find fanart of an anime and boom, \"character based diets <3\" thread is the first result. \n\nI know these people are sick, sad, and need help but i can't feel anything but hate towards them. They're killing themselves while encouraging other people to do the same. I know they need compassion and love. But I sure as hell can't give it to them. Eating disorders ruin people.\n\nI'm sorry, i'm just tired of it",

On brand for our disorder but seeing as how much we've suffered we shouldn't feel guilt for not feeling empathy.\n\nPersonally I've added a lot of things to my blocked/muted keywords list. I've found blockchains are really helpful too. So far a combo of this has worked.",

It actually makes me feel a little bit better about the slightly more obscure platforms of pro-ana of the early 2000s \u2026 not something I\u2019m at all saying was a shining point in time in terms of my character, but imo, those spaces existing on their own domains was maybe less overt in exposing itself to anyone who didn\u2019t seek it out. I ended up deleting my twitter account entirely, I kept the app, mostly just so reading the weather and local news tweets would be convenient. I agree with you that empathy is difficult here. Obviously those folks are sick, and that\u2019s a place I\u2019ve been.. but that doesn\u2019t mean accountability shouldn\u2019t exist simultaneously. It can be fairly triggering on bad days, and just upsetting other times. I really can\u2019t reconcile it for myself, or change it, so I just do what I can to limit my own time and associations on social media ed and recovery communities.",

My parents wouldn't allow me, I'm a minor and the only phone that can make calls is always with my mother. The only place nearby I could ask for help from is like 10 miles away too, since I live In a tiny town. \n\nShutting down accounts of people who have eating disorders isn't going to fix their problems if the only reason they're doing this online is because they were so desperate and knew they couldn't get help. Just going to blankly state it now. Nobody just doesn't want help for no reason.",
