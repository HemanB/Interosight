  "selftext": "I wander groggily up the stairs, battling my lower level movement urges, fighting myself against OCD urges to walk around the block 3 times before breakfast. I pace up and down the stairs, finding some comfort in it before getting aggravated at myself and stopping again.\n\nThis shit is hard. Compensatory behaviors are a bitch and the thoughts of eating a cookie right after eating pizza for dinner because I decided to \u2018extra challenge\u2019 myself swarm in my head. I still have to eat breakfast though and I know that. I just have to forget. Eat and forget. But first coffee.\n\nUp the stairs again to the kurieg which is already set up for me, pod in place, cup under spout. My fiance treats me so well, getting up at 4:30am for work and still finding time to get my shit in order (or at least the coffee portion of it). I smile and grip the handle, pulling down the lid of the coffee machine and as i do a post it note reveals itself on the top of the machine: \u2018thank you for eating a cookie and having a sip of my soda with me last night. I love you. You\u2019re doing great.\u2019\n\nSometimes the things we do dont seem like they\u2019re enough or it seems like we are the only ones who know the volume of the noise in our heads, but those notes remind me that no matter what, someone knows how hard it is and they\u2019ll always be proud of me for trying",
