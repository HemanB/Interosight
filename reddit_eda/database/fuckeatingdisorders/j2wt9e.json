  "selftext": "In 2018, I was an active member of a pro-eating disorder website. Every day, I would scroll through the site obsessively for hours. I would read forum post after forum post about really triggering things to motivate myself to continue destroying my mind and body. Most regrettably, though, I would post the worst, most triggering things multiple times a day. One of these forums was dedicated to something called \"body checks\", where people posted images of their bodies (usually in some state of undress) as a way to visually measure physical changes. For months, I posted in this forum nearly every day. \n\nMy sick body is out on the internet. It's there for everyone to see. I cannot imagine how many people I triggered with my content. I regret my actions so deeply. Without intending to, I fueled people's disorder. I gave them reasons to keep hurting themselves. I gave them images, posts about my obsessive exercise routine, and fatphobia to read. I gave them material to take notes from to apply in real life. I participated in a destructive, toxic community. For that, I am so sorry. \n\nI am so glad I've left that community and haven't returned to it in two years now. I NEVER want to be part of that toxicity again. Instead, I want to motivate others to embrace themselves as they are and continue choosing recovery. I want to be a better person. I hope that as the years go by, I can participate more in the recovery community. Everyone deserves to accept and love who they are, and nobody deserves to live in misery. If you are actively participating in the pro-ED community, I highly encourage you to leave; as much as your ED will be pissed at first, you are doing yourself a favor.",
