The same was true for this woman.  About 8 months after they left treatment the beautiful lady died in her sleep.  She had truly been getting better, but the damage to her heart was done and her death came with no warning.  \n\nYou don't know the damage you are doing that isn't immediately obvious.  You are missing out on SO MUCH by  starving--physically, emotionally, socially, etc.  Life is pretty short, and you owe it to yourself to make the best of it and enjoy it, which you cannot do in the depths of ED.  If you don't have anyone else, please DM me when you need someone to talk you through it.  You DESERVE all the wonderful things life has to offer.  I'll be thinking about you.",

      "body": "I\u2019ve been involuntarily hospitalized at BMIs <13 three times. The first time, before I was hospitalized, I could barely stand for longer than ten minutes. The second time I was so consumed with burning calories even though I could no longer exert myself beyond walking I would spend nearly every waking moment attempting to pace or fidget. I could barely read. Every night my legs were so stiff I would collapse into bed and be unable to move until I woke up the next morning.\n\nThe last time was the single most terrifying experience of my life. I\u2019ve never been so scared of my own brain. I lost every scrape of cognition outside of contemplating food. Nearly every day I would black out completely at some point, urinate myself on the way to the bathroom and struggle for minutes to heave myself up off the toilet, struggle each night to heave blankets over my body and push them off of myself in the morning, struggle each afternoon when I was briefly invigorated by a small meal to go for a compulsory walk, a walk that had dwindled from ten miles to one mile over a month of sharp decline, a walk that I eventually collapsed on, prompting a stranger to finally call an ambulance on me. My whole body was evidently falling apart, but what moved me from the emergency department to a bed in the ICU in short order this time around was, specifically, my failing liver. Rhabdomyolysis brought on by a one-mile walk.\n\nDespite my daily agony, the most horrifying moment of all came after I\u2019d been committed for a couple of weeks, when the hospital psychiatrist gathered my care team around to show me three CT scans of a human brain: one belonging to a healthy 26 year old, one belonging to an 83 year old experiencing the onset of dementia, and one of a 20-year-old anorexic patient, mine.\n\nThe first was unremarkable: grey and white matter nearly filling out the cranium. The second was markedly worn, potholes of cerebral spinal fluid indicating deterioration accrued over a life of aging. The third had the worst degradation of all. My brain looked rotted. Black chasms of cerebral spinal fluid occupied the spaces where my body had cannibalized itself in a desperate bid for glucose, taking anything it could find.\n\nSuddenly all of my insanity made sense. I was shaken to sobs. I knew the dilapidation of my brain was just a snapshot of what the rest of my organs looked like. It was evident even on my skin, which was speckled all over with tiny red and purple bruises: capillaries that had burst from the exertion of simple movements. Years-old scars, long-healed, had turned a nightmarish black. I didn\u2019t understand how a body could withstand it. The tendons in my knee felt for weeks like they\u2019d been slashed with a knife. I am still rattled to the point of crying recalling this. I cannot comprehend the power of this disease. I could not, still cannot, comprehend what drove me to such a slow, agonizing suicide. I cannot comprehend the paradox of a body fighting to hard simultaneously to die and survive all at once.\nEven in the hospital, I hid food at nearly every meal. I lied constantly to everyone before, during, and after they\u2019d committed me for being too incompetent to save my own life. My previous experiences with anorexia feel trivial compared to my last relapse. Before this last go around, I still felt like a human. I felt like a sick girl whose fatal flaw was vanity. This relapse turned me into a feral animal. All volition in my eating disorder dissipated. I didn\u2019t want to be skinny. I didn\u2019t want anything. The motive was gone, the plot was gone, all that was left was the death march.\n\nIn the hospital, I lost all mobility. The bedrest combined with the sudden ten pounds of edema turned my body from one that couldn\u2019t go up stairs to one that couldn\u2019t get off a bed. I couldn\u2019t lift my neck or walk for three weeks. Once I laid flat, a nurse had to assist me back into a sitting position. And tuck me in every night. And lift me onto the bedside commode. It might\u2019ve been humiliating if I hadn\u2019t already lost every ounce of my dignity.\n\nAnyway. I\u2019ve been out of hospital for a little over a year now. I gave recovery a good college try before becoming so horrified by the fat on my still-underweight body that I\u2019ve now settled into what is apparently a permanent uncomfortable quasi-recovery limbo, not gaining weight, not actively dying quite as fast. I don\u2019t know what my brain looks like now, but I know full, \u201cnormal\u201d cognition apparently doesn\u2019t resume in recovered anorexics until their menstruation has returned for a number of months, and I haven\u2019t had a period in eight years. I expect it doesn\u2019t look good, if my state of mind is any indication. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to me. I hope I die soon, hopefully by accident. I wouldn\u2019t wish this disease on anyone. I wish more than anything that I could beg my younger self to turn back while she still could. If you feel like you still can, do it. \nDo it now. Nothing is worth this.\n\nSorry for the ramble. I wasn\u2019t expecting to wind up typing all this out when I saw this post! Ugh anyway, yeah. Wishing you lots of strength.\n\nedit: typo, formatting",

      "body": "There is death in its physical sense - the ceasing of the body to function - but in my experience, it is the death of the spirit, of the self, that has been most relevant and, I think, is often forgotten. And yet it is fatefully tragic. The way anorexia kills your personality, sucks the life from you until you are an empty shell of who you once were. You can't think, you can't laugh, you can't feel... just numbness, nothing. People around you are laughing at parties, with friends around bonfires, cookouts, going out for drinks... but anorexia won't let you go to those events - what about the food, the calories, will there be something there I can eat? And even if anorexia does let you go, you won't be present; how could you be, when your mind is filled with thoughts of food, numbers, anxiety, when your body and mind is so tired from malnourishment and the stress of it all. Everything becomes a blur.\n\nYour goals, your passions, your dreams? There will be little room left in your mind, in your heart, for those either. You will watch those around you pursue their dreams, their goals...fall in love, explore the world, meet people, learn new hobbies, start families, careers... and the dreams you once had for yourself, those will slowly slip between your fingers, until they become dead, now just shadowy memories of something you once held so dear, so important to you, to the true and authentic you, which has been buried beneath the eating disorder. The only important thing becomes the eating disorder itself. Anorexia will convince you that it's keeping you safe, that it's keeping you in control. But really all its doing is making your life smaller and smaller, until it feels like there is nothing left. Just you and the eating disorder. Life becomes void of color, of depth, of meaning and purpose... unless, of course, you truly find meaning in life in eating as little as possible and striving to be the smallest one in the room. \n\nI say all this not to paint a hopeless picture of an eating disorder... because there is ALWAYS HOPE. I want to remind you (and myself, too) of the more insidious ways anorexia kills. Every day you spend immersed in the eating disorder is a day of your one and precious life, succumbed to the anorexia. And every day you stick with recovery, you are living... you are alive, and you are planting the seeds for a brighter tomorrow. \n\nKeep fighting for your life, for the kind of life YOU want and you deserve, not the kind of emptiness your eating disorder will provide. You got this :)",

I got super weak and dizzy all the time; sometimes I would have to just immediately sit on the floor after getting out of bed because of it. My body temp would drop to around 96 degrees, and when it would, I would be totally zoned out and distant and slow mentally - it felt so bizarre. My period almost disappeared. And my hair started turning white from the ends up. Got hit with mild refeeding syndrome too - my body was so not used to eating that when I did, i would get really dizzy, my heart rate would go crazy high, and I literally would not be able to breathe (I could only get the most shallow breaths) for like 2-3 hours; I would have to lie on my side, sometimes on a cold floor, and not speak or move and concentrate solely on trying to breathe (thought it was panic attacks but it wasn't \ud83d\ude2d).

I know my ED could read health complications and a part of me could want them to scare me into recovery but my ED could also use them as reasons it's \"not that bad\" and can continue, or it's \"different because \\[insert excuse here\\].\" Let me just say a few things that might help motivate you to fight as har as you can for recovery. One is that life goes by fast. It's easy to think we have time to recover and then one day, all of this time just went by that we miss. It's okay to not know what we want in life, but we deserve a chance to experience the things we end up knowing we love, that we don't know about yet, if that makes sense. I had the worst depression and couldn't experience joy from my number one passion let alone ever imagine I'd find a passion I didn't yet know at the time. It was hard to motivate myself in treatment, because I was scared and uncomfortable and didn't know what I wanted, felt lost and trapped and without a clear direction. A part of me wanted to \"keep my body alive incase I ever want it\" and I literally journaled that, but I didn't know what for.  \n\n\nThings I wish I did differently\u2026I wish I took care of my teeth, my bones (both can seem fine and then suddenly it all catches up), didn't go through terrifying heart complications that can happen to any of us unexpectedly, etc. There's no rock bottom and there's no worst ED or \"sick enough\" that suddenly makes recovering easier. Every person my ED was jealous of is gone now and much too young. I feel sick even saying that word, but I admit that even if only for a moment, it was, it's part of the heinous disease. You have to recover for you. It's okay to do it for other people along the way, but in the end we're the person we have to do it for. And we have to believe ourselves, trust ourselves and remind ourselves how serious it is, because it will try to mess with our minds and tell us any lie to go back to it.",

      "body": "I made the mistake of reading everyone else's comments before I made my own - I stupidly wasn't prepared for the onslaught of emotions and dose of reality - so this isn't going to be as ~~long~~ (lol this still ended up long I'm sorry) or as meaningful as I was planning. I'm sorry. I wanted this to be much more succinct for you, but it's probably going to be a jumbled mess because my brain is also a jumbled mess. (to be clear, the other comments aren't bad - they're amazing! But they hit close to home and I hadn't prepared my emotions, something that I absolutely should have done. I want to thank EVERYBODY for your stories. I'm going to be holding them all, and you all along with them, for as long as I can.)\n\n\nTo put it bluntly: my heart is fucked. I have done irreparable damage. I'm on medication, but because I'm not even close to being in recovery, the medication dose has to be adjusted frequently. It just stops working every couple of months. My cardiologist wants me to change meds, but my extremely unwell brain won't let me do it because it *might* cause weight gain. Because weight gain is worse than my failing heart, apparently /s (**it's not worse. I *should* be choosing to change meds. I *should* be choosing a healthy heart. I *should* be choosing fucking weight gain. Don't be like me.**)\n\n\nSo my heart just keeps getting sicker, along with the rest of me. Any sort of movement, and my heart rate goes to the 140s. Standing up and/or walking, 150s. If I try to run or do anything more strenuous than walking, it decides that the 180s or higher is where it's at. Then it takes literally hours for it to come back down. Sometimes, if it gets too high or it takes too long to come down, it makes me vomit. \n\n\nHeart palpitations. Fainting. BP problems. Bradycardia at random times too, because apparently my heart can't only exist at one end of the extremes. \n\n\nAmbulance rides and hours in emergency because my heart is shitting itself and making me cold and sweaty and pale. Markers in my blood that indicate bad things are happening, but choosing to leave emergency and \"wait and see\" instead of getting the scans I realistically know I need, and then justifying it to myself because the D Dimer levels were only \"slightly\" high so it's fine. \n\n\nIf dying doesn't actively happen by my own hand, I'm sure it will be my heart that gets me. Even if I was in recovery, which I am very much not, my cardiologist has made it pretty clear that my heart cannot heal anymore. The best I can hope for is doing no more damage, but we both know that's probably not going to happen either. \n\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, my heart crapping out is not a matter of *if* - it's a matter of *when*.\n\n\nI haven't told the people in my life who know about my ED how bad my heart is. They know it has problems, but they don't know it's irreparable. They don't know how rapidly it's been getting worse. They don't know I'm refusing to try the medication that will probably help slow down the damage because I'm too fucking scared of gaining weight. They don't know, and I don't want them to know. I can't bring myself to make the choice to tell them because then all they'll have is the burden of knowing my body is failing without any hope of undoing the damage that has been done. \n\n\nI don't know how much longer my heart will last, but I do know it's not going to get me to any significant age. It may have somehow got me to 30, but, to be honest, I doubt it'll get me much further.\n\n\nI also want to say one more thing. You don't have to be severely underweight for an extended period of time to become this unwell. You can become this unwell and never even get to underweight. My lowest BMI was (no specifics, just ranges under spoilers) >!between 13 and 15!<, and I was there for less than a year. I've mow been underweight for quite some time (but aside from that one time, never below >!between 16.5 and 18!<), but I have spent far, far, *far* longer with a \"healthy\" BMI. My heart problems started being bad enough for medication and a regular cardiologist when I was a \"healthy\" weight and a while before the period where I was at my lowest - but healthy weights don't mean healthy behaviours or healthy bodies.\n\n\nTo reiterate: **bad stuff happening to your body, the stuff that is part of why EDs have such a high mortality rate, can happen no matter what weight you are. Even if you think you're fine because you're not severely severely underweight, even if you're trying to convince yourself your fine, if you are engaging in unhealthy behaviours *you are going to be doing damage to your body*. Don't assume you're not just based on your weight, because it's entirely likely you'd be wrong.**\n\n\nDon't be like me - do *better* than me. You don't have to let your eating disorder take the wheel.\n\n\nAs an aside - while not life threatening, lanugo fucking sucks. I don't particularly enjoy being fuzzy (although my fuzz looks less like fuzz and more just like really fine, but long, body hair now), especially not now it's bad enough for randoms to start noticing and commenting on, even if they're at a distance from me. But.. It's just another in a long line of shit I've forced, by way of my eating disorder, my body to do/become. Lanugo is not a joyful part of this disorder. You can also get lanugo at a \"healthy\" weight - just sayin'.\n\n\nDo better than I've done. You don't have to end up where I am. I know it's scary, but it's okay to recover - it'll be scarier to not recover and end up where I am.\n\n\nMake the decision to put the health of your body before your ED. It won't be easy, it won't even be linear, but it will be worth it. Your ED doesn't have to win. Choose the health of your body.",

A couple times I blacked out just from waking up from my bed. I remember once feeling it coming and, barely conscious and losing my vision, munching an apple that was on my night table and hoping it would make the heavy sensation it go away. Didn't work, fainted on my way back from the bathroom because I didn't want to pee on myself. It was always scary, but another time I fell very near my iron bedframe. It dawned on me that the fall could have broken my neck and none would have noticed, since I was very much alone. ED voice was put to sleep for some time after that, but I relapsed with full force a couple of years ago. My resting heart rate was as low as 40, thought it was because \"sporty\"; my mind was fucked and I would cross streets without looking and, on one ocassion, almost run on by a car while I was busy body checking me on a crystal wall at the other side of the street. During lockdowns I worked out so much that my brother half joked that he was afraid he will find me on the floor one day; once I was doing exercises lying down and he frantically ran to me. My dad would wake up in the middle of the night, \"negotiate\" with me for \"just\" 30 minutes more of exercise and appear exactly at the end of that time frame, not a second more, to see I was getting in bed. On the rare ocassion I felt compelled to have a bit more of food my mom would gently encourage me while the whole family stared at my quietly, as if not wanting to \"scare\" me and \"spoil\" the moment. I was dying before their eyes.\nDon't do this. The ED just wants one thing of you, and it's no good. Don't hear that bitch. Being her slave is much much worse than gaining weight, and  despite their lies it will never grant you freedom or happiness, I promise.",

I get to the hospital and can no longer walk  turns out my potassium was extremely low. I get transferred to another hospital, and I have the EMT guy pick me up and put me in my bed which was so embarrassing as my butt was hanging out my gown. Was only there for a month and some change. Had a PICC line hooked up to me, think my blood sugar was low don\u2019t know really as most of it was blur. My sister said I looked like death walking it scared the crap out of her. Once I got out didn\u2019t have a period for some months. I gained weight but I can not eat like I use to I get terrible reflux and stomach pain.  Also forgot to add I was very short of breathe and the nurses had to force me to walk using these handle bars I felt terrible really dizzy nauseous the thing they had me hook to I had to drag it around the room, I couldn\u2019t make it to the bathroom without my sisters help nurses were getting annoyed by me at that point. It was so embarrassing having strangers watch me pee being so helpless I felt so weak and lonely.  The nurses loved to remind me on repeat I was their youngest patient there, I felt like they were reminding me on repeat I did this to myself and I\u2019m taking up space for someone who had no choice. I am getting wayyyyy off focus anyway please don\u2019t end up like me or anyone else here throwing up acid is not pleasant!!!!!",

I had a giant bruise on my hand for 2 weeks after that because my body couldn\u2019t heal properly. \n\nOne time during a big relapse, I fainted while getting out of the car; if my mom hadn\u2019t been in a position to catch me, I probably would have cracked my head on the pavement. I was 14. This also happened not long after I had eaten, so it was just malnourishment showing its enduring effects. \n\nLater that year, I spent a day of my Thanksgiving vacation in the ER. Then, instead of getting to come home after said vacation, I was taken to the ER at the hospital on the way back. They gave me a glucose IV and when it went in, my entire body felt like it was on fire. I began convulsing in the hospital bed as if I were being electrocuted. Later that night, I watched as my heart rate dipped below 30.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve gone through periods of time where I could pull handfuls of hair out of my head; I\u2019ve watched my fingers first turn blue and then lose circulation entirely despite being in warm weather; I\u2019ve had to wear a heart monitor while trying to socialize like a normal person in college; I\u2019ve nearly passed out while driving, exercising, teaching a class. By my early 20s, I had the bone density of an old woman. Even when the physiological effects weren\u2019t immediately apparent, all other aspects of my life were under threat. The ED has torn apart my relationships with family, friends, and partners. Hell, even other people\u2019s pets act weirdly around me when I\u2019m relapsing.\n\nThe way I see it, recovery is a lot like quitting cigarettes. The longer you delay it, the more difficult it will get; the disorder will consume your entire life and wreak havoc on your body, ultimately sending you to an early grave. And for what, a feeling of control? That feeling is purely an illusion. If it does kill you, are you really the one in control in the end?",

No one talked about my weight to me, no one suggested i get better, no one really said anything, so I figured i still looked on the upper side of average weight range. I didn\u2019t think I \n\nBut the scariest thing is, looking back at myself, I was SO close to dying. In multiple ways.\n1. I didn\u2019t see my weight. I didn\u2019t see how bad it was. And i would read about people saying things like that, and i would think \u201coh there is no way that\u2019s happening to me\u201d but like.. it did. And if I kept going, I don\u2019t think I EVER would\u2019ve known. I would have died if I kept going, because I would always THINK i\u2019d be satisfied when it happened, but looking back, I wouldn\u2019t have even realized when to stop.\n2. There was this one occasion where I got heat stroke. And like, I was scared shitless. No one took me to the hospital when I said I needed to, but they told me that gatorade would help me. And I told them no, that I couldn\u2019t drink the gatorade. That I wouldn\u2019t. But my heart was WEAK. And the heat stroke could have actually killed me. And I knew that. But I still couldn\u2019t drink the gatorade. The fact that my disorder had me choosing risking death over drinking gatorade because there were calories is terrifying.\n3. Sometimes I would wake up and my heart would be so weak that I couldn\u2019t stand. I would have to crawl to the kitchen, and cook on the floor, and eat on the floor. It felt like if I stood up, I would die. I would be on the floor for about 2 hours before I felt safe enough to stand.\n4. I\u2019ve gained weight in recovery. And I finally feel safe to walk outside again. Back when I was disordered, I would go on long walks compulsively, often through bad neighborhoods. And if somebody stabbed me, I would die. My body wouldn\u2019t have been able to protect me. When skin is the only thing covering your vital organs, death feels way closer. If anyone stabbed me, it would be so easy to kill me. And if anyone grabbed me, I wouldn\u2019t be able to fight back or get away. \n5. If not now, in 10 years. If not then, in 20. I would have killed myself with my disorder eventually, it was literally only a matter of time. If not recovery, you\u2019re choosing death. I\u2019m 23, I recovered at 22. I think if I stayed as sick as I was at 22, and stayed like that for years, age would have caught up to me. What I was doing at 22 could have VERY well killed me at 27, especially with the long term erosion of health that comes with having it for years.\n\nI would have killed myself in some way if I kept going. Not by being too skinny, but by psychologically being more obsessed with food/weight than with survival. It would have killed me eventually regardless of weight. And even if it WAS because of weight, there was no possible way I would have seen it coming.",

          "body": "I\u2019ve been involuntarily hospitalized at BMIs <13 three times. The first time, before I was hospitalized, I could barely stand for longer than ten minutes. The second time I was so consumed with burning calories even though I could no longer exert myself beyond walking I would spend nearly every waking moment attempting to pace or fidget. I could barely read. Every night my legs were so stiff I would collapse into bed and be unable to move until I woke up the next morning.\n\nThe last time was the single most terrifying experience of my life. I\u2019ve never been so scared of my own brain. I lost every scrape of cognition outside of contemplating food. Nearly every day I would black out completely at some point, urinate myself on the way to the bathroom and struggle for minutes to heave myself up off the toilet, struggle each night to heave blankets over my body and push them off of myself in the morning, struggle each afternoon when I was briefly invigorated by a small meal to go for a compulsory walk, a walk that had dwindled from ten miles to one mile over a month of sharp decline, a walk that I eventually collapsed on, prompting a stranger to finally call an ambulance on me. My whole body was evidently falling apart, but what moved me from the emergency department to a bed in the ICU in short order this time around was, specifically, my failing liver. Rhabdomyolysis brought on by a one-mile walk.\n\nDespite my daily agony, the most horrifying moment of all came after I\u2019d been committed for a couple of weeks, when the hospital psychiatrist gathered my care team around to show me three CT scans of a human brain: one belonging to a healthy 26 year old, one belonging to an 83 year old experiencing the onset of dementia, and one of a 20-year-old anorexic patient, mine.\n\nThe first was unremarkable: grey and white matter nearly filling out the cranium. The second was markedly worn, potholes of cerebral spinal fluid indicating deterioration accrued over a life of aging. The third had the worst degradation of all. My brain looked rotted. Black chasms of cerebral spinal fluid occupied the spaces where my body had cannibalized itself in a desperate bid for glucose, taking anything it could find.\n\nSuddenly all of my insanity made sense. I was shaken to sobs. I knew the dilapidation of my brain was just a snapshot of what the rest of my organs looked like. It was evident even on my skin, which was speckled all over with tiny red and purple bruises: capillaries that had burst from the exertion of simple movements. Years-old scars, long-healed, had turned a nightmarish black. I didn\u2019t understand how a body could withstand it. The tendons in my knee felt for weeks like they\u2019d been slashed with a knife. I am still rattled to the point of crying recalling this. I cannot comprehend the power of this disease. I could not, still cannot, comprehend what drove me to such a slow, agonizing suicide. I cannot comprehend the paradox of a body fighting to hard simultaneously to die and survive all at once.\nEven in the hospital, I hid food at nearly every meal. I lied constantly to everyone before, during, and after they\u2019d committed me for being too incompetent to save my own life. My previous experiences with anorexia feel trivial compared to my last relapse. Before this last go around, I still felt like a human. I felt like a sick girl whose fatal flaw was vanity. This relapse turned me into a feral animal. All volition in my eating disorder dissipated. I didn\u2019t want to be skinny. I didn\u2019t want anything. The motive was gone, the plot was gone, all that was left was the death march.\n\nIn the hospital, I lost all mobility. The bedrest combined with the sudden ten pounds of edema turned my body from one that couldn\u2019t go up stairs to one that couldn\u2019t get off a bed. I couldn\u2019t lift my neck or walk for three weeks. Once I laid flat, a nurse had to assist me back into a sitting position. And tuck me in every night. And lift me onto the bedside commode. It might\u2019ve been humiliating if I hadn\u2019t already lost every ounce of my dignity.\n\nAnyway. I\u2019ve been out of hospital for a little over a year now. I gave recovery a good college try before becoming so horrified by the fat on my still-underweight body that I\u2019ve now settled into what is apparently a permanent uncomfortable quasi-recovery limbo, not gaining weight, not actively dying quite as fast. I don\u2019t know what my brain looks like now, but I know full, \u201cnormal\u201d cognition apparently doesn\u2019t resume in recovered anorexics until their menstruation has returned for a number of months, and I haven\u2019t had a period in eight years.

          "body": "I\u2019ve been involuntarily hospitalized at BMIs <13 three times. The first time, before I was hospitalized, I could barely stand for longer than ten minutes. The second time I was so consumed with burning calories even though I could no longer exert myself beyond walking I would spend nearly every waking moment attempting to pace or fidget. I could barely read. Every night my legs were so stiff I would collapse into bed and be unable to move until I woke up the next morning.\n\nThe last time was the single most terrifying experience of my life. I\u2019ve never been so scared of my own brain. I lost every scrape of cognition outside of contemplating food. Nearly every day I would black out completely at some point, urinate myself on the way to the bathroom and struggle for minutes to heave myself up off the toilet, struggle each night to heave blankets over my body and push them off of myself in the morning, struggle each afternoon when I was briefly invigorated by a small meal to go for a compulsory walk, a walk that had dwindled from ten miles to one mile over a month of sharp decline, a walk that I eventually collapsed on, prompting a stranger to finally call an ambulance on me. My whole body was evidently falling apart, but what moved me from the emergency department to a bed in the ICU in short order this time around was, specifically, my failing liver. Rhabdomyolysis brought on by a one-mile walk.\n\nDespite my daily agony, the most horrifying moment of all came after I\u2019d been committed for a couple of weeks, when the hospital psychiatrist gathered my care team around to show me three CT scans of a human brain: one belonging to a healthy 26 year old, one belonging to an 83 year old experiencing the onset of dementia, and one of a 20-year-old anorexic patient, mine.\n\nThe first was unremarkable: grey and white matter nearly filling out the cranium. The second was markedly worn, potholes of cerebral spinal fluid indicating deterioration accrued over a life of aging. The third had the worst degradation of all. My brain looked rotted. Black chasms of cerebral spinal fluid occupied the spaces where my body had cannibalized itself in a desperate bid for glucose, taking anything it could find.\n\nSuddenly all of my insanity made sense. I was shaken to sobs. I knew the dilapidation of my brain was just a snapshot of what the rest of my organs looked like. It was evident even on my skin, which was speckled all over with tiny red and purple bruises: capillaries that had burst from the exertion of simple movements. Years-old scars, long-healed, had turned a nightmarish black. I didn\u2019t understand how a body could withstand it. The tendons in my knee felt for weeks like they\u2019d been slashed with a knife. I am still rattled to the point of crying recalling this. I cannot comprehend the power of this disease. I could not, still cannot, comprehend what drove me to such a slow, agonizing suicide. I cannot comprehend the paradox of a body fighting to hard simultaneously to die and survive all at once.\nEven in the hospital, I hid food at nearly every meal. I lied constantly to everyone before, during, and after they\u2019d committed me for being too incompetent to save my own life. My previous experiences with anorexia feel trivial compared to my last relapse. Before this last go around, I still felt like a human. I felt like a sick girl whose fatal flaw was vanity. This relapse turned me into a feral animal. All volition in my eating disorder dissipated. I didn\u2019t want to be skinny. I didn\u2019t want anything. The motive was gone, the plot was gone, all that was left was the death march.\n\nIn the hospital, I lost all mobility. The bedrest combined with the sudden ten pounds of edema turned my body from one that couldn\u2019t go up stairs to one that couldn\u2019t get off a bed. I couldn\u2019t lift my neck or walk for three weeks. Once I laid flat, a nurse had to assist me back into a sitting position. And tuck me in every night. And lift me onto the bedside commode. It might\u2019ve been humiliating if I hadn\u2019t already lost every ounce of my dignity.\n\nAnyway. I\u2019ve been out of hospital for a little over a year now. I gave recovery a good college try before becoming so horrified by the fat on my still-underweight body that I\u2019ve now settled into what is apparently a permanent uncomfortable quasi-recovery limbo, not gaining weight, not actively dying quite as fast. I don\u2019t know what my brain looks like now, but I know full, \u201cnormal\u201d cognition apparently doesn\u2019t resume in recovered anorexics until their menstruation has returned for a number of months, and I haven\u2019t had a period in eight years. I expect it doesn\u2019t look good, if my state of mind is any indication. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to me. I hope I die soon, hopefully by accident.

          "body": "I\u2019ve been involuntarily hospitalized at BMIs <13 three times. The first time, before I was hospitalized, I could barely stand for longer than ten minutes. The second time I was so consumed with burning calories even though I could no longer exert myself beyond walking I would spend nearly every waking moment attempting to pace or fidget. I could barely read. Every night my legs were so stiff I would collapse into bed and be unable to move until I woke up the next morning.\n\nThe last time was the single most terrifying experience of my life. I\u2019ve never been so scared of my own brain. I lost every scrape of cognition outside of contemplating food. Nearly every day I would black out completely at some point, urinate myself on the way to the bathroom and struggle for minutes to heave myself up off the toilet, struggle each night to heave blankets over my body and push them off of myself in the morning, struggle each afternoon when I was briefly invigorated by a small meal to go for a compulsory walk, a walk that had dwindled from ten miles to one mile over a month of sharp decline, a walk that I eventually collapsed on, prompting a stranger to finally call an ambulance on me. My whole body was evidently falling apart, but what moved me from the emergency department to a bed in the ICU in short order this time around was, specifically, my failing liver. Rhabdomyolysis brought on by a one-mile walk.\n\nDespite my daily agony, the most horrifying moment of all came after I\u2019d been committed for a couple of weeks, when the hospital psychiatrist gathered my care team around to show me three CT scans of a human brain: one belonging to a healthy 26 year old, one belonging to an 83 year old experiencing the onset of dementia, and one of a 20-year-old anorexic patient, mine.\n\nThe first was unremarkable: grey and white matter nearly filling out the cranium. The second was markedly worn, potholes of cerebral spinal fluid indicating deterioration accrued over a life of aging. The third had the worst degradation of all. My brain looked rotted. Black chasms of cerebral spinal fluid occupied the spaces where my body had cannibalized itself in a desperate bid for glucose, taking anything it could find.\n\nSuddenly all of my insanity made sense. I was shaken to sobs. I knew the dilapidation of my brain was just a snapshot of what the rest of my organs looked like. It was evident even on my skin, which was speckled all over with tiny red and purple bruises: capillaries that had burst from the exertion of simple movements. Years-old scars, long-healed, had turned a nightmarish black. I didn\u2019t understand how a body could withstand it. The tendons in my knee felt for weeks like they\u2019d been slashed with a knife. I am still rattled to the point of crying recalling this. I cannot comprehend the power of this disease. I could not, still cannot, comprehend what drove me to such a slow, agonizing suicide. I cannot comprehend the paradox of a body fighting to hard simultaneously to die and survive all at once.\nEven in the hospital, I hid food at nearly every meal. I lied constantly to everyone before, during, and after they\u2019d committed me for being too incompetent to save my own life. My previous experiences with anorexia feel trivial compared to my last relapse. Before this last go around, I still felt like a human. I felt like a sick girl whose fatal flaw was vanity. This relapse turned me into a feral animal. All volition in my eating disorder dissipated. I didn\u2019t want to be skinny. I didn\u2019t want anything. The motive was gone, the plot was gone, all that was left was the death march.\n\nIn the hospital, I lost all mobility. The bedrest combined with the sudden ten pounds of edema turned my body from one that couldn\u2019t go up stairs to one that couldn\u2019t get off a bed. I couldn\u2019t lift my neck or walk for three weeks. Once I laid flat, a nurse had to assist me back into a sitting position. And tuck me in every night. And lift me onto the bedside commode. It might\u2019ve been humiliating if I hadn\u2019t already lost every ounce of my dignity.\n\nAnyway. I\u2019ve been out of hospital for a little over a year now. I gave recovery a good college try before becoming so horrified by the fat on my still-underweight body that I\u2019ve now settled into what is apparently a permanent uncomfortable quasi-recovery limbo, not gaining weight, not actively dying quite as fast. I don\u2019t know what my brain looks like now, but I know full, \u201cnormal\u201d cognition apparently doesn\u2019t resume in recovered anorexics until their menstruation has returned for a number of months, and I haven\u2019t had a period in eight years. I expect it doesn\u2019t look good, if my state of mind is any indication. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to me. I hope I die soon, hopefully by accident. I wouldn\u2019t wish this disease on anyone. I wish more than anything that I could beg my younger self to turn back while she still could. If you feel like you still can, do it. \nDo it now. Nothing is worth this.\n\nSorry for the ramble. I wasn\u2019t expecting to wind up typing all this out when I saw this post! Ugh anyway, yeah.
