If you started out overweight though you\u2019re probably gonna end up overweight again as your body tries to recover. The reason I keep relapsing is because I keep ending up overweight in recovery and get jerks telling me if I ended up overweight again then I never really had a problem. It makes me feel inferior and undeserving of recovery and then I end up relapsing.",

It made it really hard to learn to be ok with my body the way it is when I kept hearing the other people in treatment reassure each other that they wouldn\u2019t the way I look now. \n\nEven if it is true that someone likely won\u2019t be fat when they recover, trying to make someone feel better by saying that doesn\u2019t help anyone. It only continues to reinforce the idea that being fat is something to be afraid of. It tells people that food freedom is ok only if your body looks a certain way (which is totally not true!)\n\nI\u2019m really proud of how far I\u2019ve come in learning to accept my body the way it is. I no longer want to try and lose weight despite people in my life still telling me I should. I hope you can learn to accept your body no matter the size too. \ud83d\udc9b",
