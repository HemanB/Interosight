They might be exaggerating the time period, or often they'll mean they didn't have any meals in that time period, but did snack or drink like, a couple lattes \ud83d\ude1d It's not always what it seems at face value, people tend to eat and forget \ud83e\udd37 But definitely tell them you aren't comfortable talking about it anyway x",
