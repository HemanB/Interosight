I am always so amazed when people around my eat until they are full and satisfied and stop, it's a sensation I can't even imagine and I want to feel it so bad. My therapist says I'm not biologically hungry but I'm trying to feed my pain and therefore will never feel full.\n\nI don't deal with this well, I end up restricting during the day so I can pig out for 2 hours in the evening and eat constantly for those 2-3 hours before bed I regularly get up to 2,000/3,000 in that binge time even though I eat low nutrient dense stuff. I'm too scared of the amount I would eat if not restrictive for most of the day, and it's very easy to restrict if you know eating isn't going to make the hunger stop anyway. At least have a few hours where I am eating every moment and not bothered by the hunger but I don't suggest doing this at all I need to find a way out of my current habbit.",

I\u2019ve been going thru recovery for almost two years and I STILL have days where no matter what I eat, I\u2019m still hungry. But clearly your body needs extra nourishment so try instead of thinking of it as a bad thing think of it as you treating your body with proper care and giving it what it needs. Your metabolism is messed with when you binge/restrict so it\u2019s just trying to find its sweet spot again! I promise",
