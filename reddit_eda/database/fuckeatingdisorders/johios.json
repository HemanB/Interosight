Getting more protein helps a LOT btw, I personally added a protein shake that I now use to make different things such as protein pancakes/waffles with tons of fruit and I stay full for longer than if I had something else (I use Quest vanilla flavored protein powder, you can google protein recipes). People also often say oatmeal is great for filling you up longer and it's true. I started drinking more green tea during or after meals, to give me a fuller feeling and it can help you quell cravings. In the past in an active eating disorder I would have abused these tactics to starve myself, but when utilized with healthy calorie intake, they really are game changers. It's about finding which foods work for you and creating tactics to keep you as full/satiated as possible so you get the most enjoyment out of your food possible. \n\nGood luck, OP, you've got this.",
