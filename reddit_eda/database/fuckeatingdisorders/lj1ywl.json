  "title": "Can we talk about how amazing peanut butter is?",
  "selftext": "Ive seen so many posts here, on IG and in blogs about how so many of us went through a peanut butter phase in recovery. Peanut butter was one of the foods I fucking loved even when I was actively anorexic, but I only allowed myself one tablespoon of a specific brand once a day, maybe two if I restricted enough. It was basically the only \u201ctreat\u201d I consistently allowed myself but it was *never* enough. I always wanted more but the fear and anxiety that thought caused me obviously dominated my choices. I even bought \u201czero calorie peanut butter\u201d that was the worst thing id ever tasted, but I ate it because I wanted peanut butter so much.\n\nThe first month I started recovery, I remember I went through two of those big ass honey flavored Jif jars within a week and a half and it was amazing. I put that shit on everything. Toast, pb&js, bagels, oatmeal, waffles, smoothies, fruits, nuts, pretzels, desserts. I ate it straight out of the jar, fat ass spoonful after fat ass spoonful. Sometimes I\u2019d change it up and buy almond butters and sun butters. It made weight restoration so much easier, and I still eat a spoonful almost everyday.\n\nIt\u2019s crazy how this time last year, I was precisely measuring out a stupid tablespoon of peanut butter and giving myself a fucking conniption if i wasn\u2019t 100% sure it was exactly a tablespoon. Today, I am grateful for peanut butter, and all the other nut butters that graced me with their delicious presence throughout my recovery.",
