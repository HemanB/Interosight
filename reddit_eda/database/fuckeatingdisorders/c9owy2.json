  "title": "Recovery: from Halo Top to Ben & Jerry's",
  "selftext": "Ice cream was my biggest binge food, my biggest fear food, my biggest \"I'll never be able to control myself around it\" food. Even when I felt very much recovered from binge eating (which had been caused by restricting), I still bought low-cal ice cream: off-brand Halo Top, almond milk mousse, and greek yogurt bars.\n\nEarlier today, I bought two pints of Ben and Jerry's. And not the lowish-cal moophoria, either. **THE REAL STUFF** with cookie dough chunks, brownie chunks, and two kinds of ice cream in one pint. This is the stuff my mom wouldn't even let me buy when I was a kid because it was so full of junk.\n\nTonight, I scooped out some ice cream into a bowl (probs 1/4 of the container, about 300 cals), and I ate it. Wow, it was so goddamn good. I finished my small portion and it felt like a lot. I didn't want more, and the rest of the night has passed by and I haven't thought once about going back for more ice cream. It was so much more filling than eating a whole pint of Halo Top (and let's be honest, I never ate less than one pint--usually, I ate two). And I won't have those truly disgusting sugar alcohol farts tonight and tomorrow.\n\n**I didn't think I would ever be able to eat ice cream like a normal person.** I thought that even if I controlled my binging, I'd still have urges to eat full pints of ice cream, and I thought I'd spend the rest of my life just trying to fight intense desires to eat. I'm so proud of how far I've come.\n\nA brief synopsis of how I stopped binging, if anyone is interested:\n\n* I stopped counting calories **and** I stopped weighing myself **and I stopped worrying about my weight at all, even if I thought I was gaining,** The goal now was to stop binging, not to lose weight. You will keep binging if you don't give your body enough food.\n* I listened to my body (not to a calorie counter, not to the time of day, and not to other people around me) to decide when I was hungry and when I was full. I ate when I was hungry, whenever I was hungry. At first, I couldn't even tell when I was hungry and when I was full, but my hunger signals slowly returned.\n* I ate what I wanted to eat, even if it was too much food or it wasn't healthy food. **I didn't beat myself up** about anything relating to food: eating too much, eating something \"bad,\" eating out, feeling bloated or fat, not exercising as much as I thought I should, etc.\n* I re-introduced foods I had stopped eating in my restriction or things I only ate during a binge, like real butter (salted Kerrygold is an absolute tongue orgasm on toast), full-fat cheese, pizza, and **actual fucking PB&amp;J sandwiches with normal bread, normal jelly, and normal peanut butter.**\n* I didn't give up, even when recovery wasn't feeling good, like when I was gaining weight and wanting so badly to restrict to counteract it. I moved past binges. A binge doesn't equal a failure; stopping binge eating doesn't happen overnight or even in a week or two. Commit for the long haul to feed your body what it needs, no restriction.\n\nOne thing they don't tell you about recovery: I poop so much, you guys. I poop every day, sometimes twice a day! It's such a joy, tbh. And it's normal poop, not massive gross binge logs or tiny restriction deer nuggets. I love it.\n\nEDIT: another thing I did when I started my recovery was I STOPPED LOOKING AT 1200isplenty because it\u2019s hella NOT plenty for me and was encouraging me to restrict and then binge. I stopped reading most of the eating disorder subs, actually.",

I remember that feeling very well.\n\nThe fact that you're thinking about changing or doing something different (even if you're not sure what would be) is really good. I'm proud of you for thinking about what it would be like to let some of the disordered eating habits go. \n\nI had those feelings, too--abandoning my weight loss goals was one of the hardest things for me to do. It was painful to think about, like you said. But it got less painful the more I thought about it, and eventually, it didn't seem so hard to let go.\n\nMaybe it would be interesting to try having an emotionally detached outlook toward food. Like, no matter what you ate, you just thought about it as food, not good or bad. Not too much or too little, not healthy or unhealthy. Just food for your body. Same goes for your actual physical body--it's not too fat or too skinny, not too tall or too short, not too lean or too muscly. It's just you. \n\nMaybe that helps, maybe it doesn't--just something to think about. Another thing to think about: if it's within your means, therapy can be a life-changer, especially if you can find a therapist who specializes in eating disorders. You also said that it feels like everything is falling apart, and a therapist can help you with that feeling, too.\n\nI totally empathize with you, though. Crying is okay; I cried a lot, too. I'm just glad that you're thinking about doing things differently; even if it doesn't feel like you've done anything, that's a big step! Thanks for posting here. I'm sure this post wasn't the easiest thing to read; I remember reading people's success stories and just wanting to scream because I felt like such a failure; why couldn't I do what they were doing?

But it would probably help to try to let go of some of those fears",

I remember that feeling very well.\n\nThe fact that you're thinking about changing or doing something different (even if you're not sure what would be) is really good. I'm proud of you for thinking about what it would be like to let some of the disordered eating habits go. \n\nI had those feelings, too--abandoning my weight loss goals was one of the hardest things for me to do. It was painful to think about, like you said. But it got less painful the more I thought about it, and eventually, it didn't seem so hard to let go.\n\nMaybe it would be interesting to try having an emotionally detached outlook toward food. Like, no matter what you ate, you just thought about it as food, not good or bad. Not too much or too little, not healthy or unhealthy. Just food for your body. Same goes for your actual physical body--it's not too fat or too skinny, not too tall or too short, not too lean or too muscly. It's just you. \n\nMaybe that helps, maybe it doesn't--just something to think about. Another thing to think about: if it's within your means, therapy can be a life-changer, especially if you can find a therapist who specializes in eating disorders. You also said that it feels like everything is falling apart, and a therapist can help you with that feeling, too.\n\nI totally empathize with you, though. Crying is okay; I cried a lot, too. I'm just glad that you're thinking about doing things differently; even if it doesn't feel like you've done anything, that's a big step! Thanks for posting here. I'm sure this post wasn't the easiest thing to read; I remember reading people's success stories and just wanting to scream because I felt like such a failure; why couldn't I do what they were doing? It's a really hard journey, but I really wish you the best of luck. I'm already proud of you for moving forward even though so many hard things are happening in your life.",

I want to get better at lifting- I can already lift stronger than a lot of guys at my gym, even when I'm literally about to pass out. So I'd love to see how strong I could be if I nourished myself. And I want to run a marathon but I dont want it to be a disordered thing. So recovery has to be done but I just ack fucking hate myself",
