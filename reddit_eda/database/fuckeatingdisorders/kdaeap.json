  "title": "I never realized how badly magazines and instagram fucked up my perception of my body.",
  "selftext": "I was walking down the street today and caught a glimpse of my reflection in a store window, my first thought was, \"Omg, I look so bad, my body looks so... imperfect and unattractive.\" and then I looked at myself again and thought \"Wait wtf, what? I look hot, I look like the kind of girl that I would see walking down the street and think, \"wow, she's pretty!\" Why did I just think I looked bad?\"\n\nAnd I realized the reason I thought I looked frumpy and unattractive at first was because I didn't look like a picture perfect image, my back wasn't arched to death and my body wasn't twisted to make my waist look smaller and I wasn't posed and my tits weren't in my face, I was just... a human being, walking. I feel like most images of women I see are always these instagram-y magazine type poses where they're hyper posed and dolled up and perfect and it makes me often feel like if I don't look like I just stepped off of a magazine shoot then I look unattractive.\n\nAnd it just got me thinking about how EDs really don't develop in a vacuum. The shit that goes on around us affects that disordered voice in our heads too. It's hard to dissociate it and actually learn to view myself as attractive even if I don't look like that picture-perfect image, but I'm glad I'm learning to.",
