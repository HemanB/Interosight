  "selftext": "I AM SO FUCKING BEAUTIFUL. my stomach is not flat. and i LOVE IT. i have pimples all over my face and they're so CUTE. life is on my side. i hugged a tree today. i just stood there, surrounded by green moss and snow and sun on my face, hugging it. and if someone were to walk by i wouldn't move. i don't care if they think i'm weird. i just don't care! my sister's chocolate cake is DELICIOUS and i ate two servings because i'm ALIVE. i'm LIVING again. in the end it's all just so worth it. I LOVE MYSELF and i don't care if other people don't. i am human. i have bad days. i cry. and today, i've smiled so fucking much. keep pushing. you can do it. you CAN. every bite, every meal, every spoon of peanut butter and croissant and cake and moist blueberry muffin, every day is a step towards life. and you deserve it. you deserve to love yourself and live. you will gain so much more than just weight by recovering, spontaneity and creativity, health and energy for doing the things you love. this is your sign. eat the cookie or send that text. tell them you love them. just go for it. don't rush it. take your time. but know that life is waiting for you on the other side.",
