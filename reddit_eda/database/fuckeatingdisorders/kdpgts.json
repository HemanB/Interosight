  "title": "I just had two spoons of peanut butter and then stopped.",
  "selftext": "Before I started recovery, if I opened a jar of peanut butter I couldn't stop eating it until I was sick. I think I was just so hungry and my body was so deprived that when actual calories were available, I lost all self control.\n\nWell I've been making an effort to eat more consistently and well. My mom opened a new kind of peanut butter so I had a spoonful to try it. Then I had another because it was good. And that was it. I have no desire to even have more. I am finally satisfied with just one serving of a food a like. And counterintuitively it's all because I've been eating more. I was so concerned that recovery would lead to binges, but turns out the opposite happened instead :)",
