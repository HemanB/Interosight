It was like, \"Oh, yeah, that's pretty good, I could probably go for more, but I'm pretty full right now so I don't need it.\"\n\nI had almond butter 'n' bananas and wowzers...IT'S FUCKING NOTHING. It's almost as if eating enough food and not making it any food off-limits means that I'm not entering binge mode as my poor starving body clamors for fat, sugar, and calories.",
