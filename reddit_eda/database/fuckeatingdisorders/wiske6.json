  "title": "My 67-year-old mother has untreated disordered eating and it is really fucking with our relationship",
  "selftext": "I was diagnosed with having disordered eating issues and body dysmorphia in the process of going back to therapy a couple years ago. It's so obvious now looking back, but I never realized that my sisters' severe anorexia and my seriously disordered eating habits stemmed so greatly from my mothers' own issues. \n\nThis is a tale as old as time for mothers and daughters, I'm sure. \n\nAt this point, I'd say I'm in a state of recovery. My relationship with my self-image is becoming more positive and I'm far less distressed and preoccupied by weight and food. \n\nMy mother came to visit me a month ago and her disordered eating issues were extremely distressing to me. To some degree I have heightened awareness about her issues now, but I also believe they have worsened and I don't know how to deal with it. She's lost probably 30 pounds since I saw her for Christmas. \n\nEvery moment of her five days with me revolved around food: if we weren't talking about near-future eating, we were talking about what she does or doesn't eat, the weight she's losing (\"I lost two pounds after we came back from our vacation\"), and how proud she is of the little she eats (\"I realized I can eat half as many of the olives I like on my salad every day, I really don't need the calories\"). \n\nIt got so under my skin and was so triggering for me. It brought back so many feelings of resentment I experienced early in therapy when I was processing all the hurtful things my mom said to me growing up about my body, the fact that my disordered eating and self-harm cries for help went unnoticed by my parents because my sister had full-blown anorexia, how my binge eating in secret habit probably developed from being judged and shamed by my mom for eating, and how my obsession with diets is because of their presence on a pedestal in my home. \n\nI'm 28 and my parents aren't young. Our relationship was strained growing up and I want to improve my relationship with my parents so they don't die completely estranged from me. \n\nI know I can't be my mom's therapist but I don't know how I can tolerate being in a relationship with her because of how harmful and triggering her own issues are to me.",

So I can still talk to her and have a good relationship with her without too many issues, but once in a while I feel triggered if she's been talking about it for a few minutes. I just try to change the subject fast, and if she doesn't get it (which is rare) I gently let her know the convo is hard for me and I need to move on to something else. That usually works and she feels bad and moves on. I know she doesn't want to hurt me so I figure letting her know that she is would be helpful. It's hard because people like this simply don't get that it's not normal to obsess over weight like this, so they don't understand that it hurts some people to focus so much on it. They often mean well, but it sucks that they have that negative effect on us without trying!",
