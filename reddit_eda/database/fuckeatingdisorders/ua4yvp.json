  "selftext": "I don\u2019t go on there often, but when a post pops up on my timeline, it\u2019s always a post filled with comments saying \u201cyou\u2019ll naturally want the things that will make you feel better/you will naturally crave more vegetables/I don\u2019t even crave sugar anymore, yay!,\u201d and I feel like that\u2019s just a roundabout way of giving moral value to food and thus perpetuating the concept that some foods are better than others, that if you want to be healthy, you should always choose the \u201chealthier\u201d option.\n\nI understand the concept of gentle nutrition. But what annoys me is that the sub kinda makes it \u201cmandatory,\u201d and it gives me major restriction vibes. Gentle nutrition should be about what you can *add*. Unless you have allergies, intolerances, GI issues exacerbated by certain foods, or food you just plain do not like the taste of, there is no reason to replace or remove them. And it should be centered around foods you enjoy. Like, if you want a greasy burger but you also want to get some vegetables in, why can\u2019t you order the burger *and* a salad together?\n\nIdk, maybe this is just me, but I just feel like that community forgets that intuitive eating is multifaceted, or they just choose to ignore it. Like a lot of it is rooted in diet culture and that\u2019s why a lot of ED sufferers frequent that sub, imo.",

That, and being additive to my food choices when possible, like you\u2019ve said. I think a lot of people overthink it.",

But I also think there\u2019s nuance. I came from a serious binge eating background and developed restrictive ED habits way later. So in recovery the binging (as a natural step in the process) was pretty serious, especially for sweets. Because my binge eating disorder was just as problematic to my life as the restrictive aspect, I was happy when the cravings subsided, because to me it signaled the \u201cnatural balance\u201d that most people would probably end up with.\n\nAnyway, rant over. I agree with you 100% - the best choices are the ones where you can make decisions based on what you really want. Greasy burger with a side salad all day.",

They always make such a big deal about not finishing their food when there's just scraps left. I'm sure they wouldn't open another can of chili to eat one single spoonful if they were still hungry for one, so why bother leaving a spoonful of it? As if perfection exists. They love to say that your body is not a computer, so why do some of them treat their bodies like one?

If we\u2019re talking lethargy, bloating, gastrointestinal distress, water retention, body soreness, cravings, and hunger, that\u2019s all par for the course in terms of recovery. I felt fucking awful for like 9 months into my recovery, but it definitely dissipated with time despite eating relatively the same. When the body is being fed adequately, it\u2019s first response is to allocate all available energy to repairing damages, and that can result in extreme fatigue, tummy troubles, and overall uncomfortable symptoms.\n\nThat isn\u2019t to say that you can\u2019t dislike certain foods\u2014you absolutely can. But assuming you\u2019re still early into the process, I wouldn\u2019t blame it on \u201cjunk food,\u201d especially if you\u2019re still struggling with assigning moral value to foods. Remember that anxiety and stress can cause uncomfortable physical symptoms as well; and it\u2019s very common to feel guilt and shame\u2014a by product of anxiety and stress\u2014after eating these foods due to diet culture\u2019s influence.",
