Not hungry right now, maybe later. They\u2019d say come on it\u2019s ready now let\u2019s go, so I did. \n\nThen I kept pushing and... they stopped rebutting. Then they stopped reminding me at all. They\u2019re smart. They know what they\u2019re doing. It\u2019s an autonomy thing. I have to learn. But JFC do I hate it. \n\nI just want to be looked after. :(\n\nSo, I feel you.",

      "body": "I can definitely understand this feeling. For the most part I've moved past it, but I remember when I was first recovering it was very helpful to message my friends (one of whom understood completely and who has had experience with EDs herself) and tell them the dilemma - that I wanted to eat something but I just couldn't. It felt like I needed permission, and a lot of the guilt of eating something would melt away with that permission. It might help if you can find someone to trust and figure out something like this. I'm not saying it's a permanent solution because I'm hoping you should reach a point of being more comfortable around food when you're alone with it, but it can be something for now until you become more comfortable eating without a push. Until you're back on your feet. Just someone you can message and who can give you the \"permission\" or push that your brain might need to feel less guilt. I don't know if this helps and I wish you all the best. And I hope you know that it's okay to eat and that your body needs you to be kind to it and feed it. You always have permission to eat, and you shouldn't feel any shame.  I also understand if it might help if you have that tiny extra push from someone else right now, as someone who has been there before. Stay strong! If you're willing to take words from someone online: You always deserve to eat. If you want to eat, eat. You deserve to. It'll be okay. Be kind to yourself and your body for wanting food, no matter what food it might be.",

Most of the advice you see when you Google \u201cwhat to do if my loved one has an ED\u201d is \u201cdon\u2019t try to force them to eat.\u201d So if you get an ED thought that says \u201cwell you need someone to beg you to eat, if they wanted you to eat they would have tried to force you,\u201d etc, it helps to counter that thought with the reality that everyone who loves you wants you to recover, to eat and to eat well and be satiated and happy, and that they\u2019re doing what they think is best to help you get there.",
