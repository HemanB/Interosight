  "title": "So tired of being told that my ED is about \"control\"",
  "selftext": "And that \"focusing on food is a way to cope with the fact that I feel out of control in my life\".\n\nNo it's not.\n\nThe only reason why I feel out of control in my life is because I have a fucking ED that doesn't allow me to focus on what truly matters because I can't stop thinking about food. \n\nAnd the only reason why I feel \"in control\" when I restrict is because I am afraid of gaining weight and I am afraid of giving in to my extreme hunger, therefore my brain rewards me for that - guess what, I have an ED, therefore I feel \"in control\" when I engage in ED behaviours. Who'd have thought.\n\nThe only reason why I feel anxious around mealtimes is because I am afraid of eating too much and gaining weight.\n\nThe only reason why I feel \"out of control\" when I binge is because I don't want to gain weight and binges are conductive to that. My brain uses feelings of fear, guilt and self-loathing to motivate me not to binge anymore.\n\nPeople who are afraid of spiders feel \"in control\" when they stay away from spiders and their brain rewards them for staying the fuck away from spiders. No shit Sherlock.\n\nMy life wasn't perfect before the ED and it won't be perfect after it (if there's ever gonna be an \"after\"). But I felt so much more \"in control\" when I could engage in normal adult activities. I felt so much more \"in control\" when I didn't care about food or calories and didn't feel the need to compulsively restrict my food in order to stay under an arbitrary caloric amount, like that was the single most important task in my entire existence. \n\nI don't feel \"in control\" now. I feel trapped, possessed, consumed.",

When my support team tell me my ED is a way of control I just roll my eyes mentally, I can\u2019t think of a single reason why \u2018 I felt out of control in my life\u2019 to develop an ED - maybe trauma but I\u2019ve never felt out of control in my life before",
