  "selftext": "I went on a 16 hour date with a guy who I liked for a month or so, who I sorta fixated on because of our connection that I hadn\u2019t felt with anyone else in a while. Obviously, it\u2019s a trauma bond. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve lost about 30 pounds from my ED (triggered after years of being in recovery by pandemic depression + using Invisalign as an excuse). I also had deviated septum surgery and my jaw shape changed a bit from Invisalign/practicing proper tongue posture. Anyway, I showed him an old pic of me and blamed the weight loss on Invisalign so as to not overshare about my ED and he said, \u201cSo after Invisalign, are you just gonna balloon up again?\u201d I proceeded to tell him about my ED and he apologized profusely and felt bad, but then he tapped my head and said, \u201cYou have a lot going on up there, don\u2019t you?\u201d (This is coming from a guy who told me a story about how he got robbed by a a girl he had sex with a few days ago within 5 mins of convo).\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m trying to be in recovery but every time I eat I keep thinking of his words. I guess some support is needed. Thanks! :)",
