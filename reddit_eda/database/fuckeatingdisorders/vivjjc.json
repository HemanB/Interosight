Hitting all your macros will help you feel more satisfied.\n\nThat said, extreme hunger is just that, extreme.

The mental hunger is definitely there still, and probably will be until I\u2019m weight restored, but it\u2019s a background buzz rather than a foreground scream now. Sure, there are times I\u2019m still obsessed w food and spiral, but I know now it\u2019s because I haven\u2019t eaten enough yet that day or I\u2019ve prioritized volume over nutrition, which I\u2019m working on.\n\nI am also speaking from the experience and knowledge of my treatment team and family members who fully recovered from anorexia.",
