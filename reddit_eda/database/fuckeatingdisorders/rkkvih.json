  "title": "I got a free coffee and a date and felt anxious over the 'extra calories'.",
  "selftext": "Whilst waiting for my friend to arrive, the cute barista offered me a cappuccino. I was caught off guard and hesitated while the calories appeared in my head. I had planned on having a 'scary' drink with my friend later too (and I did), but I accepted!\n\nY'all... it arrived with \"u cute\" written in latte art. I didn't have to pay for it. We're going to an exposition together soon. I could cry.\n\nI'm so mad at myself for almost ruining this over a tiny amount of calories. I eat a lot now because I'm in all in recovery, so why worry about a few (very very precious) calories in oat milk and sugar? I HAVE TO RECOVER NOW. No going back.\nOh and most of my time since has been spent thinking about a much better subject than food and calories (for the first time in ages) :)",
