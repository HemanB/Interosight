WHY DO I FEEL SO FUCKING SATISFIED AND WARM AND HAPPY? \n\nNone of us are the unicorn and I still don't wanna believe it, but the fact that a burger and fries with SAUCE solved the 'mystery' of my mental hunger is proof <33 Shocker, the girl without a menstrual cycle has increased calorie and fat needs and her body knows that! * eye roll *\n\nI know most of us think PrOtEiN and VoLuMe EaTiNg will keep you full (which may be true for a healthy person?) but if you're suffering from malnutrition in any way, this likely isn't the case xx",
