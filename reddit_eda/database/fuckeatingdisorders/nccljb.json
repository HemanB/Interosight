  "selftext": "TW: numbers\n\nBefore my ED, I truly did have a good relationship with food. I ate whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. I ate milkshakes and ice cream sundaes and fried foods and cookies dunked in cider. Food was a source of joy. I overate sometimes but I never binged. I tried new foods all the time and never got the same thing twice. Every Friday I drank a grande frappuccino with whole milk or ate a chocolate croissant before school. But I stopped when I had enough. I went out to eat with friends, got what I wanted, and enjoyed it. I didn't care about how many calories I burned when I exercised. I ate more than most of my friends but I never cared.\n\nAnd guess what? Back then, I was only FIVE pounds heavier than I am now after quasi recovery. I work out almost every day, eat 95% healthy, and keep my meals much smaller than back then. And all that's separating me from before, when I maybe worked out twice a week and ate EVERYTHING i wanted, is five pounds.\n\nMy life was great before. I had lots of friends and felt good about myself. My Snapchat memories are filled with mirror selfies of me before that I really thought I looked great in when I took them. I used to post on Instagram every month, even if the pic was taken after I'd eaten or at the end of the day.\n\nMy body was fine. I was even at the lower end of a healthy BMI. I thought I looked good, and I probably did. I see pictures from back then, and my boobs look huge and I don't know why I did this to myself. \n\nEvery day is a struggle over 5 pounds. A tiny, tiny amount that literally no one cares about, except for me.\n\nI just can't believe I did this to myself. I want to believe that I can get back to my before, but I just don't know if that's possible.",

I miss the days when I had a life, had a healthy relationship with food, and didn\u2019t give it a second thought. I miss being too busy having fun with my friends, not stressing out every time we went out to eat, not planning my days around exercise. I hate how I screwed myself over. I hope both of us can get back to how we used to be \ud83e\udd7a",
