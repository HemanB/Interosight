  "title": "I ate my biggest fear food :)",
  "selftext": "I'm really far in recovery and was never really a fear food person but what still terrifies me is the Lebanese falafel sandwich at the place where my friends always go. They double wrap it, put a shit ton of hummus and multiple ingredients in it are deep fried because the vegetables aren't just shredded lettuce and carrots, but fried aubergine, string beans and potatoes... Usually, some oil drips out the end. I've mentally calculated the range of calories it could be and it makes me wanna cry. My fucked up friends also often eat one when they haven't eaten all day, but today I'd already had a huge breakfast, lunch and a big snack. I remember when I first ate one at the same place, when I was restricting but before it got *very* bad. I couldn't finish it and felt genuinely overly full and satiated after 80% even though I was chronically hungry and hadn't eaten much that day. Basically, everything about this is terrifying and triggering. I slipped up badly last week and the ED thoughts were super loud today. I could've told my friend I'd eat at home but I fucking did it!!!",
