  "selftext": "100 days with eating enough to fuel my body. \n100 days with eating at least 2 meals a day. \n100 days with being able to go out for meals occasionally without restricting in fear. \n100 days without bingeing, restricting or purging. \n\nI\u2019m making baby steps but I\u2019m still really proud of how I\u2019m doing. I find every single day hard but I know it would be much much harder if I wasn\u2019t eating properly.  I got the reminder today about it being 100 days and I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s been that long already. Almost a third of the year and I couldn\u2019t even imagine a week at the start. \n\nJust wanted to share my positive news with everyone here!\n\nAlso I\u2019d like to say thank you to everyone who replies to people\u2019s posts (including mine) when they are having a hard time. It\u2019s so appreciated to know that someone cares or can relate to you. Thank you!",
