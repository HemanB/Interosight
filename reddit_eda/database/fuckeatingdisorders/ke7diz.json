  "title": "I've never felt healthier or happier in my body, and this is the highest weight I've been in over a decade",
  "selftext": "I'm writing this post to celebrate something that has surprised me, and made me feel so proud. I realised, recently, that my body looked different. And that, in fact, *I loved it.*\n\nI'm the heaviest I've been since before I went through a period of extreme restrictive eating in my teens (that left me with a decade, I can see now, of messed up attitude despite being outwardly healthy appearing). It's just a few lbs rn past the number on the scale I would never 'let' myself go before, but it's a really big deal for me.\n\nI value this, here, more than keeping my weight at or below a certain number (which I held myself to for *years* to be 'worthy'. No, no - this is SO much better!).\n\nBeing very slim in my twenties was part of my identity, and it was encouraged by family. I was praised for being very slender, and how I looked in clothes. I never felt sexy or womanly. Ever. But I was stuck in this 'how I should look' mode. I wasn't meant to be sexy, I was meant to be slender, graceful, petite, small... all the things people would comment on.\n\nPlus, the fact that my mother always valued thinness didn't help (she grew up overweight in a time when extreme skinniness was the 'thing'. My frame was enviable to her, despite that fact it was an underweight BMI). Of course - it's *my* responsibility 100% - but I've only JUST started listening to myself in all aspects of my life, after all these years. If I complained about feeling 'fat', it was 'you don't look it, but why don't we eat like this for a while/ you do this?'. it helped to normalise my mindset.\n\nThis year, I started being more relaxed with my diet. I didn't realise the extend to which my 'healthy' habits were keeping me in an unhealthy frame of mind. (I still eat healthy, but I won't go into detail some of the ridiculous self imposed 'rules' I had to follow). I'm exercising still, but sometimes very gently, sometimes fiercely. And *always* to feel good - not to manipulate my body.\n\nAnd this, here, is me at my highest weight in a long time. In over a decade. This is me looking at my body, and realising that I like this shape more than when I was very skinny (actually, I never felt comfortable in it then, it was just something I felt compelled to be). I feel attractive. I feel sexy, even.\n\nAnd guess what? My hair is thicker, healthier. I'm not entirely sure what my hormones have been doing this month - but I have a feeling that this is what I'm *supposed* to feel like (fat affects estrogen levels, so I'm thinking it's to do with that?).\n\nSo I'm writing this to celebrate. I'm listening to myself instead of placing control on other people ( I mean: thinking I had to be a certain way because other people could only see me as having value if I was that, and not because I valued *me...* There's a lot more to hitting this realisation but I won't write another essay here).\n\nI'm finding freedom in my habits, my body and life. And I feel amazing.",

I actually read an article the other day on perfectionism, and how it causes us to exist fragmented in other peoples minds, consumed by what they think and whether its good enough, versus just us focusing on our own ability to be good. \n\nIt kind of reminds me of this. I know it's fed to us by other people, but by seeing it for what it is, we have so much power. When you stop existing in this fragmented place, you suddenly see how much damage it was causing you, and you can focus on being an amazing, different version of yourself. \n\nANYWAY!
