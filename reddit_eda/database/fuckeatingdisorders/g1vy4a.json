  "selftext": "Tired of never feeling full and satisfied when I eat food that's good for me. Tired of only feeling full and satisfied when I eat food that's bad for me. Tired of eating. I hate eating. I hate it.\n\nHow did I do this as a kid? The secret eludes my apprehension. I ate when I was hungry and stopped when I didn't want more food. The mental hunger is endless *unless* I'm chowing down on so many calories that it's inevitably going to make me obese. CICO wins, always. If I eat enough to satisfy myself, CICO dictates that I will be fat. If I power through the mental hunger (which is awful), I'll be fine.\n\nIf I eat 1,000 calories, I'm not satisfied.\n\nIf eat 2,000 calories, I'm not satisfied.\n\nIf I eat 3,000 calories, I'll probably be satisfied.\n\nSo.\n\nIf I'm at the same satisfaction level of 1,000 calories and 2,000 calories, why the hell shouldn't I just eat the 1,000 calories? I'm miserable either way.\n\nI'm at my highest weight I've been at for a long, long time. I can feel the bloating, especially in my buttocks.\n\nI'm tired of eating. I'm tired of feeling fat. I need to stop gaining weight. I'm tired of it all.",

I'm short and relatively inactive and I need more than that.\n\n\nBut coming out of a restrictive period, you absolutely need 3000+ calories to be satisfied and not ravenous. I've been working on recovery for 9 weeks and my ED sneaks in to say \"maybe you could just eat 2k a day and maintain or lose weight and its fine\" but I know for a fact I would be majorly restricting if I ate 2000 calories, which would lead to even more feast eating and extreme hunger. \n\n\nAfter dealing with an ED for 6 years on and off, I figured I'd never view 2000 calories as restriction, but it is. You need so so much food to recover, like a stupid amount of food. As long as you are repairing your mind alongside the body and ditching restriction completely, you will not just eat and eat and gain more weight than your body needs. It might be more weight than you are happy with, but it won't make you gain weight infinitely because there is no reason to. \n\n\nIf you don't feel guilt and shame and restriction around food, it eliminates both restriction and binging. You have to do the work though, by truly TRULY not restricting and by rewiring the guilt and shame.",
