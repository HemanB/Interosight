  "selftext": "the scariest thing about having an eating disorder is the time you lose, obsessing over what you eat, what you look like, what you weigh, all the behaviors that you know are harmful, yet you can't stop them. I look back at the years when my disorder was much worse, and I realize I will never get that time back. it was lost to the disorder. anorexia was more important than anything to me. I was dying at one point and literally couldn't stop the behaviors. I was reading old food diaries I had written and feeling so embarrassed. it's a miracle I did not die. can't believe I did that to myself. I guess I am angry at myself. how could I care so little about myself? anorexia ruined so much, even though at the time, I couldn't see it. the scale was so important to me. wish I had never found that stupid scale. eating disorders hurt every part of you. they destroy you, inside and out. I want to not have an eating disorder. the scariest thing about having an eating disorder is how hard it is to get out of it once you have an eating disorder. I keep trying. every day",
