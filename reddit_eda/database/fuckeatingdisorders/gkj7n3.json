  "selftext": "Now that I'm fairly far along in recovery, I don't feel like baking desserts anymore.  Only folks here in this sub will get this, haha.  I used to always want to bake cookies and desserts for everyone else, of course.  Now my family is out and I'm sure they'd like a dessert when they get back.  And ironically, even though I'm more likely to actually eat the dessert, I'm just less interested in the process.  The urge is gone, just...GONE!  I googled brownie recipes and I got bored.  Honestly it's so freeing.  Ah well, the kids will be happy enough with ice cream from the freezer or trail mix.",
