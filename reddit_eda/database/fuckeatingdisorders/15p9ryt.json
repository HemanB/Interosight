  "selftext": "Ok so i\u2019m typing this because i have realized how much restriction takes away from you.\n\nWhen you properly nourish yourself you start to notice things outside of food and eating.\n\nI swear music is so much better, games are fun again, i can watch a show and pay attention, I can find things funny again, and i feel way better physically despite the guilt\n.\nIt\u2019s like i started honoring my extreme hunger and eating tons of food and all of a sudden i\u2019m starting to want to do things and get things and make things and idk everything feels unreal.\n\nDeep in my ed, everything in my life was a way to distract myself from eating.\nNow that i am actively trying to recover, all of these things i have been using for distractions are actually FUN.\nLike what the hell",
