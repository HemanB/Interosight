  "selftext": "My mother called me this morning and said, \"Hey, I was reading this article and I really think you have an eating disorder...\" I face palmed so hard. I asked, \"Why do you think I was admitted into residential treatment last year?!?!\" Her, \"Oh that was a vacation, a resort, I would've like to have taken one too.\"\n\nOmfg. I can't even. I tried talking to her about her own disordered eating and my father's which she denied. I was like 3 out of your children all have eating disorders for a reason... Because of you (my parents) extremely messed up eating habits. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nWow mom, wow. \ud83d\udc4f",
