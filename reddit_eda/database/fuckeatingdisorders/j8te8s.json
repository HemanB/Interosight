When I was in quasi-recovery, I stuck to these numbers religiously and I continued to lose weight.\n\nNow I eat around 2500 kcal and I\u2019m maintaining. In fact, I know that I simply cannot eat less than 2300 or I will lose weight.\n\nSo yes. If your body is working properly and you are at the correct weight for your body, you should be able to eat beyond calorie recommendations and not gain or lose any weight.",

Many recovery youtubers managed to convince me to do so, especially Stephanie Buttermore.\n\nI was maintaining on 1.5k at an underweight weight. Once I went all in, I won\u2019t lie, I gained fast.
