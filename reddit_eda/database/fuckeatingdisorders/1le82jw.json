  "title": "The rise of skinnytok - it needs to stop",
  "selftext": "I\u2019m pretty sure nearly everyone has noticed the popularity of \u2019skinnytok\u2019 going up and up. All of these \u2019health\u2019 influencers basically saying that it\u2019s okay to practically eat practically little to nothing throughout the day, and continue to walk 10k steps a day, go to the gym, do Pilates, etc. This is a reminder that it is not healthy to live like that. It\u2019s just another way to lure your ed back out, another way to malnourish your body. \n\nKids have access to these posts, and yet influencers are basically encouraging eating disorders, whether they\u2019re aware of it or not. This will drastically affect a child\u2019s brain. It\u2019s toxic. It needs to stop.\n\nThankfully, TikTok has now blocked the phrase \u2019skinnytok\u2019, so it\u2019s much harder to come across willingly, but it can still come up on your for you page. Please try and ignore these posts and block them.\n\nIt also isn\u2019t just skinny tok, it\u2019s the early 2000s all over again, just reinvented. With ozempic, celebrities getting scarcely thin, diet culture. It\u2019s back with power. All of this makes it so easy fall back and relapse. \n\nRecovery is so hard in general, but with all of these trends coming around it\u2019s even harder, so remember the reason you chose recovery. The choice to finally live a fulfilled life where you aren\u2019t afraid to go out with friends, actually feeling happy, not lashing out, living healthily. You CAN do it. You WILL get there. Don\u2019t let these trends drag you down with them. ",

Luckily, I\u2019m 24 and have been in recovery decently successfully for a few years, and I was able to shut that thought process down pretty quickly. But I can\u2019t even imagine the effect that has on a teen, or someone who\u2019s really struggling in recovery. Anyone who promotes eating disorders online is not someone promoting health and wellness\u2014not matter what they claim!! Never forget that. And if you\u2019re really struggling and keep seeing that type of content, I urge you to either delete social media apps, or block these accounts if you don\u2019t feel you can. Tiktok and instagram are not worth your mental and physical wellbeing! Sending lots of love",

So I started watching skinnytok videos on YouTube, found the subreddit, and then told myself I would start tracking calories and my steps not to be restrictive but just to have a good \"balance.\" Sure.\n\nThat lasted about 3 weeks until yesterday when I realized how tired I was because I was really hungry but afraid to eat. It's so damn frustrating and sad because you can be doing sooo well and out of nowhere, like you said the ED gets lured back out. I haven't been scared to eat in months and now it feels like I'm starting all over again :( \n\nI'm going to be okay and I'm back surrounding myself with recovery resources/media but mainly I'm just upset by how insidious EDs can be and how I genuinely thought I was doing the right thing to be \"healthy\" i.e. lean again. Hope this kind of comment is okay, it's my first time here and just wanted to be honest. I'm not advocating for any of this behavior at all, it's damaging :/",
