  "selftext": "I\u2019ve been working hard trying to recover from my bulimia, but i\u2019ve gained over 20 lbs. When I notice people around me losing weight I get anxiety. Like what if I become the fat one again, and they\u2019re all skinny. Why do I think like this? It\u2019s hard putting it into words. Does anyone ever feel like this too?",
