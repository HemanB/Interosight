  "selftext": "Gonna just post this here because I do not want to talk about my ED stuff with friends but this shit is just too good to not share\n\nTrigger warning: ED talk but no numbers, oh and also swearing\n\nOkay so like Quasi-reccovery. I have/had been stuck in this bitch for 3 years. I started recovery in 2019 and went on the slow recovery, \"all-in\", \"all-in\" with exercise compensation and like the weird state of quasi-recovery for the last year or so. I still have/had constant food anxiety, constant food thoughts, no normal relationship with exercise, still constantly tired, got put on hormones because my body ain't doing it by itself and all of that shit.\n\nWell this week was a big eye opener.\n\nI have been taking a gap year to prepare for university starting in the school year 2022-2023. Did make some progress but the little devil was still on my mind constantly and convinced me I had developed BED which in turn made me relapse and send my spiralling.\n\nThis week I finally had to actually start with preparing for moving out, getting my finances together and just uni stuff in general. It made me realise that I really have to get out of this bitch right now or university will be even more demanding than I am already expecting.\n\nSo my sceptic ass finally decided to give into my \"mental\" extreme hunger. I did not believe in it and thought that to not give a shit and just eat I had to only have extreme physical hunger. Well for the last few days I have been eating a ton and just not giving a shit tbh. The first few days were garbage because I thought that my problem would be solved in 2 days of constantly shoving PB en hot sauce sandwiches down my face. Well after a week I am finally feeling the results.\n\nI FEEL LIKE MYSELF AGAIN\n\nMy fucking hyperactive overthinking bouncing information loving self again. I eat and move on, no judgement. Like I genuinely want to READ, WATCH ANIME, DRAW AND GAME. Not to fill the void between meals no, I CRAVE MY HOBBIES BECAUSE I LIKE THEM. I woke up this morning and almost cried. I missed this feeling so badly, I thought I could never heal, always be stuck with the fucking label. I still have a long way to go, I do not think this will be over soon but god is this actual nourishment??? If this is life, then fuck me what the fuck was I thinking the last 3 years. \n\nGenuinely, the key to recovery is to not give a damn, your pals do not stand in the kitchen for an hour trying to perfectly perfect their meal so it hits all your needs and cravings. \n\nMake that sandwich, swallow it whole, then go back to doing what you love.",
