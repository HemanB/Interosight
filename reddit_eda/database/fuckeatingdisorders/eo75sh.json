Now I don\u2019t know what to believe, if I lie to myself it\u2019s easier as I don\u2019t need to worry about having problems and getting better, but if I don\u2019t I\u2019m not lying to myself and won\u2019t feel so bad about it.",

I agree, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that you don\u2019t want to admit you have a problem but because you subconsciously don\u2019t want to accept it. It\u2019s pretty typical of most people, including myself to be honest.

I was realised terrified of letting my depression go when I started getting better. For me it was a combination of worrying no one would care about me if I got better, and a constant feeling of self-hatred convincing me I deserved to feel bad.\n\nI don\u2019t think you really want to be broken. I think you just aren\u2019t ready to feel better. It\u2019s hard to understand, psychology always is. You aren\u2019t alone though, and I\u2019m here for you.",
