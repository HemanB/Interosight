  "selftext": "Like it\u2019s a problem lately. This is why we haven\u2019t been allowing discussions on what to eat, etc. in recovery\u2014because it breaks down into a disordered mess about ignoring hunger, bargaining with your eating disorder, and competing against others.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t in recovery, that\u2019s *okay*, but you still need to follow the rules and respect those that are. If someone is hungry, don\u2019t tell them how to eat less. Don\u2019t tell them what *you* do to ignore your hunger. Don\u2019t tell them ways to distract themselves. Don\u2019t make excuses for the behaviors you are choosing to engage in and/or exposing others to. This is not a pro-ED sub. I\u2019m about to start issuing temporary bans for those who break rule 10 until y\u2019all can calm tf down.\n\nThanks for coming to my TED Talk, bye.",
