It\u2019s so helpful to watch someone go through the process of extreme hunger/ weight gain, and honestly it\u2019s made me want to go all in. \n\nI texted my best friend, just telling her about the video and how I wanted to do that and her response was \u201cplease please do it\u201d (I don\u2019t know why that made me cry but it did). She told me how if she wants food, she just goes and gets it, no second thoughts, and that is just so crazy to me. I was craving cereal so badly, but I had already eaten dinner and desert, but she told me that she would just go and get it, so I did. \n\nI\u2019m now sat in bed watching Netflix and finishing a packet of Oreo\u2019s. I\u2019m not sure how long this motivation is going to last, but honestly I\u2019m just so fed up of being constantly hungry, constantly thinking about food, constantly scared of losing control. Honestly just fuck it.",

I didn't want to come off as overly negative by being the one to mention it.\n\nI think it's great if ED sufferers can use her concept of all-in to pull themselves out of ED behaviours, of course that's an amazing thing, but I worry that looking to her and her experience as some sort of guide for what to expect will just set people up for disappointment and unrealistic expectations of what recovery is really like.\n\nThere's a lot of evidence to suggest that Stephanie has been less than honest and forthcoming about the process. She's an avid photoshopper and is still clearly very wrapped up in her appearance and the fitness world. Of course it's up to every individual and what they want to aspire to, but I know that I want far more from life than to be so absorbed in my physical appearance and feel the need to edit the countless photos I post of myself.\n\nBy all means, keep on going with the all-in process! It sounds like you're doing brilliantly. Just maybe don't expect your results to be the same as Stephanie's because there's a lot of evidence to suggest that she's not honest about a lot of things.",

Honestly one of my favorite Recovery channels by far, probably because we\u2019re similar in age and were the same age when we started struggling, and the fact that she\u2019s recovered now is really encouraging to me as someone who has fought for so long, has been labeled with the SE-AN, and lost hope that recovery was possible after living with it for so long.\n\nShe\u2019s proof to me that it is possible, no matter how long you\u2019ve been fighting, even if I struggle to believe it for myself, still.",

Her posts are so amazing, I love when she posts about how she gets a sweetened caramel macchiato or mocha while her friend or husband gets just a black coffee or unsweetened latte etc., and she just normalizes listening to your own cravings and not comparing. She gives me so much hope for how I want my own relationship with food to be someday!!",
