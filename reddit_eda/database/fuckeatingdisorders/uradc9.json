  "selftext": "My doctor and nutritionist both said with anorexia nervosa, your blood work doesn't necessarily show all the damage. you can have normal blood work with anorexia and still be suffering from severe complications. they said this can happen with anorexia. it doesn't always show up in your blood work, and the results don't always stay the same. I went to an unhelpful gyneocologist today who said that isn't true, that if you damaged your organs or something it would show up in your bloodwork. she said organ failure would show up in blood work, but organ damage wouldn't.  I do not think normal blood work necessarily means everything is okay when you are anorexic. my labs are always normal even though I am severely malnourished and underweight. my doctor said I could still die from this illness. normal labs don't mean you are always  fine.",
