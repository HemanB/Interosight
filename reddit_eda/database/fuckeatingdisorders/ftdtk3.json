This was like a week ago and it still bothers me, but you know, I'm done being someone only other people can enjoy. Just a vent, let me know how you guys have dealt with similar ignorance before :')",

It\u2019s been especially hard lately being at home isolating, every conversation my mum has with me is how skinny I used to be and different diets I can\u2019t try now I\u2019m home and she can\u2019t seem to grasp I had an eating disorder. The woman stood there in the doctors office and watched me sob as he told me how much I weighed when I was severely underweight and I still thought the number was too big. Hope things pick up for you soon, hang in there.",
