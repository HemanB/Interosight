  "selftext": "I am terrified of binge eating on the holidays, but I am determined not to. Every holiday, I do a little better than the last.\n\nHalloween: overate on chocolate a bit, but I put it behind me and moved on.\n\nThanksgiving: didn't eat breakfast and got too hungry, but I managed to stop eating when fully satisfied without making myself sick. Ate leftovers that I wanted to eat and skipped those that I wasn't really into.\n\nChristmas: I am determined to Do Better this time around. I am going to get up, work out, then have a healthy brunch, and then I am going to bake up a storm with my family. I will allow myself to eat as much food as I want and not make myself sick.\n\nI am obviously a bit leery of the caloric bombs that I'm cooking up, but it's just food. It's Just Food.",

I'm pretty much avoiding holiday gatherings, I made it a month and a half without purging a few months ago and I want to get back there even if it means missing out on festivities. The eating on Christmas just feel doesn't worth it this early on, I'm not ready. I'm focused on recovering and dealing with the weight that has left me very uncomfortable in my skin.",

But i just ate a salad AND a sandwich, anyway. And ill eat more tonight, and its okay:) We deserve food.",
