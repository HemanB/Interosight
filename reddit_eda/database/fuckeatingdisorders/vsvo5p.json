Eventually you'll be able to stop when you're no longer hungry etc but your body at this moment is still learning to trust its hunger etc again after a while of being ignored, with time it'll calm down + you'll be able to enjoy food without overdoing it nd without it being too little, but for this time you just gotta power thru the uncomfortable part",
