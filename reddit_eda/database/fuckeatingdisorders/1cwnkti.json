  "selftext": "just had carbonara for dinner, but was still hungry so had a large cornetto choc cookie ice cream, still didn\u2019t fill the bottomless pit and so I just walked straight to the kitchen, grabbed a fork and started eating all the carbonara left in the pan. for context, cheese, pasta and fried foods (pancetta) are all massive fear foods. \n\nI JUST FINISHED IT. ALL OF IT. EVERY BIT OF LEFT OVER CARBONARA. I DONT KNOW HOW I JUST DID THAT. THERE WAS A LOT. \n\nAND I HAVE ABSOLUTELY ZERO REGRETS THAT FELT SO FUCKING GOOD!!! IT LITERALLY FEELS LIKE MY BODY JUST SIGHED IN RELIEF! PASTA AND CHEESE IS SO GOOD HOW HAVE I BEEN MISSING OUT ON THIS FOR SO LONG??!!!?!?\n",
