I get the vibe she's using exercise to give herself permission to eat\n\n\\- she claims her focus on \"losing fat\" is \"losing the mindset of fat as bad\" (???) but as far as viewers can see it's just her eating nourish bowls and oatmeal instead of ice cream and cookies. not sure how that relates to fat acceptance\n\nidk so many people praise her as a rEcOveReD iCoN so maybe I'm wrong but these are just things that throw me off",

Is it because it causes you to lose weight and to lose \"fat?\"\n\nOk this isn't super relevant to Linda (I personally haven't seen more than like 1 or 2 videos of hers), but a lot of \"glow up\" Youtubers do this all the time.\n\nI won't mention names since I don't want people to self-trigger, but: there's another Chinese-Canadian YTer who accumulated a huge number of fans by \"glowing up\" and posting a ton of videos about how disciplined she became through healthy eating (namely IF, cutting out literally all added sugar, etc), exercises where she'd always measure herself before/after and just focus on inches lost, etc. It was always talking about how healthy and great she feels, but then she'd make videos about \"mysteriously\" not having her period for years?? Now she says she's less strict and wants to gain muscle weight, but half her videos are still on topics like \"I ate whatever I want and LOST weight!!\"  so I doubt that. She posts some career-related things but 99% of her fanbase just sees her as a role model for being UW (because ofc she must be totally healthy at a BMI of 16 since she's Asian!!!).\n\nLike if these people had ED channels, I'd be less bothered, but I do have an issue with the whole hard-working health queen thing that draws in impressionable teenage girls and portrays being restrictive as just being strong-minded and \"feeling good.\"",

Her videos are SO repetitive. She says she loves her body at every and any size, but is constantly trying to lose weight when she gains like what? 5 lbs? 10 lbs? \n\nThe format of her uploads are:\n\n1. I gained weight, but I'm okay with it.\n2. I lied, I'm sad because I gained weight.\n3. I lost weight! \n\nIt's so contradicting. She also frames it in a way that exercising and eating \"healthy\" makes her \"feel good.\" Why does it make you feel good, Linda? Is it because it causes you to lose weight and to lose \"fat?\"",

I think it's the right one, but won't say anything more.\n\nI never really watched her personally, because I did find her more triggering than Linda (back when I thought Linda was about body positivity). And, judging by her video titles... yikes. It is all about eating whatever and losing weight or eating whatever and STAYING SKINNY like lol ?? No one asked, but thanks lmfao",
