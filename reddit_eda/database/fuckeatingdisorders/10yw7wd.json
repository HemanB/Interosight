      "body": "Fullness is typically a combination of physical fullness *and* satiety, and you often won\u2019t feel satiety without also feeling physical fullness (not *always* but most of the time, as satiety is a system to tell us our bodies have had enlugh). So like\u2026 during my EH phase, I could eat and eat and eat and still feel that I was physically hungry despite also being physically full. When my EH finally ended I experienced fullness that did not extend to physical discomfort and my brain kinda went \u201cthat\u2019s enough, I don\u2019t want any more.\u201d\n\nWhat defines fullness is a bit situational though. The body cares more about caloric intake over the actual volume of food, which is why low calorie foods can make us \u201cfeel\u201d full while actively remaining hungry. They can also result in uncomfortable fullness not because things like vegetables are actually filling but because they retain water and are usually high in fiber, which causes bloating in large quantities. This bloating is often what is mistaken for fullness. On the other hand, you can eat caloric dense foods that are less volume and achieve satiety a lot easier. For example, my work had a potluck yesterday and I ended up only being able to eat a small plate because the food was so caloric dense and I got full a lot quicker\u2014in this case, I was both physically full and satiated. When you starve your body, especially over months/years, the body isn\u2019t going to need fullness cues because, well, it\u2019s depleted of energy. And it can take several months to over a year to pull oneself out of energy debt.,\n\nI went severalllll years not remembering what fullness felt like, and spent the first year of recovery questioning whether or not I\u2019d ever experience it again. But the more you feed your body, the more it will balance itself out, including restoring consistent hunger and fullness cues.",
