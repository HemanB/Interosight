  "selftext": "I\u2019ve been in that subreddit for more than a year and can 100% say that it\u2019s full of people who don\u2019t want to get better. Now that I\u2019m in recovery it\u2019s super triggering so I just left.\n\nI made a post talking about how proud I am for eating more and how I don\u2019t care about this disease anymore and was downvoted to DEATH. Literally packed my things and left after that lmao.\n\nTo me that subreddit is like a really bad doctor you see in recovery, who tells you thing like \u201cextreme hunger is a myth\u201d and \u201chonour it by eating ONLY fruits and shit\u201d , doesn\u2019t help you, makes your recovery even harder and longer and takes a shit lot of your time for nothing.\n\nWhen my mind was super sick and fully into this disorder, that place was like a safe haven, I wasn\u2019t browsing it to help me get better but to \u201cnormalise\u201d my ed and make a joke out of it with stupid memes. I can understand that it\u2019s a place to cope, I was coping with it too, but to see posts like \u201cwhat\u2019s your favourite safe food?\u201d And \u201cI love the feeling of hunger\u201d or something trending every day? Now that I\u2019m in recovery I can clearly see how sick it is. \nAnd can I just add that it\u2019s a super fat phobic place too? \n\n\nIt\u2019s a subreddit for people to glorify their disease. The worst thing is that there\u2019s a lot of underage people there that are still developing their body, thinking that that mindset is normal,\nPlease if you are serious about this disorder NOT consuming you stay as far away as you can.",

And yeah, so many people who are basically kids having their most disordered thoughts encouraged by people old enough to know better.

I\u2019m relatively new to both subs because I didn\u2019t want to get involved with ED subreddits until I felt far enough away from the initial slog of recovery to be of use. When they came up in my feed, I didn\u2019t always check which sub it is before replying but the past couple of days I\u2019ve realised I will be doing and I think I will actually leave that sub. I do want to pass what I\u2019ve learnt on so hopefully people don\u2019t stay stuck for as long as I was but I think that\u2019s only useful when someone is open to accepting things like extreme hunger, Minnesota, setpoints being higher than the ED wants etc. \n\nIf I can summarise it, I think there\u2019s a lot of wanting to be able to pick and choose certain ED behaviours rather than understanding they all have to go. It\u2019s a hard place to be and I\u2019m not qualified to help someone get out of it.\n\nThanks again for posting this and prompting me to think through what\u2019s been making me uneasy!",
