  "title": "I ate cereal today",
  "selftext": "This morning I got up and was insanely hungry. I\u2019m currently in recovery from restricting and I\u2019m weight restored but still dealing with extreme hunger and restricting from time to time. However, lately it\u2019s been different, I\u2019ve been eating way more and even though I still feel guilty about it, it\u2019s a lot less guilt. I\u2019m becoming happier. Today I\u2019m going to meet up with a friend and not isolating myself from the real world anymore. I\u2019m repairing the relationships I broke due to anorexia. And today I had cereal for breakfast, the full fat milk and not just unsweetened almond milk. I took my most sugary cereal and ate it because that\u2019s what my body was craving. Not egg whites. Not bland oatmeal. Sugary cereal. And I ate it and it was so good. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it was so difficult. I was so tempted to throw it away with each spoonful I put in my mouth. But I didn\u2019t. I ate what I wanted and how much I wanted and that was it. Today was a win and it\u2019s only 9am. Recovery is so hard and if you\u2019re going through it right now, you are so strong. You will have a win. Just yesterday I was crying over the amount of ice cream and chips I consumed but guess what, that\u2019s irrelevant today. I\u2019m not even craving those anymore. You have got to let your body repair the damages you have caused, if your body is craving it, indulge. Restricting what your body truly needs, what it\u2019s been lacking for so long is only going to cause you harm. I did that yesterday with the ice cream and chips, I ate all the healthy meals I could come up with and I was still so ravenous and had the biggest headache ever. So I indulged, my headache went away, and I was happier. \n\nI know I kinda diverted from the whole I ate cereal this morning. But holy it\u2019s such a huge victory for me that I cried. And I just want anyone who\u2019s going through recovery right now to just keep going and fighting. Yesterday was such an awful day for me, but I kept fighting and I woke up today feeling so amazing. It\u2019s the first day in my recovery where I feel somewhat pre ed me. I never thought I could feel this way again, I didn\u2019t even remember what it felt like. So today I\u2019m choosing recovery. And I\u2019m going to continue to choose recovery. I know there will be setbacks and negative feelings but I\u2019ll just have to remember the days like this during those times. \n\nSo just to end this weird sort of rant/motivational chat, just let yourself have that cereal.",

Today I had a MOCHA with MILK, not that bullshit \"skinny mocha\" or a mocha with almond milk. But a mocha with whole milk. Thank you for the reminder that this a big win for myself in my own recovery.",

I was like 23 at the time, had lived on my own for 5+ years, and didn't know how to make an egg (fried/scrambled/boiled) at all. I literally googled it, went & bought some eggs & butter, and made myself an egg! It was delicious, and I was so proud of myself for listening to my body, for trying something new, for making an effort to eat something I wanted, and for actually eating it! It sounds so silly to some, but that was one of my favorite moments of recovery. \n\nI've been at this \"recovery\" thing for like 6 years now, and yesterday was a bad day. Today is a good day. Tomorrow is a new day!",
