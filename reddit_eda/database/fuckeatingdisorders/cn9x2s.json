  "selftext": "I'm still keeping a note in my phone of what I'm eating but it's a general note just saying what I had and what time. I'm not weighing my food and I'm not even focusing on portions as labeled on packages, just trying to be mindful about what I eat and listening to my hunger and cravings. I've binged a couple of times but that's all part of the process. \n\nI'm really hoping I can stick to this this time! I always end up feeling guilty and restrict after a bit but this is the longest I've gone since I was 15 without counting calories so I'm feeling hopeful!",
