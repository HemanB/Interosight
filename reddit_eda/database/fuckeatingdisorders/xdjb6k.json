  "selftext": "I consider myself a minimalist, and I hardly ever spent money on myself. I've been penny-pinching since I was old enough to learn how to make the most of the tokens at Chuck E. Cheese. \n\nAfter diet culture taught me that eating less is all it takes to have a smaller body and that the smaller my body, the better (false!!!). \n\nIn high school, when my parents would give me lunch money, I'd pocket it instead of eating.\n\nAnd thus began my habit of skipping meals to earn money.\n\nNow I'm in college and I'm trying to recover. Every time I buy a meal, I realize just how expensive food is---even if I'm cooking at home!\n\nI have big savings goals---top surgery, grad school, a house---and at times, I've had to work three part-time jobs just to cover my other basic costs of living.\n\nHow can I justify spending money on food when in the past it's been so easy to just not eat?",

      "body": "omg no now that i\u2019m back in college on a suuuper limited budget i almost relapsed, like literally just made myself a slightly smaller sandwich than usual and forgot to eat breakfast. Then I was like.. lemme get coffee at dunkin bc it\u2019s only $3 and it\u2019ll suppress my appetite (stupid also wasting money on coffee in this way lol). Anyway I had a panic attack bc of low blood sugar (felt super jittery and was convulsing on the ground) and ppl called an ambulance it was so embarrassing, might\u2019ve also been from the trauma the ED gave me of actually having consistent hypoglycemia but who knows lol. My point is.. it\u2019s worth it to spend money for better health bc unfortunately (if u live in the US) the money u save will catch up to u in hospital bills. I just paid them off now I don\u2019t think eating less will make me save any money long term. \n\nThere is also a link between ppl with EDs and how they spend money. We see everything as scarce so we tend to save as much as we can. I had to fight this slowly (barely had enough money at the end of the month anyway) and spend even a tiny bit on what I want, whether it be a small squishmallow from five below or one coffee a week, nothing too big ofc. Money comes and goes, and if u keep it in ur bank account it\u2019ll go down in value anyway. Money is abundant, but of course we don\u2019t feel this bc the rich hoard it (that\u2019s another story) but money isn\u2019t meant to be hoarded. If you have even a bit saved up and have a bit left over, try to spend it on yourself. And if you can\u2019t do that, please prioritize eating something because again, you will feel the effects in medical bills sooner or later. I was fine for years until boom heart, bones, hormones, brain function, etc etc. \n\nThat being said, Im still mad they monetized basic human needs like food and shelter. Basic food like potatoes and canned foods should be free along with community gardens, but that\u2019s another topic for another day. Thankfully my campus does this too, and if I were u I\u2019d also look up local pantries and community fridges. \n\nWhatever you do, prioritize food and health over money. The physical $20 bill won\u2019t keep you fed, but you can buy enough for a few meals with it.",

      "body": "I def relate - my restriction really ramped up in college because I was broke af (going to college was expensive enough!) and I began skipping meals to see how little money I could spend, it was almost a game to see how low I could get my weekly food budget (got it down to $8 a week once, which should have been a red flag, but I felt like I had really accomplished something!) It gave me *more* positive reinforcement and a pride in not eating because a) I was thinner and b) had more money in my bank account. Both felt like a victory to me. Years later, I wound up in ED treatment, and I *know* those years of scarcity contributed heavily to that. Yes, weight stigma and diet culture drove my ED, but also not wanting to 'waste' my limited funds on food which wasn't about my appearance at all. \n\nWhat I'll say about justifying spending money on food when its so easy not to eat: spending $50 a week on food now will cost you a lot less in the long run than spending THOUSANDS on healing from years upon years of the internal ravages of ED. That *will* impact your long-term spending goals, and I can say that with confidence now that I'm 37 and spent the last 6 years spending $120/week on therapy - that's over $37k. Money spent on eating and even some costs to start recovering (of couple of clinic meetings, or some coaching) gives you the greatest cost benefit, and the *sooner* you do it, the more time you'll get back, which compounds your benefit. On top of, of course, the non-quantifiable value of just feeling better.",
