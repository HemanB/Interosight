  "title": "I ate peanut butter today!",
  "selftext": "I went to the grocery store and bought the natural brand of peanut butter and put it on some Dave's bread toast. It was amazing. I missed it so much. Froget all the almond butter, cashew butter, etc...I want peanut butter. I'm so proud of myself. PB is a big fear food of mine for some reason and I'm glad I was able to eat it. \n\nAlso, ice cream is another fear food of mine, and I've been eating it every night. Now, some of the scary aspect has gone away! I didn't think this would happen! Why do I crave it every night though?\n\nWhat are some of your fear foods?",
