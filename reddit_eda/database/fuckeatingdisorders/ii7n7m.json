  "selftext": "I just saw my friends for the first time in like a few months. I've lost a lot of weight since they last saw me, but i also shaved my head and most of them only commented on that. The feedback was really good and i was feeling great for once. Unfortunately when i showed one of them a picture od myself in a sports bra and shorts he said \"damn, you look hella good now\". I jokingly asked \"are you suggestin i didn't look hella good before?\". And he responded \"oh you know what i mean, you look better! That's a compliment! Don't be so uptight!\". I know it doesn't sound horrible, but it broke me... I've been heavily restricting for the last 6 months and i sacrificed my physical and mental health. Why do people have to say things like that? I just begun my recovery process and know all i want to do is starve myself again.",
