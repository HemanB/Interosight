  "title": "Finally talked about my disorder out loud, and I feel GREAT",
  "selftext": "Maybe nobody else will see this as a huge deal but I ACKNOWLEDGE MY ED TO SOMEONE!!\nAs a man with anorexia, I have a tough time talking about my ED. Of the four people who I have told in the past five years, most of them don't believe that it's a real problem since \"only girls are anorexic.\" They insist I'm just stressed or don't have a good appetite. For that reason and many more, I have not shared this with anyone new in four years.\nUntil yesterday.\nI've been falling for a girl (first time in years--basically since my ED took my freedom, libido, and trust in my own emotions from me), and we've been in that amazing stage of moving from small talk flirting to really getting to know each other. We both are really into running together, and I enjoy running with her because it isn't about speed or tracking calories. Together, we just do it for the runners' high and to clear our heads and admire the scenery around us. I told her that I often run for the wrong reasons on my own, and I could tell she truly cared when she asked me if I would be comfortable talking about what I meant. It led to an incredible conversation and many discoveries for both of us as we discussed the disorder (she has a history with anorexia as well, which I did not know before but I had suspected in subtle ways). I also told her I didn't want this to change anything between us because I love eating meals with her--the thoughts of calories and guilt are kept at bay by my happiness when we go out for lunch together. She isn't a crutch in my life, but she helps bring out the side of me that I love and haven't known for some time.\nI'm not sure why I'm sharing this, but I think I have just always been so afraid of sharing this side of me with people who I know care enough about me to try and help. I thought that it would somehow undo my identity. But I did it. And guess what? THE WORLD DIDN'T END! I feel so free and proud! I still have a lot to work through, but all of my recovery efforts so far over the years have come up short. Maybe choosing this first step will make this time different. I feel great:) if I can do it, so can you!!!",
