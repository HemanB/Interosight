  "selftext": "I'm going to deal. Therapist has recommended ABT over standard CBT in my case because I'm, ahem, skeptical of standard CBT.\n\nAccept that I'm a bit bloated today. I had dessert last night (and a lot of green veggies loaded with fiber). That's okay.\n\nAccept that I'm going out to dinner tonight and the salt/carbs will result in bloating for a few days. That's okay.\n\nIt is okay to gain weight. It is hard to accept, but it is okay. Human worth is not defined by bodyfat percentage.  My husband does not care if I gain weight. My friends and family don't care if I gain weight. My pets don't care.\n\nI must accept that it is okay. I will be okay.\n\nYou too will be okay. Your body needs food. It needs nutrients to live.\n\nHave a nice day.",

Me either.\nYou know how much my daughters best friend weighs?\nMe either.\nYou know how much my Dr, who has saved my life due to tough love weighs? Me either.\nYou know how much my favorite co-worker weighs?\nMe either\nDo they know how much I weigh? Probably not.\nDo they care? Absolutely not.\nWhy? Because it doesn\u2019t FUCKING matter. It never has. We are the only ones that made our weight matter, no one else. We don\u2019t ask people what they weigh before we decide if they deserve a place in our lives.\n\nI love this post so much. Thank you for the reminder. \ud83d\udc9c",

But sometimes when I\u2019m having these moments, I remind myself that THIS is our one chance at life and we deserve happiness as much as we wish happiness upon everyone else. In the grand scheme of things, weight doesn\u2019t mean shit. And tight clothes don\u2019t mean shit. I want to take advantage of my time on Earth so fuck those thoughts and fuck ED.  It takes up precious space in our minds AND in our day to day lives. Obviously these thoughts and behaviors are deep rooted and so so difficult to combat. But sometimes if I need a quick reminder, that\u2019s what I tell myself. And it\u2019s the truth! Our happiness is so much more important than what ED wants for us.",
