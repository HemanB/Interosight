  "selftext": "I\u2019m on mobile so I can\u2019t add the \u201crecovery wins\u201d banner but I just wanted to say that recovery is literally the best. thing. to ever happen to me. \nI woke up this morning and realized that I don\u2019t have a massive preoccupation with food anymore, I can now just grab something and not think about it. I don\u2019t go to bed planning breakfast and lunch for the next day, and I don\u2019t freak out if mealtimes or plans change. I\u2019m not terrified of how much weight gain X food will cause, and my hunger levels have finally flattened out again. But best of all? I feel like I\u2019ve got my life back. I can THINK. My brain isn\u2019t constantly foggy and preoccupied, I have time to pursue my hobbies, I\u2019m not lagging in conversations trying to think of things to say anymore. I have strength to do things, I\u2019m not always freezing and it feels SO GOOD. It was really hard at first, I\u2019m not going to lie, but I realized that when people say it gets better and to stick with it through the worst part, it\u2019s true. It does get better. So much better. I\u2019m truly the most chill with my body image that I\u2019ve ever been. My body dysmorphia isn\u2019t nearly as strong. Sometimes I actually see myself in the mirror and say \u201cI\u2019m kinda pretty, actually\u201d. I\u2019m never going back to the ED. Fuck it",
