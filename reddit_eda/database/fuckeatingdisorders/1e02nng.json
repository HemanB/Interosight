  "selftext": "There have been a lot of posts centering around guilt, shame, fear, and disgust in regards to eating more. Many of you are questioning whether or not you deserve to eat, whether you\u2019re sick enough to eat more, etc.\n\nLet me be very clear: **Food is not a reward. Food is not something you EVER have to earn. It is a basic necessity to your survival\u2014you are ENTITLED to it, just as you are entitled to the air you breathe.** You are allowed to eat however much you fucking want. Don\u2019t ever be afraid to demand food. Especially if you are hungry.\n\nThe only exception would be if you have any known allergies/intolerances to specific cravings that would harm you, or if you are at risk of refeeding syndrome.\n\nI hope that helps at least one person today. Stay tuned for my next TED Talk",

Intuitive eating that I've read about doesn't work for me because I don't feel hunger anymore. \n\nSorry, had to get that off my chest. I want to eat. I want to not feel so much guilt, shame, and disgust. I'm trying.",
