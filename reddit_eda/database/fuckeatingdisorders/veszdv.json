          "body": "Yes, that! I don't know how to spell it, and I'm fairly sure nobody else does either. \ud83d\ude0b Fairly similar in essence to dry beef chow fun, it's rice noodles with oyster sauce and lots of fermented black soybeans (sauce), and some chili like gochujang. I like either dish with a ton of fried onions and mushrooms. Plus green onions and cilantro when I make it at home. I usually use enoki (those skinny little white mushrooms) or shiitake, but any kind will do. Plus stir-fried steak, pork, and/or tofu. Plenty of ginger and garlic too.",
