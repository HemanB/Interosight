  "title": "Unpopular opinion: eating disorder treatment centers are fucked.",
  "selftext": "I was listening to a podcast (I had no idea it would turn out to be about EDs) and an anorexic woman spoke of her time there and how it \u201csaved her life\u201d despite that she had relapses later on that were bad. She also spoke about how hard it was to be there and the constant sobbing and misery. She spoke of the mealtimes and that no one was allowed to talk about food, their struggles, their experiences, their hardships. Nothing like that. Silence. Eat in silence. \n\nI understand that that method can give one time to think and get used to the THOUGHTS of eating, but at the same time, I realized how pointless a center could be. Being around a bunch of others like yourself, you KNOW they\u2019re comparing to you, and you\u2019re comparing to them. It\u2019s a game. Who is the sickest? Who can heal the best? Who can maintain the lowest weight? Who can gain the most weight? Judgment. Arguing. Struggling. Hating. \n\nIt\u2019s fucking stupid. And then when you get out, you\u2019re not \u201chealed\u201d you just go through life a few months longer, maybe years, of being at a weight that you\u2019re not dying at. Then you relapse. Everyone relapses. So what\u2019s the point? A prolonged life by maybe a few months or a few years? \n\nShe also spoke of how her depression has never gone away, even though she is now \u201crecovered.\u201d \n\nI do not believe in recovery. Don\u2019t misunderstand, I believe that recovery is for some people and if it helps them, I am glad. But me personally, no. \n\nI just don\u2019t understand eating disorder centers. It\u2019s a comparison nightmare, and we all know that EDs are FUELED majorly on comparisons. It\u2019s a big part of a lot of people\u2019s identity, even. For a while or for forever. So being thrown into a place where not only are you miserable every single day and uncomfortable every single day, you get to be around people who will judge you all the time, and people who you will compare yourself to every day, all day. \n\nThe best treatment for EDs I can think of is individual hospital care, and individual therapy. MAYBE a small support group once in a while. But NOT in a facility where you have to be around others who are like you, who share the same internal and external judgment, who are just as miserable. Misery loves company. What hope do you get from that? It doesn\u2019t make sense to me. \n\nThis is only a vent post as well, just something that was on my mind that I needed to get out. In no way am I intending to give anyone a reason to be hopeless. If treatment centers are needed for you, or work for you, I hope it goes well and that you stay happy and healthy, or at least find some peace with yourself and heal. \n\nI just don\u2019t see it in my cards. And I don\u2019t see a reason for this type of treatment after listening to a first hand account of someone who stayed in patient. It\u2019s pretty sad and hopeless to me. It makes me lose even more hope for ever recovering. Which I haven\u2019t much anymore. If any at all. \n\nThanks for reading",

You\u2019re absolutely right, many people leave treatment fully determined to go right back to their eating disorder because centers did the absolute bare minimum of refeeding and cognitive rewiring.\n\nThat said, I\u2019ve noticed more centers are taking on approaches that don\u2019t emphasize target weights, limited intake, etc. and that\u2019s awesome. Still a long way to go, if course. Especially considering how rampant EDs have become over the last decade alone.\n\nThe one thing I do feel the need to say is that treatment centers aren\u2019t meant to be a cure for all of your mental health woes. depression and anxiety can exist outside of your eating disorder\u2014treatment isnt guaranteed to fix that, nor is it guaranteed to fix your eating disorder for that matter. You can learn all the of the skills at at the best treatment centers in the world to manage your ED but if even if you use them and still relapse, it\u2019s not on them. \n\nAnd it might sound depressing to say I\u2019ll always have an eating disorder, even when recovering, and that my anxiety and depression were worse afterwards because I wasn\u2019t numbing myself anymore; but holy shit I\u2019d rather be depressed here and there and maybe have a relapse once in a blue moon than *always* being in my eating disorder every waking moment with no time for anything else that\u2019s important to me. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

      "body": "I understand where you are coming from, and I can agree that ED treatment centers are lacking in a lot of ways. However, I think some are better than others. My experience with ED treatment centers was actually quite good. In no way was it perfect, but I think I got lucky with the centers that I went to. I was in treatment for a full year (inpatient, residential and then outpatient) and I can honestly say it made a huge, positive difference in my life. I don\u2019t believe I would be here if it wasn\u2019t for the centers I went to. \n\nWe played word games during meals, or had conversations about whatever we felt like talking about (within reason). We were allowed to talk about how we were feeling, or what we were struggling with. In fact, it was encouraged in a supportive setting. We had different groups for all different therapy types, we learned how to cook and portion our meals in a positive way. \n\nI haven\u2019t relapsed in the 5 years since I was in treatment, and I have friends from there that also haven\u2019t relapsed since then. But I have other friends from the same centers who have, multiple times. So I count myself lucky that I haven\u2019t relapsed. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s been easy the whole time, I\u2019ve had to be careful to stay on track with recovery. I believe there will always be that possibility that I could go back to my eating disorder if I\u2019m not aware of how I\u2019m doing in that regard. \n\nI guess I felt the need to rant a little myself, and wanted to offer an alternative viewpoint/experience in regards to treatment centers. Different things will work very differently for each individual person. I know many people have not had the same experience as me, and I completely understand it. In short, many things still need to change and there are unfortunately many bad treatment centers out there.",

      "body": "I honestly don't think this is an unpopular opinion...it's pretty well-acknowledged amongst the ED circles I'm in that treatment centers are, at best, problematic, and, at worst, actively harmful.\n\nLike you, I think that hospitalization for medical issues (and/or severe psychiatric issues like acute suicidality) followed by individual treatment in the community is the way to go. A few things, though:\n\nFirst, community-based treatment often relies upon meeting the patient where they're at and working with them to minimize harm/practice harm reduction where it's indicated. The problem with harm reduction is that (a) in the U.S., insurance companies usually have strict criteria for how much progress you \"should\" be making and how fast, and they might not cover services that practice a harm-reductive/patient-centered approach, and (b) individual providers may be hesitant to take on ED patients who they think of as a \"liability,\" especially if they are not making \"enough\" progress or working towards the goals that the provider thinks should be prioritized.\n\nSecond, I don't think there's a good solution for treating children and teenagers who point-blank refuse help. The best practice is to use family-based treatment, but FBT will not work in a number of situations. For example, FBT is time- and resource-intensive and probably won't be possible in a family where both parents/caregivers work full-time or in a single-parent household. Also, in a situation where there is abuse, FBT will not be effective. In those situations, it might be in the best interests of the child or teenager to get help in a residential setting. But as someone who received treatment as a teenager in an ethically-questionable facility that has fucked with me long-term, I still feel uneasy saying that.\n\nFinally (and this is purely me playing devil's advocate), I *do* want to point out that you can be grateful that a facility saved your life AND resent the way they went about doing it. Which is certainly the case for me and probably lots of people who have been in inpatient/residential treatment.",

      "body": "I totally agree that treatment centers very rarely cure eating disorders. However, they do serve an important purpose by providing symptom interruption when someone is completely unable to improve their eating disorder behaviors at home even with maximum outpatient support.  Although inpatient ED treatment certainly has not led to me being recovered, it has helped me immensely by forcing me to \u201creset\u201d my eating and ED behaviors when I\u2019ve dug myself too deep into the hole of relapse. Additionally, each time I get nutritionally restored through inpatient treatment it results in my body being healthier overall than if I had not received that period of healthy nutrition (even if I don\u2019t maintain it afterwards). It has definitely saved my life multiple times and/or my body would have lots of extensive damage. \n\nIn terms of actually addressing the psychological piece of eating disorders, I\u2019ve found I make the most progress through receiving outpatient therapy and psychiatric care after an inpatient stay because I\u2019m in a better nutrition and health state and thus more able to handle that work.",

I spent a lot of time crying in bathrooms or with my door closed at work. If I could not be crying in front of people then that would be great. There's a reason why I had to take off work and why my office even approved the short term disability. I wasn't super in control of anything. I couldnt do it anymore. But I also don't think crying in front of people is the worst thing. At least in res I could cry and couldn't then go into a spiral of I am going to hurt myself, or have someone get mad at me for being so upset. Most people in res, idk it's not like they're just in there bc they have an Ed. Most people in there are in really bad shape, and I don't mean physically. \n\nIn terms of did I go back to all of that as soon as I got out, yes and no. It put a complete stop to so many of my behaviors, php was not helpful for this but res was, and this is why I wished I had gone to res first and also stayed a little longer. I had been weighing myself 100+ times a day, I have cracked and bought a scale but I have not spent hours getting on and off the scale. I have not cut in a year. I haven't taken laxatives in a year. I have not hoarded my meds to od on in a year. I have been tempted to start scoping out places to go od, but I have not, which is a plus. Am I still restricting and over exercising? Yes. Do I still weigh myself? Yes. Have I still had a lot of si? Yes. I think if you have a good outpatient support system, family, friends, long term providers who get it, then it might be different? I had/have no one outside of people I pay to care about me to help me with my mental health. Grim but true. \n\nTreatment is funny, you are only ready to recover when you are ready to recover. And you have to fake it for awhile until it becomes a new pattern. Was it hard to have people around me tubed and not completing when I was finishing all my meals and snacks? But was I one of those people (not tubed) but sitting frantically trying to push grains of rice around? Also yes. It's a weird thing. \n\nI also am not trying to push treatment, bc idk honestly. I have been out of treatment for almost a year and have not honestly made a ton of progress on the front in the past year, in fact probably slid back from where I was when I discharged from iop.

Different things will work very differently for each individual person. I know many people have not had the same experience as me, and I completely understand it. In short, many things still need to change and there are unfortunately many bad treatment centers out there.",

I couldn't stop crying, at work, on the train, at mass. I had never been in a place where I could think about all the trauma memories and then talk about them, in my entire 30+ years. I needed to be somewhere, longer than a few days, where I was being watched and where I couldn't hurt myself, and where I could think and cry and it was okay. I couldn't do that at home safely. So yes treatment saved my life in that I was actively suicidal and had a plan and intent and means. Did it fix my ED? No.",

          "body": "Well I mean it kind of wasn't okay that I couldn't stop crying all the time. It wasn't like that was what I wanted to be doing lol. I spent a lot of time crying in bathrooms or with my door closed at work. If I could not be crying in front of people then that would be great. There's a reason why I had to take off work and why my office even approved the short term disability. I wasn't super in control of anything. I couldnt do it anymore. But I also don't think crying in front of people is the worst thing. At least in res I could cry and couldn't then go into a spiral of I am going to hurt myself, or have someone get mad at me for being so upset. Most people in res, idk it's not like they're just in there bc they have an Ed. Most people in there are in really bad shape, and I don't mean physically. \n\nIn terms of did I go back to all of that as soon as I got out, yes and no. It put a complete stop to so many of my behaviors, php was not helpful for this but res was, and this is why I wished I had gone to res first and also stayed a little longer. I had been weighing myself 100+ times a day, I have cracked and bought a scale but I have not spent hours getting on and off the scale. I have not cut in a year. I haven't taken laxatives in a year. I have not hoarded my meds to od on in a year. I have been tempted to start scoping out places to go od, but I have not, which is a plus. Am I still restricting and over exercising? Yes. Do I still weigh myself? Yes. Have I still had a lot of si? Yes. I think if you have a good outpatient support system, family, friends, long term providers who get it, then it might be different? I had/have no one outside of people I pay to care about me to help me with my mental health. Grim but true. \n\nTreatment is funny, you are only ready to recover when you are ready to recover. And you have to fake it for awhile until it becomes a new pattern. Was it hard to have people around me tubed and not completing when I was finishing all my meals and snacks? But was I one of those people (not tubed) but sitting frantically trying to push grains of rice around? Also yes. It's a weird thing. \n\nI also am not trying to push treatment, bc idk honestly. I have been out of treatment for almost a year and have not honestly made a ton of progress on the front in the past year, in fact probably slid back from where I was when I discharged from iop.

          "body": "ED treatment\u2014especially within treatment centers\u2014is severely lacking in *a lot* of ways due to fatphobic/diet culture rhetoric and an overall lack of understanding in terms of how EDs function, as well as a lack of access due to funds/insurance coverage, there is absolutely a need for some type of reform. You\u2019re absolutely right, many people leave treatment fully determined to go right back to their eating disorder because centers did the absolute bare minimum of refeeding and cognitive rewiring.\n\nThat said, I\u2019ve noticed more centers are taking on approaches that don\u2019t emphasize target weights, limited intake, etc. and that\u2019s awesome. Still a long way to go, if course. Especially considering how rampant EDs have become over the last decade alone.\n\nThe one thing I do feel the need to say is that treatment centers aren\u2019t meant to be a cure for all of your mental health woes. depression and anxiety can exist outside of your eating disorder\u2014treatment isnt guaranteed to fix that, nor is it guaranteed to fix your eating disorder for that matter. You can learn all the of the skills at at the best treatment centers in the world to manage your ED but if even if you use them and still relapse, it\u2019s not on them. \n\nAnd it might sound depressing to say I\u2019ll always have an eating disorder, even when recovering, and that my anxiety and depression were worse afterwards because I wasn\u2019t numbing myself anymore; but holy shit I\u2019d rather be depressed here and there and maybe have a relapse once in a blue moon than *always* being in my eating disorder every waking moment with no time for anything else that\u2019s important to me. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
