  "title": "I always perceive myself as disgusting and unlovable for gaining weight, and yet I find people in bigger bodies genuinely attractive.",
  "selftext": "Just a silly little rant as a reminder to myself, but like:\n\nI love the way people in bigger bodies than mine look. That\u2019s not the ED talking either; I have literally always just found big bodies attractive. \n\nI cry when I see people who\u2019ve recovered from anorexia. I cry at this immediate, all-consuming realization at how beautiful and variable bodies are.\n\nAnd yet, when I see myself gain weight, I am disgusted. I tell myself I am unlovable. I tell myself that my boyfriend will leave me, that I\u2019ll be chastised on the street, that it is fundamentally impossible for a person to value me if I\u2019m in a bigger body. I refuse to believe my boyfriend when he tells me he\u2019d love me if I gained weight, even as he actively encourages my recovery. And I somehow think it doesn\u2019t mean anything that I obviously still love and find him attractive when his body changes - in fact, I only ever find him more and more attractive because the more I know him, the more there is to love. \n\nAnd yet, I seriously tell myself that there is no one on this planet who could love a bigger body, and that everyone craves the smallest person possible.\n\nBut! I am living proof! That this is not true!\n\nI have seriously undervalued myself so badly that I can\u2019t even see that I am proof enough that no body is fundamentally unlovable. And obviously there are many, many people out there who think the way I do.",

(also, she has had an ED too, which hurts my heart because I find her so so beautiful, she feels the same way towards me). bodies of all kinds really are amazing and I believe your mind and body will catch up with the knowledge of this over time",

Towards others I feel body positivity where I love the way all shapes look, and even body neutrality where I don\u2019t particularly care or have preferences.. but towards myself I feel an intense body negativity especially lately where it seems like nothing ever makes me happy. Do you think it correlates with depression and self loathing , that it has nothing to do with others but just the task of processing trauma directed at yourself? Idk if that makes sense, I\u2019m trying to find the answer as well.",
