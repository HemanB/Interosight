  "selftext": "Honestly I've been TERRIFIED of extreme hunger but today I realised I'm literally in control of what I eat and I'm going to use that control to listen to my body as it's SCREAMING at me to eat. I've deprived it so much, that food is all I ever think about. I literally have stress dreams about breakfast. So I just ate and ate until I felt it was enough and yeah it's uncomfortable but I don't feel like a shivering, miserable pit of doom awaiting the next stupidly small meal ill eat.\n\nI've been trying to resist it for MONTHS and let me tell you it does not go away and I'm just giving in as of today. If you're reading this because you're scared of your extreme hunger, take it as a sign to just go and eat because it isn't going anywhere and your body is literally begging you. Food isn't scary it's just energy and youre in control. No you aren't binging, no you aren't doing anything wrong. You need more food than anyone else in your house right now. \n\nEat your way out or you'll be miserable until you do, life is so much more than worrying about food, exercise and bodies every waking hour so go and LIVE ",
