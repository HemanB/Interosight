  "selftext": "Mhhh ugh. For the most part my Therepist has been excellent and very helpful in other aspects of my mental illnesses but she never fails to trigger my eating disorder. I mentioned in a last session that when I Chose recovery it would be pretty exciting to eat literally any food I want instead of my sad sad bowls of oatmeal and tuna salad, and that that was something positive to look forward to in recovery. she told me this was worrying because many anorexics \u201cturn\u201d to BED. I\u2019ve been on this subreddit enough to know that that simply isn\u2019t true. Extreme hunger is a necessary part of recovery and not a binge disorder but it sent me into a spiral regardless and I\u2019ve fallen heavily back into restriction, all my brain heard was \u201cyou are weak if you honour your hunger\u201d",
