  "selftext": "I heard my classmates mention specific calorie amounts about things I like eating, and instead of losing my mind over it I just went on with the rest of my day mildly annoyed. Literally 2 days later, and I don\u2019t even remember what numbers they said! It just made me realize that even when things are tough, I HAVE gotten better. I even started going on dates and stuff, and having no problem with eating burgers or having unknown snacks afterwards. I promise it\u2019s possible to heal!",

We at least were the brave ones to admit it and try to become better. Whenever I hear someone talk about diets and steps and calories I just zone out because I honestly couldn\u2019t care less!",

Obviously you'll have ups and downs, but if you push through, it all pays off. Remember, the 'healthiest' people are those that don't restrict. Your mind is clearer and life becomes so much simpler, coming from someone who considers themselves recovered. :))",

For me it was less stressful not to know then to be aware of the calories, but I know it\u2019s different for everyone. I also covered up the nutritional information, had other people make my meals and instead of having a pre portioned amount I would pick it out randomly. (Like getting the big bag of chips instead of small bags). It gets harder to count, and it feels stressful at first but eventually I got used to it.\n\nAnd as for the fear, a huge help was having a support system (my parents, as an example) who would comfort me and help distract me. But another important thing I did when it got hard was to remember all the good times I\u2019ve had when food was involved, like a slumber party with pizza & my friends or having hot chocolate when I was sad. It\u2019s nice to remember what you\u2019re fighting for, and the good that\u2019ll come from feeling temporarily scared. Eventually, that fear will get weaker and weaker until it doesn\u2019t affect you anymore. The most important thing in my opinion is just to keep pushing forward! And good luck!

      "body": "I think it's helpful to buy a big bag of something and pour it in a big container without labels. It also helps me to make recipes that don't have calorie counts and I eat the amount I want in a sitting without worrying about calories. If you are buying baked goods or things from a local store, they rarely list calorie information, so that could be helpful too. \n\nCalories don't give you information on how much you actually absorb and calorie counting is not really achieving what most people think it is. I've been in higher levels of care on 4,000+ calories and I wasn't gaining weight, so that shows that calories aren't the end-all-be-all diet culture wants us to think they are.",
