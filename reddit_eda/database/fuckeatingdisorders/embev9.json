And it is triggering.  \n\nOn the other hand, solid poops are something I still do a little happy dance about.  Like, how cool is it that my body is doing the food into waste thing properly? \n\nSo, like everything else in recovery, I both hate myself for it and congratulate myself for it.  Sigh.",
