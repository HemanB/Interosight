  "selftext": "No one cares that my intake at my lowest was [redacted], or my longest fast was [redacted], or about my exercise compulsions when I was at my worst. \n\nI'm not special just because I can torture my body and make myself suffer for no goddamn reason. \n\nPeople *do* care about me, and they *do* want to hear about my life, but the behaviors that went along with my ED aren't interesting topics of conversation. No one wants to hear about my obsessive calorie counting strategies and food rituals and body fixations. \n\nWe talk about our EDs like we're these beautiful, sick unicorns and we really aren't. We're a dime a dozen. The stuff we do isn't special and no one cares. They want us to get better so we can talk about other hobbies, have our personalities back, be the people we were before the ED behaviors became our entire lives. \n\nYour ED isn't special and no one cares.  It's not interesting. You're not special because you can stubbornly slowly kill yourself - there are a million reasons that people should love you and care about you, but that isn't one of them.",
