  "selftext": "So I hate pictures of myself like many of us, but my mom looooves taking candid random photos whenever we\u2019re doing family stuff.\n\nI was looking through old photos of me. My weights fluctuates often it\u2019s kinda shitty.\n\nI came across [this.](https://imgur.com/a/GzLbUCc) Which is from my 19th birthday party during that time I was in a fucking awful place with my ed. \n\nIs it just me or does this not perfectly shows the internal conflict I had with food.\n\nMy body language when I\u2019m talking myself out of eating is to wrap my arms around my stomach and remind myself why I don\u2019t need food bc I can wrap my arms around my whole torso basically. I\u2019m looking so longingly at the cake because I want to eat it all but am scared of calories or how I\u2019ll eat it all then throw it up. \n\nThat\u2019s all the emotions in this picture. ",
