  "selftext": "Yes, I did. Even after eating a \"normal\" amount the whole day, and it was safe foods my ed was comfortable with. Am I still going to eat today? Yes. \n\nI left treatment two days ago and I made a promise I wouldn't let myself down again. I can't spend the rest of my life in and out of treatment centers. I'm on the waiting list somewhere from home but I'm so tired of people telling me how I need to recover and not knowing really shit about me or my body or where I should be. I was miserable and lonely at home and miserable and lonely there.\n\nI'm going to be 21 this year and the last thing I want to do is spend it a miserable, no energy ass, wreck. I want to look back and be proud of myself. \n\nI might be on a high right now but I'm going to keep pushing everyday and not expect failure. My body is hungry. I AM fucking hungry. You can't go from starving it to normal. It's something I'm going to have to accept if I ever wanna get better and stop cheating around it. \n\nSee you all at breakfast :^)",
