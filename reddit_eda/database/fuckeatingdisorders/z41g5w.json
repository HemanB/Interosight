  "selftext": "I will post something about how unlearning and dismantling your own internalized fatphobia is a vital step in genuine ed recovery and people will almost always read that and respond negatively. Like?? I literally made a comment about medical fatphobia being a real thing and apparently that\u2019s a controversial take. \n\nLike I get not having fully worked out your *internalized* fatphobia yet but it seems like they\u2019re just generally hostile towards anyone who recognizes that fatphobia is far far deeper and more complex than just being actively rude or mean towards another person directly. It\u2019s just a very inhospitable space for people who actually are seeking recovery, especially if you have the the nerve to be overweight, have an ED and be seeking recovery (talking about myself in case that wasn\u2019t clear lol).",
