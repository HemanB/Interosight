  "selftext": "I know they might not understand how triggering it can be to talk that way but it\u2019s still so frustrating. One of my friends talks about it so much, about how she\u2019s way too busy to eat so all she\u2019ll have is a coffee in one day and she\u2019s losing so much weight!! But I know it\u2019s not healthy to live that way anyways, and it might cause permanent damage to her body. I will talk to her about it if it comes up again.",

      "body": "I remember reading somewhere that the entire practice of people \"humble-bragging\" about how little they eat, whether it be due to busy work schedule, natural appetite, or just plain ol' forgetfulness, was actually still quite heavily tied into society's disordered relationship with food. And that theory definitely makes sense when you consider how people will happily make comments like \"Omg, I'm so busy I barely ate half an apple all day today! Haha!\" with no problem whatsoever, but you rarely hear as often people talking as candidly about the times they feel as if they ate too much (not that \"too much\" is a real measure, but ygwim), since the latter is considered more \"shameful\" while the former is considered something to be proud of, even if only subconsciously. \n\nLike definitely not to get all armchair psychologist about it, but I really do think at the end of the day it's all the same toxic puritanical mindset about how abstaining from food is on some level a worthy accomplishment that one should be proud of.",
