  "title": "That feeling of being a special unicorn - does anyone else struggle with it?",
  "selftext": "Everyone says that I should follow my hunger, that in my situation it is only normal to want to eat a lot of food and I should just do it because it won't last forever. But I am a special unicorn, therefore it will last forever.\n\nEveryone says that I will gain weight and then stabilize around my pre-ED weight, which was a very healthy weight. But I am a special unicorn, therefore I will just keep gaining and gaining to infinite obesity.\n\nEveryone says that my binges are mainly due to restriction. But I am a special unicorn, therefore my binges are totally unrelated to my restriction and restricting is a perfectly reasonable behaviour to compensate binges.\n\nEveryone says I should let go. But I am a special unicorn, therefore I should not let go because this and this will happen if I do it.\n\nEveryone says he/she has had the same experiences as me. But I am a special unicorn, therefore it can't be true.\n\nEveryone says you can have an eating disorder at any weight, you can eat unrestrictedly at any weight, being at a minimally healthy BMI doesn't mean you're fully recovered, and so on. But I am a special unicorn, therefore I can only be allowed to eat if I am super-ultra-underweight.\n\nEveryone says I will feel better mentally and physically once I will be at a healthier weight, and it won't be as shitty as I imagine it now. But I am a special unicorn, therefore this won't happen to me.\n\nEveryone says it won't just go away on its own and at some point I'll have to actively challenge it by doing scary things that I don't really want to do, and not just for one day but consistently over and over again until they are not scary anymore. But I am a special unicorn, therefore I can just sit here and wait for it to go away while I keep wasting my life with this stupid illness and not trying to change anything.\n\nNothing is valid for me. No scientific study, no previous lived experience, no medical advice, no suggestions from friends or family applies to my condition. I am different. I am a special unicorn.",
