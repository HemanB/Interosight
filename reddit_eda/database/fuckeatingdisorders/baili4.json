  "selftext": "If I see one more instagram post about how \"did you know you can use INTUITIVE EATING to LOSE WEIGHT????!! Trick your body into eating less today!!!\" I'm actually going to lose my mind. \n\nThe fact that intuitive eating is now so commonly touted as this \\~fun little trick\\~ to \"hack\" your body into eating less is fucking sickening.  \n\nThis morning I read about something called the \"anti-diet diet\", basically some messed up little hobgoblins saw the anti-diet movement, a movement about rejecting diet culture and respecting everyone's bodies (including your own) as they actually and naturally are, and thought, \"Oooh fun! I'm going to make a diet out of this!!! Eat what you want but just, like, not all the time, so you don't gain weight, k? :/ This is totally healthy and not disordered because I called it the anti-diet diet\" \n\nThese people feel like fucking vultures. They can't leave anything alone or let anything be healing and innocent. Everything needs to be co-opted as part of their sad world where all that matters is losing weight. How fucking lonely and depressing do you have to be to be so physically incapable of viewing eating as anything other than a competition of \"who's doing it best.\"",

Previously I would look for signs of ED in *everyone* and always find them - that person is snacking a lot so must be a compulsive eater, that person eats small portions so must be restricting, that person read the package of a food and so must be calorie counting. I really don't care much anymore, I eat with dieting friends and friends with low appetites and friends who are health conscious. It does not affect me much.   \nI think I wanted someone to look for the signs in myself.",
