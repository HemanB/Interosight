  "selftext": "i have good days & bad days. i have days full of regret asking myself \"what have i done?\" but i also have other days where i remember how unhappy i was when i was restricting & how mean i was to those around me because i was so irritable & unhappy. in the beginning i was \"attempting recovery\" (still restricting) eating around 1,500-1,800 cals a day & SLOWLY gaining. after awhile i then upped my intake to about 2,500 cals a day & was still not gaining at a rapid pace & at first i was fine with that. one night about a month & a half ago the extreme hunger was too much to handle & my body was shaking i could no longer ignore my hunger so i gave in. it's been almost two months of pain, sadness & anger but also of happiness & relief. i was a lost cause & i was genuinely sure that i would not make it to my 21st birthday. i started from an >!11 bmi!< & am now edging on being a \"healthy weight\" again. (even though bmi does not mean much) am i scared? of course but am i continuing on through the fear & pain? i am. i try to be proud of myself for how far i've come since i've had no outside help (no therapist, dietician, hospital) & a very toxic environment but i am doing it. i am trying to accept my body for how it looks & some days that's easy but some days it is really really fucking hard & restriction comes to my mind but then i try & realize how far i have come & how much progress i've made! i even think my weight is beginning to distribute more evenly now which is a relief & exciting. sorry for the long post i am just incredibly emotional right now & i want u all to know u CAN do this! u can attempt recovery & live a happy life. please just try! i know it's terrifying but what have u got to lose? ur eating disorder is always waiting for u but trust me once u experience freedom u won't want to go back. thank u to anyone who listened i am sending all of u love & am endlessly grateful for this sub (& all of u tolerating my many annoying posts)",

      "body": "I'm in a very similar place to you. I gained weight over the last year to a now normal weight for my height. I definitely have days where I feel fat and I wonder, \"What have I done?\" I have days now where I'm convinced I'm massive. I haven't taken many photos and have mainly hidden myself because I really am not convinced I look great. It's a strange headspace to be in. How do you accept your body? Like you, I did this alone. I feel like I can relate to your post so much. I'm just not used to this body. It doesn't feel like me in a lot of ways. Honestly though, I'm extremely proud of you for doing this. I know how hard it is and I understand the struggle. You're right though... ultimately, it is worth it because my mood and energy level is a LOT better. I'm sure you've noticed the energy thing. It's pretty remarkable the difference.",
