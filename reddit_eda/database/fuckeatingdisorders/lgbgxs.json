  "title": "a big recovery win: finally being able to keep leftovers in my room",
  "selftext": "i've rarely been to my university meal hall because it's buffet style (all to-go now) with hundreds of options and big portions, left overs are inevitable. i used to not trust myself to go because i wasn't able to stop eating after being full AND if i had leftovers they would be on my mind 24/7 until i ate them. \n\ntoday for the first time i went with a bag, got as much delicious food as i could, ate until i was full, and stored the rest in my fridge to have tomorrow or for dinner. I'm looking at the Tupperware FULL of food now with no desire to overeat and i trust myself not to. wow. never before in my entire life. \n\nanother win, early recovery binges were something i always struggled with especially after my nightly mary jane consumption so i would just set myself a hard and fast rule: NO EATING after said activity.  yesterday night i was lying in bed being tantalized by the cookies right under my bed. then i was like wait a sec I'm allowed to eat this this is fine wtf and i ate them and i fell asleep :\\~)",
