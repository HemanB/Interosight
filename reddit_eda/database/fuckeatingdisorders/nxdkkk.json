  "selftext": "Hey, y'all. Currently in recovery from AN for a year. Pre-ED my chest size was average/above average. Then I dropped weight and it got considerably smaller. Eventually  I decided to recover, but even though I'm almost up to my pre-disorder weight now, my boobs are still very small. I literally went from a D to A cup :( On the bright side my WTH ratio got smaller, so I feel like the disorder changed my body shape and the way fat distributes. Wondering if anyone else has similar experiences?",

I had decently size boobs before, but when I regained initially, I was still a cup smaller and 2 pant sizes larger. After about a year and a half of maintaining (if not gaining about 7 more pounds from my initial weight before dropping) my body decided to reshape itself better and my boobs came back and I went down to my regular pant size. Im not exactly sure why. But I've heard that happening with other people as well. The annoying part is that it takes so goddamn long haha.",
