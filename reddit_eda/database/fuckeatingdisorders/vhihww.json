It\u2019s literally like a diet product??? it advertises itself as a \u201cguilt free\u201d candy bar bc it\u2019s high protein, low sugar and \u201chealthy\u201d lmao. the fact that misfits has so many recovery influencers as partners is kinda jarring bc they know that their audiences would most likely still gravitate to a diet product. It\u2019s pretty predatory to me. idk, just something I noticed so let me know if I\u2019m totally off-base",

You need to define obsession (in this case we will use obsess, as obsession is the noun to obsess, and thus a state of being): **ob\u00b7sess \u2022/\u0259b\u02c8ses/ verb \u2022 preoccupy or fill the mind of (someone) continually, intrusively, and to a troubling extent. \u2022(of a person) be preoccupied with or constantly worrying about something.** By your logic, anyone who has had an ED and works with people with EDs aren\u2019t recovered\u2026 and that\u2019s not true. Are we to pretend that EDs just don\u2019t exist? I\u2019m not hyperfixated on food, my body, or my own recovery [anymore]. I\u2019m not even hyperfixated on others\u2019 recoveries. Which, in this instance, is what I used to point out recovery accounts that remain in a \u201cprocess\u201d of indefinite recovery to excuse the continuation of engaging with behaviors such as undereating and body checking, and/or compulsive exercise. \n\nThere is a huge difference between wanting to help people when there is so much misinformation about recovery out there and  very little access to treatment for the majority of ED sufferers, and being \u201cobsessed\u201d with my, or others\u2019, recovery. Do I think y\u2019all deserve recovery? Absolutely. Am I plagued with intrusive thoughts about y\u2019all\u2019s recovery to the point it is affecting my personal life? No. I don\u2019t even think about my own recovery too much because I have other things that need my attention\u2014and as a mod, this sub happens to be one of them. Not everyone recovers, and that\u2019s fine. But knowing all of your *options*, or having a safe space to recover when you *do* want to recover is definitely a concern of mine in this sub. If you wanna call that obsession, go right ahead, but we have very different definitions of what that words means. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
