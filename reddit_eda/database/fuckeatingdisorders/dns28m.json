  "title": "i wanted to share something a student nurse showed me in my darkest hour",
  "selftext": "the first time i was hospitalised, i nearly died. i was supposed to have six small meals a day and could hardly manage an apple juice. a student nurse, probably about twenty, showed me some incredible compassion. she'd sit with me for hours and my 1:1, making sure i didn't pull any stupid stunts. she showed me this video. it's from twilight, so i felt a bit silly sharing it, but it changed things. it shows an emaciated and gaunt bella - i guess the body i was striving for. then the life begins to re-enter her - her cheeks lose their hollowness, the weight begins to gain again. and god - she looks beautiful. she looks alive. its weirdly profound.
