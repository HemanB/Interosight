I haven't got on a scale since I hit 145 this past summer and my self esteem plummeted. I'm too scared to at this point. I got a job at a bakery in August and have had a huge issue with binging up until this past month when a coworker mentioned I looked thin on a day I felt huge. I've cut down a lot, but it's still been really hard not to when I'm up late and bored. I know it doesn't feel normal, but it really is.

Do your best to balance your meals in recovery and establish healthy food patterns. It sucks, but please dont feel like you're the only one.",

It\u2019s a common occurrence for anorexics, if not something that happens to *every* anorexic. \n\nI went from underweight and eating a small amount of food 2-3 days a week to eating 3-5k calories every day, probably 4 or 5 meals on average, because of my extreme hunger. I felt out of control sometimes. It scared me and made me feel like I was absolutely repulsive, but it\u2019s what my body needed. I knew I had to give my body what it was asking for if I ever wanted things to get better. The human body does not like being underweight and will fight back against starvation.\n\nI sat in bed with two pints of ice cream, a sleeve of Oreos, a box of bakery cookies, and a bag of chocolate covered cashews and inhaled them in record time the other day. Recovery can be messy and normal to nobody but you, and that\u2019s okay.",

No matter how many times you relapse, no matter how much you eat, recovery isn't just \"Yeah I was diagnosed with anorexia the other day and now I eat the amount you should with no problem!\" if anything it is often \"I was diagnosed with anorexia a couple years ago and I'm still trying to get better, I have relapsed countless times and binged lots but I'm trying\". \n\nRecovery is different for everyone!\n\nI am NOT saying anorexia is a diet or lightening the seriousness of it I am just using this as an example; \n\nPeople who do healthy diets or just eat healthy have cheat days where they eat a ton of junk and that's natural! Because afterall whoever you are , eating something even if its unhealthy af that is better than not eating at all!  \n\nyou said there are so many people who never binge in recovery, but there are so many people who **do**. Some people (like me) aren't even recovering or trying, you're making an effort. Life isn't a game, the progress you make doesn't go down the drain just because of something you may see as 'un-pure'.\n\nI understand the high you get when you restrict, I love the feeling of my stomach excruciating feeling in my stomach , I totally get it. But don't you miss the feeling of love and happiness you got when you had just ate loads of really nice stuff and felt like you were going to explode? \n\nSorry if this wasn't any help, wishing you the best :)",
