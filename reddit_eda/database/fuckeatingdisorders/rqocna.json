  "selftext": "To all the people who are recovering/ have recovered into an overweight body, can you drop a comment so I can see more of us exist?See, I feel kinda alone in a way. I see lots of comments on how it\u2019s common to recover into an overweight body, including overweight by (stupid) BMI standards and people who are classed as plus size. Yet, all the recovery influencers I see are always still super thin and look malnourished, yet are like \u201crecovery\u2019s so worth it I feel so great and happy in my body hehe!!!\u201d Now I\u2019m definitely not saying that recovering into a smaller body is wrong or anything, people are naturally petite and I get all that. But I just don\u2019t wanna feel like I\u2019m the only person who has recovered from an ED and recovered into a larger body. I would rather be in a bigger body and happy than in a smaller body and miserable/sick. But if other people could say, like, \u201chey! I recovered into a larger body! I exist!\u201d Just so I know that I\u2019m not the only one chilling over here then I would really appreciate it. This post is kinda stupid really but I just wanna feel like theres other people who are the same and understand me :\u2019)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: thank you all so so much for the comments!!! You have all made me feel so happy and so grateful. I\u2019m so glad I chose recovery. Now I don\u2019t feel alone anymore, there\u2019s so many of us in the same boat. Thanks for the comments, I\u2019ve read every single one and they\u2019ve made me feel so positive <33333",

I feel super embarrassed because preED I was within the \u201cnOrMaL\u201d BMI range and now I\u2019ve overshot (for lack of a better term), and it is something I\u2019m really struggling with despite how hard I advocate for fat acceptance, etc. but I am trying so hard to work on that.

I also barely have any clothes and finding a bra is now basically impossible so I just live in constant discomfort in that area lol. I just try not to look at myself too closely anymore and have resigned myself to the idea of \"body respect/body neutrality.\" - it's probably the best I'll be able to do at this point in my life. I always dreamed of the day I would actually like and feel comfortable with how I look but I just don't see that happening anymore.

When I was taking antidepressants for GAD and my usual corticosteroids for rhinitis and astma, I developed Cushing's syndrome, so I gained quite a lot of weight extremely fast and when you have it, you can't lose weight even with the gratest deficit. And all of this while also having an ED, that I was denying so hard having. So all my fears were becoming a reality. But I got to a point where I couldn't take any more of weighing food, counting calories precisely, thinking about food so much, thinking I'm a total failure because I'm not skinny, so I started recovery. It was a quasi-recovery at first, but after a pretty bad relapse, I decided to start real recovery. And I'm so glad I did it. Even when I was at my worst and before having Cushing's, I was never underweight. I was eating next to nothing and I was still only at a \"healthy weight\" on the BullshitMI. Genetically, I was never meant to be skinny either, but thanks to diet culture and misinformation, I thought that I can simply change that by eating very little all my life and I never thought that it can have any health consequences. You can tell the level of mental health awareness in my country :)). It really helps to know there are other overweight people that are recovering from an ED and I know there are so many, but due to stigma and social media it seems like an oddity. I hope it will change and everyone, regardless of their weight, are worthy of recovery and deserves good mental and physical health.",

As a result, I reached body neutrality, amazing new friendships/stronger old friendships, found a new hobby, got a puppy to keep me busy, and ended up quitting my soul sucking desk job to be a dog trainer apprentice. So many things I was always waiting to do until I was thin enough and it turns out I could do all those things and more in a larger body. It gave me a sense of confidence with friends and dating to know that I never needed to be thin in the first place - people like me for me.

Set point is a range of 5-20 lbs, yes, but it doesn\u2019t simply change because you are more active and decide to \u201ceat in moderation\u201d (another word for restriction imo), if that were true 94% of diets wouldn\u2019t fail, nor would individuals gain back all their weight and then some, because they\u2019d be able to manipulate their set point. Whether or not you intended it as such, you are implying that making physical changes is a \u201clifestyle\u201d that directly influences your set point and that\u2019s literally why most of us are in recovery\u2014because we put too much emphasis on our physical bodies and the food we put into it. Set point is affected by many things, from our environment to our physical and psychological well being, but the range is just a safety net, you can\u2019t just decide you wanna weigh 20 lbs less. And as someone who is extremely active and eats according to my hunger, I don\u2019t weight less because I go to the gym or work an active job.\n\nI\u2019m not saying your treatment team is full of shit but treatment centers have a long history of being fatphobic, even in subtle ways, and many do not understand or even accept set point, and if they so accept it they believe it is something that can be manipulated to achieve thinness. So I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m not really impressed with your therapist\u2019s opinion. Maybe I *did* misinterpret your comment, but I\u2019m still left feeling like you and your team are excusing restriction and manipulating your body based on set point being within a range and I just think that\u2019s\u2026 really weird for ED specialists to encourage. Also, saying individuals weigh more because their less active and eat \u201cbad\u201d food *is* fatphobia. Don\u2019t really know how it\u2019s not.",

I don\u2019t mean to sound rude I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m just trying to get my point across :) \n\nI agree with you about set point that it\u2019s biological and doesn\u2019t change just because someone\u2019s more active and you are right that 94% of diets fail, because the body is very resilient and tries it\u2019s best to hold on to the weight it feels and functions best at; so if someone loses a lot of weight by extreme restriction on a harsh diet, then when they go off the diet their hunger cues will likely ramp up substantially and they will likely as a result eat a lot more in order to listen to that hunger, that\u2019s the body\u2019s way of restoring that energy deficit. So then they often will regain some or all of the weight they lost (and then some sometimes). The body also tries to conserve energy and maintain its set point when faced with extreme calorie restriction by slowing down the metabolism, making you cold all the time, making you tired and brain foggy so you don\u2019t spend precious energy on thinking when it needs those calories to keep the organs running and maintain homeostasis. Etc.\u2014so I totally get what you are saying about set point and I agree with it :)\n\nWhat I meant was, when I was talking with my therapist about the set point theory and how I was so scared it would make me gain weight, we worked through those fears. Because she doesn\u2019t want me to continue restricting so extremely and living in fear controlled by an ed, when there is no way that I even know what would happen when I eat/in recovery if I do not actually even do it. She wasn\u2019t coming at it from a diet culture lens or fat phobia (she operates on the Health At Every Size/HAES model and has brought up dismantling and working on my fear of getting fat, so she is very much not fatphobic). What we talked about was, set point isn\u2019t an end all be all for weight. It\u2019s a range (like you said, of 5-20 lb) where your body naturally gravitates to and settles at when you\u2019re not actively restricting foods you want or crave or need, or forcing yourself to do excessive exercise you don\u2019t enjoy. At the end of the day, the law of thermodynamics still applies and works with set point theory, where an individual\u2019s lifestyle absolutely influences one\u2019s weight *to a degree* (I used the room influences very intentionally here, *not* defines\u2014I think maybe that\u2019s where my point my have been misunderstood, for I simply meant that set point is a *function* of a complex array of factors: genetics and biology, yes, but also taking into account the natural lifestyle and food intake of the individual. I\u2019ll give an example of what I meant: if two identical twins are born and separated at birth adopted to different families, and one grows up being raised really active, maybe running is a hobby they enjoy and they generally eat lots of whole foods and fruits and vegetables and whole grains, maybe they don\u2019t have much of a sweet tooth but they love eating a slice of cake or two when they feel like it, and stop when they no longer crave it, even if that means not finishing what\u2019s on their plate or leaving the piece of cake to finish at a later time when they\u2019re in the mood again. Let\u2019s say the second twin grows up in a different family, one that is naturally less sporty and doesn\u2019t ingrain the love of running/camping/skiing/etc in that person (my family is like this for example, I always would ask my parents if we could do something fun like go on a walk or hike when I was a kid and they\u2019d be like nah that\u2019s boring. I was so jealous of my friends who went out and did things with their families and who got to go on exciting ski trips and run 5Ks together. It seemed so fun to me and whenever I got a small taste of it, like when I was able to convince my parents to doing a partial little 5K walk with me when I was like 12, I had so much fun but they didn\u2019t find it as fun and didn\u2019t want to do it again). Maybe that family is stretched on a tighter income and has to rely on cheaper fast foods to feed their family, maybe fresh fruits are too expensive so the individual instead snacks on what is available in the household, cheaper snacks like chips for example. Maybe they simply have more of a sweet tooth and to them, unrestricted eating means eating a slice of cake everyday which the first individual would have not craved because they simply weren\u2019t much of a sweets person, so *their* unrestricted eating means eating that slice of cake on a less frequent basis. The key point I was trying to make here, is that *both* of these individuals are experiencing their own *versions* of unrestricted and intuitive eating, and engaging in whatever activity and lifestyles feels most comfortable to them (ie if hiking and running 5Ks is something you enjoy, yay! But if it\u2019s not, that\u2019s so totally completely okay too and more joyful movement is what\u2019s natural and healthy for that person). In this scenario, both of the twins are genetically identical in terms of *biological* set point, in which case their natural metabolic function and the amount of calories their body requires as energy to maintain homeostasis are roughly the same range. But because of the fact that set point is not *purely* biological but *also* FURTHER a function of lifestyle and diet factors, the first twin will likely weigh less than the second one; or perhaps more, seeing as muscle weighs more than fat...what I meant is that the first one might appear more conventionally \u201chealthy\u201d and socially acceptable in terms of body weight in today\u2019s diet culture obsessed society, whereas the second one might be in a comparatively larger body that society judges as less \u201chealthy\u201d and \u201coverweight\u201d by arbitrary bmi standards. Both of these individuals have the same biological set point but because they also have vastly different lifestyles (one very active naturally, not out of the intention to control their weight but simply out of pure joy and love for being active, one much more sedentary, not because they are \u201clazy\u201d or \u201cunhealthy\u201d but simply because, like my parents I discussed earlier, they don\u2019t enjoy vigorous activity as much, and prefer to live less active lifestyles that align with what they find joy in). On the diet end, both twins are eating what they feel best eating/listening to their body and cravings and/or within the social and financial constraints they exist within. The first twin is simply consuming what they prefer, and the family generally eats whole foods and fruits and vegetables often, because they are fortunate enough to afford it and they find that that is what they crave and feel the best eating. The second twin is also simply consuming what they prefer, but because they have a natural sweet tooth they eat more foods that are objectively higher in calories and fat and sugar (NOT saying that any of that is bad. Calories are necessary, fat is necessary, sugar is a carbohydrate and that is the main macronutrient your body and brain runs off of. What I mean here is that it is in a larger quantity due to that individual\u2019s dietary preferences than the first twin, comparatively speaking). (I also want to interject this scientific article here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5781054/#s1title which studies how \u201cpeople with lower income are more vulnerable to obesity, the framework of social determinants of health indicates that material conditions confine one\u2019s access to healthy food and healthcare, while also influencing health-related behaviours (ie, dietary behaviours and physical activity).\u201d \u2014I don\u2019t mean obesity in terms of diet culture judgment and fatphobia, but am simply restating a quote from a scientific article in order to add depth to my point about how lifestyle and social factors can absolutely influence one\u2019s weight, such as if one is constrained by their budget to rely only on processed and packaged and fast foods).",

Both twins are *at* their set point, if you consider that they are living their normal lives and not actively restricting or controlling or suppressing their weight/bodies. BUT despite the identical nature of their genetics, their weights are different because of the fact that set point weight and one\u2019s body is not ONLY influenced solely by genetics but also by lifestyle and dietary preferences and social environments and a complex array of factors. \n\nNeither twin is \u201chealthier\u201d or better than the other. They are simply existing in different lives and their respective bodies have balanced out to a weight that aligns with their energy intake/consumption and activity levels/lifestyles. \n\n\nSo that\u2019s what I meant, I\u2019m sorry this scenario is so long but I really wanted to try to explain my thoughts in a way that would make sense from an outside perspective. I definitely never intended to be fatphobic by any means, and I\u2019m sorry if my original comment came off in that way. I simply was trying to explain my point that a post like OP\u2019s ignites a lot of fear in people with restrictive eds like me, and it\u2019s the idea of being \u201cdoomed\u201d by set point and biology to inevitably gain weight that petrifies me to the point that I have refused recovery for so long, out of fear. So when I spoke to my therapist and doctor and dietitian about my fears of set point, *this* is the scenario that alleviated my fear and helped me understand set point to a more nuanced degree and the idea that your body *knows what it\u2019s doing* when it eats food, and your *individual* habits and lifestyle *still* affects your weight and your individual set point, in CONJUCTION with biology and genetics. \n\nI really hope that made more sense. I definitely wanted to clear up the misconceptions I feel you made towards my original comment, which I wrote out of my own perspective as someone with an ed terrified of weight gain beyond my control and the idea that set point = doom. I wrote it with the basis of science, and the perspective of HAES where every individual\u2019s recovery is valid and looks different because every individual has different tastes/preferences for food and activity, and social influences like environment (food deserts, income levels, etc), which all combine into the plethora of factors that influence one\u2019s weight. That\u2019s what I meant. I hope this makes more sense. Thanks for reading this far if you did haha.",

Your treatment team is *still* insinuating that eating \u201cbad\u201d foods lead to less muscle mass and an overall higher weight\u2014even if it\u2019s within some range\u2014and that eating \u201cWhole Foods\u201d (which isn\u2019t actually a real term or way of eating and extremely vague at best, *most* foods are processed, doesn\u2019t make the nutritionally inferior) means you will be leaner and weigh less. That is still giving some type of moral value to food, even if you say that\u2019s not what you\u2019re doing, because it still feeds into diet culture myths that food is a huge factor in our weight when it isn\u2019t even on the top of the list, *if* at all. Your scenario feels flawed in that 1) you don\u2019t know if twin 1 or 2 has a healthy relationship with food based on their body mass or even lifestyle; if eating \u201cWhole Foods\u201d is only sustainable with money, why are eating disorders, including orthorexic behaviors, so prevalent among young women of all demographics? What makes eating this way healthy and intuitive, when it raises the risk of disordered eating at best and a full blown eating disorder at worse? Because at the end of the day, you don\u2019t know what each twin\u2019s relationship with food is. For all you know twin 2 can feel restricted and out of control around the foods twin 1 is comfortable with. This is still an exceptionally idealized version of recovery and ignores all biological drives that cause us to crave sweet foods and the mechanisms that cause us to feel out of control around foods we limit despite really wanting them (it\u2019s one thing to say you don\u2019t like sweets, it\u2019s another to avoid all \u201cjunk,\u201d I know that\u2019s not what you said but that\u2019s how I view the scenario). \n\nAlso, I\u2019ve got a lotta gripes with the obesity thing. \u201cObesity\u201d isn\u2019t caused by poverty forcing poor people to eat fast food/processed food\u2014if that were true, all poor people would be obese. It\u2019s *a lot* more complex than that. To start, poverty leads to excessive stress that can cause many chronic health conditions that not only affect fat people (heart disease, for example) but poor people in general, and tend to go untreated specifically for fat folk by a negligent medical industry. The weight stigma that permeates the medical industry prevents fat people from receiving life saving medical procedures and medication in favor of unsustainable weight loss that, again, leads to more weight gain long term; and then there\u2019s the fact that there are many health conditions that *causes* weight gain as a symptom (think PCOS, diabetes, hypothyroidism, Hashimoto\u2019s). Fat people die because of the medical industry\u2019s fatphobic beliefs and unwillingness to treat them accordingly. Studies show that medical professionals actually view fat people as less than and show them far less compassion in their treatment approach. Then there\u2019s the fact that dieting causes a lot of damage and contributes to the \u201cobesity epidemic\u201d and, yeah, in turn can lead to other health consequences down the road\u2026 but *only* if you don\u2019t let your body level out and continue to yo-yo diet and weight cycle like this. And we haven\u2019t even begun to discuss the case of \u201cobese\u201d individuals who are perfectly metabolically healthy, and it\u2019s more common than people will choose to believe.\n\nI definitely agree that certain things improve our overall health, such as regular exercise (whether that\u2019s just running errands, cleaning your home, walking or going to the gym) and eating a variety of foods that a lot of people don\u2019t have access to due to poverty. But I do *not* agree that obesity is a product of poverty and processed food consumption because it entirely shifts the damages of fat phobia away from its source. It\u2019s not a poverty problem, it\u2019s a wide spread, *systemic* problem.",

Etc.\u2014so I totally get what you are saying about set point and I agree with it :)\n\nWhat I meant was, when I was talking with my therapist about the set point theory and how I was so scared it would make me gain weight, we worked through those fears. Because she doesn\u2019t want me to continue restricting so extremely and living in fear controlled by an ed, when there is no way that I even know what would happen when I eat/in recovery if I do not actually even do it. She wasn\u2019t coming at it from a diet culture lens or fat phobia (she operates on the Health At Every Size/HAES model and has brought up dismantling and working on my fear of getting fat, so she is very much not fatphobic). What we talked about was, set point isn\u2019t an end all be all for weight. It\u2019s a range (like you said, of 5-20 lb) where your body naturally gravitates to and settles at when you\u2019re not actively restricting foods you want or crave or need, or forcing yourself to do excessive exercise you don\u2019t enjoy. At the end of the day, the law of thermodynamics still applies and works with set point theory, where an individual\u2019s lifestyle absolutely influences one\u2019s weight *to a degree* (I used the room influences very intentionally here, *not* defines\u2014I think maybe that\u2019s where my point my have been misunderstood, for I simply meant that set point is a *function* of a complex array of factors: genetics and biology, yes, but also taking into account the natural lifestyle and food intake of the individual. I\u2019ll give an example of what I meant: if two identical twins are born and separated at birth adopted to different families, and one grows up being raised really active, maybe running is a hobby they enjoy and they generally eat lots of whole foods and fruits and vegetables and whole grains, maybe they don\u2019t have much of a sweet tooth but they love eating a slice of cake or two when they feel like it, and stop when they no longer crave it, even if that means not finishing what\u2019s on their plate or leaving the piece of cake to finish at a later time when they\u2019re in the mood again. Let\u2019s say the second twin grows up in a different family, one that is naturally less sporty and doesn\u2019t ingrain the love of running/camping/skiing/etc in that person (my family is like this for example, I always would ask my parents if we could do something fun like go on a walk or hike when I was a kid and they\u2019d be like nah that\u2019s boring. I was so jealous of my friends who went out and did things with their families and who got to go on exciting ski trips and run 5Ks together. It seemed so fun to me and whenever I got a small taste of it, like when I was able to convince my parents to doing a partial little 5K walk with me when I was like 12, I had so much fun but they didn\u2019t find it as fun and didn\u2019t want to do it again). Maybe that family is stretched on a tighter income and has to rely on cheaper fast foods to feed their family, maybe fresh fruits are too expensive so the individual instead snacks on what is available in the household, cheaper snacks like chips for example. Maybe they simply have more of a sweet tooth and to them, unrestricted eating means eating a slice of cake everyday which the first individual would have not craved because they simply weren\u2019t much of a sweets person, so *their* unrestricted eating means eating that slice of cake on a less frequent basis. The key point I was trying to make here, is that *both* of these individuals are experiencing their own *versions* of unrestricted and intuitive eating, and engaging in whatever activity and lifestyles feels most comfortable to them (ie if hiking and running 5Ks is something you enjoy, yay! But if it\u2019s not, that\u2019s so totally completely okay too and more joyful movement is what\u2019s natural and healthy for that person). In this scenario, both of the twins are genetically identical in terms of *biological* set point, in which case their natural metabolic function and the amount of calories their body requires as energy to maintain homeostasis are roughly the same range. But because of the fact that set point is not *purely* biological but *also* FURTHER a function of lifestyle and diet factors, the first twin will likely weigh less than the second one; or perhaps more, seeing as muscle weighs more than fat...what I meant is that the first one might appear more conventionally \u201chealthy\u201d and socially acceptable in terms of body weight in today\u2019s diet culture obsessed society, whereas the second one might be in a comparatively larger body that society judges as less \u201chealthy\u201d and \u201coverweight\u201d by arbitrary bmi standards. Both of these individuals have the same biological set point but because they also have vastly different lifestyles (one very active naturally, not out of the intention to control their weight but simply out of pure joy and love for being active, one much more sedentary, not because they are \u201clazy\u201d or \u201cunhealthy\u201d but simply because, like my parents I discussed earlier, they don\u2019t enjoy vigorous activity as much, and prefer to live less active lifestyles that align with what they find joy in). On the diet end, both twins are eating what they feel best eating/listening to their body and cravings and/or within the social and financial constraints they exist within. The first twin is simply consuming what they prefer, and the family generally eats whole foods and fruits and vegetables often, because they are fortunate enough to afford it and they find that that is what they crave and feel the best eating. The second twin is also simply consuming what they prefer, but because they have a natural sweet tooth they eat more foods that are objectively higher in calories and fat and sugar (NOT saying that any of that is bad. Calories are necessary, fat is necessary, sugar is a carbohydrate and that is the main macronutrient your body and brain runs off of. What I mean here is that it is in a larger quantity due to that individual\u2019s dietary preferences than the first twin, comparatively speaking). (I also want to interject this scientific article here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5781054/#s1title which studies how \u201cpeople with lower income are more vulnerable to obesity, the framework of social determinants of health indicates that material conditions confine one\u2019s access to healthy food and healthcare, while also influencing health-related behaviours (ie, dietary behaviours and physical activity).\u201d \u2014I don\u2019t mean obesity in terms of diet culture judgment and fatphobia, but am simply restating a quote from a scientific article in order to add depth to my point about how lifestyle and social factors can absolutely influence one\u2019s weight, such as if one is constrained by their budget to rely only on processed and packaged and fast foods).",
