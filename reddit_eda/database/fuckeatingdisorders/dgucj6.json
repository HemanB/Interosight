My mind immediately went to the calories and sugar in it, but I acepted it anyway. Idk if I'm proud of myself for attempting to eat in front of others or grossed out that I'm actually eating deep fried sugar bread, but I hope I can keep it down.",

I'm really proud of you!\n\nAlso, I feel bad for it but, there was a part of me that felt happy to know I'm not the only that feels uncomfortable eating infront of others. I hope we can both work past that someday. \n\nGood luck and good job!",
