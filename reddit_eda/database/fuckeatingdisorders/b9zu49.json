  "title": "The \"Caf\u00e9\"",
  "selftext": "I have eaten in the Pine Cone Caf\u00e9 426 times. How? You might ask, is it possible for someone to enjoy a restaurant so much that they eat there 426 times? Well, you haven\u2019t tried the Pine Cone Caf\u00e9 and experienced its extraordinary ambiance. It is a place that keeps you coming back for more. The food is exquisite and the staff are there to meet your every need. It\u2019s so fancy that the meals are served covered dish and everyone\u2019s dish is slightly different to meet their particular palate. \n\nAt least, that\u2019s what I tell people. In truth, the Pine Cone Caf\u00e9 is the room where we have to eat. The food is mediocre, and it\u2019s super awkward in there because some grown-ass person is usually crying. It\u2019s kind of dismal. It\u2019s the room where people face their toughest demons, which might sound like an exaggeration, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s a difficult place. So, what do you do when there\u2019s something mildly traumatizing in your life that makes you question your existence? You put it on the internet. That\u2019s kind of the point of the whole internet thing. I wrote a Yelp review to add to those made by my predecessors for the Pine Cone Caf\u00e9 so that people show up at the eating disorder nuthouse thinking it\u2019s an actual restaurant. I made a menu as well that is also on Yelp. And, it\u2019s great, random people show up and try to eat at the Pine Cone Caf\u00e9. They ignore the sign out front and the lettering on the building that clearly say it\u2019s eating disorder rehab and march right in, trying to find the restaurant. The lady at the front desk has to turn them away and say that there isn\u2019t actually a restaurant open to the public. At that point, people get very confused. Two businessmen came in their suits and ties to dine with us, and were genuinely disappointed when they learned they couldn\u2019t eat there. But, not my problem. I just write the reviews. I was actually quite honest in my review from several weeks back, I just inflated a few of the perks of the Caf\u00e9: \n\n*Wow. What a unique dining experience. I have eaten here 6 times per day for the past 5 weeks; it's just that compulsory. The menu here is different every day, but repeats itself every 3 weeks to allow for a perfect balance of variety and familiarity. As for the food, it is the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me. Options vary from the world famous Asian-inspired soba noodle salad to Colorado's finest carrot ginger soup. For the less adventurous eater, the Pine Cone Caf\u00e9 offers grilled cheese with cheese made from the tears of past customers and panko-encrusted chicken tenders with a sweet and savory honey mustard sauce. However, you can only order each of these delicacies once every 3 weeks. But, not to worry, if you don't enjoy the explosive flavors, the staff will offer you a liquid replacement for your food that comes in strawberry, chocolate, or vanilla. The magic liquid is stored in a special wine cellar in mahogany boxes. They will provide you with encouragement until you complete it. In fact, they are so insistent that you get adequate nutrition that you have to fill out an official form should you not complete the liquid food.* \n\n*While the food is incredible, what really sets this place apart is its distinct culture. The intimate caf\u00e9 usually seats just 4 tables of 6. The waitstaff sit with you whilst you dine and encourage games to be played at the table. If you choose to immerse yourself in this sensory experience, be aware that it is considered rude here at the Pine Cone Caf\u00e9 to put your napkin in your lap. Should you make the grave mistake of putting your napkin in your lap, or even worse, putting your hands below the table, you shall receive a stern glare from a staff member and, in the most extreme cases, chastising from fellow diners.* \n\n*Don't worry, your dining experience doesn't end with the meal. The party continues into the night! Following dinner, you are invited to the resort's second floor which boasts private state rooms and a spa. The spa specializes in the ancient art of Japanese urinary analysis. Spa attendants analyze a silver cup of your urine each day to ensure adequate hydration. Should your urine not pass the test, you will be given a special ruby-encrusted goblet full of water at the next meal.* \n\n*Overall, I give this place an 11/10 which is why I have no intention of leaving anytime soon and even brought many of my favorite things from home to keep in my private state room.*\n\nSo, now, for the rest of my life, whenever I see a pine cone, I\u2019m going to have the weirdest flashbacks. I\u2019ll be 35 years old and making one of those pine cone bird feeders with my kid, and all I\u2019ll be able to think about is someone dropping a single blueberry at snack and getting it replaced. You drop one little blueberry and have to get a new one because we don\u2019t restrict at the Pine Cone Caf\u00e9. Or, I\u2019ll be walking down the street and step on a pine cone and the crunch will bring me right back to the millions of bags of pita chips I had to eat in the caf\u00e9. ",
