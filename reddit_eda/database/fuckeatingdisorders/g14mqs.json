  "title": "In quasi/self recovery, and as much as I hate the slight weight gain, it\u2019s been so fucking peaceful in my head. I\u2019ve never felt at peace like this in a long time and that alone makes me never want to get super UW anymore.",
  "selftext": "Tw: numbers\n\n\nIn quasi/self recovery for a month. So still weighing myself here and there (not obsessively tho, maybe once every two days), but I\u2019m hardly weighing or tracking my food. If you need more info on that feel free to look at my post history. Gained 6 lbs (95-101 at 5\u20194\u201d) and for once, I haven\u2019t been starving in the morning. I haven\u2019t been obsessively looking at recipes in the last 3-4 days. I\u2019ve been feeling FULL after having two slices of pizza with my husband rather than forcing all of me to not grab more slices (I usually would end up eating way more and restricting though \ud83d\ude43). I\u2019m haven\u2019t been thinking of my next meal every minute and wishing it would be 12pm already so I could eat. Yeah I gained weight, still a little UW, but honestly at this point I don\u2019t even care because experiencing extreme hunger and not acting upon it felt like torture. I can\u2019t even describe it. It went on for years. I averaged 10k steps a day, went to the gym 3-4x a week, and still ate less than 1100 calories at a 16 BMI. \n\nI know it\u2019s only been 3-4 days of peace and quiet, but just knowing the slight feeling of fullness and not being food obsessed 24/7, not being hypersensitive to the scent of any fucking food, being able to listen to my husband without adding up calories in my head, etc has been such an eye opener. Its more than just \u201call I could think about was food.\u201d Now I can understand why healthy people don\u2019t need to eat crazy amounts of food, because they aren\u2019t fucking starved and their body isn\u2019t yelling at them to eat! I always wondered how people only had one plate of food at parties, bbqs, etc. where I was eating like 3 hamburgers and could still go for more, but didn\u2019t wanna look weird. I\u2019ll probably still experience extreme hunger at some point again, but for now just knowing the feeling of peace and being able to be present in the moment and doing more things with my time in quarantine rather than calculating my fucking calories has been such a wake up call.",

Having that peace and being present is amazing and using this time to your advantage is the best thing you can do for yourself!
