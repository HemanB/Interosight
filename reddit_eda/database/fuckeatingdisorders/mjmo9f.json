  "title": "Reasons to recover: read if you\u2019re struggling",
  "selftext": "Writing this as I\u2019m having a hard time in recovery right now. Figured it would be a good reminder for anyone else struggling, and future me. I\u2019ve been trying to go \u201call in\u201d for around 2 weeks now, no food restrictions and minimal weighing myself. There are already so many positives. A couple months ago I would have never dreamed this possible. So, reasons to recover:\n\n1. ENERGY!! Turns out I\u2019m not inherently tired? That tends to happen when you starve yourself? I also sleep through the night. Going up and down stairs doesnt make me want to lie down for a bit. I can move without needing a break, and it\u2019s crazy.\n\n2. Not being dizzy. Guess what? When I get out of bed and shower, I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m going to faint and hit my head on the tiles! It\u2019s a great feeling. Like I have life.\n\n3. Not missing out on social events. I mostly stopped drinking due to being scared of alcohol calories. That sucks! And when I would drink, I wouldn\u2019t eat the whole day and wake up the day after feeling like DEATH. ACTUAL DEATH. Now I can eat, drink, and not ruin the whole weekend from the worse hangover ever.\n\n4. Food! Food tastes really good sometimes! I used to be obsessed with watching food videos and would literally scroll Uber eats imagining what I would order one day. I don\u2019t have that desire as much anymore.\n\n5. My body needs this. I want to make it clear that you do NOT need to be underweight to recover. There are so many more reasons to recover other than being \u201ctoo sick\u201d I.e. all of the above. But one extra thing that\u2019s pushing me on is feeling feminine again. I lost any trace of boobs or butt, my legs look horrible, and I hate the way you can see all my veins. It\u2019s actually gross. Recovery for me will give me some of myself back.\n\nAdditions from the comments:\n\n6. Acts of Love and Service - When I'm feeding my body well, I can love and serve the people I love. I can help my friends do housework and help with grocery shopping, babysitting and doing administrative tasks for friends who are bad at forms or other admin.\n\n7. Work/Study: Instead of dragging myself through the day, obsessing about food and not really being able to concentrate, I can do my work and study well. I'm more responsive to requests from colleagues, I have more capacity to take on more work or study as needed.\n\n8. Therapy: I'm much better able to deal with deeper psychological issues rather than just focusing on ED symptoms, I can process the emotions that lead to ED symptoms leading to longer term relief and management.\n\n9. passion/interests in things you used to like. I used to read a lot and I was obsessed with fictional characters but when I had an ED all I cared about was food. During recovery I\u2019ve noticed my giddy passion for the things I used to love coming back now that my body is nourished, it\u2019s crazy\n\n10. Hair not falling out all the time, Sex (solo or with a partner) is much better when you fuel yourself",
