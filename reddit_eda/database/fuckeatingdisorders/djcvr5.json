  "selftext": "So today I bought my favorite dip in the whole world. Usually when I buy this dip, I gorge myself on it and eat the whole container (or close), then not let myself have it again for months at a time because it\u2019s a \u201cbinge trigger\u201d.\n\nSo anyway, I bring it home, eat maybe 2 servings. I wasn\u2019t keeping track and the serving sizes are small but definitely a more \u201csnack size appropriate\u201d portion, and I feel fine. \n\nI have literally never bought this dip and not binged on it. Ever. I also don\u2019t have the urge to go back to it and binge on it. I had what I was planning for dinner and feel fine with the prospect of having more dip tomorrow or over the weekend. \n\nThis feels like a glitch in the matrix?",

It is like some sort of miracle thing when it starts happening. I don't know about you, but also helps to make sure to acknowledge that I can have whatever previous binge food whenever (because I am no longer restricting) and however much. Working on taking the mental restrictions/judgements away from food really helps with this process as well. I am so happy for you that you got to experience this :)",
