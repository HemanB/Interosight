Unfortunately, they don't know what they're talking about and often say shit.\nSecond : I'm a master of oatmeal, this is my only safe food. You can make a lot of taste for 150 cal, other than prepackaged ones. 1 tbsp of dry oats is 20 cal. \nSo I often take 4 of them and then add any flavour I like.\nCrave tiramisu ? Add instant coffee and some cocoa powder with sweetener.\nNo ? Pistachio or Vanilla or any flavour with sweetener.\nMore creamy ?Low fat Coconut milk with shredded coconut and obviously, sweetener.",
