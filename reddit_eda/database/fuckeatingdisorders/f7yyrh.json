  "selftext": "i posted this on my recovery instagram account a while ago but i\u2019d like to post it here because it\u2019s something we all forget way too much - that even though our disorders like to try and convince us otherwise, this shit isn\u2019t fun or glamorous.\n\nsince starting to eat more, my ed has gone ON and ON about how i was so much prettier when i was restricting. it feels so real to me sometimes that i forget and it takes so much to consistently talk back to that voice. it says being at a lower weight = the peak of beauty and that\u2019s what i should strive for no matter what it costs - my relationships, time, energy, sanity. but i\u2019ve been there. i\u2019ve been there at a dangerously low weight and it\u2019s not pretty, figuratively or literally. slowly killing yourself every day isn\u2019t beautiful (despite what pro-ana tumblr says) - it\u2019s fucking depressing.\n\nit\u2019s the going to sleep terrified that you\u2019re not going to wake up but you can\u2019t bring yourself to stop. it\u2019s the losing touch with all your friends because you\u2019ve been possessed by this demon called anorexia. it\u2019s the crying uncontrollably over having to eat a slightly different make of bread than usual, or over not being able to take a shit because there\u2019s nothing to shit out. it\u2019s the constant feeling of cold that doesn\u2019t leave no matter how many layers of clothes you wear or boiling hot showers you take. it\u2019s the pressure sores. it\u2019s the heart palpitations. it\u2019s the mood swings. it\u2019s the subsequent death that happens to way too many people because of these disorders.\n\nbut if that hasn\u2019t convinced you or you think it\u2019s worth it because \u201cuwu i just want to be pretty/handsome\u201d think again. you\u2019re going to look like shit - when you\u2019re starving, your hair and nails will get brittle and fall out. your eyes will get dull and you\u2019ll get dark circles. your skin will get dry and go grey and not in a cool gothic way, in a sad and gross way. say goodbye to your boobs and bum if you\u2019re female, too! if you purge regularly, your teeth will decay. you\u2019ll have no life in you, and life is what makes us truly beautiful, not that number on the scale that ultimately means nothing.\n\nthank you for reading :) love u guys",
