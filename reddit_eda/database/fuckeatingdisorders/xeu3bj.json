  "selftext": "I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m so angry. This eating disorder is my biggest regret, and it wasn\u2019t fucking my fault. It never is, for anyone, but heavens I\u2019m so angry at my mother for it, who even now is preventing me from eating by locking food away and tried to feed me TAPEWORM PILLS!!! \n\nand I had to go through this fucking recovery all alone when i was diagnosed and then praised for it at a young teen age and now im recovered for a year and a half and the overshoot isnt going down and Im forced to run a mile a week for school and my friend\u2019s parents who all knew me from my skinny childhood up to before teenage-hood sees me, now overweight, tells me to \u2018lose weight\u2019 and \u2018get some exercise\u2019 for my own good. and im finding sports so much more difficult than when I was pre-ED and captain\u2026 it goes on and on. \n\nbodily Im eating as much as I can even if I have to hide it, i dont feel stressed about eating and im not losing hair anymore, but this fucking society. Cant wait to find out how fatphobic college admissions are. \n\nSo, despite all the improvement, i cannot wait for this overshoot to go down. I cannot help but be a product of my environment, please, I\u2019d love to hear any overshoot tapering stories. I need this fantasy because rn I cannot face reality and continue my recovery journey. Id rather be deluded forever. Anyone?",

I wish I had some better advice other than ride it out as best as you can and get away from that bunch of disordered people as fast as possible. I'm probably twice your age but find you so inspiring. The fact that you're forced to live with a mom who treats you like that and still you've recovered is amazing. Who the fuck cares if these people think your body is too big? It's your fucking body not theirs.",

      "body": "You are right, none of this is your fault. I found gaining weight in recovery to be very traumatic too. The one-minute version of my story is that I gained in recovery, then stabilized, then lost without really trying too (I\u2019m currently in a pickle again because I relapsed, restricted too much, and started binging. So don\u2019t do that lol).\n\nI know it\u2019s hard to both manage the feelings of recovery and the judgements of those around you. Please try to realize that they just don\u2019t get it. They don\u2019t know your innermost struggles. They haven\u2019t been through what you\u2019re going through.\n\nChin up. You are young and still growing. Eat. If you are still struggling in college, most colleges offer free counseling and health services that you can take advantage of. As for right now, your mother doesn\u2019t seem to be supportive. Are there any resources at your current school that you access? Recovery can be lonely, so maybe even a guidance counselor could lend you an ear and provide a little support that your family and friends can\u2019t offer.\n\nGood luck <3",

And I absolutely understand and admire your desire to care for you mom. I really think she would benefit from some mental health counseling. As a mental health professional, I would never dare diagnose someone from such little information, but your mom does sound  like someone suffering from borderline personality disorder (emotional dysfunction/disregulation, self harm, manipulation). I would strongly encourage your mom to get some therapy. I understand your desire to help you mom, but that is a lot of responsibility to fall on one person, especially someone your age.",

I still think i could pull through with a part time job, already done most of the research on how to survive with limited cash flow and still manage school. \n\nmost teens are only too high on their superiority i know, but ive been cooking and putting myself to bed and taking myself to pretty much wherever ive needed to go since i was 8?  for most of my life ive had it sorted and as her only pillar isnt it only right that i should put family first to take care of her? since its within my capability and all. I realise this is a bit at odds with college and all that but i have my own ways justifying it and mom always put education first anyways\n\nthere might be something im missing, but i genuinely believe context is everything. sure our relationship isnt normal and her presence has never been good for me, but she\u2019s still given me all the tools i have now to succeed and im infinitely grateful for that.\n\nEdit: realised i didnt answer your question.
