  "selftext": "I have been in a bad place in my head for years, I should've started a months long inpatient but it got cancelled due to corona. Due to my mental health situation I haven't been outside on my own for 1.5 years. I get the comradeship of this  subreddit and you guys have helped me and supported me while I was here. But now even seeing the posts and the name of the subreddit throws me in a negative spiral that I cant get out of. So this is my last message here. I will be leaving the sub reddit and try to surround myself with positivity instead.\n\nThis is not meant to hurt any of your feelings, I just think this is the best for me right now.\n\nThanks for everything, dear friends",
