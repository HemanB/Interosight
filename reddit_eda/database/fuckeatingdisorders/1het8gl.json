It is crazy to me how someone can look at Ariana and not see someone struggling?! Everyone is like \u201cshe was drinking a lot in her old body\u201d and even Ariana said that body wasn\u2019t healthy for her either WHICH IS FINE but it doesn\u2019t mean this body is healthy and I\u2019m SO TIRED of everyone defending her left and right when it is SO CLEAR she is struggling. And Cynthia is just a byproduct of all of this and proof that EDs are competitive. I just needed to get that out. ",

I'm sure that it is distressing for her to be experiencing another flurry of this. It might even be triggering for her considering everything she went through while she was working with Dan Schneider.",
