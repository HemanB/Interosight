  "selftext": "Does anyone else feel this way? Ever since I have started recovery, I enjoy seeing myself gain weight. I FEEL so much better, but contrary to the ED thoughts, I LOOK so much better. The only thing I kind of miss is my slimmer face, because especially at the beginning of my recovery, I was SO BLOATED EVERYWHERE. My face got really puffy and I felt insecure. But I can already see the puffiness going down. I can see my jaw again! Yay! But really though, looking back, I only wanted to be skinny because I felt that being so thin would get people to notice me, and also, it was something for me to control. But having my ED made me more isolated than I had ever been in my entire life. The old pictures of my emaciated body only motivate me to get better and they remind me of what a terrible place I was in physically and mentally. So if you are debating recovery, it was one of the hardest but BEST DECISIONS OF MY WHOLE LIFE. \u2665\ufe0f",

I would eat up to probably 6,000 cals per day to be honest (due to extreme hunger). While this sounds scary, this is what I needed to do, and I would recommend this to anyone trying to recover. I had to set go of all rules and challenge myself everyday. I seeing changes though. My extreme hunger is gone. I am not thinking about food constantly. I can go hours without feeling hungry or thinking about food (in a healthy way). I never EVER thought that would happen because in my ED, I was so obsessed with food and constantly thought about it. It was really painful at the begining. Bloating, extreme water retention/ edema, face puffiness, body aches, constant sweating... But these side effects are tempororary. They lasted maybe 3 weeks to a little over a month. But it went quick. My bloating is going down and my confidence is going up. Look at it this way: you body is reflecting all of the damage you have done to it by starving and restricting yourself. Since you are a guy, there isn't really a SUPER clear indication of when your body is ready to recover, because getting your period back is a good indicator for women. But I would say, once you start viewing exercise as a way to feel good and get stronger, and not as a way to burn excess calories or to have abs, then you are ready.

      "body": "My extreme hunger lasted probably 3 weeks to a little over a month. I started recovery in the beginning of November this year and I only just stopped being so ravenously hungry in the past two weeks. But the thing about going \"all in\" is that if you allow yourself all of the food that you want and stop punishing yourself with exercise, you will eventually not be obsessed with food. Food is really beginning to loose its novelty for me. Like a cookie really isn't all that anymore. I can eat a cookie and feel satisfied, whereas with my extreme hunger I ate an entire sheet of cookies. My also, my metabolism SPED UP. yeah. I would be so hot all the time, I would wake up drenched in sweat. I believe this was due to my metabolism kickstarting and just burning all of the food that it was finally getting. So this sounds scary, but the end result is worth it. another thing for me that really helped was taking an SSRI medication. I suffer with bad anxiety and OCD which really catapulted my ED. This medicine has changed my life, and I firmly believe that without taking it I would have never chosen recovery. Now for the exercise, I just stopped cold turkey. I still struggle with urges to want to exercise and burn off calories just out of habit. But realize that your brain has formed neural pathways and networks that literally wire your brain to have these eating disorder thoughts. You need to combat them (which is the hardest part). The ED brain is so irrational. Think about it: will 100 extra calories burned really make you loose weight? Probably not. You need to break the cycle. Ask yourself: am I happy living this way? I always ask myself questions to remind myself of the dark place I was in. So with that being said, I wish you the absolute best in recovery, and if you want to talk I'm here\u2764\ufe0f stay strong and you've got this. I believe in you. \ud83d\ude0a",

          "body": "So what happened with me was that I stopped all exercise completely and just started eating whatever I wanted. I would eat up to probably 6,000 cals per day to be honest (due to extreme hunger). While this sounds scary, this is what I needed to do, and I would recommend this to anyone trying to recover. I had to set go of all rules and challenge myself everyday. I seeing changes though. My extreme hunger is gone. I am not thinking about food constantly. I can go hours without feeling hungry or thinking about food (in a healthy way). I never EVER thought that would happen because in my ED, I was so obsessed with food and constantly thought about it. It was really painful at the begining. Bloating, extreme water retention/ edema, face puffiness, body aches, constant sweating... But these side effects are tempororary. They lasted maybe 3 weeks to a little over a month. But it went quick. My bloating is going down and my confidence is going up. Look at it this way: you body is reflecting all of the damage you have done to it by starving and restricting yourself. Since you are a guy, there isn't really a SUPER clear indication of when your body is ready to recover, because getting your period back is a good indicator for women. But I would say, once you start viewing exercise as a way to feel good and get stronger, and not as a way to burn excess calories or to have abs, then you are ready. I wish you all the luck in recovery. You got this\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",
