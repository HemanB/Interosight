  "selftext": "Hi you guys. I found this sub a while ago and quickly joined. I\u2019m sorry if this is weird or out of the norm but I am 23 years old. My mom is in her forty\u2019s. I created a new act because I would hate for anyone to link me to it and see this post. My moms bulimia has always been an unspoken word of trust. But I\u2019m just going to dive right in. \n\nI remember hearing my mom throwing up at night after dinner. And every night before bed I would hear the popping of laxatives.. almost 20 a night and as I grew older that number grew too. I never said anything. Even when she asked me to send her some when she wasn\u2019t able to get them, as I got older, I would. And never said anything still. She is the most gorgeous person to me. Not only on the inside but on the outside as well. \n\nEventually I got older and realized what was happening. I was however struggling with self harm and understood, in a way, her pain. So I didn\u2019t say anything. Just like she didn\u2019t for a while. \n\nI remember the first time she went to the hospital I was 16. I was high and tired and she texted me but I went to bed. When I woke up I found her in a puddle of vomit.. that is my biggest regret. I took her to the ER. \n\nHer kidneys are failing. \n\nThis became a pattern for a few years. And then more frequent. But I\u2019m always there and I always try. And it is so hard and exhausting. She has lost her teeth.. she is so fragile but still so beautiful. The wear and tear on her body after over 30 years of abuse is devastating. Her joints are crippled with gout because of the build up of uric acid in her body..\n\nI don\u2019t want to lose my mom.. but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to soon. \n\nI don\u2019t want to lose my mom. I want her to be strong and happy and full.. \n\nI want her to be strong enough to stop taking laxatives and puking. I don\u2019t want to spend the remainder of our time in hospital room after hospital room.\n\nI am losing my mom to an eating disorder. \n\nPlease be strong fellow redditors and get help. Don\u2019t do it for your family. Don\u2019t do it for anyone but yourself. It is such a long painful path.",

When your parent suffers from an eating disorder though, it becomes your reality. I'm in recovery and only 22, but I've considered since I was 16, not having children so I wouldn't pass my insecurities, disordered eating, anxieties, or perfectionism on to them, it just feels irresponsible to have a child and put them at risk of becoming like me.

I have heard stories of people who have recovered after 20-30+ years of suffering, it is possible, but it isn't as common as succumbing to your illness.
