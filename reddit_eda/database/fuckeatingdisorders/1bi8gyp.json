I hadn\u2019t spoken to her in a few years.\n\nI\u2019m in recovery, but more and more of the people I knew during the time in my life when I was ill are dying. I\u2019m in my mid-20s, and so were they. I shouldn\u2019t have dead friends.\n\nI feel simultaneously lucky to have escaped this and sad that so many people haven\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to keep watching this happen.",
