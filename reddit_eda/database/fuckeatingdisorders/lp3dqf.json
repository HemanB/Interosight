  "selftext": "i barely visit this sub anymore because i'm in recovery & have been for about seven months so i really don't ever feel the need to come back but i was thinking the other day that i don't ever have the desire to sit home & eat all day anymore. when i was deep in my ed all i ever wanted to do was lay in bed & eat & eat until i was fully satisfied but now i don't have to do that to feel full. it's actually relieving to think about how eating all day long would make me feel physically sick now & is not something i want to do at all because i don't need to anymore!! i don't have extreme hunger or mental hunger & only think about food when i need to eat. i want to let anyone that is in recovery know that u are not developing BED u are experiencing extreme hunger from starvation. it DOES go away & feeling full IS possible u just have to push through. sending love to all of u <3",
