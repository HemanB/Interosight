Just by remembering to eat when my kids do (or while I'm cooking for them) and by trying to pick some of the more protein-heavy thing I have available.\n\nIt's not much but it's a big deal for me.\n\nEdit, Nov 22:\nWOW I never expected this much support for something I'm so ashamed of. Y'all are amazing and your comments have made me cry more than once now \ud83d\ude05\nThank you all so, SO much.\nFor real \ud83d\udda4",
