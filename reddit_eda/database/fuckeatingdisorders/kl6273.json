Once again I'm allowing myself to be conquered and subdued. It's a self repeating cycle I can't manage to get myself out of. I feel utterly powerless even though I know I'm not.",

      "body": "You\u2019re noticing and recognizing the mentality - that\u2019s a big deal. The sooner you learn to identify that voice as your ED, the easier it will become overtime to deconstruct those ideas. Even if you can\u2019t resist them right now, you can change the way you feel about them. Get angry! Be sad! Start countering those thoughts with good information that disarms them: \n\nRestricting after a meal doesn\u2019t \u201cbalance out\u201d the calories - we don\u2019t work like that metabolically. Restricting always puts your body under stress, no matter how much you\u2019ve eaten before.\n\nYou can\u2019t \u201close\u201d water weight - the bloating will subside once you\u2019re eating and drinking enough to recalibrate the minerals in your body.\n\nEating is not \u201cearned\u201d it is a natural biological process and one of our most basic physical needs. \n\nBody size or weight gain are not limiting diagnostic factors for eating disorders. Fat ppl have disordered eating. Thin people have disordered eating. It\u2019s about the behavior, and al of it is harming you.\n\nEven if the behavior doesn\u2019t change right away, if you can intentionally repeat these truths and counter your ED thoughts with them, you will start giving TRUTH the power, instead of your ED\u2019s lies.\n\nIt\u2019s ok to be struggling - never stop fighting for your health. You deserve to recover, and you do not have to live like this!",
