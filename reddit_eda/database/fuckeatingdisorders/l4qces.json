  "selftext": "Note: this is aimed at people in recovery from restrictive EDs, that's really the only one I have experience with. \n\nI see so many posts here about \"I'm never satisfied on maintenance calories, so why bother?\" \"I just want to EAT AND EAT AND EAT, when will it end???\" \"Normal meals just *aren't enough*\" \n\nIt gets better. Yes, at first all you want are large meals. You're hungry *all the time*. \n\nSorry, but what did you fucking expect? You just spent X amount of time starving yourself. You're physically deprived of nutrients and calories. Your body wants them back. If you \"estimate\" that you're eating maintenance, odds are, you're overestimating. If you *know* you're eating maintenance, well, you still might be hungry for more, and you have 2 options. \n\n1) Wait it out. Your body will normalize if you just *fucking eat consistently*. This means eating maintenance *every day*, regardless of how you ate the day before. Note: this will mean anything from a few weeks to a few months of being hungry despite eating maintenance. \n\n2) Eat above maintenance. Seriously, an extra bowl of cereal for a couple days will not be the end of the world. Normal people do this all the time. Don't torture yourself. Fucking eat. You're not special just because you can ignore basic bodily signals. \n\nI've been eating *actual* maintenance of 2500+ for months. I have not \"blown up.\" I just don't feel like shit all the time, have actual energy, and can eat regular- sized portions and feel satisfied. Sometimes I eat an entire pint of ice cream because it's just ~the vibe~, but there is no part of me that feels like it's a *need*, and honestly, most of the time I want *nothing* to do with *that much ice cream*. \n\nIt gets better, but you have to stick it out and *fucking eat*.",

Backwards way of saying your body adapts and used based on what you're letting the poor thing have. I find body temperature is a good gauge for me, if I'm eating too much ill be super warm but if I'm not eating enough then I'm always cold. Before ED I was eating around 1600-2000cals, never starving or even really thinking about food, comfortably warm (but not hot) and stuck around the same weight for years (5'6 58-64kg). Try eating more for a while, like weeks, it'll suck, you'll put on weight at first as your body grabs every scrap it can get its hands on but should settle in a couple of weeks. Keep it up for a few weeks and then you can adjust up/down depending how you feel. I really need to take my own advice.. I'm too old for this shit \ud83e\udd74",
