  "selftext": "This is obviously due to lack of knowledge about ED\u2019s - granted, I didn\u2019t have the slightest clue before developing AN but the amount of mental strain this illness causes every single day I\u2019m surprised more people aren\u2019t aware of the effects of EDs considering it\u2019s the biggest mental health killer \n\nI suppose my annoyance is heightened because I still struggle with tiredness even 7 months in, it often feels like I\u2019m not allowed to be because I\u2019m physically better \n\nNotably brain fog is the biggest downside to my recovery, I cannot retain information like I use to which stresses me out I\u2019ve been at such a disadvantage because of it which is sadly a reason for me to relapse when I get ideas to \n\nI realise this can also be a good thing as it brings normality but I wish people were more mindful of it",

I was 3 months into recovery and my mom thought it would be a great thing to make a giant feast of all my trigger foods that I used to love thinking it would would be a great celebration of my recovery. I binged, purged and fell right back into extreme restriction. Sweet idea, but not a good one.",

When someone perceives you as recovered, or doesn\u2019t \u201cget it\u201d, just let it go knowing that you wouldn\u2019t want anyone else to go through the pain and suffering you have, just for the sake of you being understood. \n\nI\u2019ve been \u201crecovered\u201d for a few years now but still have flashbacks almost daily that make me so so sad. (Haha I\u2019m still in this sub aren\u2019t I?) People think I\u2019m 100% now, and that\u2019s fine for them. The truth is recovery is an ongoing daily thing, long after the therapy and the behaviors stop.",

Here\u2019s a list of brain foods, so you don\u2019t have to read a whole article about nutrition: sweet potato, leafy greens, salmon, avocado, walnuts, blueberries, chocolate, coffee. When I eat the brain foods (in addition to lots of other foods!), I at least trick myself into thinking I\u2019m doing something proactive about the fog. I started eating meat (mostly salmon) just for my mind, and I\u2019m a little grateful for the brain fog.. if only because realizing I could lose my MIND and my whole identity to this shit was intolerable to me. Trying to make my brain sharp again motivates much of my recovery.",
