  "selftext": "I need to tell myself this! I need to stop counting calories, because if I eat everything I want to do today, tomorrow and even the day after, it will EASILY be >!6000-7000+!< calories every day, and that's OKAY! We've made so many delicious cakes and cookies and chocolates! We've bought in so many packs of different chocolates and candies and treats! I want hot chocolate, I want PB oatmeal, I want pizza, I want the Christmas dinners and desserts! I want fruits and veggies in addition; I want it all!\n\nFor me to TRULY enjoy myself, I can't count calories today; not sure how to avoid it though...\n\nHeck, even if I count everything and eat four times what I usually do, screw it! It's the holiday season; and I won't try to compensate for new years either!\n\nI wish you all luck with the holidays; and most importantly, enjoy yourselves with good company and food and whatever else you desire! What's the point of life if it can't be fully enjoyed!",
