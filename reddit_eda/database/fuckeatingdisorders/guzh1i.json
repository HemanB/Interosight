I vividly remember just looking down at my stomach and wanting to be like them so bad. It\u2019s mental I was literally 8 years old having these thoughts. I was looking through old photos when I still did athletics and my body was tiny like I was so so so slim and it amazes me how I thought I was fat and it\u2019s evident I just wasn\u2019t. \nIdk it\u2019s made me realise that I\u2019ll never see how I look in a non distorted way and that sucks because in my mind I\u2019ll never be good enough",

I followed the logical (to me) train of thought that if a person were to do this on purpose, they could eat whatever they wanted, then throw up, and then they wouldn\u2019t be hungry after, and then they wouldn\u2019t get fat.\n\nLittle did I know I hadn\u2019t just made that up in my head, and I was actually describing bulimia, which I would pick up at age 16 and continue to struggle with ad infinitum (I\u2019m 21 now bulimia still going strong).\n\nI think what helped me make that connection in my brain was my mom\u2019s offhand comment about some random woman we passed in the streets, she said something like \u201cshe looks like she throws up\u201d, and for some reason it stuck with me. My mom never body shamed me directly but she would say snippy little comments about other people\u2019s bodies, so I guess that made me start noticing my own body. I was always a chubby kid and I learned chubby=bad, therefore me=bad.",
