I know what kinds of feelings I can expect from engaging with my relationship with food in different ways, unhealthy or healthy. Food is comfort, food is regulation of emotions, food is asthetics, food is procrastination.  \nIt's basically everything but fuel for my body or a need that needs to be fullfilled.",
