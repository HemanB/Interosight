This is something you enjoy, you wanted and you decided to eat because every day you will get stronger than your ED brain. I promise. I felt like that at the beginning of my recovery and right now I honestly barely care. Only some days when I get really sad about shit that doesn\u2019t matter- because I realize \u201cthis doesn\u2019t matter!! it\u2019s just FOOD!\u201d I hope you\u2019re proud of what you did today and you push yourself to keep trying. You are brave and loved \u2764\ufe0f",

But I didn't do anything at all. The fullness passed and I didn't act out using an ED behavior. And then I was so damned proud that I ate a dessert and nothing happened. That was pretty special for me. \n\nMaybe sit with the feelings and let time pass. Maybe you'll see you deserve a gold star and not a punishment.",

I hope you had a nice dinner and remember your body needs food at regular intervals to maintain not only your energy and metabolism, but your mental health too. Now I want a donut hehe but I will be making apple crisp today and first I will enjoy that! Cheers to feeding ourselves delicious foods that we deserve to enjoy\ud83d\udc97",
