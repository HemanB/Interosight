  "title": "the portrayal of extreme hunger online is kind of ass",
  "selftext": "ive been noticing a lot of videos, especially on tik tok of \"what i eat in a day! extreme hunger!!\" and its really just what most people would consider a normal day of eating, maybe with a few extra snacks. not to mention theres usually a full body shot or bodycheck somewhere in the video. there's no such thing as 'eating too much' while in recovery/weight restoration but these videos make it really easy to feel like that. its almost like there's still that competitive aspect of 'im in recovery and im still eating less than you!!' \n\nextreme hunger definitely looks different for everyone, but if you KNOW that even with extreme hunger, you're eating just about half (or less) than what other people might be eating, is it really necessary to post? \n\nwhen i first started experiencing eh i thought there was something weong with me because i was eating 2-4x the people in these videos. it felt so isolating and the process of learning to honor my hunger would have been easier had i seen more representation of people who ate like me",

And, it is definitely not \u201ccouple more tiny snacks hahaha\u201d. But also, I cannot so harshly judge those people. Everyone has different metabolism. That is why, it is totally not sense making to compare ourselves with others. For ex. I\u2019ve been hiding my anorexia quite easily due to my quite fast metabolism. It looked like I ate \u201cnormal\u201d from outside to people who don\u2019t know me but, I ate about half of what my body really needs. Some people also have quite slow metabolism. Their \u201cbinge\u201d can look normal-ish but, it can be waaaay more then their so-called caloric needs. If you have extreme hunger, you have extreme hunger. Do not compare. For me it was two huge white chocolate bars (even though I don\u2019t like white chocolate) a vegan hot dog (I actually hate hot dogs...) cheese croissant and a huge american style cookie and a quarter extra sweet apple-pie as a lunch. (Imagine the dinner and breakfast) \nExtreme hunger has many roots...I think...\nRelated to physical-hunger, psychological-hunger due to starvation and emotional hunger due to trying to recover. \n\nIt is an \u201cextreme\u201d issue to handle...emotionally too!\n\nSo, do not compare it. There\u2019ll be always some bullsh\ud83e\udd8bt online that will make you feel uneasy. But! That is your body and your recovery!",
