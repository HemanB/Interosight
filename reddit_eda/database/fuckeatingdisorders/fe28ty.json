Once and far in between I still get these days, but usually when I haven\u2019t had time to eat enough or something (eating less without intentionally restricting)\n\nYou have to eat the food you are craving and not fill up on safe food or low cal substitutes. And eat as much as your body is asking you for. One day you will feel satiation again. I know it is a nerve-wrecking phase of recovery but you gotta keep pushing through!\n\nAll the best <3",

Some of it was *finally* being able to eat whatever I wanted and there was quite the list of foods that I wanted to try. \n\nBut, more importantly I found that once I started antidepressants to support the breathtaking amount of trauma work I'm doing, my constant need for food dropped right off. \n\nA lot of my bingeing was simply a rudimentary form of self soothing. My ed is rooted in trauma and the body feels safe when you're eating. If you're fighting tooth and nail in battle you're hardly going to stop and eat a muffin. Right?",

As we tend to be very controlling of our portions, it affects us psychologically even though it shouldn't! \n\nHave a good day, take care xx",
