  "selftext": "OH MY GOD. \n\nI\u2019ve been mostly recovered from my disordered eating behaviors for a few years. Don\u2019t get me wrong I still freak out mildly if I think I\u2019ve gained weight, I still try to stick to keto, but I\u2019m not counting everything and weighing myself and assessing my body constantly. There\u2019s room for improvement but it\u2019s okay.\n\nBut I\u2019m weird with money. I\u2019ve accumulated a lot of it and can\u2019t spend it. I hoard pennies cause I\u2019m scared one day I\u2019ll \u201cneed them\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m in a position where I desperately want to leave my job but I grasp onto dollars like no other. I can\u2019t see that number go down - exactly true same way I couldn\u2019t stand to see the scale go up. \n\nJust wanted to say holy shit this has plagued me my whole life and I\u2019ve never known it was related. \n\nAnyone else see the same kinds of behaviors?",
