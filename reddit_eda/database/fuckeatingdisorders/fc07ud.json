  "selftext": "I track every day, and then on days it\u2019s impossible to track because I\u2019m eating at a friend\u2019s house or I\u2019m at a party, I end up overeating which leads to a binge. And then I spend days eating in a small deficit to compensate and I can\u2019t concentrate doing anything. I just end up spending hours on weight loss subreddits, or watching mukbangs. I\u2019m pretty sick of it. My eating disorder might not be that severe, because I\u2019m actually fine with eating at maintenance (ranges between 1700-2000 calories a day) but I\u2019ve been obsessed, for MONTHS, with maintaining this exact number I\u2019m at. Problem here is that the number I\u2019m at is underweight, and I haven\u2019t had a period in nine months. \n\nI started going to the gym a few days ago, and I love it. I\u2019m planning to gain weight in the form of muscle, so I have to eat more than I usually do, but I refuse to take it as an opportunity to binge. \n\nI\u2019m not going to track my calories again either. It\u2019s time consuming and ridiculous, and my obsession with assigning myself to a specific number is downright worrying. I\u2019ll lift weights, do some cardio, and my body can do its thing. As long as I just eat healthily and intuitively, I can enjoy days where I go out with my friends and \u00ab\u00a0overeat\u00a0\u00bb. I don\u2019t have to take it as an opportunity to binge afterwards.\n\nI guess this just hit me today. Going to the gym, being surrounded by toned girls who likely weigh much more than me on the scale, made me realise how obsessive I was being. No one cares about my exact number except me. I don\u2019t have anything to gain except misery from insisting that I remain at this exact weight by carefully monitoring my intake. Bye bye myfitnesspal, you won\u2019t be missed.",

If I can forget all the calorie counts of every food I\u2019ve fixated on by refusing to use my food scale and by avoiding nutritional labels, maybe I\u2019ll eventually be able to push the numbers out of my mind, forcing me to just eat things that make me feel good and help with gym \u00ab\u00a0gains\u00a0\u00bb instead of relying on trashy diet food.\n\nI\u2019m sorry this ended up being such a long response. I\u2019m really grateful for your advice and help. I\u2019ll definitely work on gaining some weight before I start properly working out.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f",

As an example, I am 10 months into recovery and I still need to eat more than my male partner who is 5 inches taller than me, even tho I am sedentary currently (and my weight is stable). Remember to use *your* recovery tools and listen to *your* hunger. Best of luck to you <3<3<3",
