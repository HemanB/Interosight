  "title": "'Eating Disorders as Coping Mechanisms to Trauma'",
  "selftext": "I'm reading this brilliant thesis by Alexa Riobueno-Naylor at Wellesley College about the intersection of Eating Disorders, Race, and Trauma, and I wanted to share this excerpt that resonated with me quite deeply: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> *The ways that the women in this sample described their relationships to food said a lot about how they thought about themselves in relation to the world around them. According to the stories included in this sample, the relationships that women had to their EDs were representative of how they coped with experiences of trauma that disrupted their bodily autonomy and sense of self. As Becky Thompson explains, \u201cappetites are often the metaphors girls and women use to speak about atrocities\u201d (Thompson, 1994, p.12).*  \n>  \n> *The way that food entered and exited women\u2019s bodies became the primary way through which they felt they could exert control over the way their bodies felt, especially after experiencing trauma and loss of control. Food became the ultimate coping mechanism. As Stephanie Covington Armstrong describes, \u201cI needed my bulimia in order to survive, and no one and nothing could convince me to give up what had become my sole coping skill\u201d (Covington Armstrong, 2009, pg. 178).* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI personally really appreciate how much research is being done these days on the connections between Eating Disorders and traumas such as abuse, sexual assault, racism, etc, because as it (unsurprisingly!) turns out, the connection is extremely strong, and those who develop Eating Disorders as coping mechanisms to their trauma are much less of an outlier than most people think. \n\nIn some ways I think the reason this isn't talked about as often as it should (especially in mainstream circles that are perhaps somewhat ignorant about EDs) is that people really don't want to acknowledge the societal impact on ED sufferers, it's easier in a lot of ways to assume that it's just a few isolated incidents of people \"taking their diets a little too far\" than to view it as extremely traumatised victims who were put in disempowering positions with little external support that they had to turn to an eating disorder for a sense of autonomy, but I'm glad that this conversation shift is happening.  \n\nIf anyone's interested in the full thesis, [here you go!](https://repository.wellesley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1682&context=thesiscollection)",

One disorder may manifest simply as a coping mechanism for another, persisting disorder. \n\nIn my experience, ED has been an \"outer\" symptom of deeper issues that I may never have uncovered had I not developed the ED.

For my MA thesis I would like to inquire link between transgenerational trauma and development of Eating disorders.
