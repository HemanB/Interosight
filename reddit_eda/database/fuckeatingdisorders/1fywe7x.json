  "selftext": "I hate rice cakes, I hate protein bars, I hate protein yoghurts and puddings, I hate low calorie sweets and cookies, I hate bland salads, I hate low carb bread. I hate diet drinks and I hate egg whites.\nAnything that is \u2018low calorie\u2019 is empty of energy and it is noticeable. It tastes empty and like cardboard. Same with \u2018high protein, low cal\u2019 things, they fucking repulse me and don\u2019t even taste like food. It feels like shoving cement into my mouth.\nNo way I ever though these things tasted good. The only things I like are black coffee and cottage cheese and NOT by themselves. Please if you have convinced yourself you only like diet foods just force yourself to eat the real thing once or twice and you\u2019ll never want to go back again, and your tummy can finally feel filled and warm for once.
