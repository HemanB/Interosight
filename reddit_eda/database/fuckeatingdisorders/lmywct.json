I had to just deal with it. Then I was sort of just binge eating on the road. I would try to throw up in a gas station bathroom, but I was only ever good at throwing up ice cream and I couldn't eat ice cream while driving.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I sort of accidentally stopped purging. I definitely wanted to keep the fun going. Since then I've sort of slowly come to terms with gaining like 15 pounds (which isn't too bad for my frame).",
