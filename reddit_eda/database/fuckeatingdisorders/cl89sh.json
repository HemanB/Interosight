  "title": "If you feel hungry, you need to eat more",
  "selftext": "I've seen so many posts from so many struggling people on this sub whose question is, essentially, \"what do I do if I feel hungry?\"\n\nAnd it's one of those things where it's like elementary school type shit, except that when you have an eating disorder, you truly do not know the answer to this question.\n\nSo I'm writing to remind us all of the answer, which is: **If you are hungry, that means you need to eat more.** It's not \"binging\" to eat a lot of food because you're really really hungry. Even if your tummy already feels \"full\" (your body needs more nutrition than usual, it makes sense that your stomach is going to be fuller than usual while you're getting that extra nutrition \u2014 plus, the anxiety from defying ED can make you experience heightened discomfort even when objectively your system is totally capable of handling what you've eaten. You can totally feel \"full\" and hungry at the same time, and that's ok). Even if you already ate as much as your friend/boyfriend/girlfriend/mom/dad/whatever. Even if your TDEE calculator says you've already hit ten times your \"maintenance\" (whatever that means).\n\nYour TDEE calculator does not know your body. Your mom/dad/girlfriend/boyfriend does not know your body. Your ED brain doesn't know your body (ED brain willfully ignores your body). Your BODY knows your body. Your body knows what it needs. It is wise, good, and on your side. It knows what it needs, and if you are hungry, that is your body telling you it needs food. If recovery is what you desire (no judgment if it's not), then you need to do what your body says, and eat. more. food. That's really the only way forward.",

My disordered thoughts stopped me from seeing how I was restricting (skipping breakfast, taking long walks or runs, using low-cal ingredients, small portions, trying to compensate for binges by eating less)\n\nAfter a few weeks of eating intuitively (aka eating a shit ton more than I thought I should eat), my hunger signals started coming back. I started to feel full when I ate. After two months, I was even able to leave food on my plate when I felt full (whaaaaaat?!?!). \n\nIt's been a few more months now, and I'm seeing what you wrote in my own life--sometimes you just need more food! Your body doesn't burn the same number of calories every day. I ate more tonight than I thought I would; even when my stomach felt full, my mind wanted more food. So I ate it! Not a binge, not a pack of oreos, just more of what I'd made for dinner. I've noticed that if I deny myself the extra food over and over again, I will eventually have a mini-binge (nothing like my huge binges before started doing intuitive eating, though).\n\nThank you for posting this!

My problem is, some times I end up being ravenous and fed up with my anorexia and I get sick of the restrictions and rules. End up eating idk say 3.5k and then I see how swollen and distended I am and then fast the day after, even if I had had a bad day before the 3.5k day (say I went 500 -> 3.5k -> 250) which is of course a net deficit. It's like a twisted recovery relapse loop, not binging and purging because I don't do it from a psychological compulsion or even bodily hunger, but more than I know I'm giving into my anorexia and I need to tell it to go fucks itself sometimes. It's like the willpower to fight it just dissipates and then I start back at square 1. (To people who are gonna call 3.5k a binge, A. That's only 1k above my maintenance. B. It happens very rarely, but I go that high at times if I was relapsing hard and sometimes you need a day like that and then you feel a lot freer again and eating 2k feels a bit easier.)",

I've lived the fact that the only thing that ever finally straightened out my hunger signals was eating a massive amount of food for several years without trying not to gain weight (and in fact, I gained substantial weight). Before that, I was a hot-mess depraved food goblin. I probably could have been diagnosed with BED at that time...but eating was exactly what I needed to do, even though I wasn't at a \"low weight\" anymore.\n\nI also think the binge/restrict distinction is somewhat of a false dichotomy. Because I truly believe that restriction causes binging. I think it's extremely rare to restrict long-term without engaging in some form of \"binging\" (restorative eating).\n\nThat said, I'm not on here to shoehorn my experiences on to anyone else if they don't fit.

It turned out that they were actually fucked up from restricting. I usually didn't even realize that I was restricting, so I thought all I had was a binge eating disorder. My disordered thoughts stopped me from seeing how I was restricting (skipping breakfast, taking long walks or runs, using low-cal ingredients, small portions, trying to compensate for binges by eating less)\n\nAfter a few weeks of eating intuitively (aka eating a shit ton more than I thought I should eat), my hunger signals started coming back. I started to feel full when I ate. After two months, I was even able to leave food on my plate when I felt full (whaaaaaat?!?!). \n\nIt's been a few more months now, and I'm seeing what you wrote in my own life--sometimes you just need more food! Your body doesn't burn the same number of calories every day. I ate more tonight than I thought I would; even when my stomach felt full, my mind wanted more food. So I ate it! Not a binge, not a pack of oreos, just more of what I'd made for dinner. I've noticed that if I deny myself the extra food over and over again, I will eventually have a mini-binge (nothing like my huge binges before started doing intuitive eating, though).\n\nThank you for posting this! It was very validating for me to read. I struggle with intuitive eating sometimes (occasionally I reeaaalllly want to go back to counting calories), but reading this helped me see that I *am* doing the right thing, even if I'm gaining weight or not feeling confident in my diet.",

It turned out that they were actually fucked up from restricting. I usually didn't even realize that I was restricting, so I thought all I had was a binge eating disorder. My disordered thoughts stopped me from seeing how I was restricting (skipping breakfast, taking long walks or runs, using low-cal ingredients, small portions, trying to compensate for binges by eating less)\n\nAfter a few weeks of eating intuitively (aka eating a shit ton more than I thought I should eat), my hunger signals started coming back. I started to feel full when I ate. After two months, I was even able to leave food on my plate when I felt full (whaaaaaat?!?!). \n\nIt's been a few more months now, and I'm seeing what you wrote in my own life--sometimes you just need more food! Your body doesn't burn the same number of calories every day. I ate more tonight than I thought I would; even when my stomach felt full, my mind wanted more food. So I ate it! Not a binge, not a pack of oreos, just more of what I'd made for dinner. I've noticed that if I deny myself the extra food over and over again, I will eventually have a mini-binge (nothing like my huge binges before started doing intuitive eating, though).\n\nThank you for posting this! It was very validating for me to read. I struggle with intuitive eating sometimes (occasionally I reeaaalllly want to go back to counting calories), but reading this helped me see that I *am* doing the right thing, even if I'm gaining weight or not feeling confident in my diet.",
