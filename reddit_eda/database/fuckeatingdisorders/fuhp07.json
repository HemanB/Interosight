  "selftext": "I get these weird little bursts of happiness when I think about how I\u2019m gonna be almost fully recovered when quarantines over if I keep challenging my ED to the extent I have been lately.\n\nLike I\u2019ll be able to go out with my friends to get food at places without calorie counts on their menus, and I can eat at my college cafeteria even though they don\u2019t provide nutritional value, and I can go on holiday and eat more than usual without worrying about how I\u2019m gonna torture myself getting back to my goal weight as soon as I return home. In the winter, I\u2019m not gonna be freezing all the time, and I won\u2019t spend every day huddled under my blankets wishing I had the energy to do something other than scroll through Reddit looking at pictures of food.\n\nThis is how non-eating-disordered people always live, holy shit. What a dream. Can\u2019t believe that\u2019s gonna be me. I\u2019m just so happy, I feel like nothing can make me relapse now. \n\nAs hard as it was dealing with the bloat at the beginning, once I decided to recover I literally could not bring myself to restrict anymore. There\u2019s something so beautiful in just listening to hunger cues instead of planning a month\u2019s worth of carefully calculated meals.",

It got a lot better for me after a couple weeks of eating whenever I was hungry without tracking. \n\nI\u2019m still somewhat bloated, so I think it takes a while to calm down completely, maybe a couple months. But from what I\u2019ve read, eating normally and refusing to engage in any ED-type restriction is what will allow it to eventually get better. \n\nGood luck with recovery!",
