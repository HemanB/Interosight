  "selftext": "I just wanted to share that I took control, said fuck you to ed voice and made the correct choice to enjoy a cinnamon roll after lunch. I've been craving that thing for ages and IT WAS FUCKING AWESOME. I feel so powerful having taken the control back \n\nNext week I'm going to treatment for a few weeks and because of that ed is telling me that 'I can't start recovering YET, I can't change my behaviours or I won't deserve treatment'. Well guess what, fuck you. I deserve treatment either way because I am sick. \n\nEver since I saw someone recommending Tabitha Farrar's book it feels like I've unlocked some new motivation to get better and change this miserable life I'm living. Her voice is always with me, in my head pushing me to make the tough decisions. \n\n\n\nJust wanted to share this tiny win with you guys, so I don't feel so alone:)) \n\n",
