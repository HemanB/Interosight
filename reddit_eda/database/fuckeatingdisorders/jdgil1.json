  "selftext": "Hello.\n\nI've been in Anorexia recovery for some time now and here's some things that've learned and some answers to questions that I had at the beginning.\n\nTl;DR: Whatever stage you're in - it gets better\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Am I the exception?\n\nNo, no you are not. I went All In and honestly it was my best decision. I gained weight fucking rapidly (like 25lbs in a month, rapidly) and thought I might never stop. I ate past comfortable fullness 3 times a day because I was so god damn mentally hungry and couldn't stop myself.\n\nSome may have considered it bingeing but I knew I had to feed and feed and feed. So yeah, I gained weight. Big whoop. My weight gain has slowed if not stopped and I feel so much better now. My metabolism is firing and I eat very freely.\n\nI thought I was the exception (like everyone does) but I wasn't. My body and I are starting to trust each other now. It trusts that I will feed it, and I trust that it won't take more than it needs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. Will I ever get full?\n\nHell yeah you will. Soon enough your body will actually tell you to fuck off and stop stuffing it. But you know what? It won't get to that stage unless you trust that it will. Let it happen. Gain the weight. You won't regret it. You're more than just a number on a scale.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. What will happen to me when I gain weight?\n\nFor me personally, my attitude towards people has taken the biggest shift. I go out with my friends now and (sometimes) I eat out with them. I've rediscovered old hobbies like rubiks cubes, music, soccer etc that I lost interest in simply because my mind was so occupied by food and punishment exercise\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBONUS ROUND OF RECOVERY BENEFITS\n\n\\- Sitting down because you're tired and not feeing guilty\n\n\\- Eating mom's cooking again\n\n\\- Getting to eat all the delicious breakfast cereals you look at longingly on the shelves in the stores thinking \"if only...\"\n\n\\- Letting life happen around you instead of trying to control everything minute by minute and stressing if one thing goes amiss",

      "body": "I\u2019m at the part where I\u2019m wondering if my body will ever stop gaining weight. I\u2019ve gained 63 pounds in a year and 3 months. And now I\u2019m in the \u201coverweight\u201d category. It\u2019s terrifying. I\u2019m hoping my body will find its balance and that I won\u2019t worry about it anymore. I too went all in with recovery and it\u2019s been hard to trust the process. But I have already seen many huge improvements in my health and life since I started recovery, and I hope to keep seeing that as I continue forward.",

Looking back, I thought that was normal to feel like that... where every bodily movement felt like a battle. It\u2019s not.\n\nPost-ED, I hit an \u2018offshoot\u2019 weight and even lost a little after; just like many other stories! I (also!) thought I was going to be an exception and continue gaining weight for the rest of my life. But now I feel stronger than ever, like I can take on the world... Life in general feels manageable now when it didn\u2019t before.\n\nYour bit about attitude really hits close to home too!! It\u2019s so nice to have my old hobbies and personality again and not feel like a total robot.. You lose a part of yourself when you have an ED, whether you realize it or not.\n\nTrust the process!!! Get it!!!!",
