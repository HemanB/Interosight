Why do they do that? lol they think they are helping somehow, jfc... Like the only part of the ED they can comprehend is the fear of weight gain so they may be trying to \"help\" with that, but none of the other facets of the ED. FAIL! I remember talking to my mom about it and then to him and asking him to literally never again comment on my weight or what I am eating EVER again because of how harmful and detrimental it was and would always be to me. He felt bad and explained how he was just trying to help because he doesn't want me to go the other way and become unhappy etc etc. His words still circled around in my mind over and over and over and I used them as an excuse to continue ED behavior, to my own detriment. So did the comments of anyone else during that time when my body changed. If I had had professional ongoing help at that time to debrief the comment, come up with a safety plan, and a plan to approach the people and set up boundaries, etc... maybe things would not have gone so badly for me (decades of suffering).\n\nAre you still getting help out of residential? It is an ongoing process and challenges like this (dumb comments) are why we need ongoing support. People are just going to say dumb things for eternity because EDs are complicated. It's not ok that they do that, but we need to be okay somehow through it all. You don't deserve to turn it on yourself.
