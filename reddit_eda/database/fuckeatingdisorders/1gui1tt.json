  "selftext": "I\u2019m sorry for the shit I\u2019ve put you through. I\u2019m sorry for thinking being skinny was more important than listening to you. I\u2019m sorry for overworking you even on days when you were screaming for me to stop and rest. I\u2019m sorry for breaking your trust in having a constant food supply. I\u2019m sorry for scaring you into thinking we were dying, so you had to cut off our menstrual cycle just so we can survive with what little I was giving you. I\u2019m sorry for making myself afraid of food when that\u2019s all you\u2019ve been screaming for. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve constantly had to raise my cortisol and adrenaline just to get what little energy I had left. And thank you, for somehow keeping me alive despite the circumstances. Thank you for never giving up. Thank you for being intelligent and giving me health scares so I can finally listen to you. Thank you for your ability to learn how to adapt to the circumstances I gave you. Thank you for not giving me worse damage and protecting me the best way you could. Thank you for slowing my metabolism so I could survive. (I can\u2019t wait until it\u2019s back to normal lol). Thank you for allowing me to eat intuitively, especially in the past. And thank you for giving me the opportunity to eat that way again. Know that I\u2019m gonna listen to you so we can rebuild trust. Despite being larger, I\u2019m going to achieve that somehow. We deserve to be healthy and strong again. We deserve to move in a way that feels good again. We deserve to be able to eat intuitively a way that feels good no matter what type of food it is, because I know you\u2019ll know how to handle it. I\u2019m still learning and trying to like you and at the very least be neutralized with you again. I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s taking longer than expected, but I\u2019m trying. Thank you. I won\u2019t take you for granted again.",

Lately I\u2019ve been under stress, so I haven\u2019t been eating as well as I should be, but I\u2019m trying. What I think of whenever it\u2019s hard is how much better I\u2019m going to feel once I\u2019m fully recovered and healed. I think of how energized I\u2019m going to be, how I\u2019m going to experience life in a different way, how I\u2019ll finally no longer be chronically hungry, and how I ironically won\u2019t be as fixated on my body as I am now. I\u2019m still fixated on it, but not nearly as much as when I was at my lowest weight. I also finally have the energy to enjoy shows, books, do my academics right, do good at my job, etc. it\u2019s so so hard, but I\u2019m trying and you deserve to as well!!
