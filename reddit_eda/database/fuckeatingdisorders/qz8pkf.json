  "selftext": "tonight was truly awful. i prioritized my eating disorder over my niece who i consider to be my world. i left her party early so i could eat my sad dinner alone in my bed when i live 2 hours away. if i had just eaten at the party this would not have happened. if i had even eaten during the day i wouldve managed. i have convinced myself i dont really have an eating disorder because i do eat. that in pretending or over exaggerating. but tonight i think it solidified it for me. i am disgusted with myself. i saw myself in the mirror tonight and i look gaunt, sickly and pale. i couldnt hold a conversation at the party because i was so malnourished. i just watched other people eat. and tracked their calories in my head. i didnt even want to eat there because i am in such a state of malnutrition. im so used to restriction i wasnt tempted to eat, my disorder has convinced me im okay with watching others. my niece offered me some of her mac and cheese, which made me so happy because she does not share food with ANYONE.  i felt so special. but i failed her. i couldnt take a bite of a whole pasta noodle, just the tiniest bit of the end. i pretended to eat a full bite because i KNEW it was fucking weird. anybody watching me would think that behavior was weird because it is weird. the things my eating disorder convinces me to do are weird. its not normal to walk by the bakery at work a million times a day just to smell the food. or to run past restaurants on my jogs to watch other people eat and imagine the meals there. its not normal to leave a party early after barely talking to anyone so i can go home and eat crackers and carrots and watch videos of other people eat meals id rather be eating. i threw away the piece of candy my niece gave to me (again after refusing to share with anyone else) because i couldn't have a simple lollipop. i drove 2 hours and didnt stop for gas because i needed to get home and do my routine. this solidified for me that my eating disorder will not let me do anything. i have to go home and live this groundhog day and eat my sad pathetic food over and over.  i cant go anywhere because i cant eat unless its at a specific time in a specific place with specific food. i cant eat beforehand, and im a starving mess if i dont do this routine. i live inside old memories of me enjoying life not being hungry. i constantly fantasize about looking at christmas lights with my family, enjoying and being present in the moment without being miserable because i am starving. about waking up in the middle of the night to my dad leaving work and wanting to watch him leave, instead of being woken up because i am hungry. i know deep down i am so, so, hungry. even if i dont really feel it anymore. if i dont suppress my hunger with liquids before bed so i can sleep at night. im at the point that eating anything is considered a binge to me. my eating disorder will not let me have a life. i have been living this routine for months now and today was the day i couldnt work around it. it has taken over my life and taken time away from the person i consider to be my everything. how can i say that if i chose this over her? i dont know of anybody noticed me not eating or acting strange, because i know healthy people dont fixate on what others eat so much. but regardless, the memory of this birthday was tainted for me and i hope to God my niece did not see me throw out her candy or that she does not internalize the memory of me unable to eat one fucking mac and cheese noodle. i dont want her to be anything like this. i hope when she grows up she continues to ask for seconds of mac and cheese and continues to eat cake and candy and eat snacks before her meals as carefree as she did today. i want to change for her. to be a role model for her. i dont want to admire a toddler for her eating habits. i dont want this for myself but i dont know how to stop or how to make myself eat. i need help. but i have no idea how to ask for it or if im truly deserving because half the time im convinced this isnt an issue. this eating disorder has taken so much from me, for years it has stolen good memories. i dont know how to get them back.",
