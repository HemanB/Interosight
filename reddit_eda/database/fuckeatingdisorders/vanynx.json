Like if you think you HAVE to exercise to eat or will restrict on your days off then it\u2019s tied to your ED. Or if you eat food to \u201cbuild muscle\u201d aka you\u2019re still scared of your body fat percentage going up and you\u2019re still restricting food. They don\u2019t wanna build muscle without also gaining the fat they need to help heal their body. \n\nAlso they post way too much about what they eat and edit that shit and like!!! it\u2019s like you\u2019re anorexic but in a muscular body.

Posting \"brave\" bikini shots to promote the intuitive eating diet (which sells books and seminars like any other bullshit diet) is pure marketing just like skinny/muscle focused diet culture. I think promoting body neutrality is a healthier approach because it isn't so image and beauty-centric. \n\nThere's not a single person in history I admire who was remembered for their good looks instead of their good deeds and great works (except for maybe Audrey Hepburn, but she was an excellent actor and humanitarian as much as she was a style and beauty icon--and it's not her beauty people should be striving to emulate.)
