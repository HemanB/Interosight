  "selftext": "Every recovery I went through, I failed. Most of the times because I felt like without my eating disorder I lost a part of myself. The ED was so ingrained in me, I didn\u2019t know who I was without it, or that\u2019s what I thought. You are so much more than that thought that tells you \u201cdon\u2019t eat that\u201d or \u201cget rid of the meal you had\u201d or the \u201cjust run one more lap and you\u2019ll deserve what you eat\u201d. Those thoughts might have occupied your brain for so long that you might think you\u2019ve lost yourself but you haven\u2019t. Recovery or not, remember you\u2019re still you. You deserve to eat. You deserve happiness. You deserve love. You deserve to be loved by yourself. \n\nEvery person on here is unbelievably strong, and I love all of you guys.",

It is possible. I\u2019m sorry that you feel discouraged but just that you want to be healthy will take you so much further. I promise you, you can be more than you\u2019re ed, you already are. I hope you find yourself in recovery soon and having a normal relationship with food. I\u2019m rooting for you, and many are too \ud83e\udde1",
