  "title": "My therapists advice about guilt around not eating \"healthy\"",
  "selftext": "I was talking with my therapist about feeling guilty or worried I wasn't eating enough fruits and vegetables and she said this. \n\nFruits and vegetables provide micronutrients, antioxidants and fiber. But those things only work if your body already feels fed, stable, and safe. Think of them as the paint and decorations on a house, not the foundation. You can\u2019t fix a broken foundation by painting the walls.\nDuring recovery, bread matters more than broccoli. Calories matter more than variety. Comfort matters more than perfection.\n\nI asked her to type in in my notes so I can look at it whenever I feel guilty for not eating in the way my brain thinks is \"healthy\". ",

But I need to think of calories as money and I have a lot of debt to pay off before I can operate on cash again. So I have to put a lot of food into my body to overcome the debt I\u2019ve incurred. It helps me to realize that \u201chealthy\u201d is for me, pure calories that I can use easily. Helps me to frame it in my head that a peanut butter and jelly sandwich on thick bread is a better lunch choice than a salad.",
