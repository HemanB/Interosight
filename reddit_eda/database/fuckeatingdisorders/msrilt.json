Just wanted to say I\u2019m in the same boat and reading posts like yours keeps me going :) some days can be really hard wishing I was that skinny again, but then I have to look at what else I\u2019ve gained other than weight and it really does help, wishing you the best for the future!",

I ended up gaining some weight long term (I\u2019m a few years recovered now) but I feel stronger and emotionally stable, I\u2019m not so cold anymore, and I don\u2019t think about food 24/7 and I can enjoy it when I eat. Keep at it everyone.",
