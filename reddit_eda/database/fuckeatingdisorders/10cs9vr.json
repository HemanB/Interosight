  "selftext": "I need to rant. I hate it when I see influencers talk about wanting to gain weight, but doing it \u201chealthy\u201d.  If you are needing to gain weight, any way you do it will be healthier than staying at a lower weight. It makes me so irritated that they want to stick to safe foods and eat \u201chealthy\u201d and only gain \u201cmuscle\u201d when they do need to gain fat too. Grr! Ok, rant over. Eat what you want!!",
