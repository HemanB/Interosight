It's not necessarily that its *triggering* me, but it's more of an annoyance every time I see it. Same goes for r/fasting and r/intermittentfasting. It seems like those subs especially mention and pertain to anorexia, or at the very least restricting to a dangerous degree, and it's super upsetting to see so often, and see people not bothered by it, and even ENCOURAGING it. It blows my mind. \n\nSorry this is kind of annoying and bitchy, I just needed to vent lol.",

My problem was after losing the 15-20 or so lbs eating 1200 per day I kept wanting to go further. I pushed myself to a 90 lb weight by just totally not eating anything for days which definitely was majorly unhealthy. Also combined with some cocaine use to sustain the weight loss and non-eating habits. I have recovered and can't even look at the 1200 is plenty sub anymore. I know after my pregnancy I will need to lose weight and eat 1300/1200 again for my health because of my petite stature and whatnot. I hope that once I reach my goal weight I can just kind of relax and eat healthy and not think too much about food.

      "body": "Like others have pointed out, 130 to 5'2 isn't obese. Far from it. It's not even overweight. Obesity is classified as a bmi of 30 or more. Overweight is classified as a bmi of 25 or more. At 130, you're at a bmi of 23.8 which is perfectly normal weight and within the normal weight bmi range. You'd have to hit 30.5 more pounds to be obese. If a doctor claims that 130 to 5'2 is unhealthy (I don't think your doctor has actually claimed that), you need to change doctors because that one is clearly incompetent.",
