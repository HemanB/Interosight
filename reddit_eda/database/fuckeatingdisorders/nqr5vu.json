  "selftext": "I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS!!!?? The past few days have taken a massive toll on me and I decided to just fuck it and treat myself. I've been terrified of soda for the past few years and I don't even want to think about nutella. But today I stepped out of my comfort zone and I was thinking I would completely ruin my entire week, but I DID NOT!!!!!! No regrets, no remorse, no guilt and I've never been prouder of myself. It's a small step, but I'm getting there. Fuck you and your bullshit EDs",
