  "selftext": "I shouldn\u2019t be jealous of them I don\u2019t wish this on anyone so why do I still feel so fucking jealous when I see posts that are like \u201cmy parents keep telling me to eat more\u201d or \u201c my parents are concerned about me\u201d. God what I wouldn\u2019t give to have anyone in my life care about me like that. I\u2019ve never once gotten a comment from anyone in my family that they are concerned or even care at all. I\u2019m pretty underweight according to my BMI but it just feels like I\u2019m still so fat. If I wasn\u2019t so fat people would notice and care right? \n\nAnyways that\u2019s my rant for the day sorry if it makes no sense",

      "body": "I'm in uni and I have a healthy BMI but my parents are convinced I'm fat. At the peak of my eating issues, I hid the duration of my fasts but nothing else. My parents were fine with me fasting (and even encouraged it) and my mom's idea of a whole, fulfilling meal was sometimes just a meat patty and two apple slices. I had to go in for an eating disorder screening and when my parents were asked if they had any concerns about my eating habits, they said I needed to eat less and exercise more.\n\nYeah that was fun to hear.\n\nBy contrast, three of my high school teachers were genuinely concerned. One stocked up on protein bars if I ever needed them, but I was too embarrassed to take him up on the offer. Another clearly had restrictive eating issues and admitted to over-exercising but would regularly try to feed me either fruit, celery, low-cal granola bars, and diet yogurts, which was all I ever saw her eat. The third one is the only adult I've ever met with a clearly sane relationship with food and despite typically being very reluctant to share food, she would give me at least a whole meal's worth of calories every time she fed me. I knew how territorial she was with her food and never asked her for any, yet when she chose to feed me she would always give me so much and the gesture meant a lot.\n\nI have a complicated relationship with my parents so their lack of concern doesn't bother me much, but compared to the concern I got from high school teachers who were in no way obligated to make sure I ate, it's a little sad.",
