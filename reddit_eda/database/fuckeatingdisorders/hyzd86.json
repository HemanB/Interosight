Literally, I\u2019m now overweight, I\u2019m not exaggerating.\n\nI\u2019m at work and I can\u2019t stop crying and I just want to die/binge/starve all at the same time. And SH. \n\nI want to go home but I have about 4 hours left. I can\u2019t stand being in this body. I need out.\n\nEDIT: So I told my client (I\u2019m a caregiver) that the nurse asked me that and she said, \u201cthat old bitch\u201d. Made my day. Reminds me of how much I adore taking care of her. She\u2019s 94 y/o with a deteriorating memory but such an amazing sense of humor.",

So ignorant and rude. \n\nIt\u2019s so hard to feel out of control and like your body defines who you are as a human being. It doesn\u2019t, and it shouldn\u2019t. But the feelings are still there! \n\nPlease make a deal with me. I want to SH too. If you can make it one night without SH, I\u2019ll go one night without SH, too.",
