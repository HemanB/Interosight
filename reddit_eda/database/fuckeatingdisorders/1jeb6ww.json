  "selftext": "I just want to say thank you to all of the mods for how quickly you all manage to recognise and take down triggering posts. I am someone who has had a few posts removed, and in the moment I felt a little attacked. I realise like 10 minutes after this that it\u2019s the eating disorder feeling attacked, which is such a weird but sort of cool revelation I think. \nMy main appreciation goes to the fact that when removing posts, the mods will give a response to your post directly, rather than just removing the post and being left with no insight. It\u2019s a tough love approach, but it f*cking works and I am so grateful for this subreddit. \n\nI\u2019m sorry if this clogs up the sub in any way, I just wanted to thank the mod(s) that removed my previous post, so I really hope you see this. :) And if you do, just know that your insight was what I needed, and I proceeded honour the food noise. \ud83d\udc97",
