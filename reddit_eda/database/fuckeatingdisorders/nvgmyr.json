  "selftext": "I'm just as confused as you are. Yesterday I woke up and was like \"alright so what's for breakfast?\" And then I sat down and ate breakfast, feeling literally absolutely nothing at all. Just a regular person eating breakfast like a NORMAL PERSON. THIS CONTINUED FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS. My ed literally just decided to remove itself??? Is that normal??? Do I even have one???\n\nI'm honestly in a really good place and I'm shocked, like I'm waiting for everything to catch up to me and crash my happiness, where I become disgusted with myself for eating at all, but honestly I'm just so happy right now. But at the same time, it's really fucking invalidating, if it was so easy for my mind to suddenly switch into place, was I ever REALLY sick or did I just enjoy the routine? \n\nIf anyone has experienced this or is experiencing this, I really need some advice or reassurance. Even cold hard facts will do, I'm just so confused.\n\nUpdate: I'm overthinking wayyyyy too much. I feel like I'm causing people who \"\"\"\"\"\"\"truly\"\"\"\"\"\"\" suffer with eds so much more pain?? I know it makes no sense but I feel (might be triggering) like I need to be suffering with everyone else to rEaLlY bE dEsErViNG of any sort of recovery. \n\nI don't care. I'll try and see if this lasts the week and if it doesn't... I'll be back on my bs\ud83e\udd2a",

I'm like basically completely recovered (took about a year) and I totally felt this way at first. no, it does not make your ED invalid. i totally understand where you're coming from because i had the exact same thoughts-- EDs are a weird mental illness because their is an illusion of choice to them; ie, we think to ourselves that having an ED/not having one is almost like, a matter of choice? in the way that you're trying to figure out whether or not you even had one because you've had a few days of more intuitive or \"normal\" eating. but truly, people with a healed/ nondisordered relationship with food don't ask themselves such questions, or overthink their eating at all (whether they're eating more or less than usual, it's not really a subject of contemplation). \n\ni don't mean any of this in a judgemental way! because i totally have been where you are rn and understand the confusion. but you deserve to know your whole experience is valid. your struggles and ED happened, even if it seems like you have just \"snapped out\" of it-- it's never that simple. something I've talked about with my friends is how things don't just \"pop into your head\"/ people don't just \"snap out\" of things, etc-- that's the product of your subconscious's stewing and brewing of thoughts and growth, give yourself some credit even if this is an unexpected turn. and more than anything i am SO SO happy for you!!!! I know this is a confusing experience for sure, and I understand your vigilance at waiting for it to \"fall apart\" but really, if you can, stay present with yourself and enjoy this time of simplicity around food. Even if you are hit with a wave of disordered thoughts, that does not make this any less important of a step for u. if you have any more thoughts/reflections/questions my dms are 100% open, It makes me so happy to see anyone taking steps towards recovery!! \u2764\ufe0f",
