  "selftext": "Like genuine gross or horrible things, I'll start:\n\nMy ED made me steal money from my parents to buy monster ultra.\n\nMy ED made me try to convince my parents that my sister had an ED so they'd focus on making sure she'd eat and wouldn't pay attention to me.\n\nMy ED made me try to poison myself so i'd be sick for a few days and wouldn't be able to eat.\n\nI tried to buy a tapeworm.\n\nAlmost pushed my friend to the ground just because they tried to get me to eat something.\n\nI gaslit/fought my parents whenever they mention I eat too little into believing I eat a lot, wether that meant logical reasoning, screaming or insulting them, I didn't care, as long as they left me alone\n\nEDs make us do disgusting things but remember that you're more than those behaviours! This is just another one of the many horrible things about EDs. What I did to help my ED will never be okay but I can make it up to everyone I hurt",
