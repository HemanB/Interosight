  "selftext": "Does anyone get really fucking annoyed when they see recommendations for subreddits such as \u201ccalorie counting\u201d and \u201cweight loss\u201d? Some people may not mind, but personally as someone with an ED (who is only following ED subs to move towards recovery / find some sense of community) ive been heavily trying to avoid anything which promotes weight loss/calorie counting... I just find it extremely tone deaf to have these recommendations popping up... Idk if Reddit has control over what comes up in my recommended, but I find it ironic and extremely deceiving of the algorithm as well. Like why would you be recommending weight loss Reddit\u2019s to someone subscribed to eating disorders Reddit\u2019s. Idk. I just needed to rant",
