  "title": "MY HAIR IS FINALLY GROWING BACK",
  "selftext": "It\u2019s been almost 8 months. EIGHT. And I finally just noticed little baby hairs growing in (like half an inch at most so not that long at all). They had to have started growing a a few weeks ago because they weren\u2019t there before and I\u2019m so happy that *something* positive has finally come from recovery after months of feeling stagnant.\n\nSo this is just a reminder that if it doesn\u2019t seem like your body is healing or you\u2019re stuck in this limbo phase where nothing is really happening weight/health wise, I promise you it is. Hang in there \u2764\ufe0f",
