  "selftext": "It\u2019s been a tough couple of months. Beginning of January was a big struggle. My husband was out of town for a week so I was home alone in the evenings. Prime opportunities for binging and purging. I was not 100% successful but I did a lot better than I would have a year ago. I also bought Brain over Binge book and have started working through that. \n\nAt this point, it\u2019s been 3 good weeks in a row with only one minor slip up. I haven\u2019t binged at all during this time and almost didn\u2019t realize it until this past weekend. \n\nI almost fell into old patterns on Sunday. I was at the grocery store in the morning and decided to get a donut for my husband for breakfast. Naturally I should get myself one too. Well...what if I got myself an extra one to eat in the car and then I\u2019ll only eat one at home. That extra \u201cone\u201d turned into a full *four* extra donuts. I sat in my car in the grocery store parking lot and normally would\u2019ve eaten them all. Instead I looked at them and took one bite of each (so about 1 donut total) and threw the rest in the trash. I went home and ate normally the rest of the day. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s small and insignificant but I need to count it as a win this week.",

I struggle with this immensely as an all-or-nothing mentality: well, I've already eaten unhealthily, so I may as well eat garbage the rest of the day.\n\nExcept if I want another donut, I can have another donut later. And I can have one tomorrow, too. I can have a donut with breakfast, lunch, and dinner every single day if I want them. There's no reason to eat four at once--and if you're going to eat four donuts, there's nothing shameful about enjoying four donuts. It's not a secret. It's just food.",
