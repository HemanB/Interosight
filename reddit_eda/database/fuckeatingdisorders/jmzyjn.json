You are valid if weight gain isn\u2019t upsetting you. You are so damn valid regardless. Recovery looks different for everyone, and it doesn\u2019t need to be hard for it to be a real recovery.\n\nJust a reminder.",

Some way to get my fat in first really helps curb binging. I know it sounds silly but it works for me. Everyone is different and you kind of need to experiment and figure out what works for you. That being said I look forward to breakfast everyday because it\u2019s what I want to eat. Not what I have to hehe.",

I don\u2019t love myself all the time but changing my mindset about myself and my body really did help, to my surprise. It\u2019s easier not to binge when I haven\u2019t been restricting and vise versa. It was a very long process to get to the point im at now and I still don\u2019t like my self and body most of the time, but I tolerate and accept it and that\u2019s made a big difference. \n\nAlso medical marijuana that I take for other conditions helped regulate my hunger cues, but I think I\u2019m an outlier in that so I don\u2019t think I would recommend it as a good ED medication lol",
