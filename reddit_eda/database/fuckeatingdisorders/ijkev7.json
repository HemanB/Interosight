      "body": "The problem with that sub is that people always assume their experience to be default. Anything you read is aimed at you or your experience -- That's what the ego tells them anyway. So when they run into content that is aimed at ED recovery or, you know, just trying to keep people from falling down the slippery slope that diet culture can be, they get defensive, since body positivity and intuitive eating is naturally at odds with diet culture.\n\nI think a lot of it comes from ignorance and/or only listening to extremists, too. They act like HAES stands for \"just stop taking care of your body you can be healthy at any size lol\", when really it's more about \"just focus on taking proper care of your body, and whatever it looks like after you've done your best caring for it is what Healthy is meant to look like on you\". It can also mean \"so you gained weight while recovering from an ED. This is healthy for you, considering your history and what you have to heal from. Don't let the fat = unhealthy assumption derail you from your process, because your process exists on a different realm from society's aesthetic expectations of what health looks like\".\n\nBeing able to see that unfortunately requires a lot of nuance and awareness of other's experiences. Humans are generally bad at putting ourselves in other's shoes. So yeah.\n\nBTW I'm **not** excusing their actions, not at all. I hate them and they should know better lol. But I can see why they behave the way they do, even if it strikes me as immature and childish, irresponsible even.",
