  "selftext": "While reading this, keep the phrase \u201cEasier said than done\u201d in mind. I\u2019m going to try to keep all of the Healthline Mayo clinic psychobabble buzzwords out of this.\n\n1. I promise you, truly no one gives a damn what you look like.\n\n2. Yes, #SelfLove and #BodyPositivity is great, but also remember that we\u2019re simply just talking about the fleshy outer vessel here, and you can just stop caring.\n\n3. Learning to love the inner self will make learning to love the outer self a hell of a lot easier.\n\n4. Relapses happen. Binges happen. No one is perfect. Move on.\n\n5. \u201cBad food\u201d is better than no food.\n\n6. 9 times out of 10 (probably even 10 times out of 10), people don\u2019t get an eating disorder just because they want to be thin. Trace back to when you first started sliding down that rabbit hole, and try find the deeper reason.\n\n7. It\u2019s okay if some days you just want to stay in bed and pretend you don\u2019t exist. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not trying hard enough, it just means you're human.\n\n8. Not everything happens for a reason. Sometimes the world is just fucked up, and you just have to find a way around it.\n\n9. Find new recipes and foods you enjoy eating. Maybe lettuce with sesame sauce really is your favourite dish in the whole wide world, but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to add some variety to your life.\n\n10. Find the humour in everything.\n\n11. Recovery is not going to be an easy road. That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t do it though.\n\n12. In the words of Eleanor Roosevelt, \u201cEvery day, do something that scares you.\u201d\n\nThat\u2018s all. Good luck folks.\n\n",
