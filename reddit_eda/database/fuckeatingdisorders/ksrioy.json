  "selftext": "That's it. There's no compromise. There is no world where you're going to be the weight you want to be and be healthy at that weight. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt sucks, but your body isn't going to compromise with you. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm smack dab in the middle of what is considered a healthy bmi range (although we know bmi is BS) and I still haven't gotten my period. I know we all want to stay in that 18-20 bmi range, but for many of us, that will literally kill us in the long term. Plus, if you want to have babies, you'll never be able to. And even for those who don't, you have osteoporosis to look forward to. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt took me so, so long to realize that there wasn't a fourth option.",

I've never been suicidal before, but I was in the shower yesterday and asked myself what the point of living was, and though cognitively I could think of many reasons to be grateful, none of them sparked me emotionally if that makes any sense. I'm almost completely apathetic about whether I live or die, and realized the only thing preventing me from walking onto the highway is how much it would hurt the people around me. There are many people who love me and I could never hurt them that way. But even if there weren't , there would still be people I would hurt. The person who found my body, my neighbors, the guy at the deli. No matter how little you knew someone, even if you hated them, hearing that they killed themself or that they died will shake you to your core. \n\nEven if there is no one who loves you (and that is extremely unlikely) your death is going to hurt people. So if you can't live for yourself, you still need to live for them, and living is going to be far less painful if you're doing it in a body that's not cannibalizing itself. If you care about the well being of others, killing yourself is not an option. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nResponding to u/sorcerers_apprentice, I like to think of weight restoration as like taking antidepressants. It's not going to solve your problems on its own. It might not even make a dent in them on its own, but it will make it easier or at the very least possible to solve your problems. Suicide is not a viable option, so why not take the steps to make existing easier, and perhaps, at some point, joyful even?",
