  "selftext": "I\u2019m at a work event for the next few days and it made me anxious anyway (lot\u2019s of coffee and cake/snack breaks and three set meals plus lots of colleagues and strangers) but now on the first day at the welcome dinner I had already told myself to eat what I want and have dessert so I couldn\u2019t cop out. So I had my meal and went to get a piece of chocolate cake which was pretty large but there wasn\u2019t really a way to split it there and it did look delicious. \nJust as I had put it on my plate a colleague came along and asked me if I had lost weight, I said \u201cnah\u201d (I actually haven\u2019t) and she asked me if I\u2019m sure (\u201cyeah\u201d) and then said that I\u2019m probably just a slim person anyway. \nI know she meant well but can people just stop commenting on peoples weight?? It drives me nuts and I think if it had been a more private setting I would have told her that I don\u2019t like it.\n\nWell, already thrown I went back to my table where everyone commented on the size of the cake how they couldn\u2019t eat that after the meal, that it\u2019s basically a meal itself (it was a bit big tbh) and \u201cwhere do you put it\u201d at which point I was painfully aware of my bloated belly in my jeans. \nI ate it anyway until I was full (also because I couldn\u2019t just put the cake back, maybe I would have).\n\nI\u2019m mad at all the comments but also a bit proud that I ate my meal as I had intentioned. We can do hard things! Opposite actions! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb",
