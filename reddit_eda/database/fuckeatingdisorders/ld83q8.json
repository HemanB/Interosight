  "selftext": "The title says it all. I'm scared about gaining weight, but I feel like I'm starting to get my personality and my life back. I don't know how I lived for nearly a year with the crippling headaches and brain fog. Refeeding has been hard because I always think I've eaten plenty and then I get another hunger headache and have to keep eating. It's been so worth it, though. I have so much more energy. I'm not nearly as moody, and I can focus on my hobbies again without my mind constantly going to food. I still hear my ED voice telling to me restrict, but then I get another headache and remember how shitty I felt when I was at my worst point and no longer want to wage war on my body. Thank you for letting me vent on here, I'm too scared to tell anyone in my life that I have an ED so it feels so good to be able to tell someone about it and share how recovery is going. If you're procrastinating trying to recover, trust me, you'll be so happy that you decided to work towards recovering :)",
