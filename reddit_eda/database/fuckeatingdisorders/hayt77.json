  "selftext": "ok i kno we all know that humans need food to function but i guess i didn't realize just how important it was until now? \n\nit's crazy i look back on the past couple of months that i was heavily restricting and religiously exercising and i realized my interactions with other people were so hollow. i feel like i just spent a chunk of my life in a starvation induced haze. i was always so concerned with what food i ate or what food i was going to eat or when i was going to eat or what i looked like that i dead ass could not concentrate on what my friends and family were saying, much less carry on a conversation. i felt like a depressed, starved zombie.\n\ni've been on a meal plan for about a month now in addition to antidepressants and oh my god the difference is crazy!! i'm able to actually focus on what people are saying and i'm not constantly looking for an escape route whenever someone tries to talk to me. my mind isn't screaming at me all the time so i can actually think and form intelligent thoughts and carry on interesting conversations. i have so much energy and i don't always feel like i'm on the verge of tears.\n\ni've struggled with an eating disorder for about 7 years now and this is my second time relapsing but i'm hopeful:) yea every meal is still hard and food still takes up a large part of my thinking space and i'm still trying to cope with the thought of weight restoration, but holy shit the insane difference in my personality and mindset when i'm eating normally versus when i'm restricting is such a big motivator.\n\ni've made a lot of progress largely thanks to just giving my brain fuel but also a LOT of other therapy and support and meds (and weed) and exhausting self reflection. i feel kind of guilty sharing my progress bc i sometimes feel like celebrating invalidates all the pain i was feeling before and continue to feel whenever i eat. BUT all progress is good and i thought sharing might help some people bc this sub was one of the main motivators for me to go back into recovery:)\n\nanyways thanks for reading, if u wanna talk or vent even about things not related to ed  please pm me:) with all this new energy i'm always down to make new friends\ud83d\udc95",
