  "title": "What I've learned about extreme hunger",
  "selftext": "I've cycled through ED-recovery-lapse-relapse-lapse-quasi-lapse-relapse\\[...\\] (I'll be 23 in a week and started this bullshit when I was 20).\n\nNote: I know there are different EDs (BED, bulimia, etc.) but I really only have experience with restrictive ED so...sorry. I can't write to everyone's experiences, only my own.\n\nThere's a LOT of panic in this sub about extreme hunger, and it's been a while since anyone's bumped a post about what it's like when you're NOT experiencing extreme hunger, so I figured I'd attempt one. Please call me out if I say stuff that isn't helpful for people in early recovery and I'll edit ASAP.\n\nAlso, if you have weird cardiac symptoms, REGARDLESS of level of restriction, PLEASE seek medical attention if you can.  \n\nThat being said, here's what I've learned/experienced/would advise:\n\n1. Stay the FUCK away from IG/TikTok \"extreme hunger\" or \"What I eat in a day - ED recovery\" posts. You don't know if they're still restricting (they probably are), how far into recovery they are (I seriously doubt anyone documents their first 2-3 days of extreme hunger on social media because you're too busy with the insane feeding frenzy that is extreme hunger). If you're panicked about how much you're eating, comment and we can talk through it. (If you've gone through extreme hunger and you want to also offer to support, feel free to do so in the comments!)\n2. DO NOT COMPENSATE. None of this \"okay that was fun but since I CLEARLY ate \\[amount\\] over \\[allowed amount\\], tomorrow needs to be more reasonable!\" Whatever you ate *today* is whatever you ate *today*. Tomorrow is a new day. If you're still hungry, EAT. If you're not hungry, stick to 3 meals and add a snack or two. Stay hydrated but don't water-load (this does bad stuff to your electrolytes in addition to just being miserable). \n3. Don't fight it. Seriously, loading up on, idk, iceberg lettuce or whatever \"diet hacks\" you've heard is really just setting you up to be simultaneously STILL REALLY HUNGRY and also full of...lettuce. See \"water-loading,\" because really, that's what veggie-loading is.\n4. It's okay if you literally find yourself just wanting high-carb, processed foods like yknow...PopTarts. They're quick energy. Your body wants (and needs!) quick energy. Don't try to \"slow-carb-Peak-Nutrition\" your way through extreme hunger. \n5. DO NOT WEIGH YOURSELF THE DAY (OR WEEK) AFTER IT SETS IN (OR HELL, AT ALL). DO NOT. DO NOT. DO NOT. It is ALL water and food weight. (Eventually, your brain might reset to realize that gaining weight is actually the better alternative to endless physical/psychological suffering and/or death, but for now, I'll just tell you - REAL weight gain takes TIME. A LOT OF TIME. Mathematically and physiologically, you need a LOT of extra food over a substantial period of time.) \n6. Don't set a time limit. Ideally, free-eating will be your LIFE, not just X days/weeks \"while I'm recovering.\" Extreme hunger won't last forever, but freedom with food is the *goal.* \n7. It's okay to enjoy food. It's okay to enjoy eating. It's okay to enjoy giving yourself freedom to eat unrestrictedly for the first time in however long it's been. It's okay. You have not somehow failed, you are not somehow lesser. You're killing it. \n8. ...don't try to safe-food your way through extreme hunger. please. it's miserable and I'm experiencing second-hand misery just thinking about it. Get some goddamn Nutella, REAL ice cream (none of that Halo Top bullshit), cook pasta and rice instead of shirataki noodles and cauliflower, eat the egg yolk. Get a cookie (or several!) without the protein content as the main attraction, get a Starbucks drink that makes your ED tremble in fear. Conquer the weeds and the gremlins because make no mistake, they want nothing more than for you to continue suffering. \n9. Food is energy. That doesn't mean you will feel energized. I'm sorry but your body is TIRED. Even if you didn't realize it beforehand, restriction is EXHAUSTING and if you find yourself literally ONLY eating and sleeping, that's normal.\n10. You don't get a say in when it ends, and the more you fight it, the longer it will take. If you can listen to your body through extreme hunger and recovery, you get your life back. It'll be worth every minute, but you just gotta stick it out. \n\nAlso, here's a sample of *one* of my days with extreme hunger, for anyone curious:\n\n* Entire large pizza (16-18\")\n* order of mozzarella sticks (8)\n* 9-12 poptarts\n* 1-2 pints of ice cream\n* ice cream sandwich\n* 3-4 nut butter sandwiches\n* 2-3 sleeves of saltines\n* 2 protein shakes\n* cereal\n* 1-2 apples\n* tiramisu\n* steak sandwich\n* probably more things that I'm forgetting because this seems too little for extreme hunger\n\n...and I was still hungry the next day, so I ate. There were no \"protein oatmeal bowls\" or \"green smoothies\" involved. I wanted some *fucking calories* on an order of magnitude that  spinach was *not* going to deliver, and so I *fucking got some calories*.",

      "body": "I love this so much. Like... Finally, someone whose extreme hunger resonates with me. I've seen people say that it's an excuse to binge and it would make me feel so awful. But, can it even be a binge if you are still hungry? I've mentioned this before but I was eating probably triple my TDEE if I was exercising, but I wasn't exercising. And it took 2 months of that before I gained a single (real) pound. My body had a lot of repairing to do! On a different ED sub someone said that \"don't restrict yourself\" just means \"don't eat a very low amount of calories, not eat whatever you want whenever you want\" specifically in ED recovery. And that's just bullshit. If I'm so hungry my stomach feels like a hollow empty pit, and I say \"nope gotta stick to my meal plan of >reasonable calories for someone not recovering from a restrictive eating disorder< or else it's binging!\" That would just be denial. That *would* be restricting. Idk. I never fully let my extreme hunger and my body repairing run its course, so my body never fully recovered. And I did that because I was still so scared of not being fully in control, of binging, and people online made me think I was binging. \n\nSo anyways, thank you again for this post. When I'm financially able to afford eating as much as needed and fully recovering, I'll remember this \u2764\ufe0f",

One of my struggles is just feeling hungry at random times and really not knowing what to eat; fortunately it really doesn\u2019t matter, so long as you continue to eat to physical and mental satisfaction!",

But, can it even be a binge if you are still hungry? I've mentioned this before but I was eating probably triple my TDEE if I was exercising, but I wasn't exercising. And it took 2 months of that before I gained a single (real) pound. My body had a lot of repairing to do! On a different ED sub someone said that \"don't restrict yourself\" just means \"don't eat a very low amount of calories, not eat whatever you want whenever you want\" specifically in ED recovery. And that's just bullshit. If I'm so hungry my stomach feels like a hollow empty pit, and I say \"nope gotta stick to my meal plan of >reasonable calories for someone not recovering from a restrictive eating disorder< or else it's binging!\" That would just be denial. That *would* be restricting. Idk. I never fully let my extreme hunger and my body repairing run its course, so my body never fully recovered. And I did that because I was still so scared of not being fully in control, of binging, and people online made me think I was binging. \n\nSo anyways, thank you again for this post.

But, can it even be a binge if you are still hungry? I've mentioned this before but I was eating probably triple my TDEE if I was exercising, but I wasn't exercising. And it took 2 months of that before I gained a single (real) pound. My body had a lot of repairing to do! On a different ED sub someone said that \"don't restrict yourself\" just means \"don't eat a very low amount of calories, not eat whatever you want whenever you want\" specifically in ED recovery. And that's just bullshit. If I'm so hungry my stomach feels like a hollow empty pit, and I say \"nope gotta stick to my meal plan of >reasonable calories for someone not recovering from a restrictive eating disorder< or else it's binging!\" That would just be denial. That *would* be restricting. Idk. I never fully let my extreme hunger and my body repairing run its course, so my body never fully recovered. And I did that because I was still so scared of not being fully in control, of binging, and people online made me think I was binging. \n\nSo anyways, thank you again for this post.
