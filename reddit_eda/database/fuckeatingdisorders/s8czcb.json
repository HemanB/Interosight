  "selftext": "So I was restricting sugar & carbs for 11 years and started eating it again 6 months ago. I have never felt so free and that I told my friend. We got into a fight yesterday and she said to me \u201dI think your food thing are just an excuse for your sugar Addiction. I belive that you are an active addict\u201d and it really hurts my feelings. I feel soooo hurt right now. \n\nI have gained a amount of weight in my foodrecovery but have made some kind of peace with it. I felt she was judging about that last time I saw her IRL, first I thought it was just in my head but now I know my feelings was right.\n\nI was a bingedrinker when I was young and has been sober for 7 years. The extreme hunger is gone and after that my hunger was elevated but recently it also has began to normalize. For my alcoholabuse it was the opposite- I drank more and more\u2026.\n\nI have worked soo hard with my self and my coach and it hurts my feelings that my friend(s?) belive I\u2019m using when I\u2019m accually recovering",

They are likely projecting judgment about themselves onto you. You don't deserve it and should try to establish boundaries and assertive communication to let this person (and others) know that it is unacceptable. One thing ED recovery has taught me is that we must use assertive communication and boundaries in our recovery...I used to let people talk to me like that, and use ED behaviors to cope with the pain, but I know if I want to recover, I have to speak up. Maybe you do too?",

They seem to view everything from that lens because it\u2019s easier than seeing things with more nuance. If you choose to continue having a relationship with her maybe setting some boundaries on what\u2019s discussed. You can educate her on what eating disorder recovery and how continued restriction of food exacerbates your symptoms and makes you feel worse. She is likely coming from a place of concern (imagine if she saw you you coked out all the time but you said you felt great). You can acknowledge that she\u2019s worried about you and tell her that this is needed for you.",
