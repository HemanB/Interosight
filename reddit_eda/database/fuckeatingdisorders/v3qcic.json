  "selftext": " not everyone is going to recover from anorexia nervosa, and harm reduction is completely valid and is helpful for people who can't fully recover. and people who cannot fully recover deserve support, they do not deserve to be shamed because they can't recover the right or correct way. underweight people should also be allowed to discuss their feelings. not everyone is going to fully restore their weight and not everyone can gain weight so easily. my organs are damaged from long term anorexia, and I literally have a hard time gaining weight now. I can't just go to treatment and fix my illness at this point. people who have severe enduring anorexia have to be given a different approach to treatment. people who do not recover deserve to feel listened to. it's not as easy as other people think it is",
