  "selftext": "I\u2019m on a vegan diet (for ethical reasons, I have been vegan many years before developing an ED) and I am really concerned that my meal plan does not have enough protein and contains too many unhealthy foods. My dietician doesn\u2019t seem to care and just admitted she thought the \u2018energy content\u2019 was more important than the breakdown of fats, carbs and protein. I\u2019m expected to have three meals, two snacks and supper. But all the snack options are things like biscuits, crisps, belvita, sugary yogurts, salted nuts, sugary juice, full fat hummus, crumpets and no protein options. All fear foods. Then breakfast and supper are just cereal or toast. Then lunch is a sandwich or a wrap. How can I get more protein in if all I eat is carbs and fat. How can I stick to a plan if there are no \u2018healthy\u2019 options and my dietician won\u2019t help me work through this.",

I straight up DOVE into my fear foods. My nutritionist (who happens to be vegan and ED recovery specialist too) said we would start working on them and I went out to buy ice cream, peanut butter and granola THAT DAY lmao.\n\nPersonally, my advice would be to focus on how ya feel over time. If I eat a big bowl of pasta I might feel really full but still be hungry. If I eat just lean protein and greens I might not be hungry but I don\u2019t feel satisfied either. That kind of feedback has been the most valuable in terms of guiding my choices.",
