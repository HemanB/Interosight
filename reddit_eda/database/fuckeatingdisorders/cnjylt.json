  "title": "The Sudden Realization that its possible to make plans without the input of anorexia",
  "selftext": "Two weeks ago I received a text message from my grandmother who is now visiting from Florida, requesting for me to take a day off of work, not only to spend with her but to spend with her at a dinner theater, to which I gleefully agreed.\n\n\nFor two weeks I have been anticipating my day off, wondering what we\u2019ll see, excited at the prospect that we could possibly be doing something after, and it wasn\u2019t until yesterday morning that it struck me, in a similar situation no less 6 months ago I never would have agreed. When I was in the jaws of anorexia even just the suggestion of changing my routine would have sent me into an anxiety fueled rage accompanied by sorrow. It wouldn\u2019t have been an instant yes! but a begrudged \u2018ok\u2019 only after analyzing what would be on the menu to eat and determining whether I had time to exercise before the show and after if my fiance wasnt home yet.... but it wasnt like that, not at all, and after realizing, yeah, the anxiety was there but it was quickly replaced by pride and confidence: \u2018I have done it, I have come far, and I will keep going\u2019. \n\n\nIt\u2019s crazy and scary to start but despite everything the anorexia told me about recovery, moments like these, where I realize that I made a challenging dinner without scrutinizing over my snack later, or where I can go out with my favorite people without a second thought, right now they may come few and far between but I know they\u2019ll happen more often and I know that each time they do, if and when I realize I can and will feel pride. Recovery has been the hardest journey I\u2019ve taken, recovery on my own without a program I or therapy seemed impossible, and yet I stand here today, preparing for a day at the theater, feeling more in love with myself, not just for how I look, but for my accomplishments and for how far I\u2019ve come, and I hope that anyone struggling knows that the first steps are clumsy and miserable, they\u2019re scary and they feel huge (because they are) but the peaks on this uphill battle are gorgeous when you reach them, and I can only imagine what the summit will be.",
