  "selftext": "Idk I feel like it's just letting your body *be*? Like the endgoal is just eating a variety of foods, being willing to try new things, not focusing on calories (either restriction OR \"maintenance\" OR gymbro gainz) but just accepting that there will be days you're at a deficit and days you're at a surplus and your body may change over time and that's OK. \n\nrecognizing that nothing changes in a day or a week \n\nrecognizing that movement is healthy unless you do it for unhealthy reasons or in unhealthy ways \n\nlearning to live life without eating from a calculator or a checklist \n\njust..learning to *be* again \n\nI hope I get there some day",

Like I don't want to look at anything/everything I see/experience sends me spiralling- makes me feel powerless etc. I wonder if addressing things when you feel ready/facing them squarely and exercising healthy control/being proactive helps subdue the volume of the ED so food/weight stuff isn't as loaded and you can switch off/feel more at peace as a consequence- this isn't to discount/invalidate that it's a real mental illness w/ a physiological/physical impact- but I do think the intensity of the ED/the noise of it etc is from your life getting too difficult/upsetting and not liking what you see/feeling upset by everything you see/experience. When I'm really entrenched in my ED/it's badgering me constantly and I can't switch off from it/I feel like shit.. I just know other things in my life (which I'd care about/invest in if they were working) are messed up- and I dread looking at it",
