  "selftext": "For any other Jewish people here celebrating the Jewish New Year tonight: I know the holidays can be rough, especially for EDs and especially being surrounded by all sorts of different foods (and relatives), so I just wanted to give people the same advice I give to myself on days like today: Eating is fine, it won't hurt you, it won't have any catastrophic consequences, even when it feels like it will. So let yourself have some delicious apples and honey and sweets and whatever other food looks good to you. It's so much more worth it to let yourself celebrate these times, even when it's hard to.  \n\nAnd have a sweet New  Year!\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf6f\u2721\ufe0f",
