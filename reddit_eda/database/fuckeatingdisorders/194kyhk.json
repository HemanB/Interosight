  "title": "Things I noticed from my Extreme Hunger",
  "selftext": "Hello! Hope the person reading this is having a lovely day. I am going to list what MY personal experiences have been as I have been going through extreme hunger. I hope someone finds this relatable, and some of these are quite weird lol. If you get weirded out/grossed out easily, you may not want to read some of these experiences that I have experienced. Also, please don't compare yourself to what I have experienced; everyone has their own journey. Anyways, let's get on with it.\n\n\\- No matter HOW MUCH protein, fats, or perfect 'macros' are in a meal to make a normal person feel satiated, my stomach feels empty. For example, before I had anorexia, I would always enjoy a lovely bowl of oatmeal with protein powder, yogurt, fruits, and peanut butter. That would hold me over for HOURS. However, as I went through ana and decided to recover by honoring ALL of my extreme hunger, that bowl of oatmeal does me no justice. Even if I double or triple the servings, I still feel like a black hole. \n\n\\- Even if I eat a huge amount of food in one sitting while truly enjoying it and eating slowly, I will get hungry again within the next 30 minutes to an hour (whether it's mentally or physically). \n\n\\- My face looks lively again; I don't look like a ghost anymore. I have light in my eyes, and my cheeks are a rosy pink. My family noticed it as well, and it makes me so happy, especially because I look more attractive now. I don't look like a rotting corpse.\n\n\\- I have so much energy to do things! I know exercise isn't the best idea during extreme hunger, but since I am an athlete training for track season, I have to train. However, I love doing athletics. I am no longer doing them to burn calories anymore, but rather to become a better athlete. Honoring my hunger and giving my body the nutrients I need has made me perform the best I have ever in my life. I am MUCH stronger in the gym, and faster. Therefore, I can confirm that weighing less does NOT mean you will be faster. When I was underweight, I was still slow.\n\n\\- Speaking of TONS of energy, I actually have a hard time falling asleep sometimes at night. I just get really excited about the next day, and also thinking about my breakfast lol. However, I have tried honoring my hunger super late at night once, and it made me feel really sick and I didn't sleep the entire night. Therefore, I just honor it as much as I can during the day and early night. Everyone is different, like I said. I do need a good amount of sleep because of school and athletics.\n\n\\- Ok, this part gets a bit gross, so warning. Let's talk about digestive issues. My stomach hurts sometimes, and I am EXTREMELY gassy. It also smells terrible; it could kill someone who walks by. Obviously the reason why this is happening is because the body is not used to digesting copious amounts of food after a long period of restriction. However, it is getting much much better because I am able to digest food easier now as I have been continuing my journey of extreme hunger. Another gross thing is I have tons of bowel movements a day. I am talking about 4-6 times a DAY. Crazy, right?! It's not fun lol. Don't tell me I didn't warn ya. \n\n\\- I don't know if this happens to anyone else, but my resting heart rate has skyrocketed. It used to be in the low 40's or even below that when I was unhealthy, but when I started honoring my hunger and eating everything in sight, my resting heart rate is now in the 60s-70s range. Probably because my heart is pumping more blood to the digestive system to break down all the yummy food.\n\n\\- Despite having a hard time falling asleep at night sometimes due to excess energy, my overall sleeping patterns have significantly gotten better. I used to always be hungry when I went to bed, and would wake up constantly in the middle of the night because of that. Now, I can go to bed with a full stomach and a smile on my face, and sleep through the night.\n\n\\- My brain is working SO MUCH BETTER. Academics have always come easy for me, but during ana, I could not focus during class. I was always thinking about food. I don't know how I still had straight A's, don't ask me how, but I would literally start to forget things. I couldn't remember certain things and my physical response was delayed. Now that I am eating, my brain is like 200x more sharp and I can recall practically almost anything.\n\n\\- I can feel emotions again. Anorexia numbed my emotions and caused me to dissociate from everything/everyone. Now that I have gone to therapy and fixed the underlying issues that caused my eating disorder (it was control related), I am happy to be recovering and honoring my extreme hunger. I am finally able to feel happy again, to feel excited, to process my bottled emotions, and to especially feel attracted to other boys again. During ana, I was only thinking about myself and food so I didn't pay attention to any boys.\n\n\\- Speaking of boys, I noticed that when I started taking care of myself, my entire energy changed. More boys are talking to me and flirting with me. During anorexia, I separated myself from everyone, and nobody ever noticed me. Now that I am becoming much healthier, I am making more friends, and talking to more boys.\n\n\\- I am more motivated. I actually want to do my homework, I actually want to explore the world and learn new things, and I actually want to become the healthiest and best version of myself. My eating disorder voice is starting to subside, and I finally feel free to embark on the journeys that I want to embark on, NOT on the 'journeys' that my eating disorder wants me to 'embark' on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese are just a few things I have noticed from only a month of going 'all-in' with my extreme hunger. Sure, I gained some weight, but that wasn't the only thing I gained. I gained freedom, life, and a sense of who I really am. I am beginning to love life again. Remember, everyone's journey is different. I still have a long ways to go. However, I hope this reminds you to take care of yourself and to love yourself unconditionally. Life is just simply better that way. Thanks for reading this really long list.",

More boys are talking to me and flirting with me. During anorexia, I separated myself from everyone, and nobody ever noticed me. Now that I am becoming much healthier, I am making more friends, and talking to more boys.\n\nI wanna zoom in on this because I've thought about it a lot. This has been super challenging to me. I was at my worst during lockdown so sometimes I think that's why no one was into me... but then I remember that I spend another 1-2 miserable years in quasi after the strict lockdown. After I went all-in, suddenly men became interested in me, to the point where it overwhelmed me. With my long history of quasi and at a non-critical weight, I actually didn't have much edema and went through hypermetabolism first thing, so I got all the benefits quickly; I saw the results of repair within weeks and felt them within days. \n\nIt was actually troubling for a while, because my body image was problematic and I still have this twisted idea that I could only be attractive if I'm as skinny as possible. The sexual/romantic attention caught me off guard because I was barely expanding the tiny world my ED had me living in. I could hardly hold a conversation because I had no idea what I liked and wasn't up to date with anything I had previously loved.\n\nWithin the framework of \"the body attracts and the soul keeps them there\", recovery is the solution to BOTH. That's not to mention the fact that personality also attracts. Your healthier self is more attractive, and when you're mentally no longer a zombie, you can actually build connection.\n\nI'm nowhere near recovered (because I relapsed. All-in got me nearly fully recovered within months after years of struggling) but so much better than I was. Last week, I reminded the guy I'm seeing that I hadn't tasted his dessert yet. I've thought about him like 10 times more than about food in the past week. It gets better.",

Right before opening Reddit I went through a sudden bout of EH and was panicking. I ate pretty much that perfect oatmeal bowl you described and then another apple and I still felt like I hadn't eaten in ages. Then more snacks. Desperately tried to find the perfect macros, because y'know, according to diet culture, I just need to eat an entire chicken to be full and support my mooscles. Waited. Felt like the food had been teleported into the void. Guilt set in. Now I've been reminded of the benefits of honoring that hunger! Thank you.",

Their words remind me why I need to be eating such a high amount of food and why I need to listen to mental hunger, etc. I also deleted tiktok and instagram because hearing about \u2018healthy eating\u2019 or seeing peoples bodies is only triggering me.

When nothing motivates me anymore not even staying alive for my family\u2026 I eat for Jesus. It might sound very weird, but I\u2019m a Christian and knowing that He has a plan for my life is sometimes the only thing that keeps me going. I want to know what His plan is and that\u2019s why I keep on eating. Try to make steps again, and remember if it triggers, gives you anxiety and makes you feel so bad, then it\u2019s killing your ED! \ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97",
