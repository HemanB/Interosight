  "selftext": "A thought I\u2019m pretty sure we all share is that when we are \u2018thinner\u2019, that makes us more \u2018beautiful\u2019. Or worthy, or confident, etc. I definitely thought this, and I thought that when I\u2019d gain weight in recovery that I would become unattractive, ugly, undesirable etc.\n\nWell, bitch, I was wrong. In many ways. Here\u2019s a list of whats happened since I\u2019ve gained weight:\n\n* I\u2019ve had 3 people ask me out. During my ED, I had no one ask me out. One called me beautiful, and apparently one described me as the \u201cperfect woman\u201d behind my back to his friends. I\u2019m overweight. I didn\u2019t think \u201cperfect woman\u201d and \u201coverweight\u201d would go hand in hand, but fuck yeah, here we are. \n* All my family and family friends have told me how much better I look and how much happier I am. When I was thin, I was miserable. I\u2019m happy now. That makes a massive difference obviously.\n* I\u2019m so much more confident now. Confidence is a big thing, and when I was in my ED, I was always so worried about my appearance and what I looked like that it defeated the whole point of \u201cthinner equals confidence\u201c, so there\u2019s more proof it\u2019s bullshit.\n* Speaking of confidence, my boobs have come back, which to me is a huge win. I can now show a bit of cheeky cleavage, which for me makes me feel more confident and better about myself. That\u2019s me personally, I like big boobs. Now I have them.\n* One of my friends said to me after not seeing me since I\u2019ve started recovering, \u201cwow, you\u2019re hot now\u201d\n\nIdk the full point of this post tbh, it\u2019s just proof that thinner doesn\u2019t mean beautiful. I feel more beautiful now than I did before, and I\u2019ve had more attention in that way I guess? Hopefully it helps u guys feel a bit better about recovery. If you think that gaining weight will make you unattractive, you\u2019re wrong. Trust me :)",

      "body": "I\u2019m glad you have reached this point! Its great when people find peace with their bodies.\n\nI had the opposite experience, personally. I got a lot more attention when I was underweight compared to now; it\u2019s almost like it was fetishized to a weird extent. Everyone close to me says they like me better now\u2026 but I don\u2019t get hit on anymore lmao. I don\u2019t weigh myself, but I am most definitely overweight and I don\u2019t feel beautiful at all. I do struggle with body dysmorphic disorder so I\u2019m sure that contributes on top of my own internalized fatphobia, and I know overall confidence is a factor. But people who fit the \u201cbeauty\u201d standard, whether you\u2019re overweight in the \u201cright places\u201d or straight up thin do tend to get treated better on a systemic level. It\u2019s not an excuse to not work on your own fatphobia but I understand why so many people struggle with ending up at a higher weight.",
