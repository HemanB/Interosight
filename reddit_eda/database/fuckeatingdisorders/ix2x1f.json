  "selftext": "Hey everyone. I'm Richie, 25M from the UK, and I've struggled with binge eating since I was 19.\n\nI didn't fully realise until a day in October two years ago when I ate 10,271 calories in 21 hours.\n\nI decided to film myself talking about this because we have a lot of fucking work to do to tackle the stigma men feel around Binge Eating:[https://youtu.be/LQN2rI8i1CM](https://youtu.be/LQN2rI8i1CM)\n\nI've typed out some more context below as well.\n\nIf you're a guy needing support with Binge Eating, please do drop me a message: I'm here for you and we have a men's support group going with 35 of us sharing our stories \ud83d\udcaa\n\nSending love to you all.\n\n\\--------------------\n\n*I felt I was living a double life.From the outside it looked good: I'd graduated from Cambridge, I'd started a company the year before, I was sociable at parties.On the inside, I felt like a failure and felt like my life wasn't going anywhere.*\n\n*As men, we don't learn about eating disorders.*\n\n* *From society, we hear that \"guys don't have eating disorders, only women do\".*\n* *From our own brains, we tell ourselves \"it's not manly, it's shameful\".*\n* *From our well-meaning friends, we hear \"you're fine mate, everyone eats a lot, don't make a big deal of it\".*\n\n*Luckily, I've had CBT therapy in the last 18 months and am doing well now.*\n\n*But I know how difficult it is for us men who binge eat.We firstly need to be aware that this exists as a condition and we then need to be able to admit to ourselves that we are struggling.Only then can we get the help we need.*\n\n*So the stigma and the shame needs to change.*\n\n*My mission is to make it easier for guys like me \u2014 and maybe if you're reading this, guys like you \u2014 to get the help we need to tackle binge eating.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\--- edit ---\n\nI\u2019ve had lots of people reach out to join the community for men who struggle with binge eating. Either DM me or fill in this form and I\u2019ll add you\u00a0[https://forms.gle/hiEUFPiPYKaTcQiR8](https://forms.gle/hiEUFPiPYKaTcQiR8)\u00a0\u2014 stay strong fellas\n\nAlso created a subreddit for us: [https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingMen](https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingMen)",
