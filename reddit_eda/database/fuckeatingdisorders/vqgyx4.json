  "selftext": "My sister married a guy who's overweight and my mom can't shut up about it, she literally took a pic of  him when she was visiting them and sent it to our family group chat with \\*elephant\\* as the caption, she also does this in front of my sister, his WIFE, and my sister get so angry about it but doesn't confront my mother.\n\nlast year my sister had a baby boy and he's just the sweetest baby in the world, he's chubby and cute as babies should be, but my mother keeps saying bad things about him, it's so disgusting and triggering for me too.\n\n every time we look at a photo of him or when my sister visits she always says (i hope he becomes skinny when he grows up, not fat and lazy like his dad)\n\n i really hate her because she always does this in front of my sister and her other 4yo daughter, I'm afraid that that could lead both of my sister's kids to develop EDs when they grow up.\n\ni tried to confront my mother abt it but she gets really defensive, she screams and cries and acts like a victim every time so i don't know what to do aside from ranting because she was one of the causes of my ED and my sister's constant dieting cycles and my dad who is a 54yo diabetic man, starved himself because every time they go to bed she tells him he's fat and that he should lose weight when she herself is overweight too.\n\nI'm so done with her i wish she dies soon or smth",
