  "selftext": "We were eating dinner and honestly I've been okay considering... You know, it's Christmas period and I usually struggle around now. And then my niece told me to go on a diet, \"as a joke\". But I obviously didn't take it as a joke. \n\nI feel like shit lol. I obvs got upset but I can't do anything at the table bc my fam don't know my struggles w my ED bullshit. So I CAN'T say anything.\n\n I ate dessert still tho. I'm not gonna fall back into bad habits but god I Sure Am Thinking About It",

I can't really get mad at her because she's three and is using all the ways she knows to express her fondness of me but boyyyyy do I wish she wouldn't call me chubby.\n\nIf she is old enough to grasp what she is saying and suggesting, tell her to cut it out purely on the basis that it is rude.",
