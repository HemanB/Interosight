  "selftext": "Literally for anyone stuck in limbo, \u201cshould I recover or should I stay sick\u201d, whatever your thought is from keeping you from getting better, like shut that shit down. Seriously. Remember that you are sick, and your brain is sick, and you are stuck in self destruct mode, you are not ever going to just choose better for yourself and have it be easy. You literally have to rewire your fucking brain, you are going to get more sick before you feel better, it\u2019s going to be hard, you\u2019re going to want to relapse, you\u2019re going to hate yourself, it\u2019s not going to feel good all the time, but after you start goddamn does it feel so fucking good. Once your body has time to start restoring itself and you stop feeling dizzy all the time, you stop passing out, you stop having seizures, you don\u2019t feel sick 24/7, like you really start realizing that you don\u2019t actually want those things, you don\u2019t really want to be sick, you feel so grateful to not be sick and not feel cold that it pushes you to never want to go back. I promise you, you will never regret recovering. But you will regret letting yourself get more and more sick. They don\u2019t tell you what you\u2019re fucking up, and you think that you know but you don\u2019t. Or sometimes getting another disorder or another thing wrong in your body is like a badge of honor, someone telling you that you did it, you\u2019re getting more sick. That\u2019s because you\u2019ve rewired your brain to give you dopamine for self destructive behaviors. You get dopamine when you skip a meal instead of when you eat it bc you\u2019ve rewired those neurons and chemicals in your brain. Getting osteoporosis might sound nice and like you\u2019re SkinnyTM, until none of your bones can support you, your knees dislocate constantly and are collapsing beneath you, you\u2019re getting arthritis in your 20s, and doctors are telling you that you probably won\u2019t live past 35. \n\nAnd beyond any medical problem, you want to be skinny and tiny until you get there. I hate my body now. I look like a child, my pants look like they\u2019re for babies, I can\u2019t find anything in stores that fit me bc they don\u2019t have sizes this small, and this all sounds like \u201caw poor you bullshit\u201d but it fucking sucks. It fucking sucks to starve yourself for the better half of your life just to get everything you thought you wanted, and you hate it and you hate yourself and you destroyed your body and you destroyed ever having a chance for a healthy life, and you look back on pictures from when you hated yourself and get pissed off bc you used to be hot and have a bodyodyody and now you look like fucking flat Stanley. \n\nJust recover. Just do it. This is a war you will never win. This is a parasite inside your brain. Exterminate it. Just fucking recover.",

I've been working out to put on muscle, doing a \"bulk\" (surplus of calories with high protein focus to put on weight and muscle quickly) which is usually followed by a \"cut\" (mild to high calorie deficit to shed the fat weight put on to show the gained muscle) and I've been struggling to think about how I'll have to not do the cut and just deal with any extra fat I put on. I've found myself looking forward to a \"healthy weight loss\" even though it wouldn't be for me. \n\nAnyways. Thank you. This puts it in perspective- I don't need to lose weight to look \"skinny but shredded\" as my brain wants me to. I just need to be strong physically for my specific fitness goals, and strong mentally to not relapse.\n\nThank you thank you \ud83d\udc9b",

You start recovering because nothing in your body works anymore, you spend most of your time at doctors, cardiologists, neurologists, orthopedic surgeons, you name a doctor you\u2019ve probably been there. You can never walk into a doctors office without getting undressed for an EKG, which just adds to the trauma and the reasons to want to recover. \n\nBeing sick isn\u2019t beautiful. It\u2019s awful. It\u2019s torture. There\u2019s a reason we isolate ourselves so much, because it destroys you to make another person watch you die. Recover. I promise you, you don\u2019t want this.",

It sends messages to your brain telling you not to eat, telling you to relapse, telling you this or that or anything it can to trigger you, because the more sick you get the more powerful it becomes. It consumes you. It sucks all the life out of you. But as you recover, you get that power back. As you silence that voice and feed yourself and take care of yourself and love yourself, you take all of that power back into your own hands, and it feels so good. This parasite makes you think you can\u2019t live without it, because it can\u2019t live without you. But you slowly start to learn that you were your own to begin with all along, and you don\u2019t need it, and it can\u2019t have you anymore. It can\u2019t take anything from you anymore. \n\nSo good job silencing your parasite in one of your hardest months :) next month you\u2019ll thank yourself that the voice is a little bit quieter. If your one year of recovery is coming up, you should start planning to celebrate, throw a little party for yourself! One year of strength. One year of choosing yourself. One year of choosing life.",

Everything you think you love about yourself is still wrapped up in your disorder. In what you\u2019re allowed to love. Figure out what you love, figure out what makes you happy, heal all parts of your life, and then you\u2019ll really feel what it\u2019s like to be in a healthy body, and it feels great. I\u2019m still a little broken, but in the moments I feel healthy, it\u2019s like standing in the sunshine in the morning light, it just feels so good and happy and fulfilling. \n\nTake this as your sign, take your life back into YOUR hands, not your disorder\u2019s.",

We all deserve so much more than we can even imagine for ourselves, and recovery opens those doors for us. You will win this fight, I know it. I just want to put the offer out there because I know how badly I just wanted someone who had recovered or at least had been on the journey to talk to me and tell me things were going to be okay, or help me navigate it, or really anything, so if you ever want someone to talk to feel free to message me. Whether it\u2019s me or someone else, you don\u2019t have to do it alone. <3",

I never ever EVER get on Reddit and I was telling my husband about how I am 25 and finally, after spending over half of my life engaging in ED behaviors, I feel like I want to let go of my illness, but I won\u2019t know who I am without it so I feel like I have to hold onto it for dear life. My husband suggested I check out this subreddit, so I did. I literally used the word \u201climbo\u201d to describe where I am at in my recovery  and how I am not sure which way I want to take this because I am in a recovered body and I honestly don\u2019t hate it as much as I thought I would. It\u2019s HARD. Like so so so hard, but I can do more. I can live my life and feel joy\u2014like real joy\u2014and see more than just food and numbers and exercise is enjoyable and I am happy. Again, this is my second time ever pulling up Reddit and I feel like you were talking directly to me. Thank you so much for sharing this. Fuck ED.",

          "body": "It\u2019s scary letting go, and it is hard to figure out what life should look like without your disorder. In the beginning it\u2019s work, you have to push those thoughts down yourself, you have to make yourself think of things in a positive light, you have to avoid your self destructive behaviors, and you start to see just how many of them you have. And it\u2019s scary thinking about existing in the world without being sick, you think people won\u2019t treat you the same or won\u2019t care about you anymore, but that\u2019s all your disorder talking. As you keep pushing through, the work becomes habit. You start realizing \u201cit\u2019s been x amount of days since I\u2019ve thought about xyz\u201d, and sometimes those thoughts want to make you spiral, and sometimes those thoughts feel like new badges of honor. As you start restoring your body and seeing all the things you\u2019re capable of again, those become your goals and victories. \n\nAnd it sounds stupid, but practicing self love changes your fucking life. Not just taking baths and mental health days, but again, putting in the work. I would sit in front of the mirror and smile just to trick my brain, I started working on healing my inner child, I started figuring out what clothes make me feel good and what style I really like and how I really want to exist in the world for only me, not the sick part of my brain.

It\u2019s bullshit. It\u2019s all a lie and I am just ready to live. I am ready for the jump. Sure, it may be unknown and sure it may be scary, but I\u2019m ready to let go.
