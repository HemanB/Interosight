  "title": "Whenever someone says they haven't eaten in x amount of time",
  "selftext": "It really triggers me whenever someone says they haven't eaten in X amount of time. It doesn't matter if it's a disordered or non-disordered person saying it, or what their reason is. Sometimes non-disordered people are like \"Omg I'm so busy, I forgot to eat! I haven't eaten all day!\" or maybe their reason for not eating is more intentional like \"I'm doing this water fast and I haven't eaten in x amount of hours/days.\" Other times it's a person with an ED being like \"I haven't eaten in x days/weeks.\" Both of these are so triggering to me, I almost feel jealous when people say shit like this, even though I know I shouldn't. Even when my ED was at its worst, I never went a full day without eating, let alone multiple days or weeks. It makes me feel like my ED wasn't real or valid, and also I beat myself up for not having the \"discipline\" for being able to go for that long without food.\n\nI guess this kind of goes without saying, but on a somewhat related note, I also get triggered/jealous when someone says their weight and it's lower than mine, regardless of whether they have an ED or not. It's like, if they have an ED and their weight is that low, I feel like they're \"better at\" their ED than me. If they don't have an ED and they're just \"naturally skinny\" then I envy them for being able to maintain that weight without even trying, yet I still feel like maybe they just intrinsically have more discipline/self-control than me. \n\nI'm supposedly \"in recovery\" now (it's been rough tho), and idk how to NOT get triggered by this stuff... idk if I'm looking for advice or just wanted to rant, but if you have any advice that \\*actually\\* works, feel free to share",
