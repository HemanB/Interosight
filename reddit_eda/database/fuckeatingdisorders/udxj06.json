  "selftext": "Cannot believe this is really happening but something just snapped in me and I realised I can\u2019t only half commit to recovery. Thanks to all the lovely people on here for all the supportive messages! Seeing everyone elses recovery wins pushed me into this. Im going out for a meal tonight and Im terrified but ready to push myself. Might get a safer option like a pad thai or might really push myself to get a vegan burger! Never thought I would do this im so anxious but so ready to kick my ED in the bin. Dont want my life to revolve around my food and body anymore!!! I love seeing everyone who is fighting this and sharing their progress :)\n\nupdate: i had a burger and chips! and mayo! like all my fear foods and i just went fuck it if i wait till im ready ill never be ready. and nothing bad happened so i know i can do it again. the discomfort and guilt is worth it to be push through and be free of this disease.",
