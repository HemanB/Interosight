  "title": "I eat a lot yesterday at Christmas eve. I'm ALSO gonna eat a lot today at Christmas.",
  "selftext": "I definitely ate wayyyyy over my \"limit\". And when I say way over I don't just mean that I had a couple cookies. I mean actually WAY over. And yes my ED is screaming at me. But whatever. Once you actually commit to not listening to it, it's surprisingly easy to just carry on eating.\n\nI don't know what's gonna happen in the next few days. I'm very likely gonna freak out no later than next week over the infinite weight gain that just happened and all the bloat and the protruding belly and I'll feel horrible as ever. But you know what? Food has actually made me much more relaxed than when I restrict - it's like my body is saying \"oh thank God, there's some fucking food finally\".\n\nYesterday was a nice day with my family and loads of delicious foods and today is gonna be the same.\n\n*sorry for the typo in the title, it's \"I ate a lot yesterday\"",
