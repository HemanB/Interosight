  "title": "\"Eat properly and eat sensibly\"",
  "selftext": "I've been trying to eat unrestricted recently and my mum is literally stopping me. \n\nI've told her the idea, what I want to do, how I believe it's the only way to fully recovery. She was never 100% onboard, projecting her own insecurities onto my recovery (\"if I did that I would just eat crisps all day\"- I explained that that's only because you restrict that food) and even though I never wanted her to do it, it was for me,  she for some reason kept making it about herself (\"oh i would never want to do that\"). \n\nI just spoke to my brother about it and he agrees that she projects her diet into the rest of the house hold. We can only have a small lunch, you can't snack (unless she is). \n\nI told her I need to be able to eat what I want to recover, she said that's fine. It started of well. I was trying lots of new stuff. But now she's refusing to buy snack food like biscuits or crisps because she \"doesn't like having them in the cupboard\". \n\nToday she just broke and refused to let me have pancakes for breakfast (which was a huge thing in my recovery  for me even to ask) and said I need to \"eat properly and eat sensibly\" . So....restrict? Thanks mum. \n\nShe's more disordered than me at this point but insists her way of eating should be how everyone eats. \n\nI cant recover if I can't eat unrestricted/ intuitively and my mum is literally forbidding it!",

I tried to buy Lucky Charms cereal once early in recovery while shopping with her, and she refused to pay for it and said if I wanted to buy it myself I\u2019d have to hide it in my closet. After two years of me cycling through treatment, family therapy, and plenty of recommendations from people, I\u2019m happy to say she finally got around to reading \u201cIntuitive Eating\u201d and is now on her way to healing her own relationship with food. I talked to her for an hour on the phone earlier today about how shitty diet culture is! That would never have happened 3 years ago! I\u2019m hoping your mom will come around at some point too, I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with her projecting her diet mentality onto you!",

One of the first lessons I learned in my class was from a woman who was an eating disorder therapist, and she essentially said the most successful way a person\u2019s recovery can go is if everyone in the person\u2019s family attends family counseling together. Behaviors don\u2019t manifest out of nowhere, and environment is such a important factor in mental health. Please don\u2019t be too hard on yourself for struggling, it is 100% normal for things to be difficult right now & it\u2019s something to be proud of that you\u2019re working and making progress.",
