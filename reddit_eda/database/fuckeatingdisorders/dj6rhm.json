  "selftext": "I have coworkers who are into Diet Culture.  Whole30, unhealthy juice cleanses, obsessing over 5 pounds, complimenting skinny people on their skinniness, it's all they talk about *every day for years.*   One has catch phrase \"I love you like a fat kid loves cake\"  and is incredibly immature, vain and vapid.  It's a buzz kill when there's free pizza or donuts and they bitch about it messing up their diets.  I mostly say \"no thanks\" to treats, but their obnoxious whining makes my own \"no\" feel harder.\n\nOne of them has a chubby tween daughter and it breaks my heart to hear her brag about hounding her about food.  Encouraging healthfulness would be great, but what she's doing isn't that.\n\nA different co-worker gained extra weight during her pregnancy, and today I overheard the Dieters talking about her and how \"uncomfortable\" she is with her overweight body *according to them.*  Dieter says, \"I, of all people, do not care that she gained weight, she does not need to be so awkward around me.\".  The conversation ended with them patting themselves on the back for being \"so nice\" to Overweight Mama.",

Living in Diet Culture can make it so very hard to stick to our recovery/antidiet guns, so to speak.

I have actually told my boss some of the more stupid shit she has said and work wise she literally does nothing all day except take personal calls and watch sit and be fit videos. I did her \"job\" aka getting the mail and making copies when I was a clerk before they brought her on. It's no secret that she is completely incompetent. I don't even ask her to make copies of things bc like 75% of the time it is done wrong. But she is union and we are not, technically she doesn't even report to my boss. My boss is the true root of a lot of the problems tbh but we are all kind of stuck on this front.",

          "body": "Ohh man. Today a group of women were in the bathroom weighing themselves, apparently they are in a weight loss club or something, and saying their weights out loud. I have a serious like addiction to the scale, would love (hate) nothing more than to get on and off the scale 100x a day if left to my own devices.\n\nMy other coworker has food shamed me for years, when I started as a clerk and was 22 I had a sandwich from a chain and in front of all the other attys goes, do you know how many weight watchers points are in those?? Like are you for real. I was also on the low end of normal bmi then just to point out how even more ridiculous it is. I've been putting up with her food comments for almost 10 years, just today had to hear about how good it is this place released mini sandwiches bc no one needs to eat a full size sandwich from Jimmy John's (I used to eat there all the time and eat the chips too just for lunch, I have not eaten in front of them other than at our yearly holiday party in years). \n\nMy secretary tisks literally every time I eat anything at my desk, when I was pregnant she was constantly tisking and sniffing it was maddening.\n\nMy boss today told me well haven't we all taken lax to lose weight? I wanted to be like actually I took a combo of lax, diet pills and water pills from ages 16-22 and ended up almost having to go to the hospital. I am still sneaking stool softeners bc that is \"better\" than stimulant lax in my mind. So yeah sure. \n\nIdk it is my own problems and thin skin, I can't expect people to cater to my mental illness. But I have never in 31 years commented on what someone is eating, or pointed out weight loss or gain. And guess what it is not hard to do!! Just keep your mouth shut!! Like who. Cares.",
