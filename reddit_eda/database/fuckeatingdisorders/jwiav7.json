  "selftext": "Yesterday I weighed myself for the first time in weeks because I wanted to know how I was doing. Well, I gained some weight. Before this would've sent me into a spiral, but I just honestly didn't care that much.\n\nI ate three meals and a bunch of snacks and had dessert, and I'm going to do the same thing today. I'm not going to work out today, and I'm just going to enjoy the rest and get some other stuff done.\n\nI'm starting to realize that how I feel about my body has nothing to do with how much I weigh. I gained weight but I looked at myself in the mirror today and I thought I looked great.\n\nI still have work to do, but I'm going to keep going and I'm going to beat this completely. I'm going to keep eating because I know it's what's good for me and my future, and I know it's going to get even better soon.",
