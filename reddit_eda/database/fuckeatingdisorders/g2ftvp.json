  "selftext": "I\u2019m in quasi/self recovery. It\u2019s been about a month and a 5-6lb weight gain after absolutely uncontrollable extreme hunger (see my post history). \n\nWho knew I actually didn\u2019t have a \u201cnever satiated\u201d problem, but I was just fucking starved? \n\nTabitha Farrar states, \u201cyou cant ignore your hunger forever just like how you can\u2019t ignore your need to pee.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s common sense but I could never accept the truth. Like no shit, you\u2019re thinking about food, recipes, and looking up restaurant photos on yelp every second I could. I thought i was just being a fatass but my brain was just sending me signals to fucking eat!\n\nI couldn\u2019t focus on my work (I\u2019m a graphic designer) because I was sneaking on my phone looking for low calorie recipes on Pinterest. My work started looking lazy. Now that I\u2019m not thinking of food all fucking day, I have energy to put towards my creativity. This is a big one.\n\nI\u2019m not having secret mini night binges while my husband takes his shower because I\u2019m so hungry.\n\nMy hunger and fullness cues have started to come back. Yesterday I was getting full during the middle of my lunch (sweet potato, brocolli, chicken) and I swear I haven\u2019t felt that way in years that it was so foreign. Usually I\u2019d finish my meal, then think of what I could have next and after that. \n\nI know I still have a lot of work to do, but for now I\u2019m reminding myself of these things and holding myself accountable if I ever have doubts.\n\nI don\u2019t want to live that way in 10, 20, 30 years from now. I don\u2019t want to isolate myself from friends anymore. I don\u2019t want to rob the remaining years of my 20\u2019s anymore when this is supposed to be one of the best years of my life.\n\nWhen this quarantine is over, I\u2019m hitting up all my friends that I keep bailing out on to go and eat some food and have some fun. Bless my friends who still want to hang out even though I\u2019ve made excuses to not go when it revolved food.\n\nI don\u2019t want to look back in my life at how \u201cskinny\u201d i was in exchange for having a sad life that consisted of counting calories, staying home and missing out on events because I didn\u2019t want to eat, not making meaningful connections with people, etc.\n\nI want to be that spontaneous girl who doesn\u2019t give af about what she ate during the day and will still go out when her friends ask her to grab drinks at night. I want to have nights to remember like I did before my ED fucked me up. I want to have energy to put worth in my passions and work. I want to be able to have a nice date night for once with my husband at an Italian restaurant and eat one of my greatest fear foods but also one of the foods I love, pasta and garlic bread. Or just get pizza and eat it at 9pm with him while watching Netflix. I don\u2019t want to only put my worth on how skinny I am because what a sad life that is when that\u2019s all I\u2019ve got when I reach 50. Fuck anorexia.",

Who cares about this stupid shit. I\u2019m realizing all the time I\u2019ve wasted. Part of it also for me was feeling that I looked okay and then seeing that I weighed more than I wanted to and thinking what a scam that is. Isn\u2019t it great to just eat \u201c\u201d\u201dbad\u201d\u201d\u201d foods like everyone else and not flip the hell out the whole time? I still struggle but for now I\u2019m just letting myself have it if I want it and the obsessive thoughts fade more and more everyday and so does my constant insatiable hunger. Amazing how that works isnt it, lol.",

Obviously you're the best judge of your own situation but what you've described sounds like you're putting hard work into your recovery and aren't settling for quasi. You deserve a full recovery.",

      "body": "Honestly I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s success yet because I\u2019m still weighing myself and still care about body image. Maybe when I get to that point where those things don\u2019t control me then I\u2019ll feel partially successful.\n\nI think if you\u2019re already considering about recovering then you\u2019re already doing better. Some people say that \u201cquasi/self recovery isn\u2019t a real recovery\u201d which kept me putting off recovery for a long time, but honestly, fuck that shit. Watch Tabitha farrar\u2019s video on self recovering. She states that it was the best thing to do FOR HERSELF because she\u2019s always been the type to do challenging/hard things on her own. And I could relate so much to that because I do so much on my own as well and have always preferred it that way.\n\nI guess I\u2019m just taking it day by day, listening to my hunger and fullness cues and trying to regulate it. \n\nI think if you\u2019re eating more and not compensating for it (restricting, purging, exercise purging, etc), that\u2019s already a huge step and I\u2019d say that\u2019s already doing better. Although I\u2019d be cautious to set guidelines as to what is \u201cdoing better\u201d because what happens when you \u201cdo worse\u201d one day? Will you let that stop you, go back to restricting, etc? \n\nRight now I\u2018ve been reintroducing fear foods everyday, hardly counting cals, not compensating for it and I think those are small steps but also going on the right path. Everyone\u2019s different and some people need to take it slowly, some can just go all-in, but as long as you\u2019re trying then you\u2019re already doing better, in my opinion. I was surviving off the same 5 safe foods everyday for years, then would binge on some weekends with \u201cbad\u201d foods, then go back... such a horrible cycle. My main goals right now is reintroducing all types of food back in my life, little by little everyday, trying to let my body know that food isn\u2019t scarce anymore. It\u2019s a hard, hard process but the life I was living before was not worth it at all.\n\nYou\u2019ve shown that you\u2019re already courageous enough to try recovery and I wish you the best success \u2763\ufe0f pls feel free to PM me.",
