  "selftext": "This is not a post we wanted to have to make, but we really need to talk about the levels of hostility towards us a mod team we have been receiving lately.\n\nIf you have questions about a rule/why your post was removed then you can just ask us, kindly and respectfully. We are always willing to clarify our decisions, and help you repost in a way that adheres to our rules.\n\nIf we\u2019ve made a post/comment you disagree with you can bring that up to us, kindly and respectfully.\n\nWe have a very large community and as such we have rules designed to keep everyone safe. You need to follow the rules even if you don\u2019t see the point of them, this is becoming particularly ridiculous with the no weight numbers rule. I don\u2019t care if you said \u2018TW\u2019 at the top of your post, I don\u2019t care if you put a spoiler bar over it, \ud83d\udc4fstop\ud83d\udc4fposting\ud83d\udc4fyour\ud83d\udc4fgoddamn\ud83d\udc4fweight\ud83d\udc4f. We will be starting to issue temp bans for violating this rule as it\u2019s becoming egregious. \n\nWe also attract a lot of vile trolls due to both the size and nature of our sub, as such we have spam filters in place to auto-remove comments from new accounts. This is for everyone\u2019s safety, and that trumps the convenience of having your comments approved immediately, just report the bot reply and we will approve your comment as soon as we can.\n\nWe understand that eating disorders are frustrating as all hell, but we aren\u2019t your punching bags on which you can take out that frustration. We are only 3 mods for a community 35,000 strong. We simply can\u2019t see everything in this sub immediately, and we really need you to be patient with us.\n\nIt\u2019s disappointing to have to remind people of this, but we\u2019re human, and we\u2019re also recovering from an eating disorder just the same as all of you. All we ask is that you treat us with kindness, respect, and patience. We don\u2019t deserve to be insulted for having lives outside the sub (unless y\u2019all wanna start paying us lmao), we don\u2019t deserve to be blamed for your mental health, we don\u2019t deserve to be blamed for your relapse, we don\u2019t deserve dedicated hate posts about us, we don\u2019t deserve death threats. We are striving to create a safe, welcoming community for everyone, not a safe, welcoming community for everyone *except* the mod team.",

Posts are subject to moderators\u2019 discretion, and while you don\u2019t have to like it you do have to adhere to *that* rule as well as we all have different viewpoints on what breaks a rule here.\n\n2. We, the only three active mods on this sub, have lives outside of Reddit and do not owe you a response in a given timeframe. We are busy, and yet we do this for free, with zero expectations of acknowledgement outside of basically human decency. If we didn\u2019t respond when you wanted us to then idk what to tell you other than to be patience and/or shoot us another message in modmail. We have 35k members and growing\u2014sometimes it takes us several hours, or even days, to see something.\n\n3. You clearly just want to be mad and while you have a right to your feelings, you don\u2019t actually want a discussion so we will not be engaging in this.
