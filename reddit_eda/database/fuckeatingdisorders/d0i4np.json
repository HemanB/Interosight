It was hard enough convincing myself to eat when i was hungry, but when I\u2019m not it felt even worse.  Well, the most effective step in changing that was getting a proper sleep routine.  This also balanced my mood and helped with the depression.  I\u2019ve had more productive days and feel better.  I get up at 7 and I wasn\u2019t hungry straight away, but i do get hungry after about an hour and a half so now i have breakfast around 8:30, and doing this every day i now have hunger cues for it and am beginning to enjoy breakfast.  Some days it\u2019s still hard but perseverance has helped.\n\nAs for fullness, i eat what I\u2019m comfortable with.  For a few weeks, I couldn\u2019t finish the big meals my nan made me on Sundays, but i did my best and stopped when I felt full.  No point in going past that point and risk purging.  Sometimes i needed a break because anxiety, then I\u2019d eat a little more, but I finished when i was ready.  Over time i felt hungry enough and not so anxious so ate more and more.  Now I finish my meals no problem. \n\nThe biggest help has been keeping accountable to my Priest who I trust completely and helped me to stop purging and start eating 3 meals a day with Fatherly guidance, love and support.",
