  "selftext": "(TW for calorie numbers)\n\nIn January I decided to recover, gave in to extreme hunger, ate about 8000-10000 calories a day for some time, and now I\u2019m maintaining a weight above my pre-ED weight on >!4,000-5,000!< calories.\n\nBUT. The TDEE calculators tell me I need about >!2,000!< since I\u2019m completely sedentary. Instead of triggering me, I find it funny. How can it be so wrong? Wtf weird calculations does it do that so deeply misunderstand human bodies? \n\nYeah, I know my body needs more energy than bodies that haven\u2019t been through an eating disorder, but even my pre ED TDEE was about >!3000!<, not >!2000!<. Fitness people I used to watch said \u00abevery body is different\u00bb but I don\u2019t think they meant there could be a variation of >!1000-3000!< calories between what TDEE calculators say and what your genuine metabolism is. It\u2019s all bullshit. \n\nHunger cues really do exist for a reason, I\u2019ve only begun to realise recently.",

This is also assuming your BMR is that of a rough population average, but that varies by 100-300kcals in the *general* population, and well, most of the general population don't acquire a prolonged starvation hobby. \n\nPeople tend to think the calculators are accurate because normies *suck* at tracking their calories. They'll track one day (poorly), see that it roughly coincides with what they \"should\" be eating, and then go back to how they *actually* eat. If someone says they eat 1900kcals a day, I assume they're tracking 1900, eating 2100-2300+, and occasionally having a \"cheat day\" that brings their average to a MINIMUM of 2400. Probably more. People with ED history tend to track more accurately, so we think we're eating *sooooo much* to maintain our weights, when in reality, we're just eating normal kcals, probably unintentionally higher-volume foods and fewer liquid kcals, moving a bit more b.c. there's neuroscience suggesting restrictive EDs can mess with the pathways that govern NEAT even *before* you add movement compulsions, and we've lost the privilege of eating without being painfully aware of *what* we've eaten.",

I also used to see a lot of infographics that would have the words \u00ab\u00a0Think you\u2019re eating >!1200!< calories but not losing any weight?\u00a0\u00bb at the top then list a bunch of things like the calories in coffee creamer, biscuits, just basically foods that intuitive eaters wouldn\u2019t notice themselves consuming throughout the day. But like. I\u2019m pretty sure that just because someone is at a higher weight does not mean they\u2019re incapable of tracking accurately and it\u2019s quite fucking patronising to assume they are?? Maybe a literal starvation diet has simply forced their metabolism to do its literal job by conserving energy to save them if there\u2019s a famine? It\u2019s infuriating. \n\nI get your point about the calculators being used to fuel athletes, some people find eating to be a chore especially when they need to do so much of it in a day. but I feel that calculators still tend to underestimate. They underestimate my maintenance calories even when I set myself as \u00ab\u00a0highly active\u00a0\u00bb and I\u2019m sedentary. My brother is active ie he lifts weights and wants to\u00a0\u00ab bulk up\u00a0\u00bb and when I was underweight I was his \u00ab\u00a0dietician\u00a0\u00bb (just an excuse to be around food lol) and had him on >!2500!< a day, but an experiment taught us that he only gains on >!4000!< a day. That\u2019s only anecdotal of course and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a special case but I\u2019m skeptical about those calculators\u2019 abilities even to estimate an accurate amount of necessary calories even in cases where that knowledge has a non-weight loss related purpose.\n\nWow, I can imagine diet subs\u2019 reaction to learning about NEAT hahahaha. My instinct when I found out was to check Google to find out what mine was, and according to Mr Calorie Calculator it was... 17 calories a day. Tbh at that point I was deep in my restriction, hardly leaving the house anymore because going outside made me so cold and miserable so probably my NEET, physical activity, thermic effect of food, and BMR were all not burning many cals but to that extent? \n\n100% yes to your last paragraph too. It really upsets me that people are willing to give up their lives and wellbeing to be thinner especially since we all know it doesn\u2019t bring happiness\u2014 and body image is mental anyways.",

I\u2019d keep seeing people post about how they aren\u2019t losing weight on a veeeeerryyy small number of calories despite \u201cmeticulous\u201d tracking (in quotes because who knows?? People on that sub border disordered eating aaaallllll the time, so it is very likely they really are tracking well), and everybody piling on about how they need to cut more because if they aren\u2019t losing weight, it\u2019s because their starvation diet isn\u2019t extreme enough.\n\nI looked at those and rolled my eyes.\n\nSomebody else was terrified bc they were losing more weight than expected and worried it was a scary health thing. College student that walks everywhere. DUDE YOU ARE NOT SEDENTARY STOP FUELING YOURSELF LIKE YOU ARE.\n\nPeople also freaked out when I told them about a concept called non-exercise activity thermogenesis- you know, like all the things we do day to day like walk to our car or put groceries away or getting dressed or even *fidgeting.* I realized I was getting too emotionally invested in the discussion as soon as I commented a second time and that was the point where I just cut ties with the sub finally.\n\nI think calculators like this can have some utility- estimating fueling needs for top level athletes because often hunger cues aren\u2019t sufficient to get enough energy or deciding when to suspect certain medical conditions, for instance- but the instance that 5-10 lbs is somehow a \u201cbig deal\u201d that people \u201cneed\u201d to pay attention to and track calories?

We spent a week taking about \u201cobesity and obesity related diseases\u201d and one of our discussion questions was \u201chow do you see your role in obesity management?\u201d We were reading about NEAT- including in some cases people who were realistically burning several hundred calories in NEAT daily. Talking about \u201clittle fixes\u201d etc. My answer that the instructor didn\u2019t expect? \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d I spent the entire discussion post pointing out why it\u2019s not my job, ever, unless I am a person\u2019s physician to discuss somebody\u2019s weight, and that instead of focusing on weight, my place is in motivating others to treat themselves with love.\n\nThat was a fun week.\n\n**TRIGGER WARNING: Calories/ numbers** (I should really learn how to do spoilers).\n\nThe big issue with the calculators is that they provide a rough estimate. I said this in another post, but like, if you take the Harris Benedict equation for a *well nourished* individual, the number it spits out isn\u2019t even that accurate for most people. Let\u2019s say the calculator spits out some BS like 1500. This means that we are about 95% confident that the person\u2019s \u201ctrue\u201d BMR is within 1290-1710. \n\nNow let\u2019s look at PAL. If you\u2019re very active- perhaps two hours of vigorous exercise a day- it\u2019s somewhere between 2-2.4.\n\nWhat\u2019s the total range now? 2,580 to... wait for it... 4,104.\n\nLet that just sink in. Over 1500 difference.\n\nWe also don\u2019t absorb all the energy that we eat. Calories are also not perfect 4/4/9 per gram. Everything is an estimate. Literally everything.\n\nI see people on those subs run for an hour (oh hey vigorous exercise), lift heavy weights for an hour (uh... also vigorous??), and then they\u2019re complaining of exhaustion but \u201ccan\u2019t be eating too little\u201d because they \u201ceat more than their BMR\u201d (per the calculator) and like... the sub\u2019s advice \u201cyou aren\u2019t eating enough protein.\u201d Despite more often then not adequate protein intake but severely limited carb intake and thus they aren\u2019t refueling their glycogen appropriately to fuel that amount of exercise.\n\nAnd ugh, some even have a big \u201cthere no such thing as starvation mode\u201d thing in their \u201cabout\u201d or FAQ sections. A 2014 review in the Journal of International Society of Sports Nutrition basically says why that\u2019s BS. There are actual, measurable changes in energy expenditure not simply related to change in weight\n\nhttps://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1550-2783-11-7\n\nThis was 7 years ago so I\u2019ll have to look into specifics for now, but EVEN SEVEN YEARS AGO WE HAD AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE MOLECULAR CHANGES IN CHRONIC ENERGY RESTRICTION THAT AFFECT METABOLISM.\n\nNo, eating a little less here and there naturally isn\u2019t gonna kick your body into \u201cstarvation mode,\u201d but *long term energy restriction, even if you think it\u2019s \u201csafe because it\u2019s above your BMR!!\u201d changes your body\u2019s metabolic processing* which is essentially what \u201cstarvation mode\u201d is.\n\nSO. MUCH. RAGE.",

          "body": "Idk why, but until recently I was subbed to a certain weight loss sub that is very popular. I\u2019d keep seeing people post about how they aren\u2019t losing weight on a veeeeerryyy small number of calories despite \u201cmeticulous\u201d tracking (in quotes because who knows?? People on that sub border disordered eating aaaallllll the time, so it is very likely they really are tracking well), and everybody piling on about how they need to cut more because if they aren\u2019t losing weight, it\u2019s because their starvation diet isn\u2019t extreme enough.\n\nI looked at those and rolled my eyes.\n\nSomebody else was terrified bc they were losing more weight than expected and worried it was a scary health thing. College student that walks everywhere. DUDE YOU ARE NOT SEDENTARY STOP FUELING YOURSELF LIKE YOU ARE.\n\nPeople also freaked out when I told them about a concept called non-exercise activity thermogenesis- you know, like all the things we do day to day like walk to our car or put groceries away or getting dressed or even *fidgeting.* I realized I was getting too emotionally invested in the discussion as soon as I commented a second time and that was the point where I just cut ties with the sub finally.\n\nI think calculators like this can have some utility- estimating fueling needs for top level athletes because often hunger cues aren\u2019t sufficient to get enough energy or deciding when to suspect certain medical conditions, for instance- but the instance that 5-10 lbs is somehow a \u201cbig deal\u201d that people \u201cneed\u201d to pay attention to and track calories? Nope. If you\u2019re living a way that you feel physically and emotionally healthy living, your body is fine. Full stop.",

          "body": "Oh lord, the disordered eating on other subs, don\u2019t get me started. I also used to see a lot of infographics that would have the words \u00ab\u00a0Think you\u2019re eating >!1200!< calories but not losing any weight?\u00a0\u00bb at the top then list a bunch of things like the calories in coffee creamer, biscuits, just basically foods that intuitive eaters wouldn\u2019t notice themselves consuming throughout the day. But like. I\u2019m pretty sure that just because someone is at a higher weight does not mean they\u2019re incapable of tracking accurately and it\u2019s quite fucking patronising to assume they are?? Maybe a literal starvation diet has simply forced their metabolism to do its literal job by conserving energy to save them if there\u2019s a famine? It\u2019s infuriating. \n\nI get your point about the calculators being used to fuel athletes, some people find eating to be a chore especially when they need to do so much of it in a day. but I feel that calculators still tend to underestimate. They underestimate my maintenance calories even when I set myself as \u00ab\u00a0highly active\u00a0\u00bb and I\u2019m sedentary. My brother is active ie he lifts weights and wants to\u00a0\u00ab bulk up\u00a0\u00bb and when I was underweight I was his \u00ab\u00a0dietician\u00a0\u00bb (just an excuse to be around food lol) and had him on >!2500!< a day, but an experiment taught us that he only gains on >!4000!< a day. That\u2019s only anecdotal of course and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a special case but I\u2019m skeptical about those calculators\u2019 abilities even to estimate an accurate amount of necessary calories even in cases where that knowledge has a non-weight loss related purpose.\n\nWow, I can imagine diet subs\u2019 reaction to learning about NEAT hahahaha. My instinct when I found out was to check Google to find out what mine was, and according to Mr Calorie Calculator it was... 17 calories a day. Tbh at that point I was deep in my restriction, hardly leaving the house anymore because going outside made me so cold and miserable so probably my NEET, physical activity, thermic effect of food, and BMR were all not burning many cals but to that extent? \n\n100% yes to your last paragraph too. It really upsets me that people are willing to give up their lives and wellbeing to be thinner especially since we all know it doesn\u2019t bring happiness\u2014 and body image is mental anyways.",
