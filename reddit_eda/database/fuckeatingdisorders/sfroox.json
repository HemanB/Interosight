  "title": "Fuck people casually mentioning that they starve themselves",
  "selftext": "I had an experience today where a mutual friend (we just met today) was discussing how she didn't like a certain food and said \"I'd rather starve, but I already do that anyway hehe\" and then saying \"Wowwww this is the most I've eaten in days. This is more food than I've had total over the past 3 days!\"\n\nI understand if she is personally struggling with an ED and I totally sympathize. However, I feel like eating disorders/disordered behaviors shouldn't be casually discussed in that way. It feels borderline braggy the way she said it, whether she intended that or not. I grew up with my mom talking in the same way, and I'm pretty sure that has a LOT to do with the development of my disordered eating habits. After she said that, my friend & I were shocked (we weren't expecting that at all) and asked if she was okay, wanted to talk about it, etc, but she kept saying she was fine. I made an excuse to leave after that because I honestly was quite triggered. I've been doing very well lately and hearing someone *say* those words outloud was shocking. \n\nI'm all for discussions about EDs, talking about the struggles, accomplishments, etc. can be very helpful for some people. If someone asks for help, I will do what is within my means to help. But saying you starve yourself in such a lighthearted, \"haha\" way and then saying you're fine just really rubs me the wrong way, especially when you say it around people you've just met. Like I wouldn't say that to a stranger/acquaintance. \n\nAgain, I sympathize if she is struggling but god you can't just say \"I starve myself hehehe\" around people you've just met. Even if it's a cry for help, it feels inappropriate to put that on a stranger/acquaintance. This is all just my opinion of course, and I know I'm responsible for my own triggers, but it just really threw me for a loop hearing someone say that. Definitely wasn't expecting it.",

I understand that it's a way of asking for help & struggle with an ED myself, which is why I have sympathy for her, but I truly was thrown for a loop and admittedly triggered by her laughing about starving herself. (I also just met her, so I didn't consider asking for help as an initial possibility as much as I would with a close friend, if that makes sense. I look out for that much more with my close friends & family.) My friend and I became concerned, she refused and kept saying she was fine, so I politely excused myself. I excused myself for the sake of my own mental health and just said I was going to the bathroom. I never confronted her. \n\nI am not disgusted by her at all because I know how it feels. But I did feel like it was inappropriate to just *say*, even if it was a way of asking for help. That is simply my opinion, and if you don't feel like it was inappropriate then you are in your own right to have that opinion. I respect your opinions. \n\nShe is basically a stranger to me, so randomly saying she starves herself and then laughing about it was not something I was expecting, and I wouldn't expect a stranger to ask for help from me about their eating disorder.\n\n// I edited this for the sake of clarification",

If she does it again I'll use that. \n\nI told my friend to ask her to cut it out and he said \"oh she eats, don't worry\" like you missed the point there bud, eating disorders aren't a joke so she needs to stop treating them like one. She said she'd be more \"careful\" around me specifically, although that still doesn't solve the root problem, which is her basically making light of disordered eating to begin with. \n\nNext time any of my friends laugh about suicide/EDs/self harm/etc I'll definitely use that technique.",

I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re struggling with it or if you think it\u2019s popular or something, but you gotta find better comedy skills or coping skills, because it\u2019s making other people uncomfortable and confused.\u201d\n\nI actually find myself doing this in the psych ward, of all places, because I know I don\u2019t look or feel like I\u2019m in the middle of a relapse.

The resource scarcity in an ED is artificial but the body doesn't know that, and so your brain has to make sense of the signals your body is sending around competing for food and filtering it through your disordered wishes and desires (which for some may be notions of beauty through achieving thinness). It's a great question, though, honestly, and who knows",
