  "title": "The amount of \u2018I\u2019m no longer attracted to my spouse/partner because of her/his weight gain\u2019 posts is triggering and infuriating AF",
  "selftext": "Tw: talk of fatphobia and should mention I am not yet in recovery. This is a vent.\n\nI see copious posts like this in the Marriage and RelationshipAdvice subreddits. The OP *always* mentions loss of attraction and not even being able to look at their own fucking spouse and always asks \u2018how to point out that their spouse has gained weight.\u2019 They always make sure to include that their wife/sometimes husband looked \u201camazing and fit/like a supermodel\u201d and was really into going to the gym/eating healthy until it suddenly all goes to shit. But how should you point it out? Literally fucking don\u2019t. \n\nI\u2019m sure the person you are with is well aware of their weight gain and having to deal with the crippling realization that their spouse is no longer attracted to them would probably be enough to lead to a full blown eating disorder, if they didn\u2019t already have one. \n\nMy abusive ex constantly made comments about my weight (I was always at a very healthy BMI) and compared my body to the bodies of other women. But he would constantly tell me how \u201cperfect\u201d I would be if I just lost ten pounds, putting me in the closer to UW category. Looking back on it now, he was without question fetishizing anorexic body types. He is precisely what led me to developing a full blown eating disorder that I can\u2019t shake a decade later. \n\nAnd the comments in these posts are LOADED with fatphobia and toxic diet culture, like \u2018suggest meal planning healthier meals, exercising together/getting a gym membership.\u2019 \u2018Maybe it\u2019s a mental health issue/binge eating.\u2019 And there are always even worse comments like, \u2018you\u2019re still young and haven\u2019t been married long. You should get out while you can.\u2019 \u2018Your spouse let themselves go and you deserve to be with someone who will take care of themselves and their \u2728helth\u2728.\u2019 Fuck that.\n\nPeople would literally suggest to leave the person someone vowed to spend the rest of their life with over FUCKING WEIGHT GAIN. Like, are you serious? I have a feeling these subreddits are full of awful cis white heterosexual males who think women NATURALLY look like supermodels. It is a full fucking time JOB to look anything remotely close to that. It is an illness. It is exhausting. \n\nAnd bodies are SUPPOSED to change. But how can I ever recover when this is how people view weight gain? I am incredibly fortunate to have found my husband who has never made me feel like these men. In fact, he always finds me most attractive when I feel like I look like a hot mess (sweatpants, hair in utter disarray, no makeup, etc.). He has never expected me to look a certain way/pressured me to be thin. But it\u2019s terrifying. I am doing my best to challenge my own internalized fatphobia which I do still struggle with. And these posts get me so HEATED.",

Reddit is still a very male, heteronormative, regressive place even if there are lovely pockets of community and acceptance within (like this subreddit!). I\u2019ll sometimes mention similar feelings about stuff I\u2019ve seen on Reddit being triggering to my bf and he kindly reminds me that the people who gather on Reddit tend towards a certain set of beliefs that do suck but also aren\u2019t the ONLY set of beliefs out there. Your feelings and frustration are valid but I promise you it could be helpful to mindfully disengage with those kinds of posts by unfollowing the subreddit or whatever. When you read a lot of the same stuff - that weight gain in a partner made someone fall out of love, for example - it\u2019s easy to imagine that those same thought patterns are everywhere, in everyone you encounter! But of course logically we know that can\u2019t be the case because there are so many other variables that drive how people think out in the non-internet world.  So!

She sounded like a super bitch and was really mean about it. \n\nEveryone basically attacked him for being gross and gaining so much weight. \n\nI was like- um. Wtf. This is disgusting. And people came at me for defending this poor guy. \n\nAll I was even saying was like- your fianc\u00e9 should be encouraging you and supporting you, not cutting you down. She should\u2019ve talked to you in a delicate way and been like \u2018hey, I love you and want you to be healthy, and I was thinking, what if we joined a gym? Or a softball league together? Or took a cooking class?\u2019 Or just started cooking healthy meals. Or started asking him to go hiking or something. \n\nInstead she just came for him and told him he was gross.

While I was stoked to be with someone who got me like nobody else, my behaviors intensified over that first year of our relationship. I was terrified of ever allowing my body to change because what if he found me disgusting and lost all attraction for me? What if he found someone who looked better than me? What if, what if, what if.\n\nIronically, when I broke down and opened up about my ED, he was super supportive and I don\u2019t think I would have been able to recover at the time if he wasn\u2019t so open minded and encouraged me throughout my extreme hunger and weight gain. I am the heaviest I have ever been in my life and my relationship with this individual has improved tenfold\u2014which is the exact opposite of what I had seen, heard, and read about. Obviously not all relationships will turn out like mine, but honestly that\u2019s the sad part. Everyone deserves that kind of support and to feel loved at any weight. Because if your love can\u2019t change and adapt with each others\u2019 bodies, then do you *really* fucking love that person? Is it really fucking love if you are willing to throw away an entire relationship because your partner gained fucking weight?

If it's not possible for a couple to reach a compromise around a certain issue then I don't think it's a good idea to stick with it for the sake of it. I believe happiness for both people, even separately, is better than trying to force it. I do believe the content of the communication around this, as with anything in a relationship, needs to be appropriate ie. supportive and loving rather than hateful or combatitive.\n\nI have been in abusive relationships. They make the choice to be an arsehole and I make the choice to leave somebody who is being shallow, cruel, controlling or manipulative about my body or whatever else. \n\nIf anything, for my personal preferences, the person has kinda done me a favour if they leave me first! I'm not compatible with them and that's cool. Some people do value a certain body type, aesthetic or whatever, and that's fine. Each to their own. I know I feel more sensitive about this particular issue as it relates to my body image and yet I wouldn't allow that to make me think that nobody is attracted to me.

That shit can really help people in similar situations.\n\nHot take tho:\n\nA lot of these people are just simply ignorant. I can understand being conditioned to believe that being 20-30 pound overweight is really telling of bad health, and wanting to help a person you care about. Not saying it's true, because it isn't. People ask me about my self-harm scars. They tell me: WHy don't you just stop? Or when I pick, they say: \"Why don't you stop? Why don't you cover it up with makeup\"? Ofc, it is super annoying and puts me in a really bad mindset sometimes. I've had to learn to set boundaries in the moment and educate a little. I harbor less resentment, I compartmentalize the judgment, and yeah. Not easy, but I made it. Took a while. Anywho, if someone who happens to not know how to handle the situation wants to show love and acknowledgment, it can come off the wrong way. And it can feel like pure idiocy, but not everyone is going to be woke or interpersonally and intrapersonally conscious. Doesn't mean anything other than ignorance sometimes. And fear.\n\nMost people are being shit on in the west, and everyone just goes about a traditional \"way\" in our culture, not really learning or growing because nobody really knows how to go about it. The modern media pushes anything BUT science on consumers to make a profit, and people are literally eating in to so many conspiracy theories right now that it's terrifying. It really seems that science is just not valid enough to people of profitable enough to corporations. As a result, people kind of remain ignorant. I have a friend from Germany who says that emotional intelligence is a part of the Curriculum in German schools. It's mainly a cultural thing, and persecuting ppl or sometimes even labeling people as \"bad\" or \"idiots\" is not the way to end fatphobia. \n\nI feel like a lot of men don't have the expressive tools and stuff to support and empower themselves quite like women do. We HAVE to stop demonizing ppl if we truly want to see change. And change will be slow, unfortunately.  Also, many people are just plain ignorant. Can we blame them? Science is not mainstream these days, unfortunately.\n\nThat's why a lot of men might act like ignorant babies, b/c they themselves can be quite vapid without the support net of something akin to feminism for men. Many men are disordered themselves. That hunger to perpetuate power and to generate more power can be disordered as well. Not saying it's an excuse. Just saying.

But I\u2019ve been steeped in diet culture and fatphobia for nearly three decades; even though I loved these individuals and wanted them to be attracted to me, I never internalized their beliefs and instead was just like, \u201cwell I look the best AND I get the most social capital/privilege from others at x bmi, so I\u2019m gonna keep going with that.\u201d For me it\u2019s become a lot less about what one particular partner wants and more about how the world at large rewards me for looking \ud83d\ude2d I\u2019m really sensitive. I know when I gain weight someone\u2019s going to comment on it, and I definitely have fear about that day coming. (I am single and in recovery now though, and I definitely feel more at peace that I\u2019m doing it alone so I don\u2019t have to worry about people triggering me.)",

It seems similar for a lot of guys my age, as I'm in my mid thirties and most guys I meet don't seem to be put off by mombod. They still buy my friends and I drinks when we're out despite us all being married and not interested, and I still have been catcalled or flirted with at ridiculous places, like the gas station lol. But as my husband has told me, most guys will try to sleep with any woman regardless of size. They have preferences like we do, but whether you're thin or not, you'll get attention from guys, especially in the bar scene. \n\nIn fact, over the years, I've come to the disturbing realization that I feel more judged for my weight by other women than men. It's always other women who made comments about me or other girls not being thin enough, or that guys won't like us, etc. When I see comments on reddit about women on tv shows, it's usually women calling them fat and assuming the husband is cheating because she hasn't lost the baby weight...when there's no evidence that he is and he seems perfectly happy. When I was younger, it was other women encouraging me to starve myself and count calories, while any guys who found out what I was doing were shocked and upset and just confused why I thought I was fat. So for me, talking to my husband and his friends and finding out that they tend to like curvier girls has helped me put things in perspective. I wish I knew this when I was a teen and trying to stay thin to impress guys who apparently didn't even care either way lol.",
