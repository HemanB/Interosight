  "selftext": "I've really struggled the past few months and have started weighing myself and my food again. Yesterday, I asked my best friend if I could give him my scale and invited him to pizza for lunch today. \n\nI am terrified but I am writing this to remind myself that this is the right choice. I am a grown woman. I don't need to starve myself in order to be worthy of love and respect. I want to live a fulfilling life more than I want to be small. I am allowed to take up space. I feel like shit right now because this is new and scary. That's okay and it will fade. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDealing with anxiety by not eating does not work in the long run. Not eating makes my depression worse. Food is normal and nothing to be afraid of. \n\nWhen I imagine a life worth living, that does not include counting tomatoes or weighing out salad or cancelling plans because of low energy or fear of calories. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am safe where I am right now. I can make my own decisions. I will not let this ED continue to rule my life. It has taken enough of me already",

I haven't weighed myself in awhile, but I'd been keeping my scale in the house because it felt safer knowing I could always check back in if I \"needed\" to.\n\nYesterday, my boyfriend and I tossed it. Right now, he's making me breakfast and I'm in the other room with no idea what's going into it, only that it will be delicious and that having a partner who loves me enough to cook for me is meaningful in its own right.\n\nIt's definitely scary, but you're so right - our ideal lives shouldn't be and aren't measured in grams or pounds. I'm super, super happy for you!",

If it helps, this is the place I was in mentally when I finally recovered for good: I was just so freaking sick of agonizing over everything I put in my mouth and missing out on life.
