  "selftext": "* i am in recovery. i am recovering from an eating disorder so of course i have to concentrate more on fueling my body.\n* skipping meals is not trendy. it does not even contribute to weight loss. it is just unhealthy.\n* those that brag on social media about not eating are exaggerating, or misunderstanding their intake. do not use them as comparison. \n* building on the previous point. because of my eating disorder i am hyper aware of my intake - unlike most people. this leads to the misconception that i am eating much more than anyone else\n* everyone has a different metabolism, depending on genetics and wild variety of other factors. if you need more food than others it may just be a difference in metabolism. trust that your body knows what to do with the food you give it.\n* how my body is shaped is something i am born with. my digestive patterns/bloating is something i am born with. for the most part, it is futile to try to change these forcefully. i cannot let my eating disorder convince me that i am \u201ctoo fat\u201d or that the way my body naturally functions is something i can control.\n* do not look for validation from others. i AM sick. i AM suffering. i AM sensitive. i AM recovering. most people are NOT. so of course i have different needs.",
