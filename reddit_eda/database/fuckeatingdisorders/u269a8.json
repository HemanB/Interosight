  "title": "Just reminder that if you end up \u201coverweight\u201d/in a larger body post recovery, you aren\u2019t a failure",
  "selftext": "I spent years of my life convinced that ending up in a larger body would be unbearable, intolerable, unsustainable. That it would symbolize my life as a massive failure.\n\nI gained a lot of weight in recovery\u2026 and while I don\u2019t really fit into fat spaces, I am the heaviest I have ever been and I\u2019m certain I\u2019ve surpassed the \u201chealthy\u201d BMI range. And honestly? I didn\u2019t develop diabetes, I didn\u2019t die, and the universe didn\u2019t explode. While I don\u2019t necessarily *like* my body, I accept that this is the body I need to be in to be healthy, whether it\u2019s permanent or not.\n\nSo this is just your reminder that if you ended up \u201coverweight\u201d or in a larger body post recovery, you are not a failure. The societal chatter regarding diet culture can be very loud at times, but I am here to tell you that you are not alone; your body isn\u2019t broken, you aren\u2019t a failed thin person, and you don\u2019t need to change.",

Even at my lowest weight I still had a \"normal\" BMI. Yet my endocrine system is totally effed up due to restricting, overexercising and the binge-purge cycle.",

      "body": "Furthermore, these reassurances you often see that anorexics will inevitably recover into naturally skinny bodies is I think indicative of lingering disordered thoughts. There's every chance you won't be thin post-recovery, and that's OK. I understand these reassurances come from a place of kindnes, as telling someone deep in their ED that they might gain more than they consider acceptable will probably just scare them - but they aren't true. What is true, though, is that if you decide to power through and recover regardless, the reality of ending up bigger than you thought doesn't matter to you all that much any more.",
