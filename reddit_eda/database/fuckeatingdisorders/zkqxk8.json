  "selftext": "I know I'm a toxic jealous POS but how am I supposed to believe that I need 3 meals and 3 snacks when I eat like >!600 kcal!< for breakfast everyday and Ro whom everyone looks up to promotes those tiny ass >!200 kcal!< porridge bags as a breakfast??? A MEAL? Or half a cup of oats with nothing but some milk and maple syrup??? Also enough people eating two toasts with a thin layer of cream cheese. Well even with a morning snack, I'm still eating more for breakfast then... I'm spiraling and convinced I eat more than everyone in this world because even before my ED, I would have 2-4 times those portions for each meal every single day whereas others might eat more during EH but consider those tiny portions normal... I'm breaking down bro I am a glutton I can't do this anymore",

Some people have smaller meals and then larger/more regular snacks throughout the day. Some people are simply not fuelling their body sufficiently. The point is, you have no way of telling, but the more important point is, what or how much anyone else eats doesn\u2019t affect how much **your** body needs.\n\nComparing your intake to others is not going to bring you any happiness, especially comparing it to social media influencers who are paid to claim they eat a certain thing every day. Let me ask you, when you were eating less than 3 meals and 3 snacks a day, when you were restricting your intake, did you feel physically good? Of course not, because you weren\u2019t giving your body enough food. Your body needs as much food as it needs, what anyone else eats doesn\u2019t change that at all.",

Whereas it\u2019s true that partly this may be because you\u2019ve come out of restrictive eating and that\u2019s totally fine it\u2019s also true that appetites vary and the recommended 2000 calorie intake is vastly inaccurate - I know people who eat 1,800 and gain and people who eat 3,000 and maintain their overall weight with no exercise. I personally always feel so guilty for eating more than others but it\u2019s honestly completely fine. Today my parents split one fucking baby chicken between the two of them and ate some sad veg on the side and like a piece of ham each. I had one entire baby chicken to myself + vegetables + a pot of yoghurt with granola. My sibling eats takeout every day and eats day more than me yet they\u2019re skinnier, my mum eats way less than me yet she\u2019s a bit bigger. Literally appetites just vary person to person and esp. with exercise levels, age as older people tend to eat less, genetics. The \u00ab\u00a0what I eat in a day\u00a0\u00bb videos are insanely annoying because I\u2019m sorry but no I\u2019m not going to feel fully after one pot of porridge with half a banana and a spoonful of peanut butter. It\u2019s okay to have an appetite trust your body and your hunger cues if you have those I know they can be difficult to identify in recovery. I now eat however fucking much I need to feel full because I know if I don\u2019t it\u2019ll bite me in the ass later and I\u2019ll be fucking ravenous. You\u2019re not a glutton trust ur body you\u2019ll be okay :)",

Do what makes you feel good - your body needs fuel to survive and comparing yourself isn\u2019t helpful. I personally found that muting influencers that I used to follow helped me compare myself to others less, but I know some people do get motivation from them.\n\nYou can do this and sending you so much strength on your recovery journey.",

You should allow yourself to have every bit of food that your body wants and needs, regardless of how much someone else who is in recovery might be eating on camera for a split second.
