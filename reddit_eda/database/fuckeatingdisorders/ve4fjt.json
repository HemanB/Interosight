  "selftext": "I've been a part of r/edanonmyous for a while, and I initially didn't mind the sub, you could talk about your struggles with your eating disorder, which is fine. I figured it would be fine to stay in while being early into recovery, because I might still relate. But lately, moreso in the past week, I have noticed a big increase in fatphobic posts reaching hot and showing up on my feed.\n\nIt's genuinely vile. I'm not talking about fear of personal weight gain, I mean consistent belittling of fat people.\n\nThere are some good discussions to be had around the subject of fatphobia, like how we need to stop insinutating EVERY eating disorder is based in fatphobia, or how body positive influencers often belittle people with restrictive eating disorders or even compare their struggles to racism and homophobia. But this isn't what's been happening.\n\nA lot of it is disgusting, elementary school type, bullying. People posting how they hate HAES, not because of any valid criticisms, but because they don't want to be fat and therefore we shouldn't normalize fatness and fat people shouldn't be proud of their bodies because it's unhealthy. \n\nThe one I just read was talking about how people need to stop saying \"well, what's wrong with being fat?\" not because it minimizes the struggle of eating disorders, but because they think being bad is fat, and then the replies continuing to list all this fatphobic crap about how we shouldn't accept fat bodies and it's only a US thing.\n\nWhich just... isn't it. The body positivity movement and fat activists do have valid criticism they could benefit from, but shaming fat people is not one of them. \n\nI personally believe that fatphobia and fat shaming is an inherently pro-ana, pro-mia, pro-ed, whatever you'd like to call it, behavior and will inherently worsen eating disorders in many people, as well as validating their toxic, disordered behavior, rather than realizing it's not a normal or acceptable thing to do. \n\nI also wonder about the people on the sub who don't have restrictive eating disorders. A lot of binge-eating disorders are motivated by fatphobia. Many times it's internalized fatphobia which perpetuates the binge cycle, as weird as it sounds, because feeling like shit can trigger stress, which triggers binge eating. Obviously, if someone with BED sees this, and is also overweight, that's not going to feel great, and can result in binge eating, or hell, trigger a switch of eating disorders. \n\nI don't get it. I've never been fat myself, and I still understand that being a shitty person and degrading fat people isn't a good thing to do, because suprise, fat people also have feelings and shaming them does absolutely nothing.\n\nYou can't have a safe space for eating disordered individuals, which posts this type of content. The longer I get into recovery, the more I'm realizing that \"safe spaces\" for actively eating disordered individuals reqlly aren't a thing.",
