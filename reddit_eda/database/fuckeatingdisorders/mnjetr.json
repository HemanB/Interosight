  "selftext": "when i was really struggling, all i wanted to do was experiment in the kitchen. i cooked all my meals from scratch and baked myself the lowest calorie/\u201chealthiest\u201d desserts possible. now that i\u2019m committed to unrestricted eating, i could not be bothered. i have all these baking supplies i spent loads of money on, but i don\u2019t feel like it. like, i WAS planning on making a batch of granola for myself this week, but i\u2019d rather just spend seven dollars on the kind that i like so i can eat it without the effort. i know i\u2019m gonna want dessert throughout the week too, so i guess i\u2019ll just buy something at the store? which seems SO crazy and foreign to me. but whatever, just trying to ride the recovery wave. but i do feel bad about all those baking supplies i bought, lol",

The part of ED that makes food such a large part of our lives takes away so much from us. Sometimes, making food ourselves is a way of maintaining control over our eating. There's no harm in eating food we didn't fully make ourselves. Sometimes, we really just can't be bothered to do all that.",
