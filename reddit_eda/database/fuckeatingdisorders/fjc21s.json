  "title": "How to Disappear Completely: On Modern Anorexia",
  "selftext": "The title is a really good book I just finished reading. I would highly recommend, especially as you're stuck homebound for quarantine. \n\nThe author discusses how so many depictions of anorexia in films and books romanticize it and function as a source of tips and inspiration for people suffering from anorexia or wanting to suffer from it. That's right- she herself admits that she -wanted- to become afflicted with anorexia at the age of 14, and read memoirs like 'Wasted' and psychology books about the disease to learn how to become anorexic, until finally...it worked. \n\nI found the book to be a really refreshing perspective that put together what I've personally felt and experienced.",
