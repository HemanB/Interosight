  "title": "IM WEIGHT RESTORED",
  "selftext": "GUYSSSSS GUESS WHATTTTT??? I'M WEIGHT RESTORED EEEBEEHEHEH !!! I haven't been weighing myself because it used to trigger me really bad but recently I weighed myself to show my dad the progress I've been making. I've gained around 10 pounds in a week- 15 pounds in 2 weeks :,) I'm finally back to the healthy weight range and now no longer feel like i'd fall down at any second haha\n\nand yes I have gained a lot of body fat but who cares??? this fat will keep me alive longer and provide me with the protection and energy I need for each day. if anything I like the softer feel- I don't feel all boney and you can no longer see my spine and ribcage- people used to get scared by that. also not to mention my boobs are getting back to their pre ed size :,) I missed them\n\nI'm still gaining too!! and will continue to honor my cravings even if it's an ungodly amount cuz idc\n\nI just wanted to update everyone and let everyone know that continuing with recovery will not only save your life but give you a new one-  you'll be able to live to the fullest and be happy :) I feel alive every morning instead of a sac of potatoes and not to mention get to eat all the delicious foods I've missed out on <3 \n\nYou can do this too- all in recovery was the best decision for me. please take care of yourselves and stay strong throughout your journeys, if I can do it; so can you !!!",
