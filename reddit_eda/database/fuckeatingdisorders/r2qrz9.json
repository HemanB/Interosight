One of them was Elzani, who looking back was very clearly still deep in the throes of her ED despite claiming otherwise. At first it was great to see her making efforts to challenge her fears, but she posted these videos over two years and it became obvious that she wasn't gaining weight. She acted like she was making such great progress when it was clear that, when the camera was off, she was restricting. In one vlog she refused to eat something because she was \"saving it for a full day of eating video\". Her hair was lank and she had huge black bags under her eyes. She was in her twenties yet seemingly had no friends, no job, just lived in her parents' huge, posh house and was looked after by them. Her 15-year-old sister honestly seemed more grown up than she was. Eventually I couldn't watch her any more because it just made me feel so sad. It shows how anorexia stunts more than just your weight.",

Idk if they\u2019re still up or if she took them down though. She also made a post about how she doesn\u2019t refer to her ed as \u201cAna\u201d and sort of patronizing those who do, but once again if you scroll to her veryyy beginning posts in her account, she would refer to her ed as \u201cAna\u201d all the time.

She acted like she was making such great progress when it was clear that, when the camera was off, she was restricting. In one vlog she refused to eat something because she was \"saving it for a full day of eating video\". Her hair was lank and she had huge black bags under her eyes. She was in her twenties yet seemingly had no friends, no job, just lived in her parents' huge, posh house and was looked after by them.

She also posts some hypocritical things like how you shouldn\u2019t post ng tubes/hospital pics bc they may be triggering to other people, but at the very start of her account she had her own pictures of herself with an ng tube and in the hospital up. Idk if they\u2019re still up or if she took them down though. She also made a post about how she doesn\u2019t refer to her ed as \u201cAna\u201d and sort of patronizing those who do, but once again if you scroll to her veryyy beginning posts in her account, she would refer to her ed as \u201cAna\u201d all the time. So it feels like she just sort of projects her own disordered habits onto others without acknowledging them and then claiming to be more recovered than she really is. Idk she seems nice though?",

Again, I\u2019m not opposed to people referring to her as a fitness influencer (and this certainly isn\u2019t an attack on her as a person, either), my issue is that she is promoting all in as if you can still exercise to manipulate your body and weight (even if she doesn\u2019t say it) and that\u2019s not how it works. You can be into fitness and not have a desire to change the way your body looks, especially if it involves restricting. Claiming to be an intuitive eater when you aren\u2019t is extremely harmful to a lot of her followers who *do* struggle with disordered eating, and though she is absolutely free to do what she wants with her body, she\u2019s affirming to these people that you don\u2019t need to fix your relationship with exercise and continuing the notion that thinness is superior.\n\nAlso, she\u2019s weirdly focused on her body and food and that in and of itself is a sign of disordered behavior.",

I do come from a place of compassion because she\u2019s struggling with the same illness as the rest of us, however I think at some point it\u2019s not fair to the rest of us to keep enabling it and glossing over the issue when it\u2019s staring us right in the face and perpetuating frustration in the rest of us.

          "body": "OMG I NOTICED THAT TOO, she made a whole big deal about going inpatient right when Covid was becoming more serious like 1.5 ish to 2 years ago, she even made a whole story highlight titled \u201cinpatient\u201d or something similar and she posted things like \u201chelp me decorate my bedroom wall!\u201d implying that she would be in treatment for the long run. Then literally a week later she posts randomly \u201cgood news! I get to go home!\u201d and that was the end of it and she never mentioned it again on her page. The highlight and everything was deleted too. \n\nTotally get where you\u2019re coming from! I really hope she\u2019s doing better than she appears, but it simply just seems to me that she\u2019s not actually practicing with she is preaching. As someone with an ed (like you and the rest of us here I\u2019m sure), it\u2019s just so easy to tell that she\u2019s not doing as well as she portrays herself as, and it seems like she\u2019s clinging to her ed as a part of her identity by continuing to post all of these things she doesn\u2019t even herself follow. I do come from a place of compassion because she\u2019s struggling with the same illness as the rest of us, however I think at some point it\u2019s not fair to the rest of us to keep enabling it and glossing over the issue when it\u2019s staring us right in the face and perpetuating frustration in the rest of us. For someone who posts about weight gain being okay, etc. it\u2019s very suspicious that she hasn\u2019t appeared to have gained any weight but rather only seems to have continued to lose\u2014to me that\u2019s super triggering and makes me feel like if I were to jump more into recovery and gain, I\u2019d be doing something wrong because she allegedly is all in, etc and maintaining such an underweight appearance. :(",

          "body": "you put into words so much of what I was thinking about her wayyyy better than I ever could have! I followed her and liked her a lot when I was still deep in my ED. Once I started to actually recover, I had to unfollow her because it became apparent she wasn't actually following any of her own advice- and why do what someone else says when they clearly don't do it themselves? I hope she genuinely does recover, because she seems to be a kind person who is really struggling. But I think her content could be harmful and gives people a false impression of what recovery really is.",

She seems like such a sweet person in real life but I think Instagram is really not a good influence on her recovery at the moment and I think stepping away from it and actually focusing on her recovery would be so beneficial! Yay for you for making the right choice for your own recovery and finally unfollowing her today, that\u2019s so monumental!! I\u2019m so happy for you, best wishes to you and your recovery :) <3",
