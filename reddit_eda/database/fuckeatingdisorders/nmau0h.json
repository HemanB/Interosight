  "selftext": "Eating disorders fucking suck so much. \n\nIt\u2019s so upsetting to see others in the sub Reddit struggling, bound to their own food rules and restricting their behaviour as a means to appease the ED and disordered thoughts \n\nFor those not in recovery or struggling this might be clich\u00e9 but I understand the non-stop battle with this disease, I just wanna let you know I see you and hear you even if it seems like no one cares, my words may seem empty to you now but you deserve to live, deserve to eat, live a life your younger self would be proud of. I know it\u2019s terrifying and daring but let go of this burden on your shoulder so you can flourish \n\nYou guys are so deserving of all the love in the world whether that is faking it until you make it or going all in recovery I\u2019m so proud of you and I\u2019m glad you are here today <3",
