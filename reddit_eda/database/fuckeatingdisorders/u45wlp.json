  "selftext": "I know this is posted about a lot but. The accounts that post things like \u201cwhat I eat now I have food freedom\u201d and start the video with a mirror video of them (they always look like a fitness model), and then the entire video is just coffee with fake sugar and a bunch of healthy food really really REALLY grind my gears\n\nIdk, I guess everyone IS different but personally, I only ate fake sugar and ~aesthetic foods~ in quasi recovery, and personally as a now fully recovered person I do not give enough fucks about what I eat to be documenting it in several parts. I feel like you still have to be obsessed with food to be recording it daily while claiming to be recovered (ofc while recovering, especially with all-in I understand the need for validation, but this particular account claimed to be FULLY recovered already). anyways I feel like they\u2019re just spreading the hella damaging message that this is what recovery is? This is how to stop binging? Like just eat healthily and you\u2019ll look like me! And ofc that may have worked for them, not denying their experience, but a lot of ppl will eat what they eat, be starving afterwards, and end up nowhere near as thin as they are. Just seems really fucking irresponsible idk \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70",

It\u2019s the recovery accounts that post about LIVING the recovered life and fighting the diet industry that are creating really great communities. The comments under \u201cwhat I eat\u201d creators are usual very disordered. Furthermore, they do not like to hear feedback and will defer to their \u201csupporters\u201d. I don\u2019t think they know it but it really reveals how insidious eating disorders are. How much it isolates you and give you a false sense of self. How we treat people when they confront us with something we don\u2019t want to hear. How often we have to say \u201cit\u2019s fine/don\u2019t worry\u201d and justify disordered behavior.
