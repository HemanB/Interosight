  "selftext": "I just need to vent. I've always had body dysmorphia, OCD, and disordered eating, counting calories obsessively since I was 11 and less than 100 pounds. As I grew older, I gained weight (now 24) as one does naturally. I have small bones, so in my perception I look 'heavy' even at a normal weight (say when I'm 125).\n\nI lost weight this year because I've been bored in quarantine and exercising a lot. I also started invisalign, so I don't like to eat until dinner because it's a pain to take out my trays and floss and brush after eating. The weight loss for invisalign is normal. BUT so many people have commented on how I look too skinny. Yesterday I went to the DENTIST, who I've known for a while and is kind of a fatherly guy, and he kept saying I was too skinny and needed to gain weight. My family tells me that I'm too skinny. My friend who owns a clothing company didn't post my pics of her $200 clothing item because my ribs were poking out (not confirmed, but I suspect since she's about body positivity and my ribs poking out might be triggering to people?)\n\nI hate when people call me skinny, but I secretly love it. I had this same feeling when I was prescribed Adderall. \n\nBut it also fucking sucks when people go on about how much weight you lost, because it makes you feel like you looked bad before. Not saying that being a higher weight is bad--but as you all know, it's about perception of OURSELVES, not others. At least for me. \n\nIdk what to do. I'm so conflicted. I'm never hungry and I think malnourished and I should probably go to the doctor to get my blood tested at this point. She also pointed out that I'm too thin and lost too much weight.",
