  "selftext": "Woke up early and let my ED convince me that it was too early to eat breakfast, even though I also didn\u2019t have my 4 am snack and I was painfully hungry (extreme hunger is real, y\u2019all). The time finally rolled around so there I was in the kitchen prepping my brekkie and my body was just like, \u201cyou know what? Fuck you, we aren\u2019t doing this shit again,\u201d and hit me with dizziness, cold sweats, shakiness and white spots in my vision. I casually told my boyfriend \u201cI think I\u2019m gonna faint,\u201d AS IF THATS NORMAL and barely managed to stagger to the couch where I just died, lol. Eventually it passed and I ate but fuuuuck that sucked.\n\nSo Note to self: if I now try and skip/prolong breakfast my body will legit shut down and make me faint and I\u2019ll also scare the hell out of my boyfriend. \ud83d\ude43",

And tbh fuck that, even if I DID want to intentionally restrict again, I just couldn\u2019t deal with the side effects. The physical hunger is just too painful if I don\u2019t eat soon enough as it is and I\u2019d rather not risk fainting and cracking my head open on top of it lol. Plus my bf deadass almost had a heart attack and I don\u2019t wanna do that to him either.",

I think it\u2019s because Usually I try to only wait 3 hours max to eat, but I\u2019ll go anywhere between 4-9 hours without food from when I go to sleep to waking up the next morning. And at this point my body is no longer pumping me full of cortisol to give me energy and not die in a starved state. So anything beyond 3 hours and my body is like \u201comg no\u201d if that makes sense?\n\nAlso, I know I should listen to my hunger even if I JUST ate but sometimes i didn\u2019t bring enough snacks or whatever so I\u2019m forced to push those boundaries a little bit. Usually I start to feel nauseated from hunger at around the 2.5-3 hour mark. Anything beyond that, EAPECIALLY if I\u2019ve been on my feet for awhile, and it\u2019s game over lol.",
