  "selftext": "Last year I really let myself go and binged on half a raspberry. I decided I'd had enough and I lost 100 pounds in 1 week by cutting out every single food group that exists and avoiding my entire social life.\n\nI just finished my 5th 72 hours water fast of the week and I feel great! I also just finished beating God in a weight lifting competition after bulking up on electrolytes and 1 tsp of peanut butter so I wouldn't feel dizzy :) I felt so full afterwards haha anyway KCKO!",
