  "title": "Finished my food plan for the first time and im overwhelmed (kcal mention, weight mention)",
  "selftext": "My current goal is 1500-1600kcal a day (still probably below maintenance for 5'9 and  just under 130lbs and pretty active, but getting closer!). Today my food plan came to 1530 kcal and i finished *all* of it. \n\nI felt like i was eating *constantly* and my brain is mildly in shock that i can do the same thing again tomorrow...and the next day...and the next day...and not gain weight (probably? We'll see.) \n\nI ran out of my giant 300kcal protein bars so i packed a smaller bar with some chopped veggies and guac for dipping (guac was a fear food! Turns out its really great and 90kcals isn't that much when youre not trying to stay under 500-700kcal!) Im kind of scared at how much volume *real* food has though. Like...yikes. how am i supposed to hit my goal. Guess ill have to tackle *real* peanut butter eventually. \n\nAlso, snack packs are great for this. I can't eat intuitively (my intuitive eating is intuitive...starving.) snack packs + food scale means i dont put 3 chunks of broccoli in my lunch and call it 30kcal and repeat for everything  (calling a 200kcal lunch 400kcals does not equal 400kcals.) \n\nRecovery is such a process and I'm glad reddit exists because i dont think any of my irl friends want to listen to me constantly talk about food.",
