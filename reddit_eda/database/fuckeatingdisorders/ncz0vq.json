  "selftext": "***TW for calorie numbers***\n\nHaiiiiiiii, it\u2019s me again. I\u2019ve been meaning to make this post since my one year mark back in March, but I\u2019ve just been so busy with... well, not being fucking sick for the first time in Y E A R S. And truthfully, I was unsure about how recovery had made me feel, not only physically but psychologically as well... but after January, I think I finally discovered myself again, and immersed myself in my creative endeavors all over again. It was as if I never fell out of it... but I digress.\n\nI\u2019m going to go over my recovery month-by month, in detail, in hopes that it will be of some use to somebody in this sub. If you have any questions, feel free to ask!\n\n**Month 1:** I decided to recover the day my state went into lockdown. My extreme hunger kicked in *immediately*, which scared the shit out of me. I remember telling myself I would \u201callow\u201d myself to eat, but only after I restricted for x amount of hours and only after I exercised... of course, I then found out gyms would remain closed for the foreseeable future (including my apartment\u2019s sad excuse for a gym), and I was really forced to loosen my obsessive grip on exercise, which in turn convinced me to eat as well. It took me a few days, but I was able to throw myself into the throes of extreme hunger and eat according to my body\u2019s needs. I ate every hour, as I\u2019d feel physically ill and faint if I didn\u2019t. I ate, and and, and then ate some more. Extreme hunger gave me no leniency during  the nighttime hours, either; I\u2019d wake up every at least three times just to eat. Fuck, I remember counting up all of my calories once and I ate close to 11,000kcals in one day.\n\nI was constantly shoveling food into my mouth (particularly nutrient/caloric dense food\u2014i.e., \u201cprocessed junk food\u201d), yet i was still hungry 30 minutes later. I suffered from gastroparisis long before recovery, so all that food just sat in my stomach for hours. I was so bloated that I looked as if I was in my third trimester of pregnancy. I immediately retained water, specifically in my hands, feet, legs, the entirety of my midsection, and my face. \n\nAround week 3, my emotions, which I\u2019ve been numbing for literal *years*, were flipped back on. Everything made me cry; to my friend jokingly saying I hurt his feelings to my boyfriend\u2019s tone shifting slightly. Everything f elt so overwhelming all the time.\n\nExtreme physical exhaustion basically forced me into hibernation, as I slept for 14 hours a day. The night sweats (aka, hypermetabolism) were so severe that I had to lay down a blanket underneath and use my own sheet to guarantee my partner\u2019s side of the bed wouldn\u2019t be soaked as well; everything I put into my body was immediately burned off because it just didn\u2019t know what the fuck to do with it all. This stage was so miserable because I was constantly changing out of wet clothes and ensuring I ate more and more so I wouldn\u2019t lose more weight. At this point, I have gained approximately 15 lbs of pure water and water weight, but have not gained true weight just yet.\n\n**Month 2-3:** by this time, I was no longer struggling with night sweats associated with hypermetabolism, though I still slept half the day away, cried frequently, and ate at a significant surplus. I could not be physically active for too long, as my legs would swell and I\u2019d begin to feel faint. Month two was when I finally started gaining true weight. It felt rapid at first, but looking back I truly believe it was probably about 1.5-2 lbs a week. \n\nAt about two months, none of my ED jeans or shorts fit and I would have regular meltdowns, ranting and raving about how this is a nightmare and I must have gained a million pounds. But I continued eating.\n\n**Month 4-7:** these next three months were messy for me. Most of my pre-ED clothes didn\u2019t fit at all, and my body image was at an all time low; my body dysmorphia was constantly being triggered every time I caught a glance at my\nown reflection. I was body checking at an all time high, compulsively checking every single angle, pinching my flesh, and begging my friends for reassurance they learned quickly not to give me. \n\nBut I still didn\u2019t know what I looked like. Looking at photos from before I entered recover were surreal. I didn\u2019t realized how emancipated I was\u2014not just my weight, but my hair, the dark circles under my eyes, how pale and physically fragile I was, as if I\u2019d shatter if I fell too hard (that was a real concern of mine, by the way). But when I looked at myself at this time in my recovery, I saw some hideous monster and that was very difficult for me. I developed a phobia of my own reflection and I began to miss my ED body.\n\nExtreme hunger had reduced around month 4, but was still present in my every day life. I had read so much about how others weight restored after just four months, and My rigid, OCD brain somehow convinced me that I absolutely **had** to be weight restored now, so I began to ignore the remnants of my extreme hunger and only allowed myself to eat [redacted] calories a day. Nothing as low as during my active anorexia, but still not enough to support my recovering body, which unfortunately still required a lot of food. I\u2019m not completely sure as I never weighed myself once at this point, but I believe I lost a little bit of weight and my body was not happy about it.\n\nCouple all that with extreme food boredom and I fucking relapsed, got stuck in a state of quasi recovery, whatever you wanna call it, for 3.5 months. I was constantly hungry, but had zero appetite. It was especially bad at night.\n\n**Month 8-9:** I was able to pull myself out of that relapse and began honoring my extreme hunger once more. I was averaging about 4,000kcals a day for two months. I got rid of my ED clothes, and I started therapy after realizing that I was not recovering psychologically at all, my OCD was flairing up and my body dysmorphia forced me to think about the way I looked every hour of every day. The new clothes I\u2019d bought suddenly felt tight and I noticed new fat deposits in places I\u2019ve never had fat before. My face was swollen and my body felt tight from the water retention.\n\nI have a short short torso and long legs, which resulted in any weight gain I had to my trunk/abdomin region looked compact and too heavy. My ass, thighs, and upper arms also held a lot of weight, whereas my wrists, feet, calves and neck seemingly gained nothing at all. The best description for this foreign body would be, an adult sized toddler. It was uncomfortable and I felt alien in my body, all of the time.\n\nI had gotten a physical done for my new job, and I\u2019d requested not to know what my weight is.... so they told me my BMI instead. I cried for an hour.\n\nThese months were very difficult for me, because recovery just felt hopeless and not at all worth it.\n\n**Months 10-12:** new year, new me\u2014literally. I finally began to see the brighter side of recovery, just dimly. My extreme hunger vanished completely, for the first time in almost a year. I was still eating about 3,400-3,800kcals daily, but my body was still doing a lot of internal healing. I no longer thought about food and every once  in awhile I\u2019d experience fullness. \n\nI dropped some water weight and no longer felt uncomfortably bloated and swollen. I stayed a consistent clothing size and no longer had to continuously buy new leggings and underwear.\n\nI still struggled immensely with my body dysmorphia, and an inability to look at myself from the neck down... but I suddenly had more energy to go back to weight lifting  purely for enjoyment and no aesthetic goal despite my (perceived) uneven weight distribution. I found motivation to start making art again. I laughed a lot more.\n\n**Month 13-14 (present):** my appetite has stabilized and I now experience hunger. I feel like I did, pre-ED  as far as hunger cues and my physical health feels. I have loads of energy to do the things I want, such as hiking, going on walks, and I\u2019m able to be present no matter what food I might have to eat or if I might have to skip a workout (fun story, I dropped a weight on my foot and haven\u2019t worked out properly in about 2 weeks). \n\nI have \u201covershot\u201d by quite a lot compared to what I lost. My body feels extremely foreign to me, and my weight has yet to redistribute (all in the belly). However I\u2019m slowly moving away from the concept that I\u2019ll lose it. I want to feel comfortable in my body regardless of my size. My relationship has improved, I\u2019m excelling at my job, and I get to eat freely and I can be present with friends, family and my therapist.\n\nThat isn\u2019t to say I don\u2019t have my struggles. I still can\u2019t look in mirrors without feeling immense embarrassment and disgust. I\u2019m currently struggling to ensure I\u2019m eating enough when I\u2019m stressed (going through a really rough time in my life). I have a bad habit of buying clothes that are too big and then crying about the size. But I am actively working on dismantling my own internalized fatphobia and practicing radical acceptance about this new body. I am aware of the things that trigger me and have to make the conscious decision to not give into compulsive ED thoughts, because at the end of the day I am responsible for my own mental health.\n\nTo sum this post up, recovery is fucking hard, often for a long damn time. But it is soooososososo worth it if you wade through the really fucking bad parts, when it feels like it isn\u2019t worth it at all. You have a mental disorder, but you are not broken and you deserve to live a life without your eating disorder whispering in your eat every second of every single day. I hope this helped at least one person. \ud83e\udd70",

This is my 3rd time in recovery from serious relapses (trips to inpatient), and I\u2019m at the stage where I\u2019m just about weight restored, but mentally and emotionally I still significantly struggle with ED thoughts. However, this time was different, because this time I actively chose recovery instead of my ass getting dragged to another inpatient facility. It took 6 months of hard work, but I look and feel healthy again. Even though I\u2019m physically healthy, my body dysmorphia is at an all time high and I tend to cry and isolate a lot of the time. When I find myself wanting to cling on to ED behaviors again to find some type of \u201crelief\u201d, I just try to remember how I felt deep in my ED, and how nothing is worth going down that hole again. Knowing that I\u2019m not the only one who struggles with extreme hunger, body image anxiety, and revolving thoughts about food makes me feel less alone in this.

Did she/he comment  on your looks? Was she/he trying to help you or just ignored it?\n\nAnd how did the partner react to your recovery phase?",

He didn\u2019t ignore it but I was so deep in my own shit that it wouldn\u2019t have matter if he\u2019d said anything (my sister tried to bring it up to me and it just caused me to sink further down).\n\nRecovery has improved my relationship soooo much though. He was extremely supportive when I told him I needed help and when I decided to recover. He never once made me feel bad about the weight gain,  buying a new wardrobe, nothing. I couldn\u2019t have ended up with a better partner to recover with.",
