  "selftext": "most of the big reasons why I'm anorexic are pretty clear to me, but I avoid talking about the fact that my fear of being sexualised is fuel for my ed.\n\nI don't even know why I feel like this tho. I don't know if I'm asexual, I think I am but I'm open to changing that label in the future. I am not a victim of sexual trauma, I just don't want to be viewed by anyone sexually. I still feel like a child.\n\nI don't even like bending over out of fear of any implied sexual undertones. it just makes me so uncomfortable. \n\nI have a very flat chest and the thought of getting bigger boobs if i gain weight disgusts me. the same goes for hips.\n\nthe only thing I can think of that has triggered this is the fact that when I was about 9 or 10 I started getting boobs before most other girls in my class and I used to get made fun of for it. and being fake asked out as a joke multiple times.\n\nI just think I'm so ugly and disgusting that thinking someone could be genuinely attracted to me is unbelievable. I cant even comprehend that.\n\nI dont really know where I'm going with this, just a rant I guess. this subject makes me so uncomfortable I have not even told my therapist this.",

However, now that I\u2019ve been in recovery for a bit now and I\u2019ve put a lil on myself I can feel hot as hell and my confidence can definitely influence my wardrobe haha, but I still totally get days where I wanna hide from the world /-: WIP\n\nEdit: these feelings about myself have made it way easier for me to feel comfortable with sex and openly talk about it which is nice, I know not all relationships need it but I\u2019m my particular one I always really wanted that aspect so I\u2019m happy about that",
