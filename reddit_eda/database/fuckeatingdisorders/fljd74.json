I think about lying in a hospital bed and having my only problem in life being my deadly illness.\n\nBut I don\u2019t go back to it because it\u2019s never been as idealistic as it seems in my head. I\u2019ve been inpatient 3 times and each time it\u2019s happened, it wasn\u2019t what my disorder promised. It was misery in a way I didn\u2019t want. It was isolation and heartbreak. It was hurting others more than I hurt myself. I don\u2019t go back because I love the people in my life too much to put them through my hell again. I don\u2019t go back because if I can\u2019t do it for me, I\u2019ll do it for them, and one day I\u2019ll be able to do it for me. \n\nSorry to get kinda deep on ya but recovery is a precious thing to me.",

      "body": "Today I read that anorexia is in a way, our desire to be a child above an adult because it\u2019s a self centered illness in a way; and it\u2019s so true too because I never had my shit together with my eating disorder, I was too worried about food and my body above my relationships and school and work. I needed to be taken care of and it has always been that way for as long as I\u2019ve been sick (which is A REALLY LONG TIME). So for me, every time I\u2019d try to get better in the past by slowly bumping up calories or reintroducing small amounts of trigger foods or exercising less, people always said I was doing a good job and worried less; to my sick brain, that made me think they were abandoning me in a sense. Like if people aren\u2019t worried about me then they don\u2019t love me  and won\u2019t take care of me so the only thing to do is to get sicker. I mean, a lot of this was subconscious but I\u2019ve been thinking about it a lot since I grew up extremely poor and in a toxic environment, and the only time I caught attention was when I acted out (which included bawling because I was so fucking hungry). If I\u2019m too obsessed with my body, food and restriction, then I have no time to take responsibility for my own life, including delving into and resolving my own trauma.",

I can hide it pretty well, at least I think so.\n\nI recently went 5 years of solid recovery. Had hobbies and interests and actually took care of things I'd been ignoring forever. Very interesting, but I always felt like something was missing or that I wasn't doing what I should be doing. \n\nAnd then something bad happens and all you can think is \"this time I'll make it count\".\n\nIt ain't easy, friend.",
