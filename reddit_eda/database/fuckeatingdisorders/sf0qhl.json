  "selftext": "I don't know what's what half the time. \n\nI've seen several threads on Reddit where someone will mention having an eating disorder but they're going to reddit for advice for some kind of issue that could possibly be fixed by or caused by food. Ok, fine, it's america and we can't all afford a dietitian. A well meaning person will reply with advice that on the surface is normal but to anyone familiar with ED rhetoric it's disordered. Telling a person how to eat, what to eat, that food is the cause of all their problems. I've gotten into heated discussions with people in an attempt to educate them, but they're so brainwashed by diet culture (or are struggling themselves with some disordered behaviors they haven't addressed) that it's useless. I've steered people away from certain subreddits to try to get them better advice. But it seems futile. \n\nI don't know if this makes any sense but I'm riled up about it.",
