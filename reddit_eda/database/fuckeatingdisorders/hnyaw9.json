  "selftext": "the title kinda says it all, i\u2019m 17 and i can\u2019t remember the last time i ate something -even something tiny- without thinking about/logging the calories. it\u2019s exhausting and i feel like i\u2019m wasting the best years of my life picking apart everything i eat. \n\nby all means, high school should be full of bad decisions, parties, skipping school, etc, but i\u2019m wasting so much time and energy measuring food, counting calories, and bailing on plans because i\u2019m scared there might be food that i\u2019ll binge on.\n\nthe irony of it all is today my dad told me how proud he was that i was \u201ceating well and getting more exercise...\u201d i almost laughed",

I know there really isn\u2019t anything we can say to make you want to get better, it\u2019s something you\u2019ll need to want yourself, but being self aware is a good thing. I\u2019ve been in recovery for 7 months now which isn\u2019t a lot but it\u2019s the longest I\u2019ve ever had in ten years and counting is still in the back of my mind but at least it\u2019s not in the front. \n\nI challenge you to make a conscious decision to retaliate against your ED thoughts at least once a day. For example: if you want to drink a smoothie but your ED is telling you to drink water instead, have a small smoothie. If you want to wear shorts but your ED says your legs look fat wear them out for an hour or two. Start small and work your way up to drinking a big smoothie, wearing shorts all day, eating at restaurants or wearing swim suits or whatever scares you. Eventually you can start doing it twice a day, 3x a day- etc. exposure therapy is GREAT for EDs. Just a suggestion, good luck hun \u2764\ufe0f",
