  "title": "Staaaaaaahp spreading misinformation about extreme hunger.",
  "selftext": "No, it\u2019s not binging or BED. No, it\u2019s not happening because you eat sugar. No, it\u2019s not caused by your hormones. No, it\u2019s not a result of not eating \u201cbAlAnCeD mEaLs.\u201d The biological purpose of extreme hunger (scientifically referred to as *post-starvation hyperphagia*) is to restore the body\u2019s optimal fat to fat free (muscle) mass ratio. You will continue to experience EH until your body has restored 100% fat free mass, which requires your body to achieve more than 100% fat mass (**fun fact:** *this is also why we overshoot*). It has absolutely nothing to do will power, hormones, or \u201cswinging from one extreme to another\u201d, and everything to do with how your body functions and how it responds to a [percieved] famine both during and after.\n \nI\u2019m going to get real with y\u2019all: the reason the shit I mentioned above is circulating around in this sub, and most especially in other ED subs, is because y\u2019all are afraid of gaining \u201ctoo much\u201d weight and you need to address that internalized fatphobia. **Spoiler**: there is no gaining too much in recovery; your body is smart as fuck and knows how to heal and regulate itself. Whether you\u2019re all-in or taking a slower approach, you can\u2019t recover without eating a lot of food, period. You can\u2019t starve your body for months/years and then expect it to bounce back like nothing ever happened, like you won\u2019t gain weight, or only gain what you\u2019re comfortable with while eating what you *think* is enough. You have an eating disorder\u2014the entire problem is that *you do not know how to feed yourself*. And you certainly don\u2019t know how to cope with triggering situations\u2014if you did, you wouldn\u2019t immediately jump to restriction and fight tooth and nail to find any excuse to view eating according to hunger as immoral or wrong. So stop trying to find answers to excuse away your *real* hunger. The fact that you\u2019re trying to dismiss your hunger in itself is a disordered behavior.\n\nJust food for thought (pun entirely intended). Thanks for coming to another episode of Sareeee48 Talks.\n\n**Edit:** this is not an attack on anyone, especially those who are struggling to honor their hunger. That shit is hard. Recovery is hard. But the level of misinformation that I\u2019ve seen being encouraged as of late is really not okay. Remember that the advice you give may have real impacts on the people who read it. If you\u2019re determined to share your experiences or opinions, that is absolutely okay! But at least make sure it\u2019s accurate and follows the sub\u2019s rules.",

      "body": "Fat free mass is essentially bones and muscles, and you have an optimal amount of bones-and-muscles to be healthy.  When you recover, you gain back your fat mass faster than your fat-free mass, so you need to keep gaining fat mass above your optimal level in order to completely restore your fat-free mass.  Let's illustrate with an example:\n\nSuppose Mary has a healthy pre-ED weight of 140 lbs, and 25% body fat, meaning she has about 35 lbs of fat mass and 105 lbs of fat free mass.\n\nMary develops a restrictive eating disorder, loses both fat and muscle/bone mass, and weighs 100 lbs, with a body fat percentage of 15%, meaning she now has 15 lbs of fat mass and 85 lbs of fat-free mass.  \n\nTo physically recover, she needs to gain at least 20 lbs of fat-free mass, and because of the preferential way the body stores fat, for every lb of fat-free mass she restores, she also restores 3 lbs of fat mass.  So to regain her 20 lbs of fat-free mass, she will need to gain 60 lbs of fat mass, which would mean she would \"overshoot\" to 180 lbs in order to recover physically.\n\n[Here](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/hunger-artist/201402/recovering-anorexia-how-and-why-not-stop-halfway) is a plain-language article that goes into this phenomenon, and [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/ejcn2016256) is a peer-reviewed paper on it.  In the example, I used a ratio of fat-gain-to-fat-free-gain that roughly aligned with the findings in this paper.",

I\u2019m always looking for a different way unfortunately, have been for the last decade. \n\nIt just seems like such a blind leap of faith. I\u2019ve been eating in the order of 3500-6000+ calories the last few weeks, sometimes giving in and sometimes holding back on extreme hunger. Very weird cravings for chocolate, processed foods, etc\u2026couldn\u2019t be further from how I lived all my adult life so far (I\u2019m 32M and have had this shit plaguing me since I was 19). I was legitimately eating 3000 calories a day through tracking rigidly for around a year previously but never made much ground as far as physical or mental recovery goes, always remained underweight, and extremely anxiety ridden. \nI\u2019ve gained in the region of a few kilos so far, but worry what lies ahead. I don\u2019t know how my body is going to turn out and it\u2019s so frightening. I\u2019m thinking of stopping the regular weighing altogether. \n\nI\u2019m also limiting all unnecessary movement - doing only some limited strength training, walking in work, etc and short strolls. \n\nHow does someone ever eat a normal amount again and feel satisfied? Do people ever heal their relationship with movement? I sometimes feel like I should try to cut back or plan my diet a bit more, and bring in more cardio, but know in my heart of hearts that it\u2019ll probably lead me down those well trodden paths of restriction again eventually, and on to perpetual quasi/non recovery. I also fear that if I do stay the course, I will probably freak out someday soon and relapse. \nDoes it get easier? I\u2019m guessing not in the short term\u2026..",

          "body": "Fat free mass is essentially bones and muscles, and you have an optimal amount of bones-and-muscles to be healthy.  When you recover, you gain back your fat mass faster than your fat-free mass, so you need to keep gaining fat mass above your optimal level in order to completely restore your fat-free mass.  Let's illustrate with an example:\n\nSuppose Mary has a healthy pre-ED weight of 140 lbs, and 25% body fat, meaning she has about 35 lbs of fat mass and 105 lbs of fat free mass.\n\nMary develops a restrictive eating disorder, loses both fat and muscle/bone mass, and weighs 100 lbs, with a body fat percentage of 15%, meaning she now has 15 lbs of fat mass and 85 lbs of fat-free mass.  \n\nTo physically recover, she needs to gain at least 20 lbs of fat-free mass, and because of the preferential way the body stores fat, for every lb of fat-free mass she restores, she also restores 3 lbs of fat mass.  So to regain her 20 lbs of fat-free mass, she will need to gain 60 lbs of fat mass, which would mean she would \"overshoot\" to 180 lbs in order to recover physically.\n\n[Here](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/hunger-artist/201402/recovering-anorexia-how-and-why-not-stop-halfway) is a plain-language article that goes into this phenomenon, and [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/ejcn2016256) is a peer-reviewed paper on it.  In the example, I used a ratio of fat-gain-to-fat-free-gain that roughly aligned with the findings in this paper.",

Keep in mind that BMI is not backed by any sort of scientific evidence; it was created by a white, European man in the 1800s to measure the average body mass of other white, European men of the 1800s\u2014it is not only exclusionary by design, it\u2019s also extremely flawed and an extremely poor and inaccurate indicator of health. If you feel healthy both physically and psychologically, then why does it matter if you\u2019re \u201cobese\u201d? Especially when we consider that many of these individuals who reside in a larger body are more proficient at fight off diseases that fatness supposedly causes to begin with (aka, the \u201cobesity paradox\u201d).\n\nAt the end of the day, correlation is not causation. Larger bodies aren\u2019t inherently more unhealthy from a biological perspective, and science has failed repeatedly to prove that they are (that is, if you exclude studies with clear weight biases). Bodies come in all shapes and sizes; If you end up at a higher weight post recovery, then it\u2019s the weight your body functions best at. It is not a moral failing, despite what our deeply fatphobic society tells us.",
