  "selftext": "I started making a real effort to recover 10 days ago and have been eating to satiate my extreme hunger for the past 4 days. I was weighed by a doctor this morning and I've gone from 100lbs to 115lbs in that short time. I'm still underweight but this enormous gain in such a short time is so upsetting because it was one of my top fears that I'd end up weight restored and still obsessed with food and plagued by ED thoughts. I want to restrict but even more I just want to keep eating. I'm so hungry all the time.",

      "body": "So I don't fully know what is going on with you, but some anecdotal evidence of why you're ok.\n\nFirst off- I would HIGHLY recommend you stop weighing yourself. It might sound impossible to do right now, but your body has SO MUCH going on right now, your weight will fluctuate and it's definitely not just fat accumulating. \n\nSecond, I gained 15 lbs in 4 days when I attempted to eat normally. It terrified me. I actually talked to my dietician at the time about it (which if you haven't I recomend you do). Basically, for me I hadn't been getting enough carbs, so my body was likely restoring glycogen store stubbornly. Then, your body needs to retain fluids to help work on parts it couldn't when it didnt have enough energy- ligaments, muscles, etc are getting repaired now. Depending on the extent of the damage, you might retain these fluids for a bit. But your body is repairing itself!!! And it's because you're giving it the energy to do so!\n\nSo, basically try to be patient and don't weigh yourself for now. I promise the weight gain will not continue at this rate. Your body just needs time to figure out what to do with adequate energy. \n\nYou have to learn how to trust your body at the same time your body is learning to trust you.",

          "body": "I want to recover because I starved myself to such an extreme that I literally couldn't do anything. I was so weak I could barely walk, open doors or climb the stairs. I'm signed off work right now because I'm too emaciated to function properly. For weeks at work I'd do nothing except show up, because my brain was almost completely turned off. My daily routine was to go to work, then sit in McDonalds for 2 hours drinking coffee, distracting myself from my relentless hunger, until I knew my partner would be home, because if I got home first I'd be tempted to eat and then purge. I'd have a single 300-ish calorie meal around 7PM, comprised of konjac noodles and vegetables. On weekends I'd treat myself to 400 calories worth of baked fish with broccoli. I lived this way for months. I legitimately thought I was going to die before I could even get my first appointment with the ED specialist.\n\nNow though, it's like I can't stop eating. I eat large healthy meals and something triggers inside of me and within minutes I'm back in the kitchen feasting on granola, fruit and chocolate. I'm craving sugar and carbs like crazy even when I'm not very hungry. On the one hand I want to honor my cravings because every recovery resource I've read says trying to ignore it will only make it worse. But I'm scared of gaining a huge amount very quickly. I'm scared my AN was right when it told me 'you're an insatiable pig - if you start eating you won't ever be able to stop... that's why you need to just not eat instead!'",

I'm still trying to come to terms with hunger cues and recognizing when I'm full. Unfortunately I do feel like all the progress I've made has been in spite of my therapist and not because of her - from recommending I stick to a starvation diet of 1,500 calories (1,900 is maintenance for me, even at my low weight) to telling me to weigh myself regularly, to making me keep a daily 'food diary' in which I log every morsel... I feel like anorexia would still have a very tight grip on me if I hadn't refused to listen to all her terrible advice.",
