  "selftext": "A few days ago I saw this post on a subreddit that you can probably guess the name of (idk if I can say it here?). It made me so mad and I have to talk about it. \n\nThe OP had an extremely obvious eating disorder, in the way that he described his diet and how he talked about his body. In his post history he basically admitted to having one and purging his meals. \n\nHe was doing a type of fasting where you eat 400 calories a day or something like that and he asked this subreddit for advice, saying that he wanted to lose as much weight as quickly as possible to get to his goal weight ((which was suspiciously low)). He said that he didn't care about how much damage he did to his body. \n\nThe most upvoted response was telling this poor man that \"you will not do any damage to your body, get that idea out of your head\" and then instructed him to water fast for 3 months to reach his goal weight, and stop the 400 calorie \"crap\". \n\nCan u fucking imagine what reading that must feel like as someone with an ED, he was bashed by these people for eating 400 calories a day because apparently that's way too much and its better to literally starve yourself for months \n\nHe then said he was worried about having a weak heart from years of drug abuse and they still encouraged him to do it. \n\nSeriously, how can they ban /r/proED and allow this shit",
