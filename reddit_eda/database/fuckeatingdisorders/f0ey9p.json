  "selftext": "Because eventually I end up having NO appetite at all. For months I stopped eating well. Felt terrible. Finally had enough and FORCED myself to eat, 3 big meals a day plus snacks  and after 3 days, guess what, appetite  came back! Not going to lie it was PAINFUL to eat. It was like that scene in Bridesmaids where Kristen Wigg is eating the Jordon Almond in the fitting room..... But its worked.",

Skip sugary foods as that hijacks your eating desires and messes up your system. And learn to spice things. Experiment and figure out what you like. North American food is notoriously bland to try to appeal to everyone. When i don't feel like eating eggs or cooked vegetables, i toss in curry powder, chili flakes, garlic, and red vinegar. It's my go to to make eating suck less. Find yours :)",
