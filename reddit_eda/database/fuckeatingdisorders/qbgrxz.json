  "selftext": "This is NOT promoting eating disorders btw! Please read the whole post if you think otherwise. \u200b\n\nWhenever you hear eating disorder, most people think of a small, white teenage girl crying in the bathroom, next to the toilet. And for many people, that's the truth. People with EDs suffer, and there is often very few times of genuine happiness. \n\nBut one thing that has made me feel the most guilty, is the short term joy I felt from it. The comments from family members who said how much smaller i was, to the statements my mother made about me fitting her old clothes. I hate talking about how joyful I'd feel when restricting, knowing that I might get more attention and people will finally think how \"pretty\" and \"mature\" i as. \n\nIt was nice. It was really nice to feel that twisted joy of not eating, knowing I'll keep my goal, that people will still think I'm at least sorta attractive. \n\nI hate talking about it because it makes me feel as if the person listening, thinks I'm stupid, or delusional. I know it wrong and messed up, but that was heaven compared to the nights crying about how I'll never be pretty. I havent recieved the same kind treatment from my family members ince I gained weight. \n\nThis kind of attention only lasts for a second. Even if I was small, the compliments would eventually end, and I'd be back where I started. There was no point, the end goal didn't even give me the prize I so desperately wanted. Truth is, being smaller never made me pretty, it just made me sick",

I was just expressing it to my therapist - I was having a horrible night awhile ago, and ended up skipping dinner, and it made me feel so happy and grounded and proud.
