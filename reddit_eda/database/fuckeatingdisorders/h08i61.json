  "selftext": "Honestly I have no idea if this makes any sense or not, but whenever I eat I get SO much anxiety because the whole time my brain is going \"what if this meal isn't the most delicious it could be?\". And the reason I think that is because I know I won't eat again in a long time so I feel like there's a huge expectation of deliciousness when I do eat. It's like I know there is a finite number of meals I will ever eat so every meal has to be the best. There's no space for any mediocre food.",
