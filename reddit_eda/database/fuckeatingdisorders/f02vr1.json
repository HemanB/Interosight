  "selftext": "We finally did it gamers, after 2 years of purging daily I was able to make it 2 entire months without engaging in any eating disorder activities.  I threw away my scale, ate without checking the calories, and even found myself enjoying eating at restaurants with friends. Unfortunately, a week ago I cracked after giving into the temptation of weighing myself, I started purging 4-5 times a day and everything went to hell. My face swelled up, now it's super red + inflamed, my glands are fucked so i have no jaw definition which makes my esteem so much worse.  My lips got super cracked and developed a fungal infection from being constantly in contact with vomit and stomach acid, and three days ago after a 3 hour b/p episode, I hit rock bottom. I lost the ability to interact with my surroundings, started jerking and convulsing, hit the floor and pissed myself, and my jaw clamped shut; bruising my tongue and causing me to lose a decent amount of blood. All of this took place in my university's dining hall. Even worse, I had amnesia about the incident. I woke up hours later in my bed to dozens of texts telling me what happened. I am DONE with letting bulimia ruin my life. I made it 2 months and am determined to make it 2 more, again and again until I finally reach the healthy and normal existence that I deserve. To anyone even considering purging, don't even play around with the idea. At first, you may lose weight and feel invincible, but 2 years later and you'll find yourself tweaking out in a puddle of your own urine on a cafeteria floor. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTDLR; 2 years after developing bulimia, had a tonic-clonic seizure due to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Lost control of bladder in front of dozens of peers :(",
