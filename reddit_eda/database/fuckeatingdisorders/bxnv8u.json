  "selftext": "It\u2019s very difficult for me to separate the idea of intermittent fasting from my own personal experience with an eating disorder. I\u2019m doing my best, but I can\u2019t help but feel triggered every time I see these kinds of posts. Now I\u2019ve seen one that said \u201chere\u2019s my progress with intermittent fasting- starting one meal a day soon and attempting a 36 hour fast\u201d. It\u2019s shocking and alarming to me the amount of support these kinds of posts are met with... Is it really possible for people to lose weight in this way and not develop an eating disorder!? It seems to go completely unaddressed in that sub and really fucked up behaviors are normalized and encouraged. Am I projecting?",

Cardiovascular health is actually a stronger predictor of health than body weight.

On top of that, Im still only able to afford a poverty diet full of junk food. I tried IF purely for health reasons (reset my body of all the junk and try focusing on healthy foods when I do eat)  and realized it made my brain go back to my ED way of thinking. The hunger pangs are too triggering and I felt guilty when I did eat. So, IF is NOT for me.",
