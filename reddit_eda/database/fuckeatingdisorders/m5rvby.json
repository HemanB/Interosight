I understand that many aren\u2019t in recovery yet\u2014hell, maybe you are and you\u2019re still struggling with your body. And I feel for you. But we *do not* discuss intentional weight loss, dieting or fatphobia in a positive light here. If you want to discuss your weight loss, go to a weight loss sub. This is not the sub to celebrate these types of behaviors and members should not be triggered in a space they should feel safe in. If I see it, it will either need to be edited or removed.\n\nThanks for coming to my TED talk.",
