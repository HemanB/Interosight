I have yet to see one of these \u201crecovered\u201d influencers spend a day on the couch eating candy watching Netflix, or go get pizza for dinner. So frustrating and unrealistic\u2026\n\n~ Rant over ~",

Or they be preachin' about, \"Eat to fuel guys!\" and then proceed to go the gym & do 500 million walks.\n\nThat's why I think it's very damaging to be posting WIEAD when ur recovering, and the accounts that do it are only waving red flags. Same deal with the recovery accounts who post their before & afters at least 6x a day...... idk............ a lil counterintuitive it seems.",

I don't see this as any freakin' different.\n\nI decided to take a sports nutrition class for my master's degree. Armed with that knowledge, I can safely say that you should absolutely eat to fuel but that none of this is eating to fuel. Where. The. Eff. Are. The. Carbs. I'm not joking. Salad bowl with chicken AFTER the gym?? WHERE IS THE GLYCOGEN REFUELING. It's non-existent.\n\nI get really upset about the demonizing of carbs in general, but especially by people who claim \"fitness\" saved them or whatever (\"strong is the new skinny\" bs). I really want to see a recovery person who is actually into real fitness but REALLY fuels that activity. You're doing hard activity, running several miles AND lifting? Or during an event where you are competing multiple times a day? Then I'm talking >!1-1.2!< g of carbs per kg body weight per hour for FOUR HOURS after your activity. Yeah. You read that right. That's hundreds of calories just in carbs to fuel that activity- for a >!110!< lb person that's quite literally >!800-960 calories!< just of carbs so you can maximize your glycogen and compete at the top of your game.\n\nBut no, they don't actually care about performance. They just use \"fitness\" as a way to really mean \"socially acceptable weight control\" because lord forbid you gain \\*gasp\\* fat!",

Honestly what I want to see is weight gain , food that isn't aesthetic , convenient food , skip exercise, seconds,  junk that  doesn't make the whole day a crazy 10k challenge but disguised as ed recovery when its clearly not. But honestly most of all weight gainnnnnnn ! Because if you \"eat\" pizza everyday and stay skinny you prove nothing to me because I know eating that much ill gain weight so sure it would be easy to recover if I could eat a whole dominos pizza and 7 slices of cake eveyday and stay on the cusp of underweight for eternity.",

Or during an event where you are competing multiple times a day? Then I'm talking >!1-1.2!< g of carbs per kg body weight per hour for FOUR HOURS after your activity. Yeah. You read that right. That's hundreds of calories just in carbs to fuel that activity- for a >!110!< lb person that's quite literally >!800-960 calories!< just of carbs so you can maximize your glycogen and compete at the top of your game.\n\nBut no, they don't actually care about performance.
