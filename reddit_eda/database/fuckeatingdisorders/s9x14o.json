I think brown sugar + butter is literally toffee, right? which makes lots of sense bc I love toffee lol.also I live in Louisiana and pralines are made similarly with brown sugar but add flour, butter, & nuts \ud83d\udda4\n\nidk if you've tried the brown sugar Truvia blend, but I find it to be very delicious too and it pairs PERFECT with coffee!! imo it has a slight coffee taste to it on its own even",
