  "title": "Some Thoughts from a \"Not Skinny\" Underweight Person",
  "selftext": "I suffered from a sever eating disorder for 8 years. At my lowest weight I looked normal, strong in fact and had an \"average\" BMI. I thought I was a failure who couldn't even succeed at having an eating disorder. \n\nI suffered EDNOS, but I thought that I was bulimic, non-restrictive and oh was I wrong. Going through recovery I was convinced I had a binge eating disorder because I couldn't stop myself from eating everything all the time. Part of the binge eating was due to binging and purging previously but most of it was just my body trying to get nutrients. \n\nI was an athlete and I was just training to be strong, fighting my own body to be the best. Everyone else just thought I was strong too.\n\nI tried to put on some weight over the past couple years but it wasn't enough. It wasn't until I got a stress fracture in one hip and then the other, after going over a year without having my period that I realized how serious things were. \n\nOver the past several months I have been working on eating whatever and not purging. I have significantly reduced my running and I increased by body weight by over 16%. Yes my stomach got a little squishier (which was my biggest fear), but I got my period back and turns out I have boobs. \n\nOnly now do I see the full extent of how bad things were. I was severally underweight (even though I looked normal or even a little bigger than some people). I was degrading my bones, ruining my teeth and destroying my throat. I would occasionally have shortness of breath (this should have scared me but didn't). I couldn't focus, was extremely tired and would get dizzy (all things I dismissed as unrelated). \n\nNow my BMI says I'm \"overweight\" but fuck that. I am exactly the weight my body needs me to be and I am stronger and happier now. It's not always easy to be in recovery but I chose it everyday. I finally learned that no one pound, five pound, or even 20 pounds is worth my happiness or my life. \n\nI've also learned: no one can fix this for you, it's going to be hard, it will not be a straight path and if you keep waiting things will never change.",

Some people are visibly sick and everyone in their lives validates their recovery and others of us pass the eye test as healthy while destroying ourselves physically and mentally. No BMI or level of performance is worth your mental peace.",
