We ate the quiche, it was delicious, there was nothing left. \nThen she got home and got sick and threw up all of the quiche. \nI felt disgusted with myself because she wouldn\u2019t gain any weight from it, and I would. I was enraged at the idea that she wouldn\u2019t be affected by the extra calories or anything. \n\nIt took me a while to get past it.",
