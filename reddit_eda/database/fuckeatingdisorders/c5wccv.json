  "selftext": "This came about after he (24m) ate dinner one night when I (22f) was over.  He commented on how much he ate and (jokingly) said \u201cI feel like I just gained 15lbs from that one meal, you aren\u2019t gunna love me anymore.\u201d So I said, \u201cBabe, you could gain 100lbs and I\u2019d still love you.\u201d He said \u201cGross, I wouldn\u2019t want you to.\u201d I said \u201cYour weight doesn\u2019t matter to me, I\u2019m into your personality.\u201d He responded \u201cIf I gained 100lbs I would be unhealthy and would hope you wouldn\u2019t love me.\u201d I came back with \u201cWhat, so if I gained 100lbs you wouldn\u2019t love me?\u201d And he goes \u201cNah, I would tap out at like 30lbs.\u201d Like, not at all joking at this point. I\u2019m 5\u20194 and weigh 95lbs, which technically makes me underweight, so I said (trying to bring a little humor back into this) \u201cGood god! If I gained 30lbs I would be at a healthy weight. Babe, that\u2019s kind of the worst thing you\u2019ve ever said.\u201d He said \u201cOkay fine, like 60lbs then.\u201d I told him most women gain 50lbs from a pregnancy easily and he was SHOCKED. (I\u2019m not pregnant, thank GOD, but we\u2019ve talked about marriage and kids). We have not, however, ever had the eating disorder talk, but there\u2019s no way he doesn\u2019t suspect that I\u2019m anorexic. I basically never eat around him even when we\u2019re together for days in a row and when we go to restaurants I only get drinks. Even the meal he ate that started the conversation was one that I didn\u2019t partake in at all. I don\u2019t know, am I making too much of this? I\u2019m annoyed he said that at all. This happened like a month ago but I can\u2019t stop thinking about it.",

He still believes fat people don\u2019t deserve love and that is evil. Fat people are human and are one of the most maligned group where it is okay to say the best strategy to help is to judge fatness as laziness and to shame. He is going to hurt you even if he isn\u2019t deliberately trying. His behavior is misogynistic and disgusting.
