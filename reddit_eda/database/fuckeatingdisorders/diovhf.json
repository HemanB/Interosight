  "selftext": "So for the last month i\u2019ve suddenly become strangely comfortable with my body... It\u2019s kinda crazy. It\u2019s been kinda out of the blue, but it happened around the time I stopped working out completely. Obviously i\u2019m not loving it and flaunting it at any opportunity haha, but I can live with this.\n\nI never thought I could make progress in this area. I thought I was the exception, that I\u2019d forever hate my body and think its unacceptable. Now I realize that I look average, and thats ok. I used to think average wasn\u2019t enough, that I had to prove that I\u2019m a good, hard working person through being different somehow. \n\nI have an average body and an average life and that makes me feel pretty content. Maybe I seem uninteresting to some but honestly who cares, I\u2019m the one who has to deal with chaos of fitting myself into some mould. \n\nIdk, maybe me posting this could help someone. Body image issues are a bitch and it felt like I wasn\u2019t making progress for so long. There\u2019s hope you guys :)",

      "body": "This makes me so happy. It also makes me ask myself (again), are eating disorders fed by this idea that we are meant to be better than everyone else? What is so wrong with what some would call \"average\"? It's about finding the extraordinary in the mundane.\n\nCelebrate this time, but all the processes of a weight-restored body take some time to come back. For instance, this article talks about a process of starting to enjoy and find pleasure in sex while/after recovering from anorexia.\n\nhttps://medium.com/pulpmag/draft-ana-sex-on-eating-disorders-and-sex-and-why-poetry-is-the-only-real-way-to-talk-about-91751983ebc1",

I DO still have hard days or weeks every now and then where I feel myself sliding away from that sense of okay-ness, but they get less frequent all the time.\nMy life is small and comfortable and I'm very content the vast majority of the time.\n\n You dont sound uninteresting to me--you sound *happy.* Thank you for sharing this little ray of hope! What an awesome thing you've achieved :)",
