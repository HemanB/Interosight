  "title": "Today is the first day of the rest of my life",
  "selftext": "Today I have gone all in. \n\nI have been in quasi recovery for almost a year now with a minor relapse over the past 3 or so weeks and it has become too much. I\u2019ve lost my family\u2019s trust, I\u2019ve lost friendships. I\u2019m so fucking tired. \n\nI woke up this morning and decided enough was enough. I decided to flip my day on it\u2019s head. Not do my \u2018allowed\u2019 exercise. Have breakfast as soon as I got up instead of delaying for as long as possible. \n\nI didn\u2019t put my Apple Watch on today. I have broken a 540 day streak of \u2018closing my rings\u2019. \n\nFor breakfast I made cinnamon pancakes from scratch with yoghurt, blueberries, strawberries, banana, maple syrup, and Reese\u2019s peanut butter chips that mum bought me ages ago but I have been too scared to open. \n\nThen I was still hungry so I had a slice of a fruit loaf mum had made and I toasted it and put banana on top with maple syrup and more peanut butter chips lol\n\nThen I was craving a milo so I had fat fucking milo (it\u2019s a malt chocolate powder here in Australia that you mix with milk), this is the first time I\u2019ve had milk in like a year. \n\nBy 8:15am I think I had eaten more calories than I have in a full day in YEARS! \n\nI have also been craving an almond croissant. So by 10am I asked mum if we could go get coffee and croissants. It was so yum. \n\nI just made lunch and I had an omelette with eggs, zucchini, cherry tomatoes, ham, spring onion, and rocket and had it with a toasted English muffin with pizza sauce! \n\nI feel so full. I feel sick. Both from food and from anxiety. I feel so anxious right now. I\u2019m spiralling a bit. \n\nBut also I feel proud. This morning when I walked downstairs I told my mum this is what I was going to do today. Nothing else is working, may as well just try it for a day. She burst into tears. \n\nI owe it to those around me to stick at this. I owe it to myself.",

I had been at the stage where I could eat what others cooked but with alterations. For example, if dad was cooking crumbed chicken I\u2019d have that but ask for it not to be crumbed. Or if they were making roast veggies, I\u2019d have the roast veggies but made in a seperate tray with no oil etc etc \n\nWELL!\n\nLast night dad made crumbed fresh fish with home made French fries. You best believe I had the dish crumbed (and I went back for seconds when only one other person did too!) and I had the potatoes cooked in oil! \n\nBefore this I enjoyed nibbling on a cheese/grazing platter. I had Camembert cheese for the first time since 2021! \n\nAdmittedly, looking back, I could have pushed myself harder with the cheese platter but that\u2019s okay. Next time. \n\nThen for dessert we had baked fruit with ice cream (I had extra ice cream!). Then I had tea and a couple of chocolates! \n\nI struggled getting to sleep because I was overthinking, but it was so worth it. \n\nTo anyone out there wondering if to take the leap: try it. One day. Just try one day. You can do it! \n\nPS \nThe dinner guests stayed over so mum is going to cook up a big Shakshuka for breakfast - I will join in! And for lunch I think I\u2019m going to go get GYG (an Australian Mexican fast food chain) \ud83e\udd73",
