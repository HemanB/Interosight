Get More Sleep\r  \nGoing to bed a bit earlier or setting your alarm clock a little later is a simple strategy to help you reach and maintain a healthy weight. In fact, several studies associate sufficient sleep with weight loss.\r  \n One 10-year study linked sleeping fewer than 6 hours per night to a higher risk of obesity among young women.  \r  \nAnother small study showed that getting 1 less hour of sleep per night led to less fat loss in people following a low calorie diet, compared with a control group \r  \nOther research indicates that a lack of sleep may contribute to alterations in hunger hormones, increased appetite, and a higher risk of obesity\r  \nAlthough everyone needs a different amount of sleep, most studies tie at least 7 hours of sleep per night to the most benefits for weight management and overall health\r  \nTo support a healthy sleep cycle, stick to a regular sleep schedule, limit your intake of caffeine in the evening, and minimize your use of electronic devices before bed.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n2.Eat more healthy fats \r  \n\r  \nA 12-month study associated following a mediterranean diet rich in healthy fats from olive oil and nuts with greater long-term weight loss, compared with a low fat diet.\r  \nAnother review linked diets enriched with olive oil to greater reductions in body weight and belly fat compared with diets without olive oil\r  \nWhat\u2019s more, increased intake of trans fats \u2014 a type of fat often found in fried or processed foods \u2014 is associated with increased long-term weight gain\r  \nOlive oil, coconut oil, avocados, nuts, and seeds are just a few examples of nutritious fats that can benefit your health.\r  \n\r  \nKeep in mind that healthy fat is still high in calories, so it\u2019s important to moderate your intake. Instead of eating more fat overall, try swapping fried foods, processed ingredients, and refined oils for the healthy varieties above.\r  \n3. Drink unsweetened beverages.\r  \n\r  \nSwapping out sugary drinks for healthier selections is one of the easiest ways to promote long-term, sustainable fat loss.\r  \nFor example, sugar-sweetened beverages like Soda are often packed with calories and offer little nutritional value. Alcohol is also high in calories and may lower inhibitions, which may increase your risk of overeating.\r  \nStudies have associated drinking both sugar-sweetened beverages and alcohol with a higher risk of excess belly fat\r  \nAccording to one small study in 14 young men, drinking 1 pint (570 mL) of water before a meal increased feelings of fullness, reduced hunger, and decreased the number of calories eaten during the meal. \r  \nhttps://sites.google.com/view/thehottestplant-basedoffer/home",
