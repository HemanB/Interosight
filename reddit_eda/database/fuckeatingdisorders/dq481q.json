  "selftext": "Avocado toast with some eggs. (It was delicious.) Normally, I fast for a large part of the day, but I decided to experiment with eating breakfast to see how that would feel.\n\nWhen I fast, I have noticed that I feel bloated and it takes me a very long time to feel satiated when I start eating. It's as if my body suddenly realizes yes, there is food coming, and so it starts screaming at me to eat more, which leads me to eat a lot, which makes me feel uncomfortable.",

Theirs no limits to how long I can go without eating, but as soon as I eat anything I want more.  \n\nMy bf has been bugging me to eat more than just dinner all week. Today I made myself eat a hard boiled egg around 2pm! It seemed to make him happy which makes me happy. Thought I\u2019d share because you seem like you\u2019d relate/understand. \n\nAwesome job bytheway. :)",
