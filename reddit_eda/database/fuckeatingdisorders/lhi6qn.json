I didn\u2019t get my period until I surpassed my pre-ED weight by responding to every single hunger cue (be it mental or physical hunger)\n\nIf you\u2019re not experiencing extreme hunger, then I\u2019m not sure. The only advice I can give is to give up exercise and eat a lot but I\u2019m sure you\u2019re already doing that. If you don\u2019t mind me asking, how long have you been recovering?",
