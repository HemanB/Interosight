  "selftext": "I run a gym, he's a friend, and I know he was saying it as a compliment. I had been doing really really well in recovery after a bad breakdown a few years ago and the subsequent years of therapy. It's been harder recently for a variety of reasons, and I recognize that I've gone back to doing some things that I greatly enjoy but really serve ED.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe said that to me last night while I was teaching a (bootcamp style) class and I thought I was going to start crying right there. I'm 30 years old. I'm successful at work, I compete in a strength sport, I shouldn't be offended by a compliment like that, but now my appetite is completely gone again. I hate this. It never stops.",

      "body": "I think comments like that upset my emotional equilibrium so dramatically because they play right into deep fears about myself and about how I\u2019m perceived by others. There\u2019s a tsunami of old thoughts and feelings and action urges. I can\u2019t really logic my way out of it, but there are some tools I can use to shape my response.\n\n\nSaying,  \u201cHey, that\u2019s old thinking.\u201d helps me separate myself from the thought. My unhelpful and unhealthy thoughts often *feel* true just because I\u2019ve thought them so intensely for so long. And also because I\u2019ve taught myself they\u2019re true by acting as though they\u2019re true. But it turns out thoughts that feel reallly true can still be total lies.\n\n\nThen I have to *act* on new healthier thoughts instead of the old. Whichever thought I choose to act on is the thought I will strengthen. So over and over and over the question arises...which will I choose? I don\u2019t do it perfectly by any means. But even a small start is enough for a shift and I\u2019m hopeful that momentum will build. <3",

      "body": "Reiterating all of the comments by other posters. I couldn\u2019t have said any of it better myself.\n\nBody comments are extremely triggering; it\u2019s often a lose-lose situation. If someone says I look \u201cgood,\u201d my mind spins, trying to put a definition to \u201cgood.\u201d If someone says I look thin, my mind spins just as fast, again focusing solely on semantics (which will never be good enough to match what the eating disorder wants to hear/feel).\n\nIt would be extremely helpful if body comments, in general, weren\u2019t so commonly exchanged in every day interactions. Unfortunately, it\u2019s unavoidable. What we can do for ourselves is strengthen the voice of our true selves by working to actively rewire those outdated, negative neural pathways with new thoughts/beliefs. The work is hard, but trusting that the effort and time are worth it. You aren\u2019t alone. \ud83d\udc9b",
