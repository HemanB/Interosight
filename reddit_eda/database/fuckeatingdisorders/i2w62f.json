  "selftext": "I've been really working at eating breakfast for recovery these past few months. Prior to this, I was either \"fasting\" or asleep during breakfast time. If this wasn't the case, I would eat something non-substantial to try and hold me over until I \"should\" be eating.\n\nFollowing recovery pages on Instagram exposed me to a lot of oatmeal pictures? I know this sounds weird but bear with me. And I've found them really exciting. The bowls always look so delicious and they always have a variety of toppings. I think I'm lowkey obsessed with them? I save so many pictures with the intention of recreating them and I genuinely look forward to dressing a bowl up in the morning. They've also been a great way for me to reintroduce lots of things I would have avoided prior to this (cookie/nut butters, dried fruit, nuts, etc.) I'm nearly halfway through my gigantic tub of peanut butter and I am elated beyond words.\n\nI don't really have a point here and I just wanted to geek out about oatmeal",
