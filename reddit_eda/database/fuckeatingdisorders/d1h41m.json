  "title": "\u201cYou don\u2019t choose an eating disorder, but you do choose recovery\u201d",
  "selftext": "A year ago today, I received a call from my GP urging me to go to the ER right away. I rolled my eyes over the phone, feeling frustrated and misunderstood. Did I *really* need to go? I *felt* fine. As soon as she hung up, my thoughts and emotions froze, leaving only one thing on my mind: \u201cYou need to exercise if you\u2019re going to sit in a waiting room\u201d. I obeyed.\n\nA few hours later I was admitted for cardiac abnormalities secondary to my eating disorder.\n\nThe voice that told me to exercise when my heart was in critical condition is the same voice that follows me around every day. When I take transit, it tells me not to sit down, and god forbid I take the escalators. When I follow my meal-plan it tells me I\u2019m greedy and failing. When I\u2019m invited for lunch it tells me not to go, insisting that others around me are trying to make me fat.\n\nI am now eight months into recovery, and still argue with this voice thousands of times every day. The only way to completely shut it off is by doing what it says. As enticing as it sounds to have this constant battle with yourself every day, I didn\u2019t choose this. It is absolutely exhausting, and at times I feel so drained from the chatter that I end up giving in and doing what it wants me to do. For me it\u2019s not a matter of just \u201cchoosing recovery\u201d, as so many people prescribe it to be.\n\nIgnoring the thoughts and choosing to go out for lunch is tremendously hard. At times I find myself paralyzed when ordering, feeling incapable of \u201cchoosing recovery\u201d and I end up getting what my eating disorder voice deems \u201csafe\u201d. I decided I wanted a life without anorexia when I put myself on treatment waiting lists. Wanting a life outside of an eating disorder doesn\u2019t mean making a single choice to recover, it means having to make thousands of choices every day while ignoring the screaming in your head.\n\nThe idea that you can choose recovery minimizes how difficult it is to stop eating disorder behaviours. I told myself over and over: *tomorrow is going to be different, I don\u2019t want to feel like this anymore*, but I wasn\u2019t able to change much without specialized treatment. Even within the eating disorder community, I have been shamed for having slips because I\u2019m not \u201cchoosing recovery\u201d. If it was as simple as choosing recovery, there wouldn\u2019t be millions of people suffering from eating disorders. People wouldn\u2019t need to return to treatment, and eating disorders wouldn\u2019t have the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric illness.\n\nI wish it was as simple as choosing recovery. It would make it a hell of a lot easier for me and all of my supports if I could simply make the choice to get better.\n\nI am trying.\n\nIf someone you love is struggling with an eating disorder, be patient with them. Don\u2019t get angry with them when they\u2019re struggling, instead channel that anger towards their illness. Recovery is a process that takes years, and it\u2019s never linear. We're all doing our best.",
