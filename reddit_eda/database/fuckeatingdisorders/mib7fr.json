  "title": "Just wanna shout-out all of us dealing with digestive issues because shit is rough (literally)",
  "selftext": "Farting in public, and I mean everywhere because you literally cannot hold it in. They smell horrendous too.\nSitting on the toilet for 30 minutes praying to God you get something out and the ultimate relief when the absolute rock of solid finally comes out after a week.\nYour body holding onto everything you put in it and your belly looking and feeling like it's about to bust wide open.\nConstantly living in baggy clothing because of the extreme bloat. \n\nIf you know, you know. And if you don't know, you're still as fucking valid as the next guy so stop comparing because I'm so darn tootin proud of you too. \n\nIt's embarrassing but it's something to be proud of. I'm still on doctor prescribed go-go medicine but it's nice to not have to rely on laxatives anymore to \"clean me out.\" I'm finding joy in the little things (poops).\n\nIt's really fucking uncomfortable between the bloating, gas, pain, and everything in between especially on top of nourishing yourself but it does start to get better. And I think the digestive parts are not celebrated in recovery as much as they should be because it is So. Fucking. Rough. But it has been one of my biggest struggles and I know I'm not the only one. \n\nBe proud of yourself for sticking it out through it. It's not taken as seriously as it should but for working through it, no matter how uncomfortable or just straight triggering it is, you're still going. Keep going (and hopefully more regularly) :)",
