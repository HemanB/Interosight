  "selftext": "... that this is pretty much the only ED related subreddit that doesn\u2019t openly encourage behaviors.\n\nI\u2019m bulimic and I made the mistake to go to r/bulimia and oh my GOD.\n\nI understand not being ready to recover and venting about your experience or sharing harm reduction tactics which can promote recovery steps eventually but openly asking if bulimia helps with fat loss? Asking people if they lost or gained weight \u201cwith\u201d bulimia? As if it\u2019s like the new version of keto or something... \n\nI just unleashed my frustration in one of the posts and while I\u2019m not proud of it, I very much thing it was justified.\n\nAm I being a self righteous jerk? Can someone weigh in on this?\n\nOh and by the way I\u2019m so glad to have you guys and this community. I\u2019d probably end up having a stroke hunched on top of my toilet or keep running half marathons five days a week and call myself a recovered \u201cfitness guru\u201d if it weren\u2019t for you all.\n\nEDIT\nGuys OP just messaged me and told me that I\u2019m a deranged person and I should seek medical attention asap because I got so riled up about a \u201crandom question\u201d. What\u2019s more, the mods are with OP. I just... I don\u2019t even understand the world anymore.",

It definitely sounds like they're talking about it as though it's a diet, just something they want to try to lose weight. (Like binging and purging makes you lose weight somehow?? I mean sure, if you're just throwing up meals you'll lose weight but does this person not know that bulimia involves binging too? Yeah, that's great for weight loss /s). And they sounded super bummed when people said no. \n\nMaybe I'm just being an asshole or whatever but it sounded like they were lowkey looking for tips. Asking this question, hoping people would say yes so that they can try it when the consensus turns out to be actually no, it doesn't make you lose weight (ah, what a bummer /s), doesn't seem to belong in a recovery sub. Someone made the argument that the responses saying no is exactly why it belongs there but I think that's a load of crap. That was not the intent of the post. \n\nI didn't see your initial comment that was removed, but totally agree with your other comments. That whole post/thread kinda has pissed me off a bit lol",
