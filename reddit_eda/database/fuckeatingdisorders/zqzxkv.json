  "selftext": "First, to clarify, I\u2019m not on death\u2019s door, I don\u2019t mean that kind of wake up call.\n\nBut I\u2019m 34. I\u2019ve had this disorder for 20 years, and have avoided getting a DEXA scan since the one I got in 2004. And I now know why.\n\nBecause today, I was informed I have full-blown osteoporosis. At 34. And that\u2019s one of the only irreversible conditions/effects of this disorder. If I were younger, under 30, even, I would have a better chance at rebuilding bone mineral density.\n\nBut now\u2026the best I can hope for is first and foremost trying to keep aiming for nutritional rehabilitation, and taking meds as a second line defense to halt further bone density loss. I can\u2019t get it back. \n\nI can\u2019t get 20 years of my life back. I can\u2019t get back my ability to do the things I love the most (sports like ice skating and skateboarding) without major danger. I can\u2019t get back the years in which I probably would have been able to have my own children.\n\nI\u2019m 34 years old, and I feel stupid for being this upset at this news, but also\u2026I\u2019m just 34. It feels suffocating to think about the reality of this not getting better, and the best case scenario just being pausing the damage that\u2019s been done.\n\nFuck these disorders. Fuck EDs for not letting us see how much danger we\u2019re in. Fuck the ED denial that tells us we\u2019re the one person who won\u2019t have [problem X]. And most of all, fuck me for not finding a way to break free for 2 freaking decades, until this damage was done.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for the tone, I\u2019m just lying here on my bed in tears, beating myself up for this extremely real wake/up call of a physical issue as a result of this mental freaking illness and it all feels so\u2026exhaustingly overwhelming. I\u2019m so mad that I relapsed majorly last year without realizing until it was too late. And I hate myself for not being able to keep this from happening.\n\nBecause like the title says\u2026I was the exception\u2026until I wasn\u2019t. This hurts. Badly.\n\nedit: typos fixed because I\u2019m an idiot who didn\u2019t proofread",

That tends to slow down in late 20s-30ish, but I wouldn\u2019t stop doing everything I could if I were you. If there\u2019s any chance at all you could even reverse some of it, I wish you all the luck in the world. You absolutely shouldn\u2019t have to deal with this at age 21. Thank you for taking time to read and comment; sending all the love and best wishes for any success your way.",

You're welcome <3 \n\nI'm so so glad about your husband. Having even just a bit of emotional support is very helpful. I can really empathise with how you feel, it doesn't only affect you, but those who love you, too. If anything, it's good motivation to keep you going - you want a better life for your husband, and he's happy if you're happy and healthy and safe, so you're striving to achieve just that. It's tough and it's gonna take a lot of mental energy, but I know you can do it. You sound really strong and mature and capable, and you have a great support system. Gaining back some of that control over your body is also going to do wonders for your self esteem, imo - once you get to the point of gaining your health back, doing things you love, seeing your husband proud and joyful and not worried about you anymore. The future is looking so, so bright. This, right now, is shit, and it hurts, and it's scary, and you must be so full of regrets, but there is so much love and fun ahead. You just have to get there. It's going to be so worth it. \n\nI'm really proud of you for realising how bad this got, and for having the motivation to change your future. It's amazing, I think it's what we all strive for with this disorder. You're really strong.",

I try to do that a lot for people in my life, and it really means a lot when I encounter anyone else who does the same, so thank you. \n\nThankfully I have an extremely supportive husband, and I have an excellent outpatient team that I\u2019m very fortunate to be able to work with right now, all of whom are very compassionate, empathetic, and eager to help me in any way they can. \n\nI don\u2019t know how in the world my husband has stuck with me throughout all of this bull crap, but I couldn\u2019t be more thankful that he has, because I couldn\u2019t ask for a better partner in all of this. Part of the reason I\u2019m so pissed off at this disorder is because of everything it\u2019s taken from him because it stolen ME. \n\nAnd he is the sole reason I\u2019m continuing to fight, because if I didn\u2019t have him, and I got this news\u2026I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d have it in me to keep fighting. I\u2019m definitely not to a point where I really want this for myself yet, but I\u2019m hoping that going through the motions for him, and at least knowing that I don\u2019t want us to live the life we\u2019re currently living, I\u2019m OK with feeling like shit going through this process if it means he gets any relief, or gets any of his wife back.",
