I'm cramping and in pain nearly every day. Im crying on the floor right now because i feel so fucking hopeless. \n\n90% of people recover and their digestion heals. Then there is me. 7 years of pain. 7 years of not doing things I want to do because of how bad my cramping is. Fucking fuck eating disorders. \n\n\nFuck doctors who are uneducated and unhelpful about eating disorders. I just want someone or something to actually help.",

Having an eating disorder and recovering can really mess with normal gut bacteria and can lead to bloating, bowel issues, pain, inflammation, basically anything. This isn't something that a lot of  medical doctors test for or treat  as much as naturopaths/nutritionists/functional medicine doctors or hollistic practioners in general. This might be useful if you've gotten tested for a lot of other things but ur results have come back clear (like mine lol) But its worth looking into/finding a practitioner who treats it! Look up SIBO or gut dysbiosis on google. Finding a doc who does GI mapping or hydrogen breath tests can help u figure out if u have any bacterial imbalance issues :)",
