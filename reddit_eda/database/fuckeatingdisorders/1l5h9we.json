  "selftext": "This morning, I decided I\u2019m not putting my life on pause anymore.\n\nI had my favorite biscuits, and then I made myself a big, creamy bowl of porridge. No weighing the oats. I added banana, a nice chunk of peanut butter, and cinnamon, because I love it. I even made myself an oat cappuccino to go with it.\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t perfect. It felt a little rushed. My belly felt warm and full and weird, and I honestly didn\u2019t know if I liked it or not. But I kept telling myself: this is what freedom feels like before it starts feeling safe.\n\nNo more fasting days. No more life on hold until I reach the \u201cperfect\u201d number. That number will never be enough, but this life and this moment is:)\n\nI\u2019m terrified.\nBut I\u2019m here.\nAnd I\u2019m doing it scared.\n\nTo anyone still stuck in it: I see you. And I know it's not going to be easy, but hey, lets chose living today.\u2764\ufe0f",
