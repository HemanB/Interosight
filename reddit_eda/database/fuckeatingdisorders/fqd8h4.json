  "selftext": "I\u2019m at a point with my weight that if I lost ten pounds due to illness, I would die. I don\u2019t want to die. \n\nEvery day for the past two weeks I have eaten over 2000 calories of good, nutritious, healthy food. Save for the occasional binge, I have averaged 1100 calories or less for the past two years. Man it feels bad psychologically to see the number on the scale ever so slowly creep up but I must survive. \n\nI\u2019ve gained two pounds and I\u2019m going to fucking beat this thing. \nThat\u2019s all.\n\nEdit: WOW! I\u2019ve never posted here before and was just wanting to put my thoughts down somewhere concrete and verbalize the commitment I\u2019ve made to myself. I never expected such an outpouring of love and support and camaraderie. \n\nTo all that commented, liked, saw this: I LOVE YOU ALL!!!! Keep fighting.",
