  "selftext": "Hi!\n\nWhen i was in the middle of my anorexia to like three weeks ago (a long time!), I was completely obsessed with food. Every weekend, I would \\*treat myself\\* by riding my bike twenty miles to a bookstore to look at cookbooks for a few hours (is that not the *most* disordered shit you've ever heard?? It makes me laugh now how did I not know..?). I watched cooking TV shows only. My 'For You' pages on YouTube and Instagram were 100% food and eating related, because that's the content I interacted with. I went on this subreddit, as well as a few other food/ed related ones constantly. \n\nI can say now that being over a month into real recovery, there is room for *so much more* in my brain than there was. I completely forgot this page existed for a while. The algorithms are starting to give me non-food things. I'm reading poetry, not recipes.   \n\nIt's so possible.",
