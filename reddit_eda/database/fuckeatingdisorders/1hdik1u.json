It takes time and buy-in though.\n\nBut to answer your actual question, I would say the goal is true \"neutrality\" towards food/eating/body image/etc. Where it doesn't take up much of your brainspace, you can enjoy food without obsessing over it, and you choose what to eat based on what sounds good combined with what you think will make you feel good based on past experience and what you're craving, \"cravings\" being not that intense. Where eating is sometimes even just boring and necessary. Where you can eat more one day and less another and not worry about it. Where the voice in your head doesn't scream at you and hasn't for a long time.",
