  "selftext": "It\u2019s only been a week so far and the physical pain has been EXCRUCIATING at times, as has the bloating and edema, extreme hunger, all of that jazz. I\u2019ve had bad days, but also good days (or maybe neutral days is a better word?).\n\nI noticed the other day, but just now specifically as I saw this super funny meme, that I laugh A LOT now. Like, I\u2019ve always had a great sense of humor and I\u2019m pretty witty in general but just talking to my boyfriend about certain things and joking with each other, I will just burst into genuine fucking laughter like I never have in SO FUCKING LONG and it feels so good.\n\nAnd honestly, if I can feel this good ALREADY, then I don\u2019t even care about all the bad stuff. I think being able to laugh and love so fully this early on is so much more worth it than being in a \u201cbeautiful and skinny\u201d body that\u2019s obviously killing me anyway. Fuck my eating disorder, I CAN LAUGH AGAIN AND ITS THE BEST THING EVER.",
