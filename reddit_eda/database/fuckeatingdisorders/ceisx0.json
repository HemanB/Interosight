  "title": "My PTSD therapist tried to confide in me about how crazy her ED patients are. Okay.",
  "selftext": "She went off on a tangent about how a few of her other patients were counting calories. Can't remember how we even got on the topic.\n\nApparently someone was freaking out today!\n\n*Because a cookie had [insert #] calories!*\n\nI looked shocked - because in what universe was that *not* an insane amount of kCal for a cookie? Hard sympathy vibes for the actual cookie bitch, wherever she is.\n\nThe doc mistook my shock and started laughing. \"Right?! Who *does* that! Who counts the calories in *cookies?!\".*\n\nUm...well, the traumatized, insane, senseless weirdos who keep you employed, I guess.\n\nI had told her initially that I have no food problems (wanted to just work on handling PTSD symptoms first), so I guess she thought I'd Get It.\n\nInstead, it just haunts me a little every time I've see a cookie within the last week.\n\nMight ask for a referral this week. She's also clearly forgotten 3 times that my mom died six months ago, and that's why I originally contacted her; she's clearly overloaded, yet not admitting it. But if I'm being honest, the cookie thing might've been a dealbreaker.\n\nI don't feel so good, Mr. Stark.",
