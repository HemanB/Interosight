  "selftext": "decided to do an experiment today and went the whole day without snacking. my ED brain tells me 3 meals (in recovery) is all I need, but my 3 meals are pretty small so I need to eat between meals to keep my energy up. today was to prove once and for all that snacks actually are necessary because I have felt pretty weak and low in energy all day. \n\nso about half an hour ago I decided to get a snack because I realised mum was making dinner and it would still be a while (even though me and my therapist have decided to have designated food times of 10am, 2pm and 6pm). my dad left the room while I was making it and then they called to me from the kitchen and said not to ruin my appetite just before dinner.\n\nfuck.\n\nso that's proof that they talked about my eating behind my back, they have judged me for having a snack. they didn't think me having a snack was necessary so close to dinner time. but I feel so weak! I just feel so ashamed right now. my mind is going crazy about how I shouldn't have had it, I should have just waited. they think I'm weak-willed and have no self control. I'm angry too because I TOLD them I wanted to make my own meals so I can stick to the schedule and have dinner at 6. no. they took that away from me and judged me for having a snack.\n\nI know I'm overreacting to a tiny, inconsequential comment. I have realised my recovery is actually a lot more fragile than I imagined and thats such a frightening and depressing reality.",

I\u2019ve heard my parents say that to eachother and myself a lot. It\u2019s a very common comment. But I understand why it is hurtful to you, and now I think you should sit down with your parents if they are aware of your ED and recovery, and explain to them that comments about your eating are hurtful.\n\nKeep going, friend. I\u2019m proud of you.",

I know that it really sucks to get triggered by off-handed comments about your eating habits, especially if you\u2019re early into recovery.  Have you said anything to them about it?  If not, you should probably explain to them that it\u2019s not helpful to make comments like that.",

      "body": "It\u2019s good that you can recognize when your ED brain is overreacting. But also, even though it\u2019s seen as a normal thing to do and I\u2019m sure they have good intentions, it\u2019s not okay for people to comment on and police what you chose to eat in recovery. I would be upset if this happened, too - and I\u2019m a year and a half into recovery! I\u2019ve worked so hard to get to a point where I can eat whatever I want, and if someone says \u201cdon\u2019t eat that\u201d I\u2019d freak out a little bit (though everyone in my family also knows better at this point). \n\nIt\u2019s also awesome that you decided to have a snack. That\u2019s a huge accomplishment!!",

Today she even made a similar comment and it still triggers me so badly. Just know that you know your body best, nobody knows what\u2019s best for you better than you. You were absolutely right to eat if you felt faint, you shouldn\u2019t have to justify eating at anytime to anyone! Please know that it\u2019s totally normal to feel triggered by a comment like that and please don\u2019t let it set you back. You got this!",
