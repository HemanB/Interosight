  "selftext": "Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m all for plus and mid size representation! Please we want more of it! Their bodies are healthy and beautiful and we don\u2019t see enough of them.\n\nTW: BMI\n\nWe\u2019re all tired of seeing actors and models in the 17-20 bmi range. But we know bmi is BS (I never got below a bmi of 20 even at the height of my illness though I did lose my period and slept 14 hours a day). However, plus size and mid size models are getting more attention and this is awesome. But if you look at pediatric growth charts, you\u2019ll find that the 50th percentile for bmi is somewhere in the 22 bmi range. This is around where I am and I feel like I never see any representation around here since it\u2019s neither skinny nor thick. DAE feel this way?\n\nUsually if I do see ppl in this category, they have hella ass or muscles or something. If anyone knows of any actors or models in this category who just have like average bodies I\u2019d love to hear so I can see some inspiration. \n\nAlso:",

There are people with low/normal BMI who have a wide waistline or wide shoulders and so on. Women don't all have  hourglass figures and that's okay!
