  "selftext": "hello and fuuuuck eating disorders. i have been reading through the posts by the members of this community and i feel immensely less alone. it is so rare to find a community like this, and i thank you all for sharing your stories. i feel a huge sense of solidarity and belonging as i join you. \n\ni have been struggling with anorexia for 10 years now, diagnosed for 7 years. i have been in intensive eating disorder treatment twice, once when i was 17 and once when i was 19, and have been to inpatient more times than i can count on my hands. i am 23 now, and as pathetic as it makes me feel, anorexia is a part of my identity that i have no idea how to let go of. \n\ni hate living like this. i am tired of feeling so sick and weak but i feel so repulsed by food most of the time. it is constant physical and mental anguish. \n\ni wish i could go back and visit my younger self, throw away that computer i spent endless time browsing pro-ana tumblr, and tell myself just how badly i am going to fuck up my life by doing this. in my young impressionable mind it seemed so glamorous to live this way. that rabbit hole of thinspo, and toxic tips and tricks to lose weight, slowly broke me. so slowly that i didn\u2019t even realize at first that i had really developed an eating disorder. i felt like a fraud emulating the lifestyles of these bloggers i idolized, but i was a child who needed help. \n\nat this point i don\u2019t know if i will ever recover. i feel i am in far too deep now. i am simultaneously disgusted by my underweight body and disgusted by any body fat i have. i have a heart condition i brought on to myself with this behavior. i wish there was some sort of magic hypnotism that would fix my brain. i\u2019m so frustrated with myself. \n\nthank you to anyone who has read my post. i haven\u2019t been to therapy since before the pandemic and it\u2019s been rough. i bottle this up most of the time because i don\u2019t want to worry the people i love. take care, everyone.",
