  "selftext": "I would like to disclose that buying a fitbit or other fitness device is not a good idea as they're immensely triggering.\n\nI was messing around with the diet plan feature and when I entered in a goal weight that was higher than my current weight, it said that it does not support weight gain even though I'm underweight... this is unbelievable. The best it could do is provide a diet plan that would support weight meintainence. I wasn't planning on using my fitbit to track calories anyway, but this is just another bulletpoint on the list of ways society demonises weight gain even when it's the healthy thing to do. Im actually angry about this. Its essentially saying that the only acceptable direction your weight can go is downwards... its so damaging...",
