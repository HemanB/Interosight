I'm waiting for an inpatient spot, but because I do not look sick I always get pushed aside. They say your health has to be in danger to enter an inpatient program. Pardon me? Of course I'm sick. I cry when I look in the mirror, I am bulimic, I don't get my period, my thyroid is out of control, I'm type 1 diabetic. \nI'm right there with you. I've been told so many times, \"you have an eating disorder? You aren't skinny!\" Thanks that made me feel great.",
