(I didn't even tell her I had eating issues for the first year, which I wouldn't recommend, but I wasn't ready to give it up yet.) She worked with me on the underlying problems, and was eventually able to convince me to have appointments with a dietician. That was the most important mental health work I've done, because it made long-term healing possible. I'd still be in that cycle if it wasn't for her.\n\nI said all that to say...don't give up.
