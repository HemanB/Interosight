  "title": "Two years of severe anorexia, got my period back today. I feel like a failure, but I know I\u2019m not",
  "selftext": "Well, it happened. My period came back.\n\nIt was so bizarre to dig through boxes of stored stuff and find my pads again. Totally unopened. It felt even weirder to wake up again today and realise, oh, the period thing.\n\nThis means I have enough nutrition to keep feeding my body. I can\u2019t help but feel like a failure. Like anorexia is telling me, this means you\u2019re fat. Skinniness was all you had. Losing your period was a tribute to how beautiful and thin you were.\n\nMy sister is the only one who knows. She told me, she gets her period and  that she\u2019s not overweight. That I should accept that if I continued doing a balancing act of relapse and recovery, that my period would never return and this living hell would be so much worse.\n\nWeirdly enough, despite getting my period and ED telling me I\u2019m fat now or I will be, I have no desire to restrict. Like the sensible part of my brain is just, \u201cWE ARENT DOING THIS NO PERIOD THING AGAIN.\u201d\n\nBut, yeah. Thought I\u2019d say it. Is it normal to bloat on your period? I think this is good news? I\u2019m going to exist today and pretend I\u2019m just my younger self who didn\u2019t bat an eye at a period. Because it\u2019s normal!",
