  "selftext": "During the height of my ED I was convinced I hadn\u2019t caused any significant harm to my body and that my behaviors were normal. Only long into recovery was I able to recognize how much damage had been done, much of which no one ever mentioned to me while I was restricting. \n\n1. Hair falling out\n2. Puffy face \n3. My GI system is a wreck \n4. Lowered Intelligence \n5. Memory loss and inability to retain new memories  \n6. Horrible concentration  \n7. A body that doesn\u2019t trust you\n\nIf you are thinking about recovery and keep pushing it off, please go and start right now. Don\u2019t wait. Recover. The sooner you start, the better it will be in the long run.\n\nEdit: there were so many other consequences but I am just listing the ones I feel were the most unexpected/not as commonly mentioned (for me at least)",
