I\u2019d recommend looking up info about the body neutrality movement, which is much more in line with the logic you\u2019re describing - a movement trying to shift away from the need to be beautiful at all, or to ascribe so much value to traits like beauty. Personally I think that\u2019s a much more logical and helpful way of thinking than trying to convince myself that every part of the way I look is beautiful.",

For some people they are, and I don't want to invalidate that, but EDs can happen for all sorts of reasons and just like any other mental illness need specific, individualized treatment, not sappy platitudes.\n\nAlso, as someone who is genetically predetermined to have more of a \"boyish\" body shape I really dislike the whole \"real women have curves\" movement.  Actually, when you think about it the idea that you have to have the curves of a Kardashian to be a real woman is pretty transphobic, and probably ableist as well.  I really prefer the idea that body size doesn't matter, taking care of your health as best you can does.",

Not being able to do the things I want with my body really changed my attitude about it, in a good way overall. I focus on how my body feels (pain/no pain, tight or sore vs relaxed) and whether I'm able to get up and do what I want to do. Whether I'm beautiful is pretty low on the priority list right now. \n\nAlso, I think it's important to acknowledge that not all people are equally beautiful, and that's ok. I dont' have to be beautiful to deserve human rights, or to be treated with respect. Idk I have a lot of thoughts about this and I don't want to write an essay, but I think you're on to something.",

I see all these people who are \"recovered\" or \"in recovery\" whose profiles are basically just countless body pics. I respect that if that's what helps them, but I personally believe that recovery should be about shifting your focus away from food and body issues entirely. \n\nThis honestly holds true for the \"fat acceptance\" movement as well - again, it's absolutely great that you feel confident in whatever appearance or body size you have and you can live your recovery however you want but I don't know, equating yourself with your body or your looks just strikes me as a little bit problematic and a little bit too similar to what so many people with EDs do.\n\nAnd yeah, you don't need to be \"beautiful\" to have a good life. I am quite ugly honestly. I know that, everyone knows that, and it's okay. I can get by without being told or convincing myself that I'm attractive.",

They\u2019re still my body. I don\u2019t need to find something beautiful in order to not hate it. THAT is the sort of black-and-white, rigid thinking that honestly got me into a really bad spot.

I don\u2019t have an ED (my little sister I look after does), but I\u2019ve found that one of the great things about getting older is that less focus is placed on how you look aesthetically. This is especially the case since I\u2019ve got pregnant; there\u2019s a lot less social pressure to look \u2018beautiful\u2019 and instead people focus on how you are producing/have produced a human, which is an amazing feat. It almost like as you get older and go through stages of life, people no longer focus on your outer beauty, but instead also look at what you\u2019ve accomplished. It\u2019s just sad that that same perspective isn\u2019t used for young girls too.",
