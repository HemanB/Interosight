Like I had someone ask me once if I was starving myself and I'm like \"yeah...technically I am always starving, I constantly eat at a calorie deficient below my means.\" like I had just gotten done complaining about my anorexia to them too which is why I  was even more confused by their question. Then they said \"No, I mean like are you actually eating any food? I already know you're not eating enough most days. I was more worried about you not eating at all.\" Like jeez...both are still very harmful for you lol.",

It just adds to the bullshit idea that people with eating disorders somehow exist on water and oxygen alone. I know that even during the height of my anorexia, I still ate multiple meals every single day. If anything, the more malnourished I became, the more I *had* to consume something at regular intervals in order to prevent dangerously low blood sugar levels. \n\nI've known people who passed away due to anorexia and they were consuming regular 'meals' right up until the end.",
