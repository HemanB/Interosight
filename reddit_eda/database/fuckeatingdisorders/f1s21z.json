  "selftext": "what is proving that you\u2019re sick?\n\nproving you\u2019re sick can look like:\nconstantly reminding others of your lowest bmi / weight\ntalking about numbers as a gauge for how sick you were / are (calories, sizes, pounds, etc.)\nreminding others of how much / how many times a day / how long you engaged in ED behaviors for  \nposting pictures of you at your lowest weight (!!!)\nflaunting your inpatient / hospital admissions \nflaunting a feeding tube\netc etc.\n\nwhy is this behavior problematic? because it reinforces the idea that you\u2019re not sick / not sick enough if you haven\u2019t been that low of a bmi, or if you haven\u2019t been underweight, or if you have an eating disorder other than anorexia, if you haven\u2019t been inpatient / hospitalized, etc etc. there is no need to prove you\u2019re sick. the right people will believe you. i believe you. \n\n\nif you feel the need to prove you were / are sick ask yourself why. do you want to prove you\u2019re sick, or does the eating disorder? would you benefit from this or would the eating disorder? practice self validation. don\u2019t potentially trigger others for the sake of validating your eating disorder.",
