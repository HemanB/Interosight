  "selftext": "I'm eating at a reasonable caloric intake and I've come face to face with the reality that, even though my body needs calories, I can't just eat sugary snacks and protein bars to get there. In order to un-fuck my body, I gotta eat *real* food. That's rough. I love protein bars. Eating a package of beef jerky instead of a protein bar is a rough switch. But i can handle the volume of food now, so i gotta stop with the constant protein bar and granola bar diet bc my body can't heal unless i give it actual nutrients. I miss when the goal was just \"calories at any cost\".",

Have you spoken with a counselor or therapist about your childhood experiences? It seems to me those unpleasant experiences may be complicating your ED treatment, which I think is pretty common. I have a close friend from ED treatment who realized in therapy her childhood food insecurity was giving her a ton of anxiety around just grocery shopping and spending which fed her restriction habits.

Is there \"real\" food that has cultural significance for you? Basically, is there a way to reconnect food with pleasure or a positive personal connection from your lived experience? If not, is there some way for you to forge that connection again, through imagination or research or a combination of the two?\n\nEating disorder recovery can make mealtime a real chore, and while part of that is the simple accomplishment of eating (or eating without purging) but I think for long-term recovery, don't be afraid to find the pleasure in eating again - if that has any meaning to you. Maybe that's more in preparing the food than eating it. Maybe its shopping for ingredients. Maybe its discovering an old cookbook and remembering dishes from your memories. For me, its helped reconnect with a time when food and eating weren't so complicated and talked to death and full of emotional mines.",
