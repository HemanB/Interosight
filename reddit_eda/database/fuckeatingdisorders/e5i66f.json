If that makes sense.\n\n Giving those types of thoughts importance & keeping all that in the front of your mind just keeps you fixated on food. If you don't judge foods as morally wrong/bad/fattening/unhealthy or whatever then you have nothing to worry about, once the worry stops the food will no longer be at the forefront of your thoughts all the time & the food fixation & hunger will die down.\n\nIt's immensely difficult (believe me, I know!) but try to ignore the guilty thoughts & running number tallies. Behave as though they are unimportant & eventually you & your brain will learn that is true! With no restrictions & finally eating what your body asks of you it should *eventually* naturally find a range it is happy with & a comfortable consumption level with a variety of all foods. You don't need to judge or micromanage it. It just takes time.",

      "body": "It tends to ebb and flow like that for a while. Extreme hunger doesn't really have a specifically set timeline unfortunately (though I promise you, it does end). The best thing you can do right now is honestly to just try and lean into it, because the one thing that's more or less guaranteed to make extreme hunger last longer is if you try to deny it or restrict your food during it, that'll only make you hungrier for longer. The best way of getting through it is letting your body eat whatever it wants right now, and eventually, little by little, you'll start to notice it dying down on it's own.",
