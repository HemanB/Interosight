  "selftext": "No one really prepares you or tells you about how disgusting and painful recovery is.  \n\nWhen I first started recovering, I was bloating SO bad. My whole body was so swollen, especially in my face. If I ate literally slightly more than what I ate when I was anorexic, I would gain weight - just to give an idea of the bloating. I actually gained my weight rapidly after I let go of all the restrictions (like probably within a month or two?).  Let's not forget how painful it is to force-feed yourself 2500-3000 calories a day to gain weight. My stomach constantly felt like it was going to burst open from being so full. \n\nI ended up gaining quite a bit of weight and struggled with binging once my body was used to eating again. \n\nAfter about a year to a year and a half, my weight naturally fell back down to my set point. The bloating was completely gone. I ended up losing a bit of weight from my highest in recovery without changing my diet, really. \n\nAfter 2 years, I now eat 2000 calories + a day and my weight is in a completely healthy, slim range. I don't gain weight from having 1 calorie more of air like I did before, lol. It literally stays within the same range regardless of how much food I eat. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just wanted to share my win. I am so happy to finally have reached this place in my life where I can eat a little more without crying in my bed after lol.  Fuck eating disorders for taking so much of my life away, even through recovery.",

It was only actually this year that I committed to working out again and skating more seriously.  I don\u2019t really have a straight forward answer to it, but I really recommend doing some physical activity (like taking walks) that doesn\u2019t focus on building up your body.

Like my metabolism at the time was extremely messed up, I did some really severe damage to myself. :/ So I think it just takes time to reverse the damage. \n\nFrom what I can remember, I struggled with bloating for a very long time - I looked quite swollen everywhere for a period there, looking back at old pics now. But there was a point I hit where I was not actively gaining weight from eating a morsel of food, and my weight became relatively stable. The bloating eventually subsided after my weight stabilized (took some time). It was a long time ago now and at the time I kinda blocked out any thoughts about my body or what I was eating because it made me sad lol and was super triggering, so unfortunately this is as much as I remember. \n\nSide note - a recommendation I have is getting an instant pot / pressure cooker, if you\u2019re not much of a cook. I literally hated cooking, so I struggled with eating nutritious food (which I think exacerbated the symptoms). But I\u2019ve been able to make tons of nutritious food with low effort, and it has made a pretty extraordinary difference to my hair, nails, how I feel, bloating, etc. I lost like half of my hair during my ED and this is the only thing that has fixed that post recovery. \n\nHope it helps and congratulations on recovery!!! \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0a",

      "body": "I\u2019m much better now. It\u2019s been 3 years and a few months since I started by journey in ED recovery and I\u2019m so grateful I stuck it out. The weight gain process was so difficult. But it got better. One thing I did that was huge in my recovery after this post, was I found a different dietitian. I felt that the one I had just wasn\u2019t listening to my fears and concerns. She really seemed to have an agenda and made little judgements about every food I chose to eat. I remember I went to this restaurant once and I wanted something fresher for dinner so I chose this salmon dish with quinoa and pomegranate seeds. But she asked if another other meals had looked good on the menu. I said the pizza did. And she then told me I should have chosen the pizza. Back then I didn\u2019t trust myself yet. I worried my brain was somehow always tricking me into relapse. My dietitian spent a lot of time telling me my ED brain was and tricky and that I couldn\u2019t trust myself. This went against what I was learning in therapy \u2014 that I could trust myself. My therapist was telling me I was strong and capable and that I needed to show compassion and curiosity toward my feelings. My dietitian was saying the opposite. Any time I shared concerns and doubts with mg dietitian I realized she just wanted me to follow her rhetoric and trust her judgement. She didn\u2019t like questions or concerns. And ultimately no matter how much body positivity she preached or health at every size she taught, I didn\u2019t feel safe with her because she didn\u2019t welcome my questions or concerns. She got upset with them. I told my therapist how I felt and asked her for a new ED recovery dietitian. I told her what I wanted: someone who would hold me accountable and challenge me if they thought I was slipping into old thoughts or habits from my ED, BUT also someone who didn\u2019t balk at or judge my individual ideas or questions about the nutrition info I was being given. She got a reference for me and I started with the new dietitian and it changed my life. I could be honest with her and she didn\u2019t shoot me down. The old dietitian wanted to see me raging fear foods on a constant basis. And while I\u2019m so glad I got comfortable eating fear foods I didn\u2019t feel like there was any gently nutrition going on. This new dietitian was so helpful and balanced. She helped me find loving ways of choosing nourishing and balanced meals while also making sure I was keeping fun foods in my repertoire. She also told me I didn\u2019t have to like where my body was at. The old dietitian kept trying to make me love and like how my overweight body looked and felt. And it just wasn\u2019t authentic for me. She wanted me to just say I liked it but I didn\u2019t. This new dietitian told me I didn\u2019t have to like it, but that I needed to show it love and gratefulness for all it does for me. She said \u201cyou can work towards a more balanced body, but you need to be honest with yourself that you might not ever find a body shape you are super happy with. When you were in your ED you weren\u2019t happy with your body either. So just don\u2019t lie to yourself. And Be kind to your body as you seek more balance. \u201c this was revolutionary for me. She helped me talk through all my meals to find more balanced options and also how to work intuitive eating into balanced nutrition. If I told her I didn\u2019t agree with an idea or teaching or I had concerns she accepted it but challenged it. It\u2019s been so good for me. She also helped me find more balance in my activity and movement. She said \u201c20 minutes a day of movement is a loving thing to do for your body whether it\u2019s stretching, walking, yoga, weights, bike riding, rock climbing etc. Take it easy, and do it from a place of love for your body and how it makes you feel, not from a place of hate and shame for how your body looks.\u201d I really embraced this and started telling myself, \u201cI care about what my body can do and how it feels, now how it looks\u201d and this changed everything. I started eating and moving in ways that supported this. I joined a Jiu Jitsu class and realized I needed to build strength to keep up so I started lifting weights. And then I realized I couldn\u2019t build the muscle without eating really good amounts of food so I didn\u2019t want to skip any meals. I wanted to actually build muscle and strength not break it down and hurt it. Then my sister started asking me to do fun run 5ks. So I would run once per week to gear up for the fun run and we had a blast. We take photos together in our fun run t shirts and we cheer each other along the run the whole way. Ultimately my weight has dropped down a bit since 2 years ago. And I don\u2019t know if it will continue to do so or not. But I got so thrilled with seeing what my body was capable of doing if I just took good care of it, that I stopped worrying as much about how I look as often. Of course there are a host of reasons one deals with ED. My OCD definitely had a part to play, as well as a response to childhood trauma. But I\u2019m on a journey. And I don\u2019t expect perfection from myself. I know there will be great mountain top moments and tough valley moments. But that\u2019s ok. Im glad I chose to move away from a dietitian who pushed her own agenda and ideology on me and found one who encouraged personal growth and individuality while also still lovingly challenging me and pushing me to growth. Bottom line: my best advice if you want it is to keep your recovery in a constant state of evaluation. If ever you feel like you\u2019re at the end of your rope and want to give up entirely, then ask yourself if you\u2019re getting the right support. Be really honest with your recovery team. Don\u2019t lie to yourself or them. And if they are a good team they won\u2019t judge your honesty, and they will help you find ways to move forward in recovery while also being mindful of how you feel. If you\u2019re uncomfortable in your body a good team will hear you out and walk through this journey with you, not preaching at you and pulling you along THEIR path. And lastly I will say I have not relapsed in three years but that doesn\u2019t mean my ED thoughts never arise. And rather than shush them I am honest about them. And a good care team will be not only ok with that, but welcome it. Keep going. I know it\u2019s so hard. But it is so worth it. I hope you find peace and hope. You\u2019re so brave to go on this journey. It\u2019s a road not well worn for many. You can do this. I believe in you!",

I still stayed underweight and restricted, just not as severely as before. I hit a point where I stopped caring and decided to just eat normally. I gained probably 6kg (12ish pounds) within the month, even though my calories were only 1800-2000.  But I just kept up with it tbh and got through the extreme hunger phase, and it all went back to normal. All the effects of the eating disorder and negative aspects of recovery disappeared, and now I can eat 2000 calories without gaining any weight. I really recommend just going all in and getting it over with.",

Like my metabolism at the time was extremely messed up, I did some really severe damage to myself. :/ So I think it just takes time to reverse the damage. \n\nFrom what I can remember, I struggled with bloating for a very long time - I looked quite swollen everywhere for a period there, looking back at old pics now. But there was a point I hit where I was not actively gaining weight from eating a morsel of food, and my weight became relatively stable. The bloating eventually subsided after my weight stabilized (took some time). It was a long time ago now and at the time I kinda blocked out any thoughts about my body or what I was eating because it made me sad lol and was super triggering, so unfortunately this is as much as I remember. \n\nSide note - a recommendation I have is getting an instant pot / pressure cooker, if you\u2019re not much of a cook. I literally hated cooking, so I struggled with eating nutritious food (which I think exacerbated the symptoms). But I\u2019ve been able to make tons of nutritious food with low effort, and it has made a pretty extraordinary difference to my hair, nails, how I feel, bloating, etc. I lost like half of my hair during my ED and this is the only thing that has fixed that post recovery. \n\nHope it helps and congratulations on recovery!!! \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0a",
