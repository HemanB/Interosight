I will tell you but please (everyone) note that I am not recommending it.\n\nI had a binge night that was particularly bad. I was unbelievably emotional and out of control. That night a very important person told me that I was hurting myself on purpose when I did that. He told me that every time I binged I was making a decision to harm myself. He said that the people that love me are essentially watching me destroy myself simply because of my stress. He compared it to cutting myself over and over again. He told me that every single time I made that decision, I was making the choice to walk away from the life I really wanted. He told me that it was completely unacceptable. It was like a switch had been thrown in my head. I could not do that anymore to my family. It felt selfish to me and I realized that I did not want to be remembered that way. So every single time I wanted to binge, I told Him. I confessed the urge and would just say it over and over again. He would tell me I was not allowed to harm myself anymore. And honestly, that helped. It helped to be reminded and constantly told that hurting myself ON PURPOSE was not ok. I needed to remember that the consequences were more damaging than whatever the stress was that was driving me to binge.\n\nPlease again, everyone note: I am not suggesting this to anyone or saying that it would work or even that it is healthy. It was only the thing that worked for me.  \n\nI really hope everyone out there is not giving up and continues to try and stay positive.",
