  "title": "Discovered a surprising permanent ear issue from years of anorexia, just want to put it out there.",
  "selftext": "Hi there everyone,  \nI've had eating disorders since I was 9 years old (now 32), anorexia for the first 7 of those. During the very worst phase around age 15, I started having problems with my ears, but I have just been trying to ignore it, as it's been a nuisance rather than pain. Now wish I had not ignored it, but here we are.   \nThe problems got a lot worse in the last 7 weeks, so I decided to seek help.   \n\n\nTurns out I have a rare problem called Patulous Eustachian tube syndrome. I spoke to man who is an ENT specialist with a particular interest in Eustachian tube problems, and he diagnosed me with this based on the symptoms I listed. The consultant was asking about my weight when it started and now, which is how the anorexia came up - he explained anorexia or extreme weight loss is one of the main causes of this issue, because there is supposed to be fat around the Eustachian tubes, but if this goes away, they get too much space and so get stuck open. Note it is still a very rare problem to have.  \nIt can get better with weight gain, however this has not happened with me, and doing pop/sniff habit constantly for 17 years has wrecked my ears.   \n\n\nI would never have thought ear problems could be linked to anorexia, so I suppose that could be the case for others too. Just wanted to put it out there in case anyone has this particular issue, as it might help provide answers.",
