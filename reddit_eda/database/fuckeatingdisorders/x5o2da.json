  "selftext": "Avoided bagels like the plague during my eating disorder. They were one of my favorite childhood foods. I recently challenged this fear and now I want one every day. I picked up 6 bagels this morning and am so excited about having them whenever I want this week! There\u2019s nothing scary about bagels and so much to celebrate about them. Just wanted to share a moment of appreciation for bagels and recovery progress \u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udd6f",
