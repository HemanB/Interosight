  "title": "I\u2019ve beat my eating disorder. I\u2019ve beat my bloat. I\u2019m happily entering another beautiful chapter of my life :)",
  "selftext": "I\u2019ve gone through many many phases of disordered eating. I\u2019ve done extreme fasting for a long time and got hypothalamic amenorrhea. When o found out what that meant I stopped to get my period back but ever since my bloating was really extreme. After my cycle went back to normal I started immensely reducing my calories again. Even though I only ate quite little I was constantly bloated.\n\nTo get rid of it I started separating eating and drinking and keeping at least one hour in between both. I went to the doctor and they gave me lots of probiotics which at least helped the cramps but the bloat wasn\u2019t really gone. Just a little less. \n\nOn the weekend something... fascinating happened. If you have a problem with drugs or something you can stop reading now. I want to stress that I don\u2019t promote the use of illegal substances. Not at all. I\u2019m just here to tell my tale. \n\nI took mushrooms and later on MDMA with a good friend of mine. The festival we attended was absolutely amazing by the way but that\u2019s a different story. During the come up of the MDMA we started talking and everyone who knows this substance knows this feeling of immensely deep connection we experienced. I found out he had an eating disorder too which I suspected before but as he didn\u2019t seem to understand how I felt when I talked to him soberly I thought I was wrong about my diagnosis. \n\nBut yea we talked a lot about our issues and I felt the weight of all these problems drop. I\u2019m still fascinated by how these little molecules can alter your whole perception because in these moments of my soul being open to the whole world my friend really got to manifest all this positivity in my mind. I woke up the next day and I was freed. I am free of this whole problem that had way too much control over my life and lead to so much misery. I\u2019m done with this chapter of my life. \n\nAnd now for the bloating part. I stopped eating so much vegetables. I really overdid it on those and my digestive system was completely overwhelmed as they aren\u2019t that easy to digest. Especially if you completely screwed up your digestion as I did... I only took very little probiotics throughout the week but still I experience just a very little bit of bloat. Except for when I overeat. \n\nI can\u2019t believe it. If anybody told my last week that my life would be almost free of eating issues one week later I\u2019d have laughed at them. I am done. I don\u2019t plan on going back. My body is just as beautiful as yours. My mind is free and I hope that you\u2019ll experience that same freedom. I wish all the power and strength to the warriors who are still fighting these issues.

But what I think is really sad is that many people don\u2019t think about what they\u2019re doing and end up in a bad trip, psychosis or od which is what gives so many substances a bad call. I know that some people simply don\u2019t react positively to a substance but that\u2019s why you should always start with very low doses and if you don\u2019t feel the way you should simply stay abstinent from that material. That\u2019s what I did with alcohol. How ironic that I react badly to the legal and immensely positive to the illegal substances of my country lol",
