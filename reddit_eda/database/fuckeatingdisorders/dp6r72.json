  "selftext": "On Friday, I was admitted to inpatient for a heart problem related to my ED. I struggled with being here but I felt a little optimistic. I was being given fear foods and nothing bad was happening. I felt that maybe, I could recovery.\n\n\nYesterday, another girl was admitted. She eats SO slowly. It took her forty minutes to finish half of a muffin. She doesn't finish her meals so she takes the Ensure instead. It bothers me because she's so tiny, so frail, so dainty and I feel huge for finishing my food before her. It makes me want to relapse and I don't know why.",

I am super happy that your talking about it instead of taking these feelings out on your food. That other girl will have to learn some of the skills you already have regarding recovery. Maybe you could embrace the moment and help her learn. Maybe you both can work together and help each other instead; with positive encouragement.\n\nYou are Brave and strong! Keep up your good work!

Frequently it involves become extremely close to the other people in there. This can be helpful; it can also be very very dangerous for obvious reasons. \n\nI think the best rule of thumb is gentle friendliness, especially around meal times. Saying hello, or talking about pets or animals; something that is a good happy neutral safe ground. Encouragement such as \u2018you\u2019re doing well\u2019 can obviously be taken the wrong way by an Anorectic mind so wait until you know the person. \n\n\nJust talk about pets or animals or hobbies or bitch about the rules; that\u2019s a common bonding pastime lol. If they are receptive go with it. If not, it\u2019s nothing personal. It\u2019s just their head screaming at them too loudly. \n\nMost of all protect yourself and keep yourself safe.
