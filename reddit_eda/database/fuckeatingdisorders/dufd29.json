It\u2019s definitely not because I\u2019m admiring myself like it probably seems though. Im picking apart every small detail I want to change and trying to figure out how. If I didn\u2019t live with my bf I would seriously just throw a blanket over our huge bathroom mirror to avoid this, it\u2019s so bad for my ED anxiety. \n\n\nTheir have been days when I\u2019m wearing tight clothes that I actually think \u201cDamn I look great, ppl are probably jealous\u201d. Yet when my friends compliment me I get so awkward and don\u2019t know what to say. It\u2019s like if they only knew how I wish I could just be happy with an average body like them. They have no idea that when I\u2019m at home I hide my body from myself by wearing loads of baggy clothes. They have no idea that every time I see myself in the mirror when coming out of the shower, my naked body makes me want to have a break down and cry on the floor. \n\nLong story short: mirrors are the devil! \n\nIf anyone knows of a good mirror that doesn\u2019t distort and gives a more accurate reflection of our real shapes, PLEASE POST! \n\n^^see how messed up I am. I post a long rant of how bad mirrors are but I still want a good floor length mirror^^ wtf!!!!",
