  "selftext": "A year ago, I was posting in this sub with struggles and fears, fighting myself every day for the right to eat breakfast. Tonight, I just got back from an incredible dinner date with someone new. We ate pizza and drank beer and had a wonderful time and I never thought twice about it. It wasn't easy to get here but it was goddamn worthwhile. Eat when you're hungry. If you're hungry right now, consider this your permanent permission to eat. I promise that breaking free is so so worth it.",

It's hard to teach your body to want food again, but if you make a habit of eating at mealtimes the appetite should grow back over time.

Im not sure about you but I\u2019ve been having some weird pallet preferences. chocolate and dark things are not appealing and in fact almost revolting and unappetizing or after I eat the chocolate I start to just feel eh. The idea of dark foods and chocolate isn\u2019t good and I\u2019m starting to desire just white foods, not certain foods or even the fact that their white, just foods that have a white taste. Has this ever happened to anyone else? Like all I want is white and soft stuff; white cake, plain rice cakes, popcorn, white rice....so odd!",
