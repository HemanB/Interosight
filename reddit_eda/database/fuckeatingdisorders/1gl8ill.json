  "selftext": "Easily the dumbest sentence I've ever heard... like... you're not helping ANYONE in recovery by telling them that they \"won't get fat\", because if they overshoot, or simply stay overweight/obese because that's their natural weight they are going to believe something is wrong with them/their recovery and most likely relapse.\n\nThe point of recovery is to accept whatever body you end up in, not keep the fear of becoming fat instilled within you. Every body is beautiful in its own way, it's just that the media demonized fat bodies by calling anybody who has one \"lazy\" and an \"overeater\". I personally love plus sized bodies and I think they look very soft and aesthetically pleasing (saying this as a professional woman liker \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08) and genuinely I don't think I've ever associated fat bodies with such derogatory terms even deep in my ED.\n\nThe people who say this kind of bullshit are just internally fatphobic and uneducated. If you ended up overweight or even obese in recovery it's perfectly normal. \n\nYour perfect body is the body at which you feel the best and where your health is the best, not where you \"look the best\" (which doesn't exist BTW because everybody's views on beauty are different, not everyone likes the same).\n\nEDIT: The amount of people getting their comments deleted for fatphobia... do better, you're one of the reasons people are scared of recovery because they're also scared of being judged for a HEALTHY BODY that the media has deemed \"unAtTracTivE\" and \"uNhEaLThY\" but the second thin bodies are in question nobody mentions anything about their health because they fit the shitty beauty standard. I hope you get rid of your internalized fatphobia and heal your mind from such ways of thinking, best wishes.",
