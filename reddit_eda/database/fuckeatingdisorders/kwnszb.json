  "title": "My therapist asked me if I wanted to make a weight loss goal",
  "selftext": "I\u2019ve had three sessions total with this therapist. I originally went with her because she had experience in eating disorders and trauma, however I realize now that \u201cexperience\u201d is *not* the same as \u201clicensed\u201d in.\n\nI was upfront about my anorexia and body dysmorphia being the main things I need to target, otherwise I WILL relapse. We\u2019ve been working toward changing my constant negative thought patterns (all of which are about my body); I\u2019ve still been struggling but I thought maybe it\u2019ll just take a little more time, three sessions isn\u2019t a lot.\n\nWell last night, I told her I was obsessing over my BMI, to which she asked what I could do about it. Obviously I said nothing... so she said she thinks we should build a goal to lose weight.\n\nIt\u2019s worth fucking noting, I didn\u2019t tell her what my BMI was. Our sessions are all virtual and she doesn\u2019t know what I even look like. I said I cannot lose weight because I will relapse, that\u2019s it, point blank, period. It\u2019s not up for discussion.\n\nSo what did she do? She started lecturing me about not putting in the work to get better and change my thoughts, despite the fact that she knew FROM THE START that I refused to lose weight because I cannot do so without falling  headfirst into anorexia again. She said she was going to find me another therapist who specializes in body dysmorphia, which is fine, until she added be \u201cBecause you weren\u2019t trying.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, I\u2019m getting a new therapist on MY terms. But holy shit, I\u2019m just still pissed hours later.",
