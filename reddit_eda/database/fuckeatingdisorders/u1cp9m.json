  "selftext": "Going into recovery about 3 months ago I was hella skeptical.. I didn\u2019t believe in extreme hunger even though I experienced it three years ago first recovering, I just thought I was binging. But I kept going and while the EH isn\u2019t gone by any means, just decreased, I think about food and exercise and movement a LOT less and holy shit is it freeing (and a bit boring sometimes\u2026 brain too empty). And this is really really early in recovery I think. Not sure if I\u2019m weight restored yet and I\u2019m definitely not done, but i\u2019ve improved by a lot. Anyway here\u2019s a few good things that I\u2019ve noticed, in case anyone thinks it\u2019s not worth it:\n\n1. My chest doesn\u2019t hurt anymore, no more heart palpitations and I no longer feel like my heart is skipping a beat (and apparently it was!!!)\n\n2. I can walk with a heavy ass backpack on a steep hill (big hilly campus) without being dizzy and feeling like i\u2019m gonna pass out and panting a bit\u2026 so much for being \u201cfit\u201d\n\n3. Less anxiety and panic attacks. Who would\u2019ve known that malnourishment is stressful lol\n\n4. I feel like the colors are literally brighter\n\n5. My nails break less often and my hair looks a lot healthier\n\n6. I can focus on peoples conversations without thinking about my next snack, workout, or afraid that i\u2019m gonna pass out from low blood sugar or have a panic attack\n\n7. Improved memory. I study Chinese and I find it MUCH easier to memorize my characters and I get better grades on my quizzes \n\n8. I take less time to order food bc i\u2019m not analyzing the calorie amount\n\n9. There\u2019s a lot less math in my head lol. I actually never used a tracker and instead just rounded up how much I ate and didn\u2019t let myself eat more than xx amount. Sometimes I do this still unfortunately but the urge has definitely decreased. \n\nSure recovery isn\u2019t all sunshine and rainbows. It\u2019s hard work physically and mentally, with fatigue and overcoming food anxiety body image issues etc., and yeah it\u2019s hard to actually deal with my issues now that my brain can think but i think it\u2019s SO worth it. Just wanted to share some positives with y\u2019all",

I do have the help of a doctor and a therapist, and I\u2019m looking to get a dietician soon. Took me forever to find a doctor that took me seriously because i wasn\u2019t \u201cunderweight enough\u201d (whatever that means??). I also told my friends around the second month, and they\u2019ve been super supportive. I think telling those who I trust and having a good doctor was most helpful and has made this recovery (I\u2019ve relapsed like 10 ish times) the best and most sustainable one. Best of luck to you!!",
