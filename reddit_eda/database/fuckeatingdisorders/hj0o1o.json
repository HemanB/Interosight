  "selftext": "Last week, my therapist challenged me to go on an adventure because I live in a tiny lil safe cage of routine and compulsions\u2014 the same exact mundane walk every day, the same exact foods, everything ritualistically measured and calculated... I was so intimidated and overwhelmed at the thought of change and newness but MY GOODNESS this past week has been so freeing. I decided to start small with new hiking trails and then realized I really want to camp. So I started researching easy overnight backpacking excursions in my area and I went to a recycled gear store today and found a backpacking pack for $30 (it has a rip that I\u2019ll sew up).  I know exercise is a trigger and a slippery slope, but I will be mindful and cautious of my movement and I will have to keep myself vigilant about fueling my body for strength and smiles and new sights and all that! \nAnyway, I gave myself permission to try new things and to probably fail and to discover and to get so excited about something that the fear doesn\u2019t matter and GUESS WHAAAT?! I haven\u2019t been obsessing about food and body nearly as much. Today, I realized how much room there is in my mind to dream and to fantasize about life and how big and beautiful I can choose to make it! And I realized that my friends use their brains for thoughts that don\u2019t obsess and punish and scrutinize all the time and I\u2019m allowed to do that too. There\u2019s so much more space for joy than I let myself believe.",
