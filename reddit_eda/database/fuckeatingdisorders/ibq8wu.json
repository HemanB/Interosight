  "selftext": "Like every time I break from lunch at work I struggle to eat even my safe foods \n\nI can tell I have the brain fog and I know eating will make it easier and I can do my job well\n\nBut I can\u2019t bring the food to my lips. \n\nFood is absolutely needed for survival and all my science and medical training has proven it, and yet my brain is like \u201cno food bad\u201d \n\nI hate that I\u2019ve been in treatment for years now, and it\u2019s still such a struggle to eat sometimes. Excuse me brain, I\u2019ve spend so much time and money trying to fix u, please just lemme eat food without fear. \n\nI fucking hate this. I consider my self recovered mostly, but fuck this sucks. \n\n\n(Also yay me for being upsetti at the disorder and not at myself for needing food. My therapists would be proud!)",
