  "title": "Everytime i start to eat more, my brother starts calling me fat/a pig as a \u2018joke\u2019 and it is killing me.",
  "selftext": "I used to weigh 120 pounds (im 5\u20199) and felt awful with hair loss, fatigue, cold all the time, no period etc. I decided i was done with feeling like that and started eating more with a goal weight of 130-135 pounds. I now weigh 125 pounds and my brother decided it would be funny to call me fat everytime he sees me. I feel like a dumbass for letting it get to me but my weight is a very sensitive subject and i feel horrible for eating anything at all right now. I asked him to stop multiple times but he doesn\u2019t care. I relapsed back into my ED and haven\u2019t eaten since saturday night and started walking compulsively again. He noticed and just keeps making jokes about it, calling me a fat ugly pig and what not. \n\nI know i should ignore it but its literally the one thing im sensitive about and i cant let it go. I live with my parents and brother so i see him every day. I dont know how to deal, my parents dont care and just tell me to ignore him and my mom just laughs with him and tells me to stop being a baby. \n\nEven when hes not around, i still constantly hear his words and i cant make myself eat anymore without crying and hating myself, i\u2019m stuck.",

And even if you were, fat is not a cuss word, and it doesn't define you. Try to reassure yourself of these things. And try to keep gaining weight despite that because you need to attain full recovery for yourself.  You deserve full freedom from your ed. Keep eating and keep fighting.",

That is so not cool. \nIt's not super clear from your post whether or not your family is aware of your ED, but that shouldn't matter, because their behaviour is unacceptable. \n\nYou need to reach out to your support system right now. It may be wise to disclose your ED to anyone you trust to support you through this process. If that person is an aunt/uncle or grandparent, perhaps you could stay with them for a bit. It may help you get through the worst of this. \n\nUntil then, it sounds like you're just going to have to white- knuckle it. Only talk to your mom when you have to (so as not to give her any reason to call you \"disrespectful\") and don't acknowledge your brother's presence. Don't even look at him. Wear headphones when you have to leave your room so you can't hear his nasty comments. It may be that he's dealing with some poor self-esteem, so he's lashing out to make himself feel better.

He is a bully. \n\nCan you sit down and have a serious conversation with your parents about what you\u2019re going through? And how he is affecting you? Or do you have any other trusted family members you can talk to about this? His behavior is not ok and you deserve to reach out to people who will take you seriously. This is not a joke.",

I'm torn between telling you to fight fire with fire and tear him down or be the better person. Truly, you don't want to stoop down to his level. So, Be proud, look down on him, even pity him for his ignorant misery, but don't give him the satisfaction. You have come so fucking far, you are what you say you are, others may have opinions on us but it is YOU who decides. I think you are a beautiful person & I HOPE you see this as someone who cares.  I am so sorry your parents do fuck all to help and if they don't mind his language, certainly you can try (if you feel comfortable) standing up for yourself, getting a support system over to help defend you if he does this in front of company, embarrass your shitty parents by telling their friends when they come to visit.\n I'm just spitballing suggestions here because I know it must be hell walking on eggshells in what should be your safe home. You are more than what others have called you, you are more than you give yourself credit for, you have endurance he couldn't understand, willpower he does not possess and the self-control not to flip out on him. You are better than you know and stronger than you realize.",
