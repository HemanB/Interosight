  "selftext": "my stomach is the part of my body i struggle with the most. i used to want more than anything to have it be flat with absolutely no fat on it. whenever a therapist would ask me to start to come up with something to appreciate about my stomach i always drew a blank on what to say. i truly did not like anything about it until now.\ni'm about 2 months into recovery and o my god i'm so glad i'm not fucking cold all the time. a lot of your heat comes from your core so when you have a really low body fat percentage u get cold more easily.\nmy favorite thing about recovery is that i'm not cold any more. i used to get random bouts of extreme coldness where i could barely even move or i felt like crying. it was hard to get anything do anything or even talk to anyone.\nso thank u tummy fat and thigh fat and arm fat thank u for keeping me warm:,)",
