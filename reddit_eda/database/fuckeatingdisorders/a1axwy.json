  "selftext": "With apple, banana, goji berries, almonds, pumpkin seeds, cranberries, coconut, apple, raspberries, cinnamon sugar, nutmeg and peanut butter in it.\n\nI made it because I was hungry and I stopped eating when I was full.\n\nI don't remember the last time I ate something because I assesed how my body felt and decided I needed it. Normally I eat because a) I'm about to pass out; b) I've starved myself for days and finally snap and binge uncontrollably; or c) it's under 150cals and meticulously logged. I don't even have any idea how many calories are in it.\n\nI feel good.\n\nBaby steps. ",

But that\u2019s a big step towards normalizing your eating!! And it\u2019s always a great feeling to give a big F-U to your ED :) Cheers to you!",
