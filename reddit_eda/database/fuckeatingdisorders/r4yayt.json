  "title": "How are most celebrities so skinny? (Tw- weight, not eating)",
  "selftext": "I just don\u2019t understand how all of these celebrities maintain such low body weights, and especially after having kids too. Watching any tv show or movie, I realize how skinny all the women are. I am not losing weight while eating what I think isn\u2019t a lot of food per day. I just can\u2019t imagine what they eat or how often they have to work out in order to stay so skinny. The only time I lost weight in my life was during a period of intense grieving for a loved one I lost, in which I had no appetite and probably ate only around 900 calories a day, only bc I just couldn\u2019t stomach food. EVEN then, I was still in the \u201cnormal\u201d BMI category, albeit on the lower end, but still. \n\nOf course my frustration is compounded by the fact that I had my first baby earlier this year and things have kind of been a nightmare. I gained about 50lb, which I literally don\u2019t understand because I was sick for 7 months and ate less. I also gained like 15lb within the first few weeks, so I imagine something about my hormones were off but anyways. I never lost any of the weight, so I\u2019ve been sitting at 230 since the birth, and I got in-depth blood work that shows good health except my progesterone is low. It just feels like the only way I could lose weight would be to literally starve myself or be in the gym 2 hours a day, which I don\u2019t have time for. \n\nAnyways I\u2019m just venting and feeling pretty hopeless and wish there were more average-sized women represented in media.",

And it\u2019s the same with professional athletes, there\u2019s this one article about a sponsored Nike athlete who came out as having developed an eating disorder due to the pressure from Nike to look a specific way (and that *really* turned me off to buying their products tbh).\n\nCelebrates are really no different in terms of how deep they are in diet culture and how much it\u2019s part of who they are as a celebrity. That\u2019s why there are so many touting about these miraculous diets and/or workout routine that helped sculpt their physique or shed those last few pounds for good, that virtually everyone else is going to fail partly because 1) 94% of all diets fail and 2) because they\u2019re lying about the results and the diet/workout routine itself, and many can afford surgery to modify their bodies as well. Beach Body and all those products are notorious for lying about the efficacy of their workouts, and the fitness industry in general is known to either be extremely restrictive if you\u2019re a woman in particular and encouraging steroids and an exceptionally bland diet if you\u2019re a man. I know this example on its own is very anecdotal, but my boyfriend was a wrestler in high school and told me about how he begged his doctor to prescribe his steroids because he felt like he couldn\u2019t keep up with his friends.\n\nIt really just goes to show how fatphobic society is and why both eating disorders and body dysmorphic disorder are on the rise.",

Also, like someone else said, a lot of them have eating disorders, go on ultra restrictive diets, fast, workout obsessively... not a fun life.",
