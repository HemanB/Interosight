  "selftext": "Two of the people I'm following are saying this and laughing about how people are mad cause they know it's true but it's not. I'm not an expert so its hard to voice what exactly they're rooted in but I just feel like you have to be in a bubble to take all the pain and suffering and death and minimize it to \"they hated fatness that much\", no just no. We live in a fatphobic society that places value on beauty so obviously fatphobia only encourages and strengthens eating disorders. It would be the exact same as if addicts lived in a world that valued hard drugs and how much you could take without dying. And this is a major criticism I have with some fat liberationists (not politics as a whole because these are very specific people who are interested in living out revenge fantasies). You can't deny facts about mental and physical health to fit an agenda because that means you don't want a world where people can just be, you want a world where the roles are reversed. And I'm referring to ideas of \"you can never have too much fat\" or \"eating disorders are rooted in fatphobia\" or \"nutrition is fatphobic\" like no, you can have too much fat just like you can not have enough fat on your body but that's something HIGHLY personal to you and your body distribution, no stranger on the internet is ever going to be able to tell how healthy you are based on how fat you look to them (obviously extremes are outliers) and there are nutrient-dense foods and non-nutrient dense foods, the idea that all foods are equally nutritious completely invalidates the struggles of people who live in food deserts, HOWEVER not everything you eat needs to be dense in nutrients, our bodies can take a couple of McDonald's cheeseburgers. It's just so frustrating because it feels like I have to clarify and fight on two different fronts, one against diet culture and another against people who SHOULD know better. I'm thinking about unfollowing them based on their response.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedt: Thank you all for the support and for sharing your stories. If you want to know what fat acceptance and liberation is really about, this video gives some good background and sources. It's nothing like what those people are trying to push.

For the same reason I've even had someone telling me that \"EDs are rooted in racism\" (?).\n\nDon't get me wrong: I DO believe fatphobia is a thing, I DO praise fat people with EDs for being able to recover and accept their bodies, I DO sympathize with whatever struggle they might face, I DO believe that eating without restriction is the only true key to recover and I am the first one to call out those who bullshit their way into restriction by telling \"I jUsT wAnNa bE HeAlThY!\".\n\nBut. I also believe that the whole challenge your inner fatphobia, your ED is rooted in fatphobia etc., is also primarily directed towards fat people themselves and it is meant to help THEM deal with THEIR struggle. And while I do believe that certain parts of this discourse can be helpful for everyone, I also believe that if you just blanket apply the same rhetoric to every possible ED on the planet it just becomes yet another fad trend like the whole 90s media frenzy about fashion catwalks causing teens to starve into anorexia, or those outdated ideas about EDs being caused by young females having mommy issues. It just trivializes both sides of the debate and ultimately doesn't really help anyone - and yes, it also leads to extremes such as the pseudoscience claims you listed.\n\nBy the way, as I said to someone else before, all of this is extremely American centered. Some of these concepts don't really make that much sense to non-US cultures.",

IMO, fatphobia is a trauma in and of itself that often starts in childhood and, yes, absolutely contributes to the rise in eating disorders over the past few years. A connective trauma, I guess.\n\n[Some] risk factors for eating disorders include weight stigma and a history of dieting; of course, you need to meet psychological criteria to be diagnosed, but the line between disordered eating and eating disorders often become blurred, so is important to understand that, at the end of the day, EDs are mental disorders. Therefore, I think it\u2019s worth noting that many eating disorders do stem from fatphobic ideologies at a young age... not all, but some.",

          "body": "I avoid any kind of \u2018body positivity\u2019 that is rooted in things that are factually untrue such as \u2018obesity is healthy\u2019, \u2018being obese doesn\u2019t cause any health issues\u2019, \u2018you can be healthy at ANY size\u2019. Not because I hate fat people or judge them at all for their size, I myself am currently overweight - but because I see many parallels between the rhetoric of that kind of us versus them/we are healthy in spite of medical studies and science, and the pro ana/thinspiration/they just hate you cos you\u2019re what they want to be/you\u2019re doing the right thing regardless of what your doctor says shit that used to encourage me to restrict.\n\nBoth ends of the extreme are damaging. Nobody should be judged or hated for their size but one of my friends, who really helped me see I had a problem and get help when I was active in my ED, is very much into this \u2018being obese is totally healthy and none of the stuff that shows it isn\u2019t is true\u2019 and I\u2019m just like... you made me see I was damaging my body and get help when I was underweight and starving, but you see the same thing for very overweight people as offensive?? How was healthy at every size working out for you when I was underweight?\n\nIdk I just see people with EDs at both ends of the spectrum justifying their illness with that junk. There\u2019s obviously a range of healthy that is different for each individual but saying it\u2019s healthy to be extremely overweight is like someone saying \u2018well for ME 500 calories a day is plenty\u2019. Like there\u2019s an point at which it obviously isn\u2019t regardless of your body/metabolism/cardio/whatever.",

Most ED sufferers have a mix of them all.\n\nFatphobia CAN be an issue, but to say it is the \\*only\\* one only perpetuates that EDs are physical and not, you know, a mental illness.",

I would judge anyone at a higher weight (meaning literally anyone bigger than I was) and that was my entire life purpose.
