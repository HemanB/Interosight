  "selftext": "It\u2019s been a long, stressful ass day working and running errands, and I\u2019ve already ate two meals, and already had a snack, and didn\u2019t work out today or yesterday, and picked up my Prozac at the pharmacy and have to pack cause I move this weekend and have to deal with the bullshit of utility transferring and security deposits, but I am eating a bowl of curry with tempeh and vegetables because my body deserves to be fueled and nourished and I deserve to feel loved by myself and the wounded child inside of me. I am beautiful no matter what I eat and no matter how much I work out and this curry is fucking delicious. \n\nFUCK anorexia and FUCK bulimia",
