  "selftext": "Food is everywhere and even now that I'm trying to recover everything triggers me.\n\nToday our attendance question in homeroom was \"What did you eat for breakfast this morning?\" I hadn't eaten breakfast yet (but I am going to), but I also didn't want to reply \"nothing\" because I was afraid of giving someone the wrong idea, so I ended up writing way more than everyone else explaining that I would be eating later.\n\nIn health class my health teacher went on a tangent about amenorrhea and how it caused stress fractures and it made me feel absolutely terrible. He meant no harm but it reminded me everything wrong with me.\n\nI work at a grocery store and customers will constantly complain about their weight or make comments on what they're buying. I can't really do anything except smile and nod, but sometimes when they comment on something I normally eat, I won't be able to eat it for a few days because it seems like they're criticizing my diet as well as theirs.\n\nIt's just a constant barrage of things I never thought about before, but that now have the capability to ruin my day",

I'm recovered from an eating disorder and I don't get triggered by food mentions at all anymore. But I remember weeks at a time feeling ruined by casual comments about food that the average person wouldn't think twice about. It sounds especially tough for you working at a grocery store!!
