  "title": "\"high restriction\" isn't real, restriction is just restriction AND many ppl w/AN consume waaaay more per day than stereotyped",
  "selftext": "Ok couple notes: 1.) I will be discussing specific calorie values in this post 2.) yes I realize there is restricting more vs. less 3.) weight loss is NOT a criteria for having a serious ED (and, imo, should not be required for an AN diagnosis) 4.) different bodies, different responses and needs to different calorie intakes.\n\nthis is definitely kind of a rant lmao, but fr I think the phrase \"high res\" is super harmful and also misleading.\n\n\\*\n\n\\*\n\n\\*\n\n\\*\n\n\\*\n\n\\*\n\nSo I recently saw someone use the phrase \"high res\" on insta and I NAIVELY thought \"oh maybe they're referring to mental restriction while eating adequate calories or smth\"...nope! This person was talking about 1200 cal/day. I think it is INCREDIBLY harmful to paint this as \"restricting lite\" because restriction can be dangerous at many caloric amounts. Different bodies, activity levels, basal metabolisms, health conditions, etc. mean different nutritional needs - there's no singular amount of calories that can be use as a cutoff for restricting. Painting some arbitrary calorie limit as \"high res\" just generates a sense of shame/need to eat even less. And like hey, if you've restricted more in the past and youre increasing your intake now, awesome! but oh my GOD don't pretend that your restriction is suddenly \"sooo much food\" in a way that could so clearly induce shame in other people?? save those thoughts for private journals and your therapist jfc.\n\nOn that note, I have had AN for 12 years. I became medically unstable twice, once while eating an average of \\~1400 calories/day and another time while averaging \\~1700 calories/day. I was not purging either time; my instability was exclusively related to restriction. I won't tell you the least I ever ate bc I don't think that's useful information, but I will say that there were at least as many days where I ate 2000+ calories as there were days I ate under these approximate averages, and most of the time I ate around these values. I have met individuals with restrictive EDs, strong food rituals, and exercise addiction who became underweight while eating 2500+ calories per days (among many other health problems). And I don't think myself or these others are strange outliers; in fact, multiple studies document underweight AN patients consuming 1500-1800 cal/day ([link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3584709/); [link](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/84/4/698/4633254)). And why should this be shocking when most ppl (myself included) maintain weight between 2500 and 3500 cal/day?? Like of COURSE you could lose weight restricting to 1800 at that point???\n\nBesides invalidating people  and encouraging decreased intake with harmful effects, I think calling 1200+ calories a day \"high res\" also feeds into really dangerous stereotypes about this disease. The world is, by and large, sooo disconnected from knowing how many calories people actually need per day that me saying \"oh I eat 1600 calories/day\" to many people wouldn't read as problematic when it definitely should be. And the AN stereotype of like, one apple and a black coffee isn't helping this at all. ugh ok this is my rant byeee",

I\u2019ve only been perusing this sub for a short time, and when I came across people posting about \u201chigh res\u201d/\u201clow res\u201d I was like what is this fresh hell? Compounded even more when I saw that this supposed \u201chigh res\u201d was around 1200 calories (side note; what\u2019s the acute obsession with 1200 calories? It\u2019s always bobbing up in multiple subreddits and life in general by supposedly \u201cnormal\u201d folks.. and I\u2019m pretty certain from my own 20+ years experience that\u2019s long winded STARVATION people!). Genuinely concerned what \u201clow res\u201d is. Restriction is restriction, end of story. And you\u2019re going to pay the price for it. \n\nAnd I agree the hyper focus on tdee calculations needs to bugger off. They are so inaccurate it\u2019s plain silly. Use yourself as your own guide. Like others have commented here, I recently had a slap of reality with my own situation in that I had slipped to a dangerously low weight without even realising (I wasn\u2019t weighing myself at the time) because despite feeling completely crap, faint, fatigue, bonier etc etc I was convinced I was \u201cfine\u201d and just being a wet nelly simply because I was consuming what was considered WAY above the average \u201cnon disordered\u201d 5\u20193 female *should* be eating, if you go by online calculations or even just read grown women bemoaning that they can \u201conly\u201d eat x amount of calories or they will instantly become huge. By that token I should have been *gaining* weight, not getting down to stupidly low bmi. I thought I was going a little insane tbh. \n\nProof is in the pudding though..like I said restriction is restriction and your body is 100% going to let you know about it. \n\nGreat post, really glad I\u2019m not the only one who thought this way! I hope it\u2019s made others feel less invalidated by the \u201chigh res\u201d narrative.",

TW: Numbers (calories and exercise).\n\nPeople are often surprised when I tell them how 'much' I was eating most days at my sickest. My average intake was probably around 1200 calories per day. Half my daily intake was fruit and veggies, if not more. As I got worse, I'd intentionally overestimate my intake, so it's possible I was eating under 1000 calories some of the time.\n\nI was so addicted to exercise. That was my drug, my escape from the anxious mind I'd been stuck with my whole life.\n\nI walk for transportation, live in a big city in the US with good public transit so no need for a car. Probably did 20k steps (10 miles) per day on average.\n\nI'd walk to the gym, where I'd walk some more on the treadmill lol. I loved reading and walking at the same time, still do, and you can only safely do that on a treadmill. When too anxious to leave home, I'd walk around my apartment for hours, walk in place... Embarrassingly, when out with friends or family, I'd sometimes go to the bathroom and jog in place for several minutes.\n\nOther than that, I was (and still am) super into Pilates. Yoga as well. And I was a dancer, for fun and professionally. It was two hours Pilates every day, an hour of yoga, and anywhere from 2 hours of dance to \\~10 hours of dance on my most active days.\n\nSo yeah, obviously all of this physical activity put me at a huge caloric deficit. My diet probably looked 'normal' to some people, but it was nowhere near enough food to sustain such an active lifestyle. My body was falling apart, emaciated, kidneys shutting down, weak immune system (low white blood cell count) I'd get sick all the time. That's no way to live.\n\nI used to feel embarrassed / ashamed when others with eating disorders would share their super low daily calorie count. Now I don't give a fuck, thankfully. It took some work to get to this level of confidence. I do my best to educate those who are ignorant about eating disorders, and I don't take it personally when I hear things like:\n\n'That's not anorexia... Anorexia means you don't eat anything!'\n\n'You weren't anorexic, anorexics don't eat anything...'\n\n'Anorexics only eat 300 calories per day.'",

For years, I told others that I had a \"restrictive\" ED but that it was definitely not Anorexia. I believed this was the case because of the stereotypes in society, online, and even in medical/professional spaces. The first reason was that I thought my level of restriction wasn't severe enough. Because I was eating about 1,580 cals for 5 years consistently, and the lowest calories I maintained were \\~1,200-1,300, I thought that I was eating TOO much to be considered anorexic. However, I lost my period very early on as my restriction began, and I was even losing weight when I bumped up my calories to 1,900-2,000 for a period of time in the early stages. I had amenorrhea for \\~6 years, which resulted in osteoporosis. I also had the typical signs of a decreased BMR, such as sensitivity to cold, decreased BP and HR, fatigue, skin/teeth issues, etc. A second reason was that I didn't think I was \"thin enough\" to be considered anorexic. My BMI had fluctuated below and within the normal BMI range, and it was only at my very lowest weight that my BMI fell mildly below the \"normal weight range.\" This BMI range was not taking into account what my pre-ED, non-restrictive, healthy weight was.",

      "body": "Exactly this. These formulas are so out of place and reality but simultaneously do so much damage. Most of them will write you off as eating way off the upper limit and if you actually consider what you've ate it will be like a normal-ish typical simple meal. For the whole darn day. Not even taken in consideration that most people need much more than a simple meal during their day. Also usually their \"nutritional\" values are also non sensical. Like someone eats 2 eggs and thats your vitamins for the day. ***Nani???***\n\nMy partner is the one that has AN, not myself, but even though I supposedly have an okay relationship with food, everytime I have used one of these even for \"fun\" I get terrified and perplexed. They give a ***so*** wrong and scewed version of eating and \"appropriate calorie intake\" that they become a very quick path to an ED even if someone doesn't have one.\n\n\nNot even mentioning all the suggestions and ads for even more destructive eating habits they're all floaded with.",
