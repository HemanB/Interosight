  "title": "Today I'm letting go",
  "selftext": "More like yesterday, but still.\n\nI'm letting go of this eating disorder, to the best of my ability. I know it will take time to heal, to learn, and to grow. But I am tired of this. My eating disorder has been nothing but a cover for problems, an escape mechanism. I don't need to escape. I can't escape, anyway. There is never an end to becoming thin. It is a struggle that will ALWAYS persist because what I have lacked isn't confidence, nor security...what I have lacked is self-acceptance. \n\nAll I have to do is...be. Just be. Just accept. Much easier than it sounds, but I need to accept myself, my reality, and that my body is a certain way. That does not mean I can't be healthy, it just means that I need to let go of this unhealthy escape attempt that has begun to ruin my quality of life.\n\nI miss enjoying good food at restaurants. I miss enjoying desserts. I miss having snacks with friends when we go out. I miss the freedom of not counting every calorie. I miss the days when I would think more about how much I liked the design on a shirt rather than how that shirt looked on my body. I am more than my body, I am more than this illness. I want to face that. It's scary, and it's going to be hard, but I want to let this go. \n\nMuch of my life has been focused on \"how do I get rid of this\" instead of \"how do I work with this\". There is no getting away from who we are. We can practice and change our ways of thinking, but me personally, I cannot escape myself. I have been my biggest enemy, and it's time to be my best friend. It doesn't change in a day, or a night, or a week, but it will be a long term thing that I am going to try my best to take on and work with, instead of against. To be my happiest self, I must accept myself. Without self-acceptance, I will never find happiness. \n\nIt is time to let this eating disorder go, and it is time for it to let go of the control it has over my life.",
