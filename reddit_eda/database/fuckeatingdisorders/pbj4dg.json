  "selftext": "Aight it might just be my personal turmoil but the eating disorder recovery hashtag is FULL of young white girls who are skinny as skinny gets, posting abt their recovery. \n\nI'm not saying they cant go through eating disorders-- of course they can!! But.. why are so many of them filling the edrecovery hashtag? \n\nI'm following it so I can get better... but I think those posts are making me worse. I see how they are \"better\" and managed to keep their small bodies. What?? Is going on??\n\nHow are they able to do that? It kinda pisses me off. I'm not sure why. I feel like-- it's not fair, it's a lie. How come I have to stay in a big body while they get to live out their lives, skinny and mentally sound? What the hell?? Their posts are almost thinspo at this point, showing off their small bodies staring how many stretch marks they have when in actuality they are still small-- small enough to have visible collarbones. \n\nI think I'm just jealous. It's so tiring looking at myself while seeing how they are still preaching recovery and looking like that. It pisses me off too bc I feel like they are furthering eating disorders, their posts make me think they're saying \"oh! You can recover and look as good as me.\" When that's a lie.",

I think a huge reason we mainly see these types of bodies is because they are still socially acceptable, whereas others in larger bodies are not. You\u2019ll get praised for living in a privileged body (white, thin girls are told they\u2019re strong, beautiful and deserve to eat) while those in larger bodies either get a whole different kind of praise or straight up disgust and encouragement to engage in ED behaviors (think, the \u201cyou\u2019re so brave\u201d comments for doing basic things just because they\u2019re bigger or being told they should eat less solely due to their size).\n\nI don\u2019t follow these accounts anymore. Tbh, I don\u2019t follow most thin ED accounts because quite frankly, they make me feel fucking terrible about myself and I ask myself the same questions you\u2019ve asked here: why can\u2019t I look like that?\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not saying recovering into a thin body isn\u2019t okay, it absolutely is, but I feel like there is a stark difference between those who recover into a thin body (or play the role of recovered while still actively engaging in behaviors) and those who don\u2019t. And those who don\u2019t often have a significantly harder time trying to navigate recovery and accepting their body at a higher weight compared to those who gained very little. EDs are mental disorders and everyone with an ED is a victim worthy of recovery, but to say \u201cit\u2019s hard for everyone\u201d ignores the pain those in larger bodies go through just for simply existing in a society that literally condemns being fat at all costs.",

I don't enjoy seeing quasi-body checks of skinny people in gym clothes under the edrecovery hashtag (implying that there is a way *somehow* to keep the skinny body, reap all the \"benefits\" of an ED yet be rid of all the behaviors and thoughts. Oh, and you should hit the gym, contrary to all recovery advice ever). Neither do I like seeing people contort themselves into impossible positions to show off belly rolls and cellulite (implying this time that recovery means attaining 'unattractive' attributes that you now must reclaim as attractive, an exposure therapy in all the things your ED fears. Yet, half the people who post these are still really hot).\n\nI think the issue is with body pictures per se. If you feel the need to post your body checks to show off your recovered body I suspect you are not fully healed yet. I am not saying \"don't post pictures of yourself\" but rather \"dont post body checks\". The ED was already so body-focused, recovery should not be the same. Instead show me other things you've 'gained': Outings, new hobbies, even the new sport you are doing, but show it to me in a way that it is not about how it changes your body. \n\nAnd not surprising that this is mostly done by, as you word it, \"young white girls who are skinny as skinny gets\", because they fit the bill of what mainstream media portrays as attractive. There are also recovery accounts of those who do not look like that, but they receive far more backlash (\"you are trading one ED for the other!!\"). They do not sell a fantasy of 'recovery in a skinny body that stays skinny', so that's why they are probably not on trending.",

      "body": "I feel you; it can take a huge hit off your self esteem to see girls in recovery who still seem very small, almost suspiciously so. While I can't speak for everyone, I've observed that a lot of people with restrictive EDs tend to be competitive and quick to make comparisons, especially toward other ED sufferers that seem \"sicker.\" There was even a while there that I thought of myself as \"bad at recovery\" because I kept relapsing into b/p while those on my recovery feeds seemed to go weeks and months with no episodes. Made me want to give up, but it helped to remember that that was just the ED talking. The little voice in your head driving you toward ED behaviors will say anything to drag you back in.\n\nWhat I had to do to get over this, that may help you out too, is to unfollow and unsub a lot of ED related stuff entirely. Even pro recovery blogs. It takes a lot of mental focus off the ED because it's not constantly in your feed. That's not to say you can never revisit, but constantly comparing your body and your recovery process to others' isn't going to make you feel any better, and it sounds like you may not be at a point yet where you can control those thoughts. Taking a break gives you time to think about other things -- hobbies you may have abandoned, projects you never finished, relationships that may have suffered. Making peace with your body is a whole other beast (idk anything about that one man,) but recovery is often minute by minute, and maybe it's time to think about whether you really want to spend those minutes staring at other girls on social media and tearing yourself up over them.\n\nTake care of yourself. \ud83d\udc9e",

      "body": "Social media creates a lot of barriers for people who are anything but white and thin to get noticed by the algorithm. I\u2019d also caution you to direct your anger towards systemic fatphobia rather than at thin bodies. I completely empathize with the sentiment that it pisses you off that these influencers remain thin by societal standards in recovery. But here\u2019s some stuff to keep in mind. A) there is a sizable percentage of \u201crecovery influencers\u201d that are still very much in their eating disorders. Tbh most recovery accounts are really strict about \u201cclean eating\u201d which is far more concerning that the volume of thin bodies on hashtags. B) the only reason you want to be thin I\u2019m the first place is because someone told you that you should. We don\u2019t come programmed caring about this shit. Disordered eating and body image make a lot of businesses a lot of money. So they spend a lot on making you feel like shit about yourself. It\u2019s all prey on the desire for a \u201csolution\u201d to whatever is really bothering you in your life. Part of the game is to feel a sense of jealousy and pit people against each other. And c) never believe what you see on social media. Editing technology has gotten to the point where you can\u2019t tell the difference between a real human and CGI. Again I understand the jealousy but I challenge you to look deeper into why your desire to take up less space  is so strong.",
