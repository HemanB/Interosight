  "selftext": "-body dysmorphia, feeling million times worse about my body, i felt more confident when i weighted more\n\n-intense anxiety, i'm terrified of everything and can't stop worrying\n\n-malnourishment driven compulsions (ocd)\n\n- being angry at my parents 247, turning into a monster\n\n-absolutely dreading waking up because existing becomes so painful\n\n-losing all the hope for a future and not giving a shit about anything, i don't care if i fail my classes and don't get into uni\n\n-isolating from friends because imagine how horrible it would be if i needed to eat my portioned safe foods five minutes away from my schedule!\n\n-fucking awful dissociation, i could accidentally walk under a car and not blink, nothing feels real\n\n-losing your whole personality, people not recognising you mentally\n\n-being freezing cold \n\n-days revolving around food and exercise\n\n-the rituals that take over your whole life and all your freedom\n\n-physical symptoms that you ignore because you kind of wish that they were serious\n\n-being adult and told that you're on your own, wishing you were kid and sent to treatment\n\n-being in such an intense pain that you can only exist by day at a time, the thought of being here in a week makes you want to scream\n\n-every day feels like a pure torture in every way possible\n\n-being in the worst mental pain you've ever been but being so numb you can't let it out so you just turn so angry at everyone and because you don't want to hurt others you end up hurting yourself more and more, it just bottles up to the point of absolute torture\n\nSo yes, keep the ng tiktok dances up and promote relapsing it truly is just as fun as your ed promises!! xxx\n\n\n\n",
