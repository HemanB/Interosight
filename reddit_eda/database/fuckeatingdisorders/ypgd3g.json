  "selftext": "I know it's an ED Group, but it's starting to feel so pro-ana? Like, every 20 hours or so you get a post talking about how good they feel restricting. Or you get:\n\n\"Will I gain weight if I eat xyz?\"\n\"Does anyone feel prettier while restricting?\"\n\"I just binged, how do I get back on track?\"\n\nFirst of all, I get it - again, it's an ED Group. People will discuss safe foods, triggers, etc. but just now I saw someone post about how their \"fat coworker\" was triggered into mimicking their eating habits. And then someone in the comments said regular people don't have it in them to restrict??? And someone responded saying they felt validated???????\n\nI'm sorry, that sub is just so triggering \ud83d\ude2d I'm recovered and I usually just lurk on ED subs because hey, it's still relatable. Goddamn though. That sub is so weirdly pro-restriction and pro-skinny.",

I thought it'd be funny and help me not taking my problems so seriously. I also thought, because my ED wasn't motivated by body image issues, that I wouldn't be triggered the same way.\n\nI know it seems contradictory to you for me to be be on that page given the warning, but I really didn't think it'd affect me like it has. I didn't have disordered eating habits that centered around body image issues. Color me surprised when I starting experiencing the urge to restrict all over again, only this time because I can't stand to look at myself in the mirror now. All because of a meme page that didn't cause me trouble before now.",

It's like a constant reminder that I'm single (and therefore unlovable) because my body doesn't meet the unspoken standards of other people, particularly people I'm attracted to.\n\nWhat's really scary about this is that my ED arose from a desire to control and was initially health obsessed (like orthorexia but with more chaos). As someone who developed an eating disorder without body image issues, the sub is literally giving me body image issues when I didn't have them.",
