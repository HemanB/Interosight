  "selftext": "i finally told my sister about my eating disorder and i confessed that i haven\u2019t eaten in over 2 days. she acted like she cared then she came in my room asking me if her cheeks look fatter and pulled up her shirt to show me that her stomach got bigger (she\u2019s taking these pills that can cause weight gain). shes 5'6 and 110. she said that the pills are dumb because they\u2019re causing her the gain weight... doesn\u2019t she think about how that might make me feel?? like what the fuck. now i\u2019m crying because i feel even more disgusting than i did before.",
