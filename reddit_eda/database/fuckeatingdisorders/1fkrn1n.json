The best dietician I had really helped me through my stint with using social media as basically a google search. One time I asked her an insane food question I had seen from a post and she lovingly responded \"what in the tiktok f\\*ckery is that?!\". To this day when I hear someone sharing clearly unfounded social media nutrition nonsense I say this to myself. (and sometimes to whoever said it)",
