  "selftext": "My mom told me yesterday she will no longer pay any of my healthcare. So if I was to drop off again, I wouldn't have any help. I don't have insurance now, can't see a therapist or dietician anymore without paying out of pocket. My ED is screaming to really throw in the towel, but instead I'm using this as fuel to really become a better me by myself, for myself. \n\nI'm basically homeless right now, I stay with my grandma after leaving treatment AMA. I'm almodt 21 and I feel like such a loser. I feel like a stranger here, and everywhere. Haven't slept in my own bed in months. Instead of using this to break me further, I'm using this to find my purpose. \n\nI sold my shitty car, bought an SUV, and I plan on taking a road trip, living out of it for minimum a week in a few weeks. I've wanted to do this for ages and it's finally a possibility, albeit my ED. I won't have access to make all my safe foods, be so rigid, and it's exactly what I feel I need. To learn how to eat to survive instead of please my ED. To really find my roots and beliefs outside of what this disorder has brainwashed me to believe I want. To be okay with the bare minimum because I hate this health addicted-trying to be perfect mold I've shrunk myself into. I realized how comfortable I was living in groundhog day, doing, eating, living the same boring life everyday and finally I've hit my breaking point. It's not what I want for my life. \n\nI'm still struggling, but mentally I'm the free-st I've been in so so long. I feel like I'm taking my life back, for me, and not for anyone else or my stupid ed. If I can do this, I can break the chains I feel like are wrapped around me. \n\nClaim your life back. Do what feels authentic to you, and I promise your ed will start to shrink even a tiny bit. \"Show em who's boss\" so to say. \n\nAlso, share your favorite roadtrip snacks. The ones you got as a kid, or what you'd get if your ed was never present at all. I'm sure I might get around to some of em along the way. :)",

When I was a kid my parents would grab me one from the gas station. \n\nAlso if you stop at any local delis or cafes, ask the person working what their favorite thing is and then try that - it gets you out of your comfort zone and sometimes the thing is really good! \n\nGlad you\u2019re doing this. Good luck \ud83d\udc98",
