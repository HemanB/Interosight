  "selftext": "last week, i was fully engulfed in relapse, i\u2019d been for awhile. i won\u2019t detail my specific rituals, \u201crules\u201d, etc. but i was able to do all of them everyday and was losing constantly and was most comfortable that way as my ED has been present since i was maybe 11. but on thursday everything changed. i found out i am pregnant. (5 weeks and 2 days today). i thought, with the low weight and no period, i could have gone so long without knowing. i got lucky on an off chance and just happened to find out earlier than even healthy women typically find out. i won\u2019t say it magically put me into recovery, but i haven\u2019t touched my ED tracking journal, haven\u2019t purged (HUGE for me as i will begin sweating and shaking and crying if i don\u2019t purge because i feel so terrible and guilty) and i\u2019ve been using watching pregnancy vids as distraction when i get impulsions. this baby is already making me a better person. i\u2019m 21. i\u2019m scared. but i\u2019m so thankful, for obvious reasons and because my boyfriend and i were told by doctors that we would be very unlikely to naturally conceive. but here we are! and i\u2019m so ready to get healthy and do right! for the first time i feel like my life can go beyond constant relapse and just blimps of living in between.",

Wishing you a h&h pregnancy and beyond \ud83c\udf38\n\nPlease, consider asking your midwife at your booking in appointment for prenatal ED counseling, even though you feel well now. Pregnancy and postpartum puts a heavy strain on ED and i would strongly advise to have the safety net. \n\nI always relapse after pregnancy even though when I first got pregnant I\u2019d been in remission for well over a year. It gets harder as they grow up, I\u2019m struggling with another relapse now I have a teenage daughter who I\u2019m supposed to be a role model to. Ime the healthcare in maternity react very positively to proactive measures against ED, don\u2019t be afraid! I only wish I\u2019d had the courage to do it sooner.\n\nGood luck!",

I'm not saying it's bad that you're having or keeping the kid, just that there surely has to be some extra effort put in to make sure you'll be okay after giving birth as well.\n\nI just remember back in ye days on anorexia forums, I would often read about moms who got pregnant, was fine during the entire pregnancy, and then relapse the second they give birth because they don't have a 'good enough excuse' to keep eating. \n\nI wish you best of luck in finding yourself",

This feeling will disappear as soon as you give birth, and since you no longer have an excuse to yourself to justify your eating patterns, you're gonna relapse and your child will watch you do it and follow your example. Kids notice, and if you have any disordered patterns during their childhood, they will mimick you 100%\n\nPlease don't be fooled into thinking this child is gonna cure you. It won't. I would suggest not having the child at all, and wait until you're healthier when not pregnant. If you have moral issues with abortion, you at the very least need permanent therapy, every single week maybe twice a week from now on until after birth. Otherwise you're gonna go straight back to where you were as soon as this child is here. And adding constant stress from taking care of a baby won't help your disorder.\n\nPlease think of your child first.",

Wtf.\n\nIf she's were to go straight back to relapsing after birth, which is statistically likely, abortion for some people would be the right choice to make. You can always get pregnant again, abortion is completely morally sound as long as it's not too late on.\n\nBesides, did you just decide to skip the whole 'intense therapy' part for funsies? I said it was an option of many. Nobody should be selfish enough to keep a child in the world knowing they're gonna make them sick for life, so unless she can go get therapy and force herself to recover, which can be extrenwlt difficult or impossible, abortion would be the kinder option.",
