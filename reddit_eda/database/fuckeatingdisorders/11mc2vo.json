  "selftext": "I gained about 36 pounds in recovery. I know weight talk during this process is regarded as counterproductive but it\u2019s not for me. I couldn\u2019t feel more content. I genuinely don\u2019t care about it. If you would\u2019ve told me that I would be back at this number to me, deep in my Ed, I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done. \n\nThe last time I didn\u2019t feel devoid of harrowing depression was more than three years ago. Everyday during the depths of my disorder, I felt like an ostrich with its head in the sand. I was existing physically but my mental state was so far gone. I dissociated the most important years of my life. I have no memories of highschool besides those of restriction. I couldn\u2019t even tell you about the day of my graduation, but I can remember everything I ate that day, and the amount of steps. \n\nIt\u2019s saddening to me that I lost a lot of my youth to this disorder. It\u2019s saddening that all of my relationships, my passions, my hobbies, my academics all went with the weight loss. With each pound, I lost a facet of my personality, and I lost who I was. I would work at my job and not remember who I was. What I was living for. I had no one and no one knew me. I never spoke, I was quiet, and I was alone. I had ghosted my friends, ended friendships of 12+ years because I no longer had the capacity for others in my life. My pulse was weak and my ability to run was gone. I wasn\u2019t able to walk without agonizing pain. People would ask me questions, and all my brain would internalize was tv static. Food was a threat, something I had to plan for, and wait for, and long for, and dread. Life was only existent upon numbers. What time to eat, how many calories, how many more hours until I can eat, how much do I weigh, how much more do I need to lose. I went through anorexia, orthorexia, bulimia, binge eating, back to anorexia. I went through every Ed and suffered tremendously. I didn\u2019t have the attention span to watch videos or listen to music. I played instruments for eight years and my love for music was lost. I didn\u2019t care about anything. I would sit in my music class and my brain was dormant. My teacher knew something was wrong, but couldn\u2019t discern why the student that was a freshman prodigy was now a lifeless senior post Covid. I never smiled, I never laughed, and when I did, it felt wrong. I didn\u2019t think I would live much longer. I thought my years were limited, that I would either starve to death or I would commit suicide. \n\nI recall being on a walk, deep in my Ed, and seeing a tree, leaking honey colored sap. I can remember physically drooling over it, imagine the tree was bread, and the sap was honey. I manically walked the next ten miles, drooling at the thought of bread and honey. I can recall crying for hours, debating if i should make it painless, or draw out my end through my Ed. Insanity. \n\nI\u2019m not underweight anymore. I have disordered thoughts occasionally. And I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m recovered. But I have the food freedom and mental clarity of someone who never went through the pain I did. \n\n I gained weight but I regained my love for music, my ability to walk, the ability to love, to speak to others with kindness, to be filled with excitement about food, to look in the mirror and recognize myself, to stay grounded, to have my mind think about myself with compassion, to show others compassion, to look forward to the future, to know my life is meaningful, to know I am loved. I picked up my clarinet again. Like I said, I used to be an outstanding musician, and I mean that, full cockiness implied. Playing it again, as a hobby, not as a distraction from food, genuinely makes me want to cry. This is the first month in a long time where I don\u2019t wanna die. I have no depression, and I have no thoughts of suicide. \n\nPlease recover while you still can. It\u2019s a long process. It\u2019s even harder than the Ed. But I promise you, you don\u2019t deserve to live hating yourself. You deserve happiness and joy, and to eat cake when you want, to be able to think of yourself kindly, to run, to walk, to not be confined to food thoughts. \n\nSo yeah, I stepped on the scale. I honestly have plans to chuck the fucker in the trash. But I felt only love towards myself. I saw a number, not an indicator of who I was as a person, or what I\u2019ve lived. I unconditionally promise myself to never go back to the way it was. I deserve more in life. I deserve everything it has to offer. And then some.",

Wear some eye protection and break it with a hammer, run over it with a vehicle, throw it into the fires of a mythical volcano, just don't even give it the satisfaction of being used/recovered.  You are going through recovery, no reason to give the lifeless device which has taken so much of your life the same opportunity to come back into your life.",
