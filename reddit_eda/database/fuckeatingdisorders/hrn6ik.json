  "selftext": "Some alcoholics drink as a distraction from all the problems they are experiencing in their lives. Being drunk numbs their feeling and allows them to forget their troubles. But drinking also makes those problems worse because they are left to fester and life becomes 100x more difficult to live happily when you have a destructive addiction.\n\nSimilarly, restricting my diet gives me temporary relief from the horrible thoughts I have about my body and life. It gives me a sense of achievement that temporarily silences my swimming mind. When I restrict, I can forget how much I hate myself, but while I'm doing that, I can never address the root causes of that hatred, therefore strengthening it. \n\nStarvation is my alcohol that makes my life seemingly more tolerable; but in reality it is just making everything worse...",

It's like a deranged game of whack a mole. I would probably take the anorexia over alcoholism most days though. Fewer legal consequences.",

      "body": "I often relate my ED to when I was addicted to self harm. I do it for the same reasons--self loathing, control, hoping people will notice and care about me when I don't feel cared about, hoping I might go too far/passive suicidality, stress relief, clearing my mind, a physical manifestation of internal pain... the list goes on. My eating disorder is basically a more socially acceptable version of self harm, which is super messed up when you think about it.\n\nAnd I got super addicted to self harm, like even when I felt great and didn't have a reason to do it anymore, I still had constant urges, and any life inconvenience became a reason to do it. And it's the same with my ED, even as my mental health has improved I still lapse into it because it's familiar and comes with a certain high.\n\nUnfortunately ED recovery is so much harder. Can't avoid food.",
