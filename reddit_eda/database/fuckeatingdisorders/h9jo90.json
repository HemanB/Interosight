  "selftext": "I do not mean to invalidate anyone or make anyone feel guilty or feel uncomfortable, but I really need to vent. Please do not take offense. I just really need to let this out because it\u2019s been bothering me for awhile. \n\nI feel so alone at times. I feel so underrepresented by the fucking media and my therapist doesn\u2019t understand that. I rarely see any videos about women of color suffering from these diseases. We are invisible. I feel invisible. And because of my ethnicity we tend to have \u201ccurvier\u201d bodies. Not that mine is that curvy right now, since I\u2019m UW, but I still see the boxiness of it. And the culture and having immigrant parents that don\u2019t understand my ed just kinda like feels bleh. \n\nMy doctor told me I need to go inpatient and I do not want to go because I am scared I won\u2019t see anyone who \u201clooks\u201d like me. It\u2019ll make me feel like shit and alone. I know this sounds stupid or weird and it may be, but it\u2019s something that is important to me. \n\nI want to feel heard, and on this platform I DO feel heard. Thank you all so much for always being here for everyone. We don\u2019t have to see how we look like to support one another and that\u2019s what I love about this subreddit. You guys fucking rock \u2764\ufe0f. \n\nI just wish it was like this outside of here basically.",

She looks at her plate confused, and then asks about it. Turns out the dietitian confused her with the only other black girl in the program. \n\n\nSo yeah, I got the privilege of seeing blatant racism in health care. I'm so sorry that this kind of stuff happens. \n\nI also noticed how care is handled sometimes. All the therapists were white and it seemed kinda obvious they didn't understand some of the things these girls went through. I imagine there's a lot if other racist  bullshit out there too.",

      "body": "As others have said, you are definitely not alone. It is really difficult and unfortunate that a lot of people do not understand (or maybe even realize) that this, like any other medical or mental health issue effects all different types of people.\n\nLike you, I suspect my ethnically \"boxier\" frame, even when I was very underweight for my body, caused my ED to go unnoticed by the few medical professionals I encountered as a kid and young adult. I definitely relate to having immigrant parents and living in a culture that misunderstands issues like EDs. I had periods in my life, especially as a kid, where my ED really grabbed onto the idea that things couldn't be that bad for me because people with my type of background don't have EDs--wrong!\n\nAdditionally, many of us non-white people also are dealing with a history of poverty. The compounding class issue is rarely addressed, and of course contributes to issues like this going unnoticed. This is not only due to the of a lack of adequate health care, but also because these issues are stereotypically seen as a middle-class problem. For me, it is really hard to unravel the threads of my ED because I know my history of food scarcity (and my parents' own histories of food scarcity) played a pretty large role in the development of my issues with food.\n\nI feel incredibly grateful to have this space where these types of issues can be brought up and are treated with respect.
