  "selftext": "A friend of mine dropped off a baked good for me to try (I do a lot of baking for friends), and said she really wanted to hear my feedback. \n\nThe urge was there to either chew and spit, or just throw it out and tell her it was great. But I know that every time I eat, it\u2019s a conscious decision towards health, and I know that my friend gave me that as a gesture of love. So, I ate it for breakfast. \n\nI\u2019ll probably be spinning my wheels about it for a couple days, but I know the next time will be easier :) and I know that the discomfort of recovery is better than waking up at 75, with stress fractures and a decades-old fear of carbs. \n\nWishing you all a happy and healthy Tuesday.",
