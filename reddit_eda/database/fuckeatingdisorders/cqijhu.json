  "title": "Today i\u2019m 1 year into recovery: an honest update",
  "selftext": "I didn\u2019t really choose recovery tbh, one day i just snapped. Things aren\u2019t great yet honestly. My ED completely destroyed my social life, health and financial state. I\u2019m still dealing with physical consequences and ruined relationships. The debt that came with no longer being able to work still haunts me. I have underlying depression/PTSD that\u2019s difficult to cope with.\n\nYet... it\u2019s been so worth it? Yes life still sucks, but not in the way my ED made me feel. I felt completely trapped in my ED. Every day was the same and the sense of happiness I gained from it was so tiny and pointless. \n\nFacing life and its problems is shitty but at least feels more satisfying to me nowadays. Picking up the pieces after my ED has been exhausting but I feel damn strong doing it. I\u2019m looking out for my future self now. That feels really good. \n\nRecovery fucking sucks though, sorry to be blunt. However it\u2019s nothing compared to life stuck in an ED. Anyone who\u2019s trying to recover right now, I feel you and I\u2019m so proud of you. Prying the parasite that is an eating disorder off your brain takes incredible strength, especially on top of life\u2019s other stresses. \n\nAfter the mid recovery clusterfuck (aka the worst depression of my life) things started getting better. I thought i\u2019d be miserable forever but just as promised, I started feeling better. \n\nSo yea, you\u2019re not the exception to recovery (trust me, i thought i was 100% an exception). Even if your life\u2019s a mess like mine. I feel like a cheese ball saying that but I seriously sympathize with you guys. \n\nCheers to another year. \u2764\ufe0f",

      "body": "Thank you for responding, it's really helpful for me to know that I'm not alone in continued physical symptoms.   So I don't feel like I'm failing or start questioning my treatment / eating (ex. *it's bc I'm not eating every superfood every day!*).  I'm moving from more structured eating to more intuitive eating, but sometimes the energy/pain makes me start second guessing myself.\n\nExpecting possible continued fatigue/soreness also helps plan for the next year, since friends/colleagues (not close ones who know) are wondering why I'm not going out for massive runs or bike rides.  I'm beyond that period of the excuse of \"recovering from an injury\" so now I don't know how to deflect the invites (I am *really* an outdoorsy person).\n\nThen there's travel-  I have big goals, both personal and work, but I probably need to keep things in the very-low-activity range for awhile.  I recently went on an overseas trip, thinking (back when I bought tickets) that I *should* be ready for some action at 3 months clean & feeding, but the long days of walking on concrete and carrying backpacks (which I wouldn't have even noticed before) truly \\*kicked my ass\\*.  I don't regret going bc it was amazing, but my partner did have to experience some breakdowns of frustration and ruminations on *why is my body not working  yet?!?*  So looks like we should plan something relaxing and spa-type for our next trip :)\n\nI feel you about needing to eat more, or for me, it's more often (since I don't really enjoy very big meals anymore).  My partner never eats breakfast, can skip any meal without consequence and just eat more later, and sometimes I feel like I should be able to do this, but of course I quickly fall apart! (and always did, but even moreso to almost passing out during my ED).  He is so kind and supportive, and he's always been good about us finding a snack or meal even if he's not hungry.  I just have to own it and not feel self-conscious about always having snacks in my purse or needing to stop for a bite.\n\nI wish you all the best in your continued recovery!! There is so much pain and sadness on this reddit sub, so it's wonderful to hear a voice of reason and hope from the other side of the battlefield :)",
