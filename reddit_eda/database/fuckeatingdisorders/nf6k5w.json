Everyday she would go to the supermarket and buy me binge food, ask me what I wanted and bought me it with no questions asked. Then she would shame me, guilt me. Tell me how much she does for me, how much I owe her etc which would make me feel like shit and I would binge to cope. It was this vicious cycle. \n\nI\u2019m trying to recover now but it\u2019s so difficult. I wish she just gave me the help I needed not straight up enable my eating disorder\n\n\nIn therapy so please don\u2019t tell me to go there",

Not that way but my mother absolutely refused to acknowledge my anorexia, and when I was trying to recover (and struggling) she just cut me out of family meals unless it was a special occasion like Christmas or something. So then I had no access to cooked/warm food to try to recover (she was too controlling in the kitchen for me to sort out my own, and also I was just a teenager and did not want to recover).",

      "body": "My mom usually gets herself food (this dumb Ed shit has been going on for generations, my granny\u2019s mom died of not eating, my granny very visibly struggles with the obsessive clean and \u201chealthy\u201d eating thing, my mom binges usually for a few days to years and then looses the weight by eating raw and vegan only and doing sports excessively, my granny told me her granny wasn\u2019t eating anything if someone was in the same room with her and died after not eating at all for quite some time, both may aunts struggle with obvious Ed\u2019s as well, my sister obviously has problems with binges and I\u2019m struggling with a nice mix of stuff with a nice constant bulimia thing going on) anyway, she makes herself food and because she is ashamed of eating she makes me feel guilty for making myself food as well. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s the first thing I ate, it doesn\u2019t matter if I have half of what she had, the only thing that matters is her guilt and the fact that I\u2019m overweight. But I\u2019m overweight because I binge in secret cause I can\u2019t eat when she\u2019s there cause she will make me feel so bad about myself and then I\u2019ll eat to stop the brain. I\u2019m actively planing on getting professional help as soon as I\u2019m 18 cause my mom doesn\u2019t think anything is wrong besides me being too lazy. I just wish I wouldn\u2019t have these problems with food. I just wish I could eat without feeling so bad afterwards and I wish I could stop binging. If I didnt binge I\u2019d be a normal weight. People would finally stop thinking I\u2019m dumb/poor/lazy. I\u2019m so tired of spending all my money on binges..I\u2019m so tired of this bullshit and I\u2019m pretty sure the things my mom said are like 45% of the reasons. In conclusion: moms are shit, I hope u get better, my mom won\u2019t get grandchildren cause damn I won\u2019t make more mentally ill kids.",
