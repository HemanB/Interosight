That's why I always gravitated towards heavy metal music and it's kind of fashion, which was basically jeans, T-shirts and a good pair of leather boots. I've never felt like my body was ever attractive, no matter the fashion. Probably why I hated fashion and clothes growing up.\n\nI hate this whole recycling of the every 20 years. I didn't like distressed jeans or bootleg jeans to begin with because either everyone can see your legs, or I looked like I had no legs because I'm short and bootcut jeans are so wide. I still hate most fashions that came out of the 90s/early 00s.",
