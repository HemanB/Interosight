None of this shit is our fault and I want to say that because part of the ED tells us we're to blame. That there's something wrong with US, but I'm here to say that's a fucking lie and FUCK anyone who has told us otherwise that's led in part to our EDs (or to the people that STILL say shit even now when we're in recovery).",

      "body": "The insults though they were appearance-themed were not about our appearance at all, they did the equivalent of visit a random insult generator online and said whatever it showed. They're assholes for the sake of being assholes, and more often than not it's not even over personal beef but they felt like being an asshole to anyone in their path, that just so happened to be us, and their insults are generic bullshit they pulled from the shallow archives of their shallow minds of hostile things to say. Treat it like fake news, because it is. We took the bait because we didn't know any better at the time, but now we do, especially if you are/have been skinny and their rhetoric never changed, that's hard evidence right there. Don't let yourself get sick and wither away in attempt to halt their crusade because from firsthand experience it does not change, they don't stop, because it was never about your appearance let alone anything rational or based in reality in the first place. Losing weight to gain respect is like studying astronomy in order to learn how to ride a bicycle. It's not even relevant so of course it's not going to work, I learnt the hard way that compensating this way does jack shit. It's gotta be approached directly or by cutting them off completely if they are completely unreasonable and won't stop being a dick.",

Nobody\u2019s perfect, and everyone has blind spots.\n\nI could\u2019ve been born to an unfathomably rich oil tycoon in the Middle East and had the most luxurious of silver spoons growing up. I\u2019m sure I still would\u2019ve had problems. Robin Williams killed himself. Rich kids at wealthy schools commit crime and need antidepressants too. Life\u2019s always gonna have tough aspects.
