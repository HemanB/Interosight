  "title": "Today and everyday here after I will commit myself to unrestricted eating and weight gain.",
  "selftext": "I\u2019ve been recovering from my last relapse for nearly a month now, I\u2019ve never made it this far and I\u2019m honestly very surprised. Although I can feel I\u2019ve been in the verge of a relapse for about a week and increasingly engaging in unhelpful behaviours I wanted to write this to hold myself accountable to my commitment to this recovery. \n\nI realised a few days ago that I was still restricting, eating a lot, but I was still weighing everything, counting calories and would never let myself eat above my goal calories even if I was really hungry and really wanted to. So I threw out all the scales, deleted MFP and made a pledge to commit myself to structured unrestricted eating (still having a baseline minimum of 3 meals + 3 snacks and an idea of how much that has to include at a minimum. It went well, until I realised I had started skipping snacks and missing parts off meals and justifying it by the fact I was not physically hungry, or I had waiting too long and at that point I should just wait until the next meal or snack and not bother eating. Yesterday was my birthday and I wanted to challenge having a meal out and having an alcoholic drink with it, I did have several panic attacks beforehand, which included sitting down on the side of the road and crying but I did manage to have a starter and a drink instead of a full meal and then took myself out for takeaway chips on the beach to make up for it. \n\nOn reflection of all of this I realised something very important about my commit to recovery. Eating was becoming easier, I have basically no fear foods anymore, food and the act of eating causes very little anxiety in the moment now, the most nerve wrecking thing is getting overwhelmed by having to make a decision about what to eat. I can see that this proves I have committed myself to and am succeeding at eating unrestrictedly. However, I still feel terrible about eating afterwards, I find eating food I haven\u2019t prepared and don\u2019t know the calories of really difficult, using different bowls so I\u2019m not forcing myself the tiniest portions possible is difficult and eating food I deem \u201cbad\u201d or \u201cunhealthy\u201d because it\u2019s a food associated with weight gain by diet culture is hard. I see that this shows I haven\u2019t actually committed myself to unrestricted weight gain, I continue to use this behaviours because I fear if I don\u2019t I will gain weight. Which is stupid, I can\u2019t recover still holding on to a suppress body weight, I can\u2019t allow myself food freedom, and not allow my body freedom to gain weight, change shape, and make itself healthy. \n\nSo after that stupidly long post I\u2019m here to say, today and every day here after I shall commit myself to both. I will eat the food I want in the amounts my body wants and needs regardless of the consequence of that (which will in the end be a better and happier life), I will do this every moment regardless of external factors. I can be sad, anxious, angry, happy, indifferent and still eat. Basically I must eat in order to heal my body and my relationship with food. So if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m off to have a PBJ sandwich, and maybe some of that leftover takeout.",

I know I still need a little bit more of a push before I can fully commit, but I feel so close after today, I think I\u2019m nearly ready. The problem is that my family keeps triggering me by bringing up my eating habits and weight, (I\u2019ve talked to them about it and they do it less, but sometimes it slips out) but I\u2019m moving out in 2 weeks so I think I\u2019ll finally be in the right mindset to commit to full recovery.",

Honestly it\u2019s so freeing, today my sister offered my some Japanese cookies she bought from are local Asian super market. The label is in Japanese, I couldn\u2019t read it and I don\u2019t know any nutritional information. I immediately said yes when offered and I ate and moved on. It was so freeing to join in, it was so nice to be able to say yes. She\u2019s a little younger than me but has autism so doesn\u2019t really understand what\u2019s going on with me - she always offers me some of her food and I can see the disappointment in her eyes when I say no. It was nice not to see that. \n\nIt\u2019s so easy, it\u2019s so difficult, but it\u2019s worth it. Good luck with everything and I hope moving out goes well and that it is a positive move for you and your recovery. Take care.",
