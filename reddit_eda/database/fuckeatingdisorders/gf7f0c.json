  "title": "Body Callout during a Zoom Call",
  "selftext": "I was hanging out with five friends last night via Zoom and one of them was talking about this guy who knows him and how he\u2019s always pressuring him to work out.\n\nHe was saying how maybe he has a point and he should lose weight because this guy was basically offering to become his sugar daddy if he would get thin. Then he jokingly(?) said, \u201cI mean it makes sense, look at the only one of us who\u2019s married.\u201d (which is me). \n\nAnd it was so uncomfortable? There was one girl in the call who knows about my ED and changed the topic, but it was just so uncalled for.\n\nAnd it really pissed me off. Even if I didn\u2019t have an ED, it\u2019s a shitty thing to say and it probably made everyone else in the call feel bad (none of them are large). \n\nI feel like it\u2019s very possible this guy *has* been having a hard time with his weight during quarantine and made a snide remark, but I just HATE when people assume that I\u2019m having an easy go of it because I didn\u2019t put on weight in quarantine.\n\nQuarantine has been absolute hell and I\u2019ve had my worst relapse in a long time. I\u2019m slowly picking up the pieces and trying not to fall apart while stuck inside taking care of a toddler, managing a home, and working remotely.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re stuck at home all day with little to no responsibilities and have put on a few pounds that will probably fall off once your schedule goes back to normal.\n\nJust fuck you.",

      "body": "Hi, I\u2019m sorry he put you on the spot and I\u2019m sorry you are struggling so much. I just wanted to offer solidarity. I\u2019m working from home with a 1 and 4 year old and the stress is unrelenting. Now I\u2019ve turned back to my ED I\u2019ve been recovered from.\n\nPeople in different aspects of my life had been commenting on my weight loss that I guess really became noticeable early this year but was really due to finally getting the last bit of baby weight off. I\u2019ve been pregnant or nursing almost the entire time I\u2019ve lived in this town so they just aren\u2019t used to seeing me at my normal size, which looks thin compared to the average adult. Anyway, the comments triggered me big time even though they were well intended.. Now I\u2019m losing more weight from relapse and feel so self-conscious in a bad way.. even despite feeling driven and wanting to be skinnier. I was wearing a v-neck T-shirt on a virtual happy hour and about died from embarrassment when my colleagues were talking about weight gain and one made a comment that I\u2019ll be a skeleton by the end of this. I just mumbled something about being busy from the kids. \n\nUnless it\u2019s a personal friend that has told me they are on a weight loss or fitness program, I never comment on someone\u2019s size or shape, big or small. It\u2019s so off limits in my mind!",

I\u2019m usually pretty chill about people talking about bodies and food and understanding that I\u2019m just super sensitive, but....it\u2019s a tough time and I needed to rant. \n\nMy support systems or bare minimum right now because of the virus situation, holding on though!
