  "selftext": "I simply cannot envision a future where I just eat what I truly, ACTUALLY want and maintain an average weight, just like I did before developing an ED. My mind just can't process that scenario. The ED convinces me that the slightly restrictive prescribed meal plans, with set mealtimes, \"normal\" portion sizes, an \"average\" amount of calories and \"no binges because that's only emotional\" is the only barrier that protects me from becoming overweight.\n\nThere will never, ever be a time where I can just munch on something without having to forcibly stop myself. A time where I eat a normal lunch and feel fully satisfied afterwards. A time where I don't think about food and have to compulsively fill my time with random stuff to try and distract myself from it. A time where I eat one slice of cake or a handful of crisps and do not secretly want to eat the whole package but pretend otherwise. Or, if that will happen, it will only be because I've become overweight in the process - which will mean that my ED was right.",

      "body": "Hi there! I feel like I\u2019ve come a long way in recovery, so I hope my experience helps you.\n\nI also had this fear (still have it). After the obsessive restricting, I had a bingeing phase, then restriction, then bingeing, sprinkled with compensatory excessive exercise. I thought my hunger was broken, that I\u2019d forever have to, like you say, force myself to stop, because my stomach had become a black hole, and I yearned for the days when I was a child who just naturally got full on not much.\n\nEventually I decided that what I was doing to myself was unacceptable and it wasn\u2019t how I wanted to live my life, so I very gradually started taking steps toward recovery. Deleting tracking apps, not counting in my head, eating out without worrying about not knowing the calories in my food, eating more foods I didn\u2019t allow myself to eat before, trying to accept that my healthy adult body will look a certain way, allowing myself to eat whenever I felt like eating, not exercising as much.\n\nThere were still cycles of restrict-binge within that time, but each time seemed less intense than the last, like my ED itself was getting tired, because I wasn\u2019t feeding it\u2014I was feeding myself.\n\nSince the lockdown a couple of months ago I finally decided to dramatically drop exercise sessions. I only \u201cwork out\u201d when I feel like it, I don\u2019t try to manipulate myself into doing anything. I had already made great progress at that point, but since then it\u2019s really been wonderful, because my appetite normalized completely. It was like a miracle to me. To be able to eat a normal portion and just feel full? Magic. \n\nThat\u2019s where I am now, I\u2019ve lived with my reclaimed normal appetite for these last few months, and my weight has normalized. I had gained 10lbs at the peak of my restricting-bingeing cycles, I had lost about half of that before lockdown, mainly because even though I was still hungry a lot, I wasn\u2019t really outright bingeing anymore, and now since my hunger normalized, I\u2019m pretty much back to where I was when my ED was just starting. \n\nI don\u2019t look exactly the same, I was, honestly, leaner then, but I was also 18. I\u2019m almost 25 now, and I think it\u2019s normal that my body looks different now. I think I like how I look now better. I\u2019m basically an older, buffer, more mature version of myself, as if nothing had happened in between. I\u2019m a lot stronger than I was at 18, both in mind and body, I think, and I\u2019m grateful that I emerged healthier on the other side. \n\nI still have ED thoughts, but they don\u2019t consume my life anymore. I have time for me, I barely think about food anymore, it\u2019s wild!\n\nSo I hope that you and anyone else who reads this will see that there is hope, there is another side, an outside to the tunnel. Recovery is so so so worth it. Don\u2019t give up, give yourself a break and get to know your body again. It\u2019s a bit like helicopter parents, you know? Too much and the kid rebels, but you give the kid space, opportunities to have their own experiences, and the next thing you know, they\u2019re a fun, capable human being you\u2019re proud to hang out with. So trust your body, you might not like what happens initially, but trust it, listen to it, give it some love, it\u2019ll learn trust you again too, and it\u2019ll all work out.",

It\u2019s excruciating because I know that I wouldn\u2019t have the urge to eat so much if I stopped thinking so much about food/my body in the first place, but like you said, it would be as if my ED were validated if I gained weight as a result",

You did it before your ED, and you can do it again. You've trained your brain to only think in terms of absolutes (either I starve myself or I binge), but you can UN-train your brain. I was the same way, and it's still hard, but being aware that you can live life without thinking at the extremes has really helped. Wishing you luck, you can do it!!!",
