  "title": "Want to fully recover from a restrictive eating disorder? Here are some truths.",
  "selftext": "TW; some ED realness may be kind of blunt so please don\u2019t read if you think mentions of weight gain or anything in that realm may be harmful to you in this moment! \n\nBeen lurking around the sub for awhile now, and just have to get this off my chest. \n\nIf you want to FULLY recover from a restricting eating disorder (and this probably applies to other eating disorders as well to some degree I can only speak as someone who has suffered from a restrictive ED), YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GAIN WEIGHT. Period, end of story. Regardless of your weight now or body shape, if you\u2019re restricting and ignoring your body\u2019s needs you\u2019re going to have to eat more (and probably A LOT more at that) than what you\u2019re eating now or stop doing the things that you do to control your weight. How or what you eat to gain that weight isn\u2019t going to be the same as what you will be doing once you reach a body weight that is right for you and you alone. But you have to reach that place first. \n\nI know it\u2019s probably the last thing you want to hear, and weight gain is probably almost the biggest fear currently and obstacle to recovery for everyone with a restricting eating disorder. But you\u2019re not going to and you cannot \u201cI\u2019m a special unicorn weight gain will be especially difficult and catastrophic and unacceptable for me so I can\u2019t eat\u201d your way out of this reality in the pursuit of true recovery. \n\nNo one, and I of all people certainly cannot or anyone on this sub as well, can predict for you how much weight you will gain with absolute certainty and if that will be higher or lower than your pre-ED weight or if you will be categorized as \u201coverweight\u201d or \u201cobese\u201d by the BMI scale or if you will lose the \u201covershoot weight\u201d or not or if you\u2019re going to gain 1, 5, 20, 50, or whatever pounds. In fact, it doesn\u2019t fucking matter and anyone who is trying to predict how much weight you will gain shouldn\u2019t really be someone you listen to without question because they aren\u2019t you! The only one in control of your weight is your body on the way to full recovery, and it is going to decide regardless of what you want where it should be in terms of weight if you want to fully recover. The weight may redistribute it may not maybe your stomach is just meant to look like that and what\u2019s wrong with that it doesn\u2019t fucking matter none of this is permission or justification or fodder for your ED to decide it\u2019s time to throw in the towel and quit. \n\nFurthermore, your body isn\u2019t fucked or wrong for gaining weight or looking the way it is. Your body is innocent! It has continued to keep you alive and has remained loyal to keeping your existence on this plane of earth despite the fact that day in and day out you under the control of your ED harm it and have demonstrated at every turn that you will take the opportunity to consistently deprive it of its needs. I honestly don\u2019t think any living thing would have stuck with me the way my body kept me alive after all the abuse I put it through. This fight is between you and your ED, and your body is in your side. It\u2019s not you against an out of control body. Your body is not trying to kill your or make things worse for you by gaining weight or looking a certain way in recovery, I promise. \n\nAnd as someone who has done the half or quasi-recovery deal and has been underweight, at a \u201cnormal\u201d weight, and overweight in all orders and cycles for years, I can and will say that it fucking sucks it\u2019s like having the ED but also gaining weight. Sure, I may not have been gaining all the weight that my body needed in my attempt to control my weight in this \u201crecovery\u201d but my ED certainly wasn\u2019t happy about any weight gain at all and I was just if not even more, with the weight gain on top of it all, miserable than I was in the depths of my ED. Fucking around the weight gain thing while wanting full recovery is impossible. Doing anything \u201ctolerable\u201d to your ED is still letting it live in some capacity. If you\u2019re not fully recovered your ED is going to keep on living in some way within you and doing the toxic shit it does it\u2019s going to continue to make your life horrible within that corner of your world. And, from my experience, the ED voice doesn\u2019t get kinder or the rituals any less suffocating just because you put on a few pounds you think is enough or acceptable to your standards but your body disagrees with.\n\nBut honestly, who cares what my experience in recovery is like? Sure, if someone said that they lost the overshoot weight it may be reassuring to you in the moment, but the fact is that it may not be true for you. And if that belief that\u2019s been \u201cjustifying\u201d or \u201ccushioning\u201d your weight gain is proven to be false once you wake up one day and realize all the weight you\u2019ve gained or the process isn\u2019t what you were \u201cpromised\u201d by someone then what happens now? You just give up on recovery? And if someone else gets to recover into a conventionally thin body but you can\u2019t because that\u2019s not how your body and your genetics work are you going to go back to restricting? I sure as hell let these things get to me during my many attempts at recovery. The experiences of others are not markers or indicators that if you miss them it must mean you are doing something wrong in recovery. Recovery is such a personal process, and, honestly honestly, the only way you can fuck it up is by restricting and not resting or taking care of yourself to your best capacity.\n\nI\u2019m not at all against harm reduction or seeking reassurance, but it is important to also recognize that the experience of someone else in a totally different body than yours and in a completely different circumstance may or may not happen to you. During my one of my earlier attempts at recovery, I felt that everything that was said to be surrounding the weight gain and the amount of it and whether or not I would lose any of it was misconstrued by my fucked ED brain as a promise and an excuse of \u201coh see it didn\u2019t happen in this way for you so now we have to go back to the old ways because weight gain doesn\u2019t work for you and you\u2019re going to endlessly gain\u201d which was fucking bullshit and caused me to relapse several times since honestly only once I let it all go and gained whatever I needed to and accepted that no matter how painful it was I did stop gaining the weight. Maybe it wasn\u2019t the weight I wanted to be at in the moment, but it was a weight my physical body worked optimally at. Only when I forced myself to have 0 expectations for my weight against all fucking odds and pain and ludicrous fears was I able to recover. And bodies are meant to change and adapt to different life stages and circumstances anyways. What you will be at the end of recovery isn\u2019t set in stone either and almost, with guarantee, will change at some point for some reason during your lifetime. This stage of my life was \u201cI have to get out of this fucking nightmare before it slowly kills me mentally and physically\u201d so that was the weight I needed to be at.\n\nI know this all may sound really harsh, but you are going to gain weight and it will be out of your control how much you gain on the way to full recovery. There is no bargaining or questioning in that. Realizing this fact early on may save you a lot of grief and suffering down the line. Still, none of this makes it any less scary or easier to digest at all. But you will do the hardest thing you think you will ever do the thing that scares the living shit out of you and you may have to do it screaming, crying, and kicking but YOU WILL SURVIVE. Ain\u2019t that amazing? You\u2019re going to do what you perceive and is very real to you as the most difficult thing in the world and make it through in one piece. \n\nI\u2019m rooting for you all. I cannot and will not promise happiness or bliss at the end of recovery. There\u2019s still endless shit to unpack and life troubles for me as a \u201crecovered\u201d person, but the magical thing is that these problems will no longer be caused by your ED and, probably, will be there regardless of if you\u2019re stick thin or not. And you will be both more physically and emotionally capable of handling whatever comes your way. \n\nYou\u2019re tough as all hell, and you deserve better.",

It made me so angry that diet culture and all of the capitalist corporations and what not had convinced me that the judgments and opinions of strangers the fear of looking in a way that may or may not conform to their toxic beliefs could lead me to not only abuse myself but want to end my own life. It\u2019s not fucking worth it. The reality is that if I died to preserve my own perceived thinness no one would give a flying fuck certainly not me because I would be dead. I wouldn\u2019t have earned any good person moral points I wouldn\u2019t have been called hot or skinny or thin or attractive because I would have literally just been a corpse if I had let my ED convince myself this is the only way out. And I sure as fucking hell wouldn\u2019t let my ED convince me to die with it. \n\nRecovery will never ever seem \u201crealistic\u201d to anyone with an ED. You will never feel sick enough or ready enough to do it. But know for certain that if you do not do it and heal your body you will not only live in this way forever but most likely get worse and worse. And then diet culture and people profiting off of your self-hatred would have won and your loved ones and the world would have lost a wonderful person capable of so much more than keeping off some weight who could have made the planet a better place for someone else.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how much of your life you\u2019ve spent with your ED you can get out. In fact, as ass backwards as this may sound, some people believe that people who have spent more time with their ED recover quicker if they take their years of suffering as fiery motivation to recover. You do not have to be stuck in this place with these thoughts. You can fucking do this as much as you have stuck to your ED you can channel that attachments towards recovery. You can always try recovery and see how it is to just do one day.",

It goes hand in hand with trauma that will likely never be completely resolved. There isn't anyone in my life who cares if I have an ED. My ED is only giving me social benefits right now and recovery would incur a social penalty. I've never been loved unconditionally and know that the little value I have to other people is inversely correlated with my weight. \n\nIt's one of those problems that might not have been irremediable at some point in my life but in my current circumstances fixing the problem would be more costly than leaving it be. I compulsively spend because I need something to look forward to in a world without love or social engagements to look forward to (I can look forward to opening boxes.) The alternative to compulsive spending is death or being irresponsible about COVID (which would harm other people too). The alternative to having a \"high functioning\" ED for me right now is derailing my career to get treatment (and who will pay for it?) and incurring the social costs that would come with possibly gaining weight. \n\nMy low weight is the only physical feature I've ever been complimented on--it's the thing women tell me they're jealous of and women/men have explicitly told me they find \"cute\" or \"hot\" about me. \n\nBecause of the particular childhood trauma I experienced, I am hyperaware of physical sensations in my body--the discomfort of digestion or my waistband digging into my belly--and having control over my body is very important to me. \n\nI am constantly being reminded by the people in my life how important it is that I don't eat too much and get fat. Every day I hear \"you shouldn't be eating that right now or you're going to get fat.\" If I gained weight in recovery I would never hear the end of it and I'd most likely end up prediabetic again. For me, recovery would come at a high cost for unclear benefits.",

I know an ED can feel like or be a very safe coping mechanism, and I don\u2019t want to say anything specific for fear of exacerbating anything right now given how complex your situation is. So please don\u2019t read further if you\u2019re looking for harm reduction or not looking for \u201ctough love\u201d or some attempt to promote recovery because at the end of the day no one on this sub or anyone for that matter can convince you to choose recovery other than yourself. \n\nSo, for this place as of now, I\u2019ll just leave it at I wish the best for you and peace for you no matter what \u2764\ufe0f\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nThe reality is almost every person with an ED goes through this bargaining process of being convinced that their ED is worth it and that losing it would be the end of the world. Whether it be for one reason or another, you\u2019re not alone in the feeling that recovery may not be worth it and in fact may make life worse for you. The costs are insurmountably unjustifiable because the outcome of recovery is uncertain. It\u2019s not certain you will be happier after it or you will be emotionally better. You\u2019re not special in the sense that you think \u201crecovery would come at a high cost with unclear benefits\u201d it sounds really like your ED is convincing you that for you specifically this is true when in fact basically everyone who has to gain weight has to face this fear in an extremely fatphobic society entrenched in diet culture in which people are constantly commenting on what we eat and what we wear. I can guarantee you almost that everyone on this sub has felt this way one way or another, but, yet still, a lot of people still manage to recover from situations \u201cbetter\u201d than or \u201cworse\u201d than yours. A lot of anorexics get complimented on their \u201cfigure\u201d and are criticized whether it be from toxic family members or concern trolls about what they eat in recovery or changes in body size as they recover there are endless amounts of posts on this sub expressing fear of weight gain and trauma and criticisms of their body weight but yet they persist also. We all want control of our bodies and want to seem attractive to people post after post express this sort of sentiment and users constantly share about x family member calling them slovenly or y random stranger commenting on their body shape but as much as that hurts no one has to live with the consequences of an eating disorder other than you of course it\u2019s easy for someone else to say whatever the fuck they want because they don\u2019t have to deal with the self-hatred, isolation, body dysmorphia, and mental agony you will have to endure with an eating disorder. \n\nNow, none of this at all invalidates or disrespects the personal experiences and trauma you\u2019ve gone through my intention is not to talk you down or diminish your trials and tribulations whatever I say doesn\u2019t impact your lived truth at all. But it really sounds like there is a part of you that wants to recover but it\u2019s buried underneath all of this grasping for justification that for only you recovery won\u2019t be worth it and that only you will suffer heavy judgment and criticisms about your appearance when, in truth, everyone who has chosen to recover will go through the same questions and thoughts. Even if no one on the face of this planet cares about you having an ED you have to care about yourself you have to hold yourself accountable for your own life just like every single one of us has to push onwards regardless of whether or not we have teams of loved ones or no one. And the fact that there are random internet strangers alongside you in this struggle hopefully shows that someone somewhere does care that you are suffering. Furthermore, if you say you\u2019ve never been loved unconditionally despite being at a lower weight, then doesn\u2019t that somehow prove to you in some way that being in this body won\u2019t necessarily bring you that true love or attention you seem to desire?\n\nThere\u2019s also no such thing as a \u201chigh-functioning\u201d eating disorder it\u2019s just tricking you into thinking that you can live like this forever when it\u2019s almost 100% certain that such a lifestyle is unsustainable. Whether it be emotionally or physically at some point it will break and do much more than simply derail your career or incur social costs. I know it may feel as if you\u2019re invincible or if this isn\u2019t true or honestly maybe a comfort or benefit even that eating disorders have a very high mortality rate, but the fact that you express a care about your career and social engagements and love indicates that you want to do things that you objectively cannot do if you are dead. Living with an eating disorder is just a ticking clock. And, again, if people knew your low weight as the result of an eating disorder I highly doubt they would continue to compliment you or be \u201cjealous\u201d of your figure if they knew because having an eating disorder is objectively horrific and undesirable in the eyes of others maybe the physical consequences at a surface level may seem nice but no one and I mean no one would call you hot or adorable if they knew the truth of exactly what you do to get to that figure. \n\nEverything here you\u2019re still going to have to work through and heal in one way or another. Recovery doesn\u2019t erase these issues. But what recovery does give you back is the physical health of repairing the non-permanent damage a long term eating disorder has.\n\nApologies if I have caused any harm or seem on my soap box, but I too have been in this place of using my personal and very real traumas and sufferings to justify not recovering. Recovering doesn\u2019t erase that suffering or make it any better, but lingering with your ED as a coping mechanism keeps it tolerable but never ever will fix or address the issue. It is much much easier to stay in this certain level of suffering when recovery essentially entails uncertainty and discomfort, but this isn\u2019t the way you have to live forever I promise promise you that things can change.\n\n\u2014- \n\nBut whatever it is I don\u2019t want to say anything to hurt your or harm you in any way there\u2019s so much on your plate already I sincerely do not mean to patronize or insult or diminish all that you\u2019ve been through I wish I could say anything or something to be more helpful but a lot of people on this sub do see you and care about you in the capacity we have and are rooting for you.",

So please don\u2019t read further if you\u2019re looking for harm reduction or not looking for \u201ctough love\u201d or some attempt to promote recovery because at the end of the day no one on this sub or anyone for that matter can convince you to choose recovery other than yourself. \n\nSo, for this place as of now, I\u2019ll just leave it at I wish the best for you and peace for you no matter what \u2764\ufe0f\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nThe reality is almost every person with an ED goes through this bargaining process of being convinced that their ED is worth it and that losing it would be the end of the world. Whether it be for one reason or another, you\u2019re not alone in the feeling that recovery may not be worth it and in fact may make life worse for you. The costs are insurmountably unjustifiable because the outcome of recovery is uncertain. It\u2019s not certain you will be happier after it or you will be emotionally better. You\u2019re not special in the sense that you think \u201crecovery would come at a high cost with unclear benefits\u201d it sounds really like your ED is convincing you that for you specifically this is true when in fact basically everyone who has to gain weight has to face this fear in an extremely fatphobic society entrenched in diet culture in which people are constantly commenting on what we eat and what we wear. I can guarantee you almost that everyone on this sub has felt this way one way or another, but, yet still, a lot of people still manage to recover from situations \u201cbetter\u201d than or \u201cworse\u201d than yours. A lot of anorexics get complimented on their \u201cfigure\u201d and are criticized whether it be from toxic family members or concern trolls about what they eat in recovery or changes in body size as they recover there are endless amounts of posts on this sub expressing fear of weight gain and trauma and criticisms of their body weight but yet they persist also. We all want control of our bodies and want to seem attractive to people post after post express this sort of sentiment and users constantly share about x family member calling them slovenly or y random stranger commenting on their body shape but as much as that hurts no one has to live with the consequences of an eating disorder other than you of course it\u2019s easy for someone else to say whatever the fuck they want because they don\u2019t have to deal with the self-hatred, isolation, body dysmorphia, and mental agony you will have to endure with an eating disorder. \n\nNow, none of this at all invalidates or disrespects the personal experiences and trauma you\u2019ve gone through my intention is not to talk you down or diminish your trials and tribulations whatever I say doesn\u2019t impact your lived truth at all. But it really sounds like there is a part of you that wants to recover but it\u2019s buried underneath all of this grasping for justification that for only you recovery won\u2019t be worth it and that only you will suffer heavy judgment and criticisms about your appearance when, in truth, everyone who has chosen to recover will go through the same questions and thoughts. Even if no one on the face of this planet cares about you having an ED you have to care about yourself you have to hold yourself accountable for your own life just like every single one of us has to push onwards regardless of whether or not we have teams of loved ones or no one. And the fact that there are random internet strangers alongside you in this struggle hopefully shows that someone somewhere does care that you are suffering. Furthermore, if you say you\u2019ve never been loved unconditionally despite being at a lower weight, then doesn\u2019t that somehow prove to you in some way that being in this body won\u2019t necessarily bring you that true love or attention you seem to desire?\n\nThere\u2019s also no such thing as a \u201chigh-functioning\u201d eating disorder it\u2019s just tricking you into thinking that you can live like this forever when it\u2019s almost 100% certain that such a lifestyle is unsustainable. Whether it be emotionally or physically at some point it will break and do much more than simply derail your career or incur social costs. I know it may feel as if you\u2019re invincible or if this isn\u2019t true or honestly maybe a comfort or benefit even that eating disorders have a very high mortality rate, but the fact that you express a care about your career and social engagements and love indicates that you want to do things that you objectively cannot do if you are dead. Living with an eating disorder is just a ticking clock. And, again, if people knew your low weight as the result of an eating disorder I highly doubt they would continue to compliment you or be \u201cjealous\u201d of your figure if they knew because having an eating disorder is objectively horrific and undesirable in the eyes of others maybe the physical consequences at a surface level may seem nice but no one and I mean no one would call you hot or adorable if they knew the truth of exactly what you do to get to that figure. \n\nEverything here you\u2019re still going to have to work through and heal in one way or another. Recovery doesn\u2019t erase these issues. But what recovery does give you back is the physical health of repairing the non-permanent damage a long term eating disorder has.\n\nApologies if I have caused any harm or seem on my soap box, but I too have been in this place of using my personal and very real traumas and sufferings to justify not recovering. Recovering doesn\u2019t erase that suffering or make it any better, but lingering with your ED as a coping mechanism keeps it tolerable but never ever will fix or address the issue. It is much much easier to stay in this certain level of suffering when recovery essentially entails uncertainty and discomfort, but this isn\u2019t the way you have to live forever I promise promise you that things can change.\n\n\u2014- \n\nBut whatever it is I don\u2019t want to say anything to hurt your or harm you in any way there\u2019s so much on your plate already I sincerely do not mean to patronize or insult or diminish all that you\u2019ve been through I wish I could say anything or something to be more helpful but a lot of people on this sub do see you and care about you in the capacity we have and are rooting for you.",

Please, don\u2019t give up on recovering or the desire for it no matter how small an action every single day to challenge your ED is enough even if it\u2019s just one extra bite a day. \n\nI know it\u2019s so fucking hard and there were so many moments I thought I would rather die than gain weight. But, what helped for me and if you do not think this is helpful please ignore me, I would say all the thoughts my ED would tell me to keep me suffering out loud over and over again until I realized how fucking absolute stupid they were. That I would somehow be willing to throw away my life that so many people I love have an influence on and who put their belief, time, energy, and resources into making as positive as possible and my dreams, privilege, and ability to use that privilege to one day help others for a couple of pounds or an extra snack was fucking ridiculous when I looked at it out of context of my ED. It made me so angry that diet culture and all of the capitalist corporations and what not had convinced me that the judgments and opinions of strangers the fear of looking in a way that may or may not conform to their toxic beliefs could lead me to not only abuse myself but want to end my own life. It\u2019s not fucking worth it. The reality is that if I died to preserve my own perceived thinness no one would give a flying fuck certainly not me because I would be dead. I wouldn\u2019t have earned any good person moral points I wouldn\u2019t have been called hot or skinny or thin or attractive because I would have literally just been a corpse if I had let my ED convince myself this is the only way out. And I sure as fucking hell wouldn\u2019t let my ED convince me to die with it. \n\nRecovery will never ever seem \u201crealistic\u201d to anyone with an ED. You will never feel sick enough or ready enough to do it. But know for certain that if you do not do it and heal your body you will not only live in this way forever but most likely get worse and worse. And then diet culture and people profiting off of your self-hatred would have won and your loved ones and the world would have lost a wonderful person capable of so much more than keeping off some weight who could have made the planet a better place for someone else.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how much of your life you\u2019ve spent with your ED you can get out. In fact, as ass backwards as this may sound, some people believe that people who have spent more time with their ED recover quicker if they take their years of suffering as fiery motivation to recover. You do not have to be stuck in this place with these thoughts. You can fucking do this as much as you have stuck to your ED you can channel that attachments towards recovery. You can always try recovery and see how it is to just do one day.",

          "body": "TW: fatphobia and trauma\n\nThank you so much for saying this. It's a complex problem. My ED stems from experiencing every imaginable form of child abuse my entire childhood. It goes hand in hand with trauma that will likely never be completely resolved. There isn't anyone in my life who cares if I have an ED. My ED is only giving me social benefits right now and recovery would incur a social penalty. I've never been loved unconditionally and know that the little value I have to other people is inversely correlated with my weight. \n\nIt's one of those problems that might not have been irremediable at some point in my life but in my current circumstances fixing the problem would be more costly than leaving it be. I compulsively spend because I need something to look forward to in a world without love or social engagements to look forward to (I can look forward to opening boxes.) The alternative to compulsive spending is death or being irresponsible about COVID (which would harm other people too). The alternative to having a \"high functioning\" ED for me right now is derailing my career to get treatment (and who will pay for it?) and incurring the social costs that would come with possibly gaining weight. \n\nMy low weight is the only physical feature I've ever been complimented on--it's the thing women tell me they're jealous of and women/men have explicitly told me they find \"cute\" or \"hot\" about me. \n\nBecause of the particular childhood trauma I experienced, I am hyperaware of physical sensations in my body--the discomfort of digestion or my waistband digging into my belly--and having control over my body is very important to me. \n\nI am constantly being reminded by the people in my life how important it is that I don't eat too much and get fat. Every day I hear \"you shouldn't be eating that right now or you're going to get fat.\" If I gained weight in recovery I would never hear the end of it and I'd most likely end up prediabetic again. For me, recovery would come at a high cost for unclear benefits.",

          "body": "I\u2019m so sorry all of this happened to you, and please know that none of this is your fault at all. I know an ED can feel like or be a very safe coping mechanism, and I don\u2019t want to say anything specific for fear of exacerbating anything right now given how complex your situation is. So please don\u2019t read further if you\u2019re looking for harm reduction or not looking for \u201ctough love\u201d or some attempt to promote recovery because at the end of the day no one on this sub or anyone for that matter can convince you to choose recovery other than yourself. \n\nSo, for this place as of now, I\u2019ll just leave it at I wish the best for you and peace for you no matter what \u2764\ufe0f\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nThe reality is almost every person with an ED goes through this bargaining process of being convinced that their ED is worth it and that losing it would be the end of the world. Whether it be for one reason or another, you\u2019re not alone in the feeling that recovery may not be worth it and in fact may make life worse for you. The costs are insurmountably unjustifiable because the outcome of recovery is uncertain. It\u2019s not certain you will be happier after it or you will be emotionally better. You\u2019re not special in the sense that you think \u201crecovery would come at a high cost with unclear benefits\u201d it sounds really like your ED is convincing you that for you specifically this is true when in fact basically everyone who has to gain weight has to face this fear in an extremely fatphobic society entrenched in diet culture in which people are constantly commenting on what we eat and what we wear. I can guarantee you almost that everyone on this sub has felt this way one way or another, but, yet still, a lot of people still manage to recover from situations \u201cbetter\u201d than or \u201cworse\u201d than yours. A lot of anorexics get complimented on their \u201cfigure\u201d and are criticized whether it be from toxic family members or concern trolls about what they eat in recovery or changes in body size as they recover there are endless amounts of posts on this sub expressing fear of weight gain and trauma and criticisms of their body weight but yet they persist also. We all want control of our bodies and want to seem attractive to people post after post express this sort of sentiment and users constantly share about x family member calling them slovenly or y random stranger commenting on their body shape but as much as that hurts no one has to live with the consequences of an eating disorder other than you of course it\u2019s easy for someone else to say whatever the fuck they want because they don\u2019t have to deal with the self-hatred, isolation, body dysmorphia, and mental agony you will have to endure with an eating disorder. \n\nNow, none of this at all invalidates or disrespects the personal experiences and trauma you\u2019ve gone through my intention is not to talk you down or diminish your trials and tribulations whatever I say doesn\u2019t impact your lived truth at all. But it really sounds like there is a part of you that wants to recover but it\u2019s buried underneath all of this grasping for justification that for only you recovery won\u2019t be worth it and that only you will suffer heavy judgment and criticisms about your appearance when, in truth, everyone who has chosen to recover will go through the same questions and thoughts. Even if no one on the face of this planet cares about you having an ED you have to care about yourself you have to hold yourself accountable for your own life just like every single one of us has to push onwards regardless of whether or not we have teams of loved ones or no one. And the fact that there are random internet strangers alongside you in this struggle hopefully shows that someone somewhere does care that you are suffering. Furthermore, if you say you\u2019ve never been loved unconditionally despite being at a lower weight, then doesn\u2019t that somehow prove to you in some way that being in this body won\u2019t necessarily bring you that true love or attention you seem to desire?\n\nThere\u2019s also no such thing as a \u201chigh-functioning\u201d eating disorder it\u2019s just tricking you into thinking that you can live like this forever when it\u2019s almost 100% certain that such a lifestyle is unsustainable. Whether it be emotionally or physically at some point it will break and do much more than simply derail your career or incur social costs. I know it may feel as if you\u2019re invincible or if this isn\u2019t true or honestly maybe a comfort or benefit even that eating disorders have a very high mortality rate, but the fact that you express a care about your career and social engagements and love indicates that you want to do things that you objectively cannot do if you are dead. Living with an eating disorder is just a ticking clock. And, again, if people knew your low weight as the result of an eating disorder I highly doubt they would continue to compliment you or be \u201cjealous\u201d of your figure if they knew because having an eating disorder is objectively horrific and undesirable in the eyes of others maybe the physical consequences at a surface level may seem nice but no one and I mean no one would call you hot or adorable if they knew the truth of exactly what you do to get to that figure. \n\nEverything here you\u2019re still going to have to work through and heal in one way or another. Recovery doesn\u2019t erase these issues. But what recovery does give you back is the physical health of repairing the non-permanent damage a long term eating disorder has.\n\nApologies if I have caused any harm or seem on my soap box, but I too have been in this place of using my personal and very real traumas and sufferings to justify not recovering. Recovering doesn\u2019t erase that suffering or make it any better, but lingering with your ED as a coping mechanism keeps it tolerable but never ever will fix or address the issue. It is much much easier to stay in this certain level of suffering when recovery essentially entails uncertainty and discomfort, but this isn\u2019t the way you have to live forever I promise promise you that things can change.\n\n\u2014- \n\nBut whatever it is I don\u2019t want to say anything to hurt your or harm you in any way there\u2019s so much on your plate already I sincerely do not mean to patronize or insult or diminish all that you\u2019ve been through I wish I could say anything or something to be more helpful but a lot of people on this sub do see you and care about you in the capacity we have and are rooting for you.",
