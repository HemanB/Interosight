  "selftext": "Thought I'd invite everyone to join me on a recovery exercise. See, I'm 35, and I'm finally getting into the ages where IDGAF anymore...at least a little bit. It's relieving. It's relieving to look at my squishy, saggy, had-2-kids body and be like \"meh.\" It's relieving to just...not...care.

I'll start in the comments.",
