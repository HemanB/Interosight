I eat when I\u2019m hungry and I stop when I\u2019m full, I never measure anything or count calories. I can fully enjoy and appreciate food. It takes a lot of time and hard work and lapses but suddenly two weeks without relapse turned into two months without relapse turned into two years and beyond. I had a team that helped me, my therapist and nutritionist and psychiatrist. Started in inpatient treatment and now I just occasionally see a therapist. ED is a fucking scam, and I have experienced so many amazing things and so much happiness and freedom on the other side.",
