That's just my personal preference. So I will never look like that. I have in the past and the knowledge is there that I have the potential for that, but it destroys my life and makes me miserable. \n\nSo, I am not saying all fitness loving, slim/toned people are disordered, they just use a lot of the behaviours in the eating disorder world in their lifestyle in a healthier way.

And when they look back on their lives will they be happy, feel it was a life well lived?\n\nI'd rather look back on connections made, strengthened and enjoyed all the while not being my ideal body shape. Not look back and see my misery and remember all the food at various events but not the people who were there. \n\nIt's tricky, there is a lot of disordered eating especially in the fitness communities. Fasting being a new trendy thing and keto and various other things. It all comes down to restriction.\n\nI decided I'd rather enjoy life whatever I look like than enjoy what I look like but not life.",

A *lot* of people like this are perfectly happy and well adjusted- they don\u2019t see it as being \u201cdeprived\u201d of something or \u201csacrificing\u201d to have their ideal body, they work out because they *enjoy* it. \n\nI know it can make us feel better to assign disordered eating to anyone that looks the way we want to look, but the fact of the matter is that\u2019s usually not the case. Sometimes the fit, pretty, \u201cperfect\u201d girl really is just that\u2014 which is *frustrating* and *upsetting*, but if you fall into the trap of believing that kind of happiness isn\u2019t real or only ever comes with the caveat of a debilitating mental illness then you\u2019ll never get that healthy relationship with food and fitness that most of those \u201cperfect\u201d people have.",
