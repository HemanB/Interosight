  "selftext": "First off. Fuck eating disorders. Fuck our society\u2019s beauty standards. I am a human. Nothing more, nothing less. \n\nI struggled with an eating disorder from 2017-2020. I am very lucky that I was able to get past it, and I would have considered myself fully recovered. \n\nWhen I first was with my fianc\u00e9, I was at an underweight bmi. I\u2019m now on the lower end of normal. Really not a big difference. \n\nHe mentions how we need to get in shape (I exercise for my mental health, I don\u2019t need to exercise more). The only girls he comments on are waif thin. He has showed me girls on Instagram that he finds attractive, again extremely thin (too thin). He comments about how we eat if he deems it too \u201cunhealthy,\u201d he\u2019s a big controlling about when we eat, and if we\u2019re out and I want a snack, his attitude is one of \u201cyou\u2019re fine, you can wait.\u201d\n\nThe other day he pointed out a girl he found beautiful, extremely thin. I said, \u201cyou\u2019re really attracted to thin girls it seems.\u201d He responded, \u201cyes, I like skinny girls.\u201d \n\nHe\u2019s lost attraction to me it seems. He doesn\u2019t put much effort into out sex life. He expects sex 2-4 times a day, but I feel like a doll for him to use. \n\nFor the first time since recovering, I feel those thoughts creeping back and I am terrified. I feel like I\u2019m losing control. I know this is extremely unhealthy, and honestly the problem is probably my brain distorting everything. I\u2019m currently in his country where the beauty standard leans even more towards extremely thin girls. I have one more month here, but all I want to do is go home and do therapy.",

      "body": "It is not normal for your fianc\u00e9 to be showing you pictures of girls he finds attractive, or pointing out other women he's attracted to. Of course its natural to feel some degree of physical attraction to other people, but I think its really hurtful to bring those images or point out those people to *you*: there's an implied comparison between you and these other women, which is making you feel insecure - and I'm sure he's aware of that, unless he's incredibly stupid. That's not healthy, loving, or supportive, to feel like you're being scrutinized. \n\nAttraction to purely physical qualities is part of nearly every relationship in the beginning, but by the time you're thinking about things like marriage, your love should have deepened into a stronger bond beyond the physical: there should be admiration, respect, and loyalty that aren't about your appearance. You're going to spend the rest of your life with this person, surely he understands that you will both age, your bodies will change, and you should both expect to be loved regardless. Sex is also not something one party demands and the other submits to - sexual desire should be mutual and shared, as should sexual pleasure, its not an obligation. Its up to both partners to foster desire in their partner if they want to engage in intimacy: if you're not feeling it, and he really wants sex, then he needs to learn what does turn you on and do those things. He doesn't sound very concerned with your pleasure. Is that what you want the rest of your sex life to be?\n\nI don't know my friend, I think the problem here is your fianc\u00e9 - you actually sound like you've handled your ED recovery beautifully and he's just dragging you back down. Maybe you *should* just go home and get back into therapy. He's clearly in your head, and as we all do in relationships that aren't the best that we really want to work, you're rationalizing and normalizing this treatment: but it isn't ok. Whether or not you're \"ok with it.\" Though I suspect once you're out of his grasp and back in therapy you'll probably realize that you aren't (nor should you be!)",

I was in a similar situation when I relapsed and the guy I was dating was obsessed with food, image, exercise, etc. he didn\u2019t want me to go to treatment because it was inconvenient for him. He refused to acknowledge that I was malnourished. and the final straw was when I was inpatient, he asked me if I weighed more than I did when we met. \n\nTrust me, you deserve someone who will love you no matter what. Who will support you in recovery. Someone who has your back and won\u2019t comment on your food or body or control what or when you eat. \n\nPlease consider if this relationship is serving you. You are so worthy of a full and happy life.",
