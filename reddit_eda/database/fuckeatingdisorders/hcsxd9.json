  "selftext": "When my dog lies on his side or back, his ribcage sticks out. He is by no means thin, in fact, he is a few KG overweight but for a brown lab he is very fit and healthy. When I saw his bones sticking out (which was literally just because he was lying in a strange position) I kinda panicked and thought \"oh no I'm starving him, thats it, I'm going to feed him more from now on!\" \n\nIt just reminded me that being underweight is a sign of neglect or abuse. We don't look at underweight dogs and say they're cute. No. We get angry at their owners for neglecting them. Why don't I get angry at myself for neglecting my body? I wish I cared for myself like I care for my dog.",
