Geeez do these people know anything about eating disorders beyond weight?! \nPlease, OP, do not take this comment as a free pass to be skeptical of your hunger cues or even to restrict. \nLike, if you were to think of it like a garden.. you\u2018ve bit in the work, got the good soil, tore out all the weed and put in some nice seeds. Watered twice daily. Now you see a little green seedling pushing through the soil! Evidence of your hard work! Do you now just water once per day or stop watering? No of course you don\u2019t! You\u2018re thrilled at the sight of the seedlings but ultimately you\u2019re aiming for a rose bush, tulips, a tree. So you don\u2018t stop your care now, you continue to give your garden what it needs and go beyond the bare minimum. You do whatever you can to help that garden thrive. And you don\u2018t listen to others who tell you to care less about your garden. You know what it needs best. \n\nWow I really had a field day with that analogy bit this stuff really grinds my gears.",

      "body": "I got told this by the first dietitian I saw last year. Once we got to my pre Ed weight she told me I could stop gaining now and wanted me to only eat at certain times/certain amounts. I knew it was wrong but it still triggered me and I relapsed until I finally got a place in a private inpatient residential hospital. I think you probably know how to listen to your body a bit more now and maybe you could stop seeing a dietitian and just see a doctor for blind weigh ins every now and then to make sure you\u2019re not losing weight. But the way to go is to eat whenever you\u2019re hungry, whenever you feel like it, and however much you want/need at that time. Your body will get to a point where it will do whatever it needs to do with your weight if you feed it properly. I know you\u2019re probably really struggling to eat like how you were before they told you this but try as much as you can to eat the same. Your body might keep gaining but that\u2019s ok and it will stop when your body is ready for it to and it might go down later on if you keep eating but it might not and that\u2019s okay. Anyway what I\u2019m trying to say is be kind to yourself and try and keep eating the same as you were before this appointment.",
