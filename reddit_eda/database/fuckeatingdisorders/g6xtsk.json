  "selftext": "FUCK my ED for making my scared of a fucking fruit. I mean, a fruit?! Seriously?!?!\n\nI was hungry and ate a whole banana today for the first time in over a year. No cutting it into slices, no saving the rest for later, no only eating the ends and giving the middle part to someone else. I peeled that thing and ate it like a normal person.",
