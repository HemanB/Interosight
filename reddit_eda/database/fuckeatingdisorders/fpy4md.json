  "selftext": "Today marks two weeks of recovery, yaaaaay! I realized last night out of the blue after I ate that I wasn\u2019t thinking about food and I was totally entrenched in the show I was watching. Same thing this morning\u2014I had a biiiig breakfast and didn\u2019t even realize I wasn\u2019t thinking about food while I was Netflix-ing. Like... all I\u2019ve done the past 6 years is think about what, when, and how much food I\u2019ll allow myself.\n\nI know it\u2019s still very early in the recovery process and I\u2019ve had some shit days emotionally and body image-wise this week, but omg I forgot what it\u2019s like to just watch a show and be fully engaged because I couldn\u2019t focus on anything other the food food food.\n\nSmall progress but still fucking ecstatic. :)",
