  "title": "\"Graduated\" to two slices of bread!!",
  "selftext": "For the third time in a week, I have had a sandwich with 2 slices of hearty bread! There was definitely a little argument going on in my brain, but I tuned it out and instead focused on how tasty it was, and how satisfied I felt afterwards. Sandwiches are one of my big fear foods, which is really too bad because they are so tasty, easy, and convenient. And 1 piece of toast just ain't enough after a busy work day. Just gotta keep tackling that one until it feels normal.\n\nWhat are some fear foods you guys are conquering/have conquered this week? I'd like to tackle toaster waffles sometime soon, too. I used to love me some eggos.",
