  "selftext": "on January 3rd I went to urgent care to get a covid test. When I got there the nurse took me over to the scale. I was wearing a huge sweatshirt and sweatpants to hide my body so I said to her \u201cbeware the number is going to be huge because of my clothes\u201d. The scale read 88 pounds. She did my covid test and took my blood pressure and then brought me a juice box and said I needed to drink the whole thing. I sobbed and tried to refuse telling her I \u201ccould not afford the calories\u201d. It was in that moment I realized how sick I really was. The doctor came in 30 minutes later and told me I tested positive for covid. I asked her if I would be okay considering the state my body was in and she said she didn\u2019t know. Everyone told me if I wanted to beat covid I was going to have to eat- A LOT. So that\u2019s what I did. I didn\u2019t count one calorie for the first time in over a year that day. I ate whatever was given to me and just told myself \u201ceat it to beat it\u201d. And guess what? I made it out alive!! If you\u2019re not recovering you are dying. You will NEVER be good enough for your eating disorder. I cannot say I\u2019m recovered at all but for the first time I can say I\u2019m actually in recovery. I haven\u2019t started putting on weight yet which just goes to show how irrational our thoughts around food are. I know my body cannot function at this weight and it\u2019s going to have to happen and I will not give up when it does. Beat this ugly ass illness please.",

I honestly shed a tear. I\u2019m so glad you shared this and I am beyond happy that you kicked covid and are choosing recovery. You got this!",

      "body": "Honestly I don't know how to explain it but the COVID pandemic put into perspective for me personally just how much giving into my eating disorder thoughts would be unnecessary pain. It's so dangerous, and I would hate to find myself in that situation. I've found myself more grateful and less bothered about weight, because I know that at least I am staying healthy and that I am alive. I don't want to sound like I am making it about me, and I'm really sorry that you have COVID. I just hope that you feel better.\n\nI am wishing you all the very best! I hope that you feel better really soon and take care of yourself. Be kind to yourself and your body during this time. Have you lost your smell or taste? I hope that you can use this time to enjoy food and beat those thoughts. Try new foods and rest! Your body needs it and it's okay!\n\nHonestly the biggest thing that helped me beat my eating disorder was trying new foods that my friend introduced me to. I remind myself how much fun it is to try new things. I hope that you can do that too. Please take care of yourself!",

I always tell them \"no,\" when they walk me to the scale and then I provide them with either an estimation or whatever my weight was at my last weigh-in on my terms. It has saved me TONS of anxiety!",

      "body": "Congrats. This is amazing to hear. I think there is something powerful to thinking about food as medicine and units of energy. So much of a ED stems from this assignment of food as a bad or immoral thing. This weird twist of the brain where food=bad. In the end its a unit of energy, simple as that. (Hard part is feeling that even when one knows it logically...) It sounds like a big step for you. I hope this can be a gentle, wonderful uphill rise for you. Good luck. You deserve it.",
