  "selftext": "I have had to remove way too many fucking posts like this lately, Jesus Christ. \n\nThis is **not** a pro-ED sub where you can romanticize your sick body at the cost of others\u2019 wellbeing. I don\u2019t care that you like your sick body more, I don\u2019t care that you fear weight gain to the point that you\u2019d rather continue maintaining a severely low weight that could very well result in death\u2014I care that you are putting others\u2019 mental health at risk because you can\u2019t speak about these things in a neutral matter that doesn\u2019t trigger others. You can talk about how you can\u2019t let your sick body go without talking *in detail* about how those in larger bodies disgust you. At this point, some of yall are just choosing to be assholes.\n\nThanks for coming to my 1,029,383,818th TED Talk, have a wonderful day. \ud83e\udd70\n\n**EDIT:** if you see these types of posts, please, please, *please* report them. The mods have lives outside of these subs and we don\u2019t always see things ourselves, but I get reports immediately and I will look over reports as soon as I notice them/have the time if another mod hasn\u2019t already. We ask that you guys do your part in helping to keep this community safe. Thank you!",

      "body": "I think if people want to talk about thinness then they have to acknowledge the effects that come with it. You are thin but at what cost? What are all the things that you stopped doing that you loved, who you stopped seeing that you loved, and what you wanted to accomplish in life but haven\u2019t been able to? I totally sympathize with those who feel they cannot see themselves with a higher weight or larger body. It\u2019s a hard thing to face\u2026\n\nFor the most part, we have autonomy over ourselves in terms of whether to pursue recovery or not. But just as it\u2019s a crime to inflict pain on others, it should be seen as a universal responsibility to protect each other from encouraging ED behaviour. It should be universally accepted that recovery is the ideal pathway. Even if we don\u2019t choose that path, we should support those who do and nudge those in that direction who are unsure. As we don\u2019t tell people to harm themselves, then the same goes for ED sufferers: we must allow them to pursue life, not death. \n\nMy two cents on how we should approach each other in ED communities. To whoever reads this, hopefully you would agree.",
