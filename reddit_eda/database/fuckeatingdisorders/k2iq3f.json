  "selftext": "ETA: all these numbers are hella lowballed it turns out, that just further proves my point\n\nSo let's say your bmr is between 1100-1350 kcals (which unless you're super short, THIS IS YOU). \n\nThat means you need to take in 1100 cals just to run your organs. \n\nExcept it takes cals to digest food, too. TEF varies by food product, but 10-15% is reasonable. \n\nSo, that means that to net 1100 cals, you need to eat 1300. \n\nThat means that just laying in bed, propped up in pillows and whatever the fuck else, you need 1300-1400cals. \n\nMoving takes cals. Sitting up takes cals. Typing on your phone takes cals. Exercising (like most of us do) - more cals. \n\nSee why 1200 is 100% bullshit?",

It would also be absurd for someone trying to recover from an ED to try and do so on 1200 calories a day even if your ED has left you overweight.

I honestly believe that most of us with an ED do know that 1200 is bullshit, unless we are deep into that super-restrictive honeymoon phase where we can't fathom eating an extra slice of apple, and we have enough experience with TDEE calculators to have a rough idea of what we actually need to maintain our weight. Everyone has its own idea of what is restriction and what is \"needed\" or \"allowed\" and it might be problematic to use a single figure (like say 1200) as a blanket benchmark, because it tends to reinforce the idea that everyone with an ED eats less than 1200 a day - and therefore if you eat more than that you don't have an ED, because you know how ED logic works! In my case for example I eat way more than that on a daily basis, yet I am still restricting very much and I still have an ED, I promise. So I'm not sure what am I supposed to do with this info other than use it as yet another proof that I'm eating way too much.",
