  "selftext": "My brother is trying to gain weight. His body type, height and metabolism makes it very difficult for him. Recently, he\u2019s been working out to put on muscle  and he found a diet to help people like him gain weight. He was over the moon when he saw that he gained 15 pounds and was gaining muscle as well. Like, he was literally jumping for joy. \n\nA few nights ago, my sister brought it up to him. She told him that he was lucky to be the skinny one in our family, that he should stop the weight gain diet he\u2019s on, etc. He got angry. Like the red in the face, sobbing hysterically and punching the wall kind of angry. It startled me to see him get so mad, I had never known how big of an insecurity this was for him. \n\nThis experience made me realize how close-minded I am. For so long, I\u2019ve believed that skinniness would equal happiness, not just for myself, but for everyone around me. My eating disorder sort of made me forget that there are people who aren\u2019t happy to be in a smaller body. For so long, I\u2019ve envied my brother\u2019s body type, wished it was difficult for me to gain weight too. I was confused when he started trying to gain weight, I didn\u2019t know why he would want to do that. Now I realize how shitty that is. \n\nThis was a great perspective shift for me. Being smaller won\u2019t equal happiness. Not for me, not for others in recovery, and certainly not for my brother. I\u2019m happy for him and his increased confidence and I hope he\u2019ll continue to become more comfortable in his own skin.",

I'm so jealous of your body!\" And the girl said \"You're only jealous because you don't know I had cancer\".\n\n\nBeing skinny doesn't equal happiness for sure. I'm most depressed when I'm thin, even if I'm maintaining",
