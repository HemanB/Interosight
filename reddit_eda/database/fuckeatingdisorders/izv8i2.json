I\u2019m hungry and I can\u2019t afford being hungry in the night and waking up ravenous in the morning so yes, I went with something safer though I need fruit for my bowels - I\u2019ve always been scared to eat outside of my meal plan especially as I had fast food today but I was hungry and why should I beat myself up for being hungry???? Like what??? So now I will sleep like a baby :)",
