  "selftext": "You are so important. You are so worthy of recovery. Your self worth is NOT dictated by your weight, your physical appearance or your eating disorder. You are beautiful. You are kind. You have so much to live for. \n\nYour eating disorder does not control you. Recovery is hard as hell, but recovery is worth it. Focus on the good things your life has to offer you; the laugh of a small child, the taste of ice cream melting on your tongue on a hot summer's day, the feeling of genuinely enjoying a meal out with your best friends and the only thought you have is how much fun you're having. \n\nYou deserve to live a life full of happiness, love and self respect. I believe in you!",
