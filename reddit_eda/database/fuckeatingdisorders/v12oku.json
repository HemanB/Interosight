  "title": "My dad is the most fucked up person for living with ED I\u2019ve ever even heard of. (Very triggering)",
  "selftext": "About ten years ago he went on this mega diet kick. So he eats paleo or whatever it is. He will not touch a piece of bread, even once a year; he brings his own food to gatherings. He will not eat deserts that aren\u2019t made of coconut flour and 97% dark chocolate. He WILL flip if you even bring a can of coke into the house. Especially if it\u2019s ME, which I\u2019ll elaborate on in a second.\n\nI live at home due to health and economic issues. Moving out is not an option whatsoever right now.\n\nHere\u2019s the deal, my dad was off fucking prostitutes while I was a kid and my mom has had anorexia since forever and was too sick to buy us food. I was starving as a kid, and that developed into a true ED by the time I was 18 or so.\n\nFor five ish years I was so sick that in the end, I was covered in lanugo, my brain didn\u2019t work and I couldn\u2019t walk 1/4 of a mile without having extreme chest pain. I woke up every day to get out of bed and see black and hold onto the wall.\n\nAll I want is for a dad to not leer at and question every meal I eat (I\u2019m serious\u2014he works from home and has a comment for everything I eat, and he has to know what I\u2019m eating, how much I\u2019m eating, etc). I wish he didn\u2019t comment on every single persons weight gain or loss\u2014everytime he sees someone for the first time in a while, the first thing that comes out of his mouth is \u201cthey got huge, they blew up\u201d etc. This includes family members and MINOR CHILDREN. He asked my brother how another guy we know looked at a wedding the other day and my brother immediately answered with things regarding his weight, because of course my dad must know if anyone \u201cgot fat\u201d. My old friend got diagnosed with cancer and the first thing he asked was \u201cis she still heavy? All she ate was shit when you were kids. Processed food causes cancer.\u201d HOW THE FUCK IS THAT APPROPRIATE! My friend has cancer and you ask about her WEIGHT?!?!\n\nI wish he didn\u2019t bring up my mental health meds and how they \u201cdestroy the gut micro biome\u201d whenever he asks about my stomach (I\u2019ve always had stomach issues). One day my mom told him to stop commenting on my meds; within twelve hours he was saying the same shit. I wish he wouldn\u2019t have told me 13758x in the past that I would get diabetes if I ate \u201cthat much sugar\u201d when I\u2019d drizzle honey on oatmeal. \n\nI am almost 27 and I have a father who has to come over every time I make lunch to see what I\u2019m making, and then comment on sugar/fat/calorie content. This is the most fucking backwards, idiotic, controlling thing you can do.\n\nI\u2019m really just complaining. Nothing will happen. He is the use to ALWAYS think \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re offended by that, so therefore I don\u2019t care and will carry on with my previous actions.\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t even fathom a family that\u2019s even more dysfunctional with food than he is. I\u2019m living in hell with my specific father and anorexia.\n\nBy the way I\u2019ve never in my life been overweight. He is simply an obsessive, condescending narcissist who wants to control the amount and type of food I eat. It\u2019s insanity. I live in the midst of insanity.",

Your father clearly has serious issues and it must be so frustrating that he won\u2019t even acknowledge the effect they have on others. \n\nI know moving out isn\u2019t an option right now, but maybe you make that your long term goal while coping with the current environment. In the meantime, could you come up with a one-line response that you use every. single. time. he makes a comment? Maybe if you repeat yourself enough and put up an obvious \u201cwall\u201d against that type of behavior, he\u2019ll start to realize he\u2019s not having the effect he\u2019s looking for.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what\u2019s motivating him other than his own deep insecurities, but in general it sounds like it would be best to focus on protecting yourself and distancing yourself from his worldview as much as possible.\n\nThis sounds incredibly hard, but you are posting here because you\u2019re motivated to NOT let your father\u2019s issues continue spilling over into your life, and you\u2019re still pushing forward despite this difficult environment.

It sounds like a total nightmare, but even as someone without an ED I feel a knot in my stomach just reading your post which makes eating seem unappealing. \n\nI know you will move out as soon as you are able to, but until then you need to create as much physical and mental distance from him as possible. Especially in regards to your eating. \n\nThe beast within me wants to tell you to make a pact with yourself to eat a cake in front of him each time he slates your eating habits, just to piss him off. But, of course that will just cause more problems. \n\nBulk cook healthy tasty foods in the kitchen and reheat in your bedroom microwave. Or prepare fresh ingredients in your room. Take your dishes into the shower with you. Give your body and your mind the nutrition it is screaming out for. Try and associate eating with good things, like your favourite show. Or some sort of ritual that is telling yourself 'I love you'. \n\nAs someone who loves to pieces someone else who has an ED, I cannot imagine saying anything to make them worried or anxious about the food they might eat or their weight. Shame upon your father. You should want your children to be happier and healthier than yourself. \n\nStay away from his toxicity.",

He intuitively eats my whole life, but not big meals and he used to comment on how much I would eat ALL the time. He\u2019d call me fat basically and compare me to my slim sister. I had to basically move back home last year for 5 months and by the end I had resorted to hiding food while he napped and brought it only bedroom (mind you I\u2019m THIRTY!) everytime I would get something to eat he\u2019d say something like \u201cyour eating again\u201d and he always comments on other peoples weight. Mainly only women though, he was never controlling though and showered me with love he just fucked me up a little bit in thinking that only thin women are attractive. Honestly I could never live with him, 5 months was long enough. I love him but we are so much closer when we aren\u2019t living in the same house. I definitely fought with him more than my sister, best advice is get out as soon as you can.",
