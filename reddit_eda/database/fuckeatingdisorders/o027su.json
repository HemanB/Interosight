  "title": "Recovery - Coping with thigh weight gain (loss of thigh gap)",
  "selftext": "TW possibly triggering talk about thigh gaps\nHey guys\nI\u2019ve been in an outpatient recovery program for 6 weeks now, and i\u2019ve gained quite a bit of weight. My outlook has been improving and i feel my relationship with my body has been getting better\nexcept for one part - my thighs\nbefore recovery, i had an almost thigh gap. I was really happy with my thighs, and there was only a tiny bit at the top that touched, but i didn\u2019t care because it didn\u2019t rub together. the skin around my knees would brush past eachother but my thighs wouldn\u2019t touch (or they\u2019d only barely)\nbut since i\u2019ve began recovery, every stride i take my thighs rub together\ni cannot walk without being reminded of my weight gain. and i cannot wear leggings because my area is in the middle of a heat wave and, yknow, summer\neven around the house in my lounge shorts i can\u2019t relax\nit\u2019s a CONSTANT REMINDER, and honestly just generally feels extremely unpleasant. I can let go of my collarbones and ribs and waist but losing my thigh gap feels like a different kind of evil - the physical sensation of having it gone feels like hell. And i don\u2019t know how to get used to it. It\u2019s hard to recover when taking a step is a trigger. Does anyone have any advice? has anyone experienced this?",

      "body": "There\u2019s no secret trick to getting used to it; just time. Focus on distracting yourself and halting any rumination/repetitive thoughts about it. \n\nI\u2019m guessing you\u2019re in therapy as part of your program anyway? So they might help you with some techniques specifically for you, but in the meantime what helped me (and still does) is just telling myself out loud to stop thinking about whatever my mind is obsessing over and go do something else. So I literally say \u2018Quit it (my name), go get on with the laundry\u2019 or whatever. There\u2019s a science reason why this works, but I forget what it is because it\u2019s been so long since I learned it! \n\nYour body will get used to any new sensations, and you\u2019ll find it easier and easier to stop focusing attention on them. Breaking the cycle is really hard in the beginning but doing the hard work now is going to really pay off later. Youve got this.",

      "body": "it sounds like we had the same body type, before and after recovery.\n\nI have always worn bicycle shorts under my outfit to prevent my thighs touching, even when I was thinner because I suffered sever burns a few years ago and the feeling of that damaged skin touching (even when just sitting down) almost gave me mild PTSD and it would remind me of that injury.\n\nthis has had the inadvertent effect of helping me ignore my leg weight gain because I can't feel my legs touching. so when I walk or sit down and have my legs touching, I can't feel it at all.\n\nhowever, I'm at a point now that not wearing the shorts is pretty unbearable, because I'm essentially dependant on them to cope with the trauma. so I don't recommend wearing them all the time, maybe just try having a extra layer when you go out and allowing yourself to sit with that uncomfortable feeling when you're at home? I don't find myself getting too hot wearing them in the summer.",

Fluttery shorts are a blessing to help keep it airy down there and also to give you a barrier to avoid uncomfortable rubbing. Congrats on your progress and hang in there <3",

Losing stuff on my lap and dropping things I put there to hold was the one thing that drove me nuts so I just focused on that and that kept me going until I didn't really notice them any more. Sure I don't wear short shorts any more but I also have a cycle and aren't constantly freezing to death so it's a trade-off I can live with.",

Where does that fear come from? The more curious you are about your disordered thoughts, the more you will be able to look at them objectively and show yourself some compassion.",
