  "selftext": "Basically the title. Seriously though, I\u2019m in uni and the monthly allowance my parents send me is simply not enough for the amount of food I\u2019m supposed to be eating. I\u2019d get a job, but I can barely bundle up the energy to study and actually go to class. I just end up buying really cheap items in food outlets like chips, cookies, chocolate\u2026 also keep in mind I\u2019m lactose intolerant, so finding basically \u201caccidentally\u201d vegan items just ends up shriveling my options to a.) dark chocolate, b.) salted chips, c.) oreos.\n\nWorst thing is, all of those aren\u2019t PROPER MEALS, so I just end up snacking, not even snacking, I\u2019ll come home at 7 pm and open up a bag of potato chips and a jar of 2 dollar marinara and call it dinner. Of course, I can only eat half the jar because otherwise tomorrow it\u2019ll just be plain chips. When I want a proper meal I treat myself to white rice with marinara or ketchup, and if I have 2 bucks extra that week I\u2019ll even pop in a can of chickpeas. \n\nHonestly tired of this, like I miss fruits and vegetables, but they\u2019re getting extremely expensive over here (and everywhere). I used to be able to afford some, like onions, potatoes, carrots, peas\u2026 but with inflation it\u2019s just becoming economically impossible to eat both in a caloric surplus AND to eat foods that actually have SOME nutritional value (when I say nutritional value I simply mean vitamins and minerals).\n\nWhat in the living hell do I do? I know I\u2019m not the only one in this situation, so how do you guys deal with not having money hahahah?",
