This is not a weight loss sub.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t necessarily think y\u2019all should be attending these subs if you\u2019re actively trying to recover (from ANY ED, not just restrictive ones), if you want advice on how to \u201ctOnE uP\u201d and restrict your caloric intake then head on over there because it\u2019s not tolerated here and it\u2019s exhausting trying to keep up with the comments that are encouraging it lately.
