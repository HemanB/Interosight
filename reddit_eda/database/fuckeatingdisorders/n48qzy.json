  "title": "Mom's peddling disordered \"diet plans\" to my younger siblings. One has a diagnosed ED. I'm pissed.",
  "selftext": "I'm seriously so beyond done with this woman's bullshit, and seriously believe she needs her kids taken away at this point. Basically, my mom has been attempting to become an \"influencer\" for the past year or so, and somewhere along her \"influencer\" journey she became OBSESSED with diet products & programs. Most of her social media posts related to product lines like Herbalife or some \"protein powder\" company, and she even peddled some products to me via text in response to me saying I was in recovery for anorexia. \n\nI eventually blocked her and stopped communicating with her because I just couldn't handle the constant disordered diet BS, but my dad & siblings still have to be in contact with her. My dad told me a couple days ago that my mom's kicked it up a notch with the extreme dieting, and has now placed both my younger siblings on some weird diet plan with a heavy focus on protein. This pisses me off to no end, and is incredibly worrying. One of my siblings has been diagnosed with an eating disorder for about a year now. My mom is NOT aiding in their recovery by placing them on a disordered \"meal plan\" and making them more paranoid about entire food groups. She's actively hurting them and fueling their disorder. IMO, this is just further evidence that she cannot be responsible for children, and I'm really scared for my siblings right now.",
