It does not sound like you are recovered.\n\nI apologize that I offended you, I do care about others. However, you need to acknowledge that \"sharing your story\" can be done in a more positive, less triggering fashion. This is almost comparable to \"I used to indulge in X, until I got cancer\" - it contributes nothing positive towards recovery, nor did you in fact state that you recovered from the issue. Additionally, adding the comment \"F off\", just shows how childish you are acting towards others.\n\nI would recommend you reflect on your position in life; both in regards to your binge eating issue, and how you react when socializing with others.",
