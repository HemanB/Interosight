  "title": "Our identities can be based on things WAY cooler and WAY more impressive than \"I'm thin\".",
  "selftext": "This is a post I feel like I really, really need to make before my next trigger, because right now, (after having spent almost a decade and a half with an ED and most of my adult life being underweight, to now, being at a \"healthy bmi\" and feeling utterly lost without \"thin\" being a part of who I am or will probably ever be again), actually considering how there are other things I could have, as a part of my identity, which have absolutely nothing to do with my weight, but that are way more impressive, interesting, and awesome. \n\nI'm worried this post will come across as just horribly humble-braggy, but it's taken me so long to realize **I actually valued thinness as though it were some huge part of my identity as a person**: \n\nI felt like being thin made me worthwhile, even to the point where it made me who I was, like I'm nothing without it. I didn't care about anything else I had to offer. \n\nSo, to make up for all those years where I downplayed everything about me as a person, I'm going to start trying to be grateful that even though I'm not thin anymore, I can still:\n\n* Draw beautiful drawings. \n* Love and care for my boyfriend and my friends. \n* Play guitar and write songs. \n* Use my past pains and traumas to help others.\n* Take pretty photos. \n* Dance. \n\nThese are still valuable things about me, and they don't deserve to be ignored, minimized, downplayed or shrugged off, for any reason. \n\nNo matter how much I weigh, I will always have those things. I will still be the same person. \n\nEvery single person here will have lists of their own. I'd love to see other people post theirs. This feels like a really important step. It doesn't matter what you weigh, you will **always** have things about you which people will find infinitely more valuable than being able to see a glimpse of collarbone, or see you in size 0 jeans, or whatever else we so easily get so horribly caught up in.",
