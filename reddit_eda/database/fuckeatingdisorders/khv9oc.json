Ahhh I\u2019m so excited, since I\u2019ve been putting this off for months out of fear. I\u2019ve been investing a lot into recovering these past few months. So either nothing ever happened in the first place, or I was able to reverse it through getting my eating habits back to normal. Both of which would be pretty cool in my books :)",
