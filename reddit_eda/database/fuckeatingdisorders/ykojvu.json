  "selftext": "I know the 90's heroin chic or whatever body type is in vogue again right now, and honestly? I'm done. I don't care anymore. I restricted heavily in 2020 and lost a lot of weight and I still felt like that wasn't enough. I ended up binge eating and over-exercising for two years and now I still struggle with it occasionally. \n\nI'm about 90% recovered now and I have a generally healthy relationship with food and my body, except on really bad days. Recovery genuinely felt like it took forever. The urges and the disordered thoughts stick with you, and they only get louder and more frequent when you give in.\n\nI don't live to look good. I live to be healthy and strong. This shit I see online isn't going to fool me into starving myself again.",

      "body": "Yes! The worst thing is that these \"trendy\" body types are usually never achieved unless women go through plastic surgery (BBLs, liposuction) or undergo rigorous dieting, which is unrealistic because the average woman has responsibilities that require energy (which you don't really have when you're starving). \n\nWomen are almost always socialized to never be happy with their bodies so our insecurities can be profited off of. It's ridiculous. I don't wanna subscribe to any of these ideas.",
