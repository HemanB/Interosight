  "title": "From people complaining you don't eat enough to complaining you ate 'too much' of something in recovery..",
  "selftext": "I dropped to an insanely low weight. The number doesn't matter - the only thing that matters is I was surely on my way to an early grave.\n\nI began to eat again. I'm still in recovery, I'm still battling the dreadful thoughts and I've only been in the fight for 4-5 weeks. I went from one sandwich a day to lunch and a dinner + pickles as snacks. Pretty good, better than nothing. I still can't eat certain foods, in fact, many things are still off limits for me.\n\nI did develop a strong love for... well, carrots! I love carrots! I could eat them endlessly. They became a staple in my diet, sometimes consuming 1-2 carrots a day and using them to snack. I'd use them as a base for my fear foods. Hummus? Have it on a carrot! Smoothie? Chuck in some carrot! I absolutely love them raw.\n\nMy brain screams at me. \"You're fat, you're morbidly obese, congrats!\". It repeats that, every single bite of the carrot I take. However, I continue.\n\nMy family has started complaining I'm costing them too much on carrots, that they just bought me some, I'm eating them too fast! Well, yeah, I've been starving myself to an almost fatal extent for the past... year and a half? A girl is hungry.\n\nBut every time they make that comment, the passive \"oh, we're out of carrots AGAIN...\" or \"didn't I just buy you those?\"... it kills me. It kills me so bad. It feeds my anorexia, it makes me feel like a fake anorexic. Like all my experiences are invalidated because I ate two carrots as a snack + lunch and dinner.\n\nIf I ask them to stop, I get in trouble. I don't want to stop eating my carrots, I don't want to restrict anymore. But it's making me feel like I need to. Like everyone forgot I was in hospital with bradycardia after not eating this time last month, like I'm so fat from these carrots, like I'm just a nuisance.\n\nFunny thing is, they wanted to get a milkshake with me tomorrow right after complaining about my carrot addiction. They also do this with capsicums and pickles. Anything I feel comfy eating in large amounts... they don't even eat capsicum, carrots or pickles.\n\nI'm tempted to start buying my own carrot stash, honestly. I hate how these comments spoonfeed my body dysmorphia and anorexia. I can't function, really. Maybe I was never truly anorexic, seeing that I feel mildly okay downing carrots like they're water.\n\nCarrots, man.",

He isn't calling her fat, he's just making a bit of a comment - and in the end, she continues to eat heaps of bread because she loves it. I think that's a good way to look at it! My sister survived anorexia herself, so when I complain to her, I can see the cogs working in her brain. However, the rest of my family has no experience with ED.\n\nI really do love carrots! Pickles and capsicum, too. I snack on them throughout the day. I try to hide it sometimes from my family, though. But a safe food is a safe food - I shouldn't rip it away. I also love bananas and apple, but I can't eat them in the amounts of carrots I do.\n\nIt feels so reassuring to hear that my struggles are valid and that a carrot doesn't throw away a year and a half of battles.
