  "title": "What are your most ridiculous examples of \"ED logic\"?",
  "selftext": "I think sharing them or even just writing them down might be helpful not only in trivializing and making fun of them, but also deconstructing them and devoiding them of power by exposing their utter meaninglessness.\n\nSo here are some of mine:\n\nHaving dinner at 8.30PM is okay. Having dinner at 8PM is crazy.\n\nOne large course is okay. Several smaller ones are forbidden, even if they add up to a lower amount of calories.\n\nIt's hard to go from lunch to dinner without eating anything. It's (relatively) easy to go from dinner to bedtime without eating anything even if the interval is just as long.\n\nI can stuff my face with the most random food ever during a binge. But GOD FORBID I even touch a single drop of regular soda or full fat milk. That would be insane.\n\nRice is okay. Sometimes. Pasta is scary. \n\nOil added raw is just a no no. Unseasoned veggies are fine, but if they are dressed with a drizzle of oil? I'd rather have a burger please.\n\nBread is okay. Rice crackers are not okay.\n\nHam alone is not allowed. Ham with bread is okay.\n\nPotatoes are never ever allowed in any shape, size or recipe. Even cheese is better. Even if it's higher calorie.\n\nEggs are fine when put into something else, like rice or a salad. Eggs alone are forbidden.\n\nPeppers and tomatoes are lovely. Carrots are risky and must be consumed with care.\n\nBeans are only okay if I can eat a whole can. Same goes for pizza, which is only okay if I can eat a whole one.\n\nCookies are fine when put into yogurt. I must never have them with milk.\n\nBread with things is okay (sort of). Bread alone is problematic.\n\nApples must be cut in 8 slices. Oranges should be peeled with perfect technique; if any inner slice is cut in the process the whole fruit must be thrown in the garbage.\n\nAnd those are just the very first ones that come off the top of my head right now. I could go on for literal ages. Of course there's an explanation for each and every one of them - a shitty, ED-driven, maybe food-scarcity-related explanation, but an explanation nonetheless.\n\n(note: when I say \"okay\", I generally mean \"I can eat this food more than once a month without being completely overwhelmed with utter desperate terror)",

I must then drink a glass of coconut water with added potassium chloride to ensure that I am *actually* hungry and that it's not just my electrolyte levels being out of whack. After having a glass of coconut water, I must wait another 25 minutes and have a cup of coffee lest my body is tricking me.\n2. Idle hands are the devil's workshop, and so I must *only* eat if and when I have done my chores which include, but are not limited to, administering palliative care to my father. Of course, there's always something to do, so all meals - except dinner - must be postponed indefinitely.\n3. If I don't eat dinner at 9 PM on the dot, I might as well not have any, even if it's only ten past nine.\n4. If I binge/eat reactively, I can have *anything* but must wash it down with zero-calorie soda.\n5. Hot sauce is the only acceptable dressing for anything ever.\n6. I can have two small apples, but not a large one. I will not waste my apple calories on inferior apples: only perfect Cox's Orange Pippin, Honeycrisp, or Kanzi specimens will do.\n7. My oatmeal must be the perfect, creamy consistency. If it is not, it will be unceremoniously tossed into the bin.\n8. Scrambled eggs are allowed, but a single boiled egg is not.\n9. Chicken breast is the only acceptable protein source. It must be seasoned and grilled to perfection and served on a bed of spinach and roasted cherry tomatoes lest I do not consume enough iron and potassium.\n10. Sniffing peanut butter is just as good as eating it.",
