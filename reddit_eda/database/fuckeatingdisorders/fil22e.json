  "selftext": "Feeling really irrationally pissed off at people raiding the stores right now. I have like five safe foods I eat every day and if I can\u2019t find them I have no idea what the fuck I\u2019m supposed to do. I know my ED is not other people\u2019s fault, and I know everyone is scared and doing what they can to control their own panic, but I also don\u2019t want to fucking die because the Karens of the world needed 6 bags of frozen chicken breasts each.\n\nWholesome update: About ten minutes after I posted this, my bf unpromptedly texted me he found some of my safe foods at a store he was at and got them for me. Feeling better. I am working really hard to increase the amount of foods I will eat but the idea that I would be forced to do so by food scarcity is really freaking me out.",

I try my best to eat as varied a diet as I can tolerate but I always fall back to safe foods when I\u2019m stressed or tired or triggered (which is often lol). Just try your best not to let the panic get to you and keep up with feeding yourself in whatever way you can. Your immune system will thank you!",
