  "title": "My first birthday in 6 years without anorexia *TW for weight numbers",
  "selftext": "Last year, my boyfriend took me to Baskin Robins to get an Oreo Blizzard cake and a small blizzard. In line, I said something like, \u201cI bet you the cashier is going to think I\u2019m a fat fuck.\u201d I remember the funny look he gave me; I was >!95!< lbs at most, only ate once a day, and exercised for 1.5 hours every day. He and I were in this weird phase where I was too sick to understand or even acknowledge his needs in the relationship outside of my anorexia and he didn\u2019t know how to bring it up, so while he was at work all day I stayed at home, by myself, fantasizing about my single slice of cake I\u2019d end up purging before he\u2019d get home and then giving the rest to him and my roommates.\n\nThis year, my coworker bought me a cookie cake and the kids at work (I work at a daycare) made me cards and told me why they were grateful for me. My boyfriend requested Monday off so we could go to the aquarium together; he got me my favorite Starbucks drink, a mini Carvel ice cream cake for the two of us, and vodka and such for Sea Breeze cocktails; my best friend ordered me a pizza; and tomorrow we\u2019re going to the city to get me some art supplies and maybe even my own skateboard.\n\nA lot of the time, I struggle to see the good things in recovery, but this is the first birthday I\u2019ve been genuinely grateful for everything I have and it\u2019s all because I finally chose everything else over anorexia. This the first day I\u2019ve noticed I\u2019ve been genuinely happy.",
