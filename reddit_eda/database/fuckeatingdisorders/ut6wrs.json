  "selftext": "I finally went for my first psychologist session after waiting for 6 months. \n\nOne thing that really stuck with me, that I wanted to share, was when I mentioned to her at one point, what would happen if I listened to what she said and not restrict after eating, end the cycle then and there, what then would become of me? What worth would I have? \n\nI have been doing this for so long it has become something I\u2019m familiar with, something that is a part of me. And she said that since I\u2019ve never tried not restricting before and since I\u2019d never know until I do, why not give it a try, because if I stick to this life I have right now, in this bubble, I\u2019d never discover what lies beyond what I\u2019m familiar with, what I think is \u201cme\u201d. What if that version of myself where I\u2019m at a higher weight is better? What if I\u2019m more sociable, more driven, more confident, more assured, more attractive? what if that would be the best version of myself? I already know what my ED self is like - the current state I\u2019m at. \n\nEssentially, what makes me so sure that my ED self is the better version of me?\n I\u2019d never know how my non-ED self is like until I give it a try, and who knows, it might be for the better. I\u2019d truly be missing out if I don\u2019t give it a try",

When I went to the hospital as well the psych lady there said why don\u2019t you just go for it and then if you hate it that much , you can always go back. But you have to try first and give it a good go. That\u2019s the thing, if you don\u2019t try you won\u2019t know, don\u2019t let the fear stop you! You have so much potential",
