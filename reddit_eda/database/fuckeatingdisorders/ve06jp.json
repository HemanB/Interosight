  "selftext": "So eat the fucking cake. Eat the ice cream. Eat the PB, the cookie, the French fries, the egg, the sandwich, the apple, the chicken breast, the fruit and sorbet smoothie, eat *whatever the hell you want.* We\u2019re all gonna die anyway, and we don\u2019t really know when, so why not actually enjoy your life while you have it? \n\nMy ED is so focused on eating only the healthiest foods. I saw an article recently that said eating fish causes cancer? And ya know what? So fucking what if it does! If I get melanoma at age 50 because I enjoyed sushi every once in a while then so be it, at least I enjoyed so damn good sushi before then. I\u2019m sick of all the conflicting messaging from diet culture; just eat the fucking food you want, enjoy yourself, and trust me, you will have lived a full life no matter how long that life ends up being.\n\n**Edit: Some of y\u2019all are so dedicated to being angry I swear. Yes, I\u2019m well aware that there is more to ED recovery than \u201cjUsT eAT LoL \ud83e\udd2a\u201d. Not the point of this post. This was me trying to work through my own version of radical acceptance and share a thought process that has helped me, personally, with my personal ED recovery. If it doesn\u2019t help you, that\u2019s fine! We\u2019re all individuals on our own journeys, that\u2019s completely normal! It was my hope that if this could help even one person in their recovery, then it would be worth sharing. I\u2019m asking for a little civility here. Not everything is an affront to your experience with your ED. We\u2019re all working towards the same goal here.**",
