I didn't weigh out or count anything I ate today either which is another personal challenge in recovery that I've been trying to overcome.\nI wanted anyone else who came across this thread thats battling a restrictive eating disorder/ in recovery from one to know this, in case you needed to hear it: it is MORE than ok to eat what you're craving in amounts that satisfy you, and to give yourself permission to nourish your body. I did it today and it felt awesome and it felt freeing! please please please take this as your sign if you need it to honour your hunger because more likely than not it's simply what your body needs!",
