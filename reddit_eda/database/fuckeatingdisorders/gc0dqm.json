  "selftext": "Last Friday, I committed to eating the recommended number of calories for a runner my age and weight *every day* for a week. And I did it!\n\nOh my god, what a difference. \n\n- my running pace has improved so much that I actually have to remind myself to hold back because going too fast all the time can cause injuries that I don't want to have to deal with \n\n- I'm not tired and cold all the time! It's great. \n\n- food is still terrifying and annoying but I'm GETTING THERE. \n\n- it is possible to get tired of ice cream. (It's me. I'm tired of ice cream.)",
