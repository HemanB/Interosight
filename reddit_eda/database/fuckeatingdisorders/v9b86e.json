I believe it\u2019s possible to go HAM on weight loss without COMPLETELY sacrificing other things. But I wholeheartedly agree that it\u2019s a competing interest, and it has consumed THE lion\u2019s share of my time and focus over the last year. For me it\u2019s not all about weight loss, it\u2019s also about longevity and fitness, and learning how to live a lifestyle I can maintain indefinitely that will produce the aesthetic body I\u2019d like. Now that I\u2019ve studied this topic to death, I\u2019m starting to relax with my intensity of focus, and am starting to do other things more again. I still spend much more time than most people working out and thinking about food, but then, I also think I am healthier and better looking than most people who are in similar situations to me (and I\u2019m not blessed genetically).\n\nTl;dr: you\u2019re completely right, it\u2019s easy, and it\u2019s a trap, to completely eschew everything else in one\u2019s life, in the pursuit of a goal, such as weight loss. I\u2019ve been there myself. I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve come around OP. Moderation is key!",

Shame is already wrapped up in a lot of it (at least for me it was) It would be even harder to handle the idea that me having this disordered relationship w food ALSO makes me boring to be around. It seems like you found that sentiment to be empowering or enlightening which is cool, I just can feel myself getting a little sensitive though thinking about this and wanted to voice another pov for anyone else who may be reading and feeling similarly (or anyone who\u2019s currently struggling)",

I hope my kids never waste their teen years like that, but I know there's a chance they will since so many people struggle with this at some point. :(",

          "body": "Yep. I've been recovered for years and of course weigh a lot more than I did when I starved myself, especially after having kids. But I know people who aren't disordered who feel uncomfortable or not attractive on the beach or by the pool or whatever, and I guess they assume I feel the same so they complain to me about how they dread going out there in a bathing suit. And I just can't relate anymore. I found a few cute bathing suits that I feel good in, went on vacation, and was at the beach every day feeling good, jumping over waves and boogie boarding, not obsessing over someone who might be looking at me thinking i'm fat like I used to assume. \n\nI've realized anyone who stares that hard at a stranger and judges their body negatively is either a creeper or has no life, or maybe both. I know when I look at people on the beach, I'm typically admiring people's positive traits, not their flaws. Even if I see they have cellulite, I'm thinking about their nice smile or how good they are at volleyball, not thinking they don't deserve to eat like I used to assume about myself. It's so freeing to not obsess over what people might think of my body. I sat on the beach reading, eating cheez-its and drinking hard seltzer when i wasn't in the water with my kids, and it was truly relaxing. I never could have had that kind of vacation when I was still sick.",
