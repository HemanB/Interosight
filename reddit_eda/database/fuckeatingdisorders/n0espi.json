  "title": "Why is it that often \"stop restricting\" is interpreted as \"don't eat less than your meal plan\"?",
  "selftext": "It's not the same thing!\n\nI so often see people in recovery saying that they stopped restricting, or that they don't restrict, and encouraging others to do the same...yet when they show what they actually eat it's just a very normal meal plan with normal or even small-ish portions.\n\nI mean...I don't wanna invalidate or gatekeep them, I'm sure they believe what they say, but is it possible that for every single person in recovery out there \"stop restricting\" magically means \"eating in a very balanced way according to a perfectly crafted meal plan that just allows you to maintain your weight and maybe slowly gain a bit over time\"? Meanwhile I'm here binging my ass off everytime I try to \"stop restricting\".\n\nAnd I'm not just talking about people who are \"in recovery\" but actually not. I'm also referring to youtubers/instagrammers/whatever who do seem to be genuinely in recovery. And actually even dietitian themselves now that I think about it.\n\nMaybe it's just me. Maybe I'm misinterpreting everything. But it's just that for me personally I can't imagine how \"stopping restricting\" and \"eating normal meals\" can go together. \"Normal meals\" feel restrictive and these people make me feel even crazier. I saw someone the other day telling something along the lines of oh, I used to obsess so much about this food but since I stopped restricting it I no longer think about it. Girl you eat like two mouthfuls of it once a day, please tell me your secret and how you managed to stop obsessing over it with those measly amounts!",

      "body": "I think if you're following a strict meal plan, even if it's a \"normal\" amount to eat in a day, if you want to be eating more, you're still restricting yourself. You can be eating a normal amount in a day and be restricting, the word doesn't only mean starving yourself. A strict meal plan is restriction, because you're restricting yourself from eating what you would otherwise, and restricting yourself to only those foods. That's literally the definition of \"restriction\".\n\nIn my recovery from my restriction, yeah I did binge. Because recovery is a process. It's not one day that you decide I'm in recovery now because I'm following this non-restrictive meal plan and am never going to make myself throw up or binge again. It's slow. I started paying attention to my body and that I want to feel good. I *had* to mess up sometimes, otherwise I wouldn't have those moments to stop and reflect and think about how it made me feel. I allowed myself to eat an entire box of macaroni and cheese (a few times), and instead of shaming myself or hating myself, I reminded myself that I was allowed to, but also payed attention to my body and how I felt and I felt, physically, like absolute shit from it. Slowly I have learned what makes my body feel good and have prioritized that, and I am making great progress.\n\nAt the same time, I know that not everybody's recovery looks like mine, and I think that if a meal plan is in place to get somebody with restrictive issues to eat *more,* that is the healthiest thing for them, and it isn't my place to decide whether it is. That being said, there are super toxic diet culture doctors out there, and someone working on a meal plan with their doctor *does not* inherently make it healthy or something we shouldn't talk about whether it is healthy.\n\nI also am really not into the comments saying that the fear of binging or talking about recovery from restriction being eating what we want to eat scares people away from recovery. If eating what you want is so scary that you are continuing to do harm by restricting and not starting recovery, *that* is what you need to work on, not your meal plan. Eating what you want is scary to people in ED recovery, why? Because it will make them fat. Heaven forbid you look like me, right? We need to make sure they know they can recover without ending up looking like me, because that would be the *worst thing* to happen, and will keep them from choosing recovery.... I don't subscribe to catering to that. Deal with your internalized fatphobia first. See a therapist and deal with your overwhelming fear of looking like I look. Restricting yourself from binging when in \"recovery\" from restricting more is not actually being in recovery. It's putting a band aid and not addressing the root. You're still restricting yourself from your other eating disorder that you haven't addressed, binge eating disorder and it's going to stay with you forever until you get to the root cause and change that. You will be restricting yourself on a meal plan forever, wanting to eat more, fearing it, and shaming yourself when you do. Healthy relationships with food do exist after recovery, I know first hand, but yeah restricting yourself from a need to binge without working on intuitive eating, is not the road to a healthy relationship with food. Maybe a first step towards it, but it's not it.\n\nTo reiterate, though - smaller portioned meals to make sure that you are eating the right amount and avoiding refeeding syndrome and other health issues that come in the beginning stages of recovery may be necessary for some people, and it's absolutely NOT my place to decide for them, based on me looking in from the outside. This is *far* from being every case, and it is a problem, but it still isn't my place to decide that for others without knowing the details.\n\nEdit to add: Also if somebody is on a restrictive meal plan that aids to their recovery, like in the examples I mentioned above, there is NO reason for them to be sharing that on social media saying they \"aren't restricting,\" and maybe that's where some of my strong feelings on this come from. Like, yeah maybe restricting in that way is necessary for some people's recovery, but it's still restricting. You're not \"recovered\" in your relationship with food if you'd be binging like crazy if you allowed yourself to.",

Like, I've seen people doing MinnieMaud with HaloTop and im like...why. that's a whole ass pint of ice cream for like, 300 kcals. Where you getting your other 2700+? \n\nUltimately, it's caloric and macro/micronutrient sufficiency that drives satiation. A professionally designed meal plan may be able to achieve that while the portions don't look 'insane.' \n\nThere's also a mental part of restriction, too. For me, if I know I have a whole jar of peanut butter in the fridge, and that it's mine, and that I can have it *whenever,* I just...stop caring. Same for cereal, etc. When it's not in limited supply, food gets less interesting.

Someone who is recovered but says no to a food craving every now and then is still recovered.  Someone who is recovered and follows a meal plan to make sure they hit their caloric and nutrient needs, is still recovered.  Someone who is regularly eating at or above their caloric and nutritional needs every day is recovered.  It doesn't matter if they follow a meal plan, if they are working with a nutritionist to know what to eat or what their caloric and nutritional needs are, or if they eat smaller portions than Someone else, they are still recovered.  They are recovered even if they still feel anxiety once in a blue moon over a certain meal.  They are recovered even if they deny themselves a certain sweet treat every now and then, because these are things healthy people do, that people with eating disorders do to the *extreme*.  \n\n\"[Recovery] isn't happening if I am thinking about the thing I want to have but am not letting myself eat it.\" Yes, it is, and you can be recovered and still crave a food, and think \"I should not eat that right now.\"  For example, Someone in Recovery could finish a meal, crave dessert, and decide not to eat it because they know they would feel bloated or sick eating more at that point.  The difference between casual or occasion restriction and restricting in the form of an eating disorder is the frequency.  If they always restrict that food, if they never eat it because they are scared of it, that is unhealthy.  If they allow themselves to eat it, but decide occasionally it isn't the right thing to have right now, that is not unhealthy.",

Eating whatever I had a craving for whenever I wanted led to me gaining weight rapidly.  I was constantly bloated to the point my stomach was hard and distended, so much that people would question if I was pregnant.  I was constantly in physical and emotional pain.  I would eat because I couldn't stop myself, and then hate myself for it and cut later at night because I was upset that I was gaining weight uncontrollably.

But, this *psychiatric disorder* can also be defined as an *addiction*, and an *addiction* does not strictly need to have a specific emotion or other mental disorder tied to it.  As I stated, in my case I was addicted to food, but I didnt eat it because I was sad, or depressed, or bored, or anxious.  I ate it because I was hungry, because I had been starving myself.  I went beyond intuitive eating, and ate until I was bloated, because I could not stop myself.  I did not target my depression, anxiety, or any other disorder when I stopped binging.\n\nIt absolutely can be unhealthy to eat whatever you want whenever.  It was unhealthy for me.  Eating whatever I had a craving for whenever I wanted led to me gaining weight rapidly.  I was constantly bloated to the point my stomach was hard and distended, so much that people would question if I was pregnant.  I was constantly in physical and emotional pain.  I would eat because I couldn't stop myself, and then hate myself for it and cut later at night because I was upset that I was gaining weight uncontrollably.  Eating whatever whenever or trying to learn to intuitively eat without support, or guidance, absolutely can lead you to the other side of the spectrum, which is over Eating and binge eating, and is harmful to your body and mind.",

If they are scared to eat anything outside of the meal plan, I would agree that would not be a recovered mindset.  The goal is to not be anxious about eating or consuming any food, and you can be that way with a meal plan.  So I believe we do agree, and I misunderstood your original comment.  I should have elaborated, as I did here, that a meal plan does not necessarily mean you only eat the meal plan and never eat anything over it.  I see a meal plan as a \"minimum\" and that it is perfectly fine to eat outside of planned meal times, as long as you are not at a threat of refeeding syndrome.",

Binging or eating anything anytime you want it may work for you, but isn't everyone's recovery.  Thats how I tried to self recover, just eating anything I had a craving for.  I ended up with lots of half eaten food packages, lots of money spent on food, and gaining 50 pounds over three months because I was eating over 4000 calories a day.  Things like this are not only harmful mentally, but also physically.  Refeeding syndrome, bloating, swelling stomachs, constipation, diahreea, are all realities if you just eat any food you crave without considering the nutrients your body needs and the things that will be easier on your stomach after restricting.  Following this course of \"self recovery\" led me into BED, which led me to begin purging and eventually relapsing harder into restriction than before I started trying to \"recover\" in the first place.  \n\nMy advice is this; I only chose to comment on this post because you seem judgeful of people posting their recovery stories and meal plans on instagram because it doesn't align with your own.  That is what I found harmful.  Someone who has smaller portioned meal plans is someone who isn't restricting, if they are following a plan set by their doctor it is whats best for their recovery journey and should not be judged.  We should not be judging each other for how much or little one another eats during recovery, we should just be encouraging that we chose the path to recovery in the first place.  If you find people with smaller portioned meal plans triggering to you, you should stop following those people and tags on social media.",

Which is untrue.  \"If you are restricting yourself from eating what you want to eat, that is literally restriction.\"  It might be literal restriction, but does not mean that they are anorexic or not recovered.  Someone who is recovered but says no to a food craving every now and then is still recovered.  Someone who is recovered and follows a meal plan to make sure they hit their caloric and nutrient needs, is still recovered.  Someone who is regularly eating at or above their caloric and nutritional needs every day is recovered.  It doesn't matter if they follow a meal plan, if they are working with a nutritionist to know what to eat or what their caloric and nutritional needs are, or if they eat smaller portions than Someone else, they are still recovered.  They are recovered even if they still feel anxiety once in a blue moon over a certain meal.  They are recovered even if they deny themselves a certain sweet treat every now and then, because these are things healthy people do, that people with eating disorders do to the *extreme*.  \n\n\"[Recovery] isn't happening if I am thinking about the thing I want to have but am not letting myself eat it.\" Yes, it is, and you can be recovered and still crave a food, and think \"I should not eat that right now.\"  For example, Someone in Recovery could finish a meal, crave dessert, and decide not to eat it because they know they would feel bloated or sick eating more at that point.  The difference between casual or occasion restriction and restricting in the form of an eating disorder is the frequency.  If they always restrict that food, if they never eat it because they are scared of it, that is unhealthy.  If they allow themselves to eat it, but decide occasionally it isn't the right thing to have right now, that is not unhealthy.",
