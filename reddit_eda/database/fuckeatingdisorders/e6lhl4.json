  "selftext": "(since I'm not sure if slight calorie mention is allowed, TW calories)\n\nJust wanted to share a small achievement that happened a few minutes ago!\nToday at the supermarket, I had the choice between the bread that I always buy (a kind of awful, wholemeal bread that only has 77 calories per slice), and a loaf of really good, seeded bread that I used to love (but I know has 125 calories a slice). I must've looked like a crazy person in the supermarket, going back and forth, but eventually I decided to get the scary 125 calorie bread, because I'm done with having unsatisfactory, low cal bread! \nIt took a lot of courage and I know when I go to actually eat it it will be difficult, but the first step is done and I'm really proud of myself for choosing flavour over calories for once.",
