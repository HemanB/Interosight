      "body": "I didn\u2019t feel this for my ED, but I had this exact feeling with my drug and alcohol addiction. I knew alcohol/opiates were going to kill me but I couldn\u2019t let go of them partially because I identified myself as an addict and it was part of my identity. I was never able to recover from either until I was able to let go of this idea that somehow the drugs I was doing defined me as a person which is why AA and similar 12 step based programs never worked for me. I had to let go of who I WAS to become the person I was meant to BE. This is kind of tricky doing it on your own though but I had help from a fanatic mental health professional as well as a group of really supportive friends.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t identify with my ED I do identify myself as being thin and \u201cwispy\u201d for a boy which did make ED recovery a challenge but Ive been constantly reminding myself and doing affirmations so I know that my body does not define me, and Ive learned that it is merely a flesh suit that lets me experience consciousness.",
