It may come from a good place but It\u2019s really none of your business. \n\n\u201cHave this cookie. No really, I won\u2019t let you leave until you have at least one\u201d - a fear food of mine. Was already feeling down and this almost made me have an anxiety attack at work. I kept refusing it but alas was forced one. No means no. :( \n\nand just so many questions about \u201cwhat did i have for lunch/break?\u201d I leave my workplace for a reason during break, I feel more comfortable by myself. I know all of these questions come from a genuine and good place but it\u2019s so hard to recover when you have already have food and this disorder plaguing you and then society bombarding you with more triggers.",

Seriously I feel uncomfortable just reading that and you have all the right to stop them.\n\nAnd the comment on your body is totally inappropriate and can be reported.",

      "body": "Thank you for posting this today. I needed it. I, too, just started a new job. Conveniently I always forget that new situations may present new opportunities for comments on my body, food, etc. It always catches me off guard. I\u2019ve learned to discern well-meaning comments and brush them off. But the brash comments from other women about my body still upsets me so much. It upsets me that they are thinking about weight so much that it\u2019s the first thing they comment on when meeting me and it makes me feel like I\u2019m being reduced to merely a body. I try to pause and have empathy, knowing how much body image and weight have been at the forefront of my mind most of my life, but it\u2019s hard to understand why people think it\u2019s okay to say it OUT LOUD (especially very loudly, in front of other people.) It seems like common sense to me but I\u2019m proved wrong all the time!",
