      "body": "Nah as someone who likes to lift weights for the joy of it rather than aesthetics or the calorie burn, it\u2019s really annoying that people go from pure restriction to exercise addiction and base what they\u2019re allowed to eat on how much or how hard they exercise. The entire point of recovery is to find food freedom and accept your body\u2014not continue to limit yourself out of fear of weight gain or becoming fat.\n\nBut when we live in a society that promotes disordered behaviors like exercising and restircting your intake as a means of changing your body, I can\u2019t blame them entirely. They just genuinely don\u2019t know any better, they really do think that\u2019s what recovery looks like.",

      "body": "Yeaaa I see a lot of bouncing between anorexia and exercise addiction (with some food restriction still, but not as bad so they claim they are \"better\"). Just one disordered behavior to another. Still terrified of gaining an ounce of fat and tracking macros obsessively, but eat slightly more than they used to to fuel their hard-core workouts now without passing out. It's very sad to me. I almost went down that pipeline before when I was trying to convince myself that I was doing \"better\"",
