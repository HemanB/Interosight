  "selftext": "That\u2019s literally it. It\u2019s been too long since I\u2019ve had cake and even longer since I\u2019ve had cake I didn\u2019t make with a weird disordered recipe. And the world will not implode. And I will not wake up somehow a completely different person. I will not turn into a giant blob. Nothing will be different in the way my brain says it will. My morality is not somehow linked to my eating cake.",
