  "selftext": "Sugar is just amazing, and not just in taste!\n\nI\u2019m not doing all in, I\u2019m challenging my fear foods/food rules slower, and currently I\u2019m trying to work on my fear of eating \u2018too much\u2019 sugar at the moment (I\u2019m aware it\u2019s not actually too much, but that\u2019s what the ED says!). It\u2019s making such a difference, like more than I expected honestly.\n\nI\u2019m sleeping more soundly, and I don\u2019t have to pee as often, like I\u2019ve slept completely through the night twice without waking up to pee since starting to eat sugar a little more freely, I sincerely can\u2019t remember the last time that happened. I also feel more satiated, it\u2019s amazing what difference it makes to eat exactly what your body craves rather than something else!\n\nAll in is still not personally for me, but challenging this rule definitely gives me a lot more freedom to listen to my cravings more rather than sticking to safer foods, which I think is a great step in my recovery! \ud83d\ude38",
