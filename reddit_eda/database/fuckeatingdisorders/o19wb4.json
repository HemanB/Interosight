  "selftext": "When I was just out of college I confided in a l coworker who was slim that I was frustrated with my weight. Even at the time I thought she kind of was a mess, but hey: she was thin, and in my disorder, worth asking for advice from because of it.\n\nShe told me some of her tips to lose and maintain her weight\u2014involved a lot of ziplock bags\u2014and she left me with, \u201cYou\u2019ll figure it out by the time you\u2019re 30.\u201d\n\nWell, I\u2019m 30. I hit 1 year in recovery recently. I have had disordered eating habits since I was 7. Here\u2019s where I\u2019m at.\n\nNot too long after posting my review for 6 months I ended up having a panic attack about the whole process. I had to take to bed for two days, watch videos online, and order in a bunch of take out while aching. I got through it. So often the answer seems to be to just keep keeping on. In fact, so much of this entire process has surprised me in its parallels to handling and combating my anxiety\u2014oh, you\u2019re scared of that? Do it. Can you do it again with less fear? Can you create boundaries where appropriate, push through in the ways you need to to live your life?\n\nI began having so many odd physical symptoms that I put a moratorium on stressing out about them they came on and left so fast.\n\nFor two weeks my privates smelled horrific for no reason I could discern. Fun.\n\nFor another two weeks my elbows had a dull, consistent pain in the joint. Why my elbows, and why then?\n\nI gained more stretch marks, this time on my left inner bicep. They were deeper and scarier than the ones on my right. Why? Why did they begin to ache a month later?\n\nOne terrifying day my pee smelled sweet, and then the next day it didn\u2019t, and it hasn\u2019t again since. What did I eat that made that happen?\n\nMy energy improves, and then degrades. A weekend is spent on the couch barely moving. Feet swell, then dissipate, then swell again. One day the bloat on my stomach went down really significantly\u2014then it was back to pregnancy belly by the end of the day. I am discovering, over and over again, how early on 1 year really is for me.\n\nLots of things are worth pointing out as improvements, though. My joints don\u2019t crack in the way they used to. I remember at one point getting up from my desk about a year and a half ago and hearing three distinct, loud cracking noises break out across the quiet office space I was working in. It was intense, and kind of gross. This doesn\u2019t happen as much.\n\nThe TMJ that set in \u201cpermanently\u201d (one click each side per mouth open) at the beginning of my last and final restrictive episode four years ago is lessening in severity substantially. In early 2020 it had worsened to the point that I popped both sides of my jaw multiple times to open my mouth fully, and sometimes this would give me a shock of excruciating pain. Now, it\u2019s only on one side, and it\u2019s a dull pop. I hope to make a full recovery from this, but I\u2019m willing to be patient. I remember when this first set in how furious was\u2014it was so annoying, so frustrating, and then\u2026 I got used to it. It\u2019s incredible how we can normalize pain for evolutionary reasons, but it also shows how dangerous our EDs really are. It was very, very bad for me to have normalized that pain. It was very, very bad that I normalized my hunger.\n\nI continue to mostly have good poops. Occasionally I\u2019ll get constipated (and when it happens my mood definitely dips) but for the most part I have at least one good poop a day. I don\u2019t have the chonkers I did at the beginning of this process, but I\u2019m still weirdly proud of all of them, and the fact that I poop at all. I sometimes admire them as a marker of how far I\u2019ve come.\n\nIn February I realized I looked tan. Not because I was, but because my skin was less shallow. I had gotten used to it being somewhat gray, and it being not-gray was a shock, even in the middle of winter. The feeling continues into summer. I had taken my paleness at face-value, never assuming that a slightly deeper color was perhaps my more natural state.\n\nMy extreme hunger let up at 10 months. At first I didn\u2019t have much to say about this, but I realize over and over again how shocking it is to feel full. I haven\u2019t, didn\u2019t, never felt full\u2014I was always using willpower to stop. Now I just stop because I don\u2019t want more, and it\u2019s still surprising how easy and natural it is. I stop at odd points in meals\u2013not, \u201cwhen the plate is empty\u201d, or, \u201cwhen the person across from me is done\u201d, but\u2026 when I don\u2019t feel like any more. It\u2019s so natural, perhaps, that I suspect I\u2019ll lose this feeling of awe over the whole thing before I have any right to. I stop at weird points\u2014there will be a bite and a half left of something, and I\u2019ll just be done. That said, I still eat a lot. I probably eat a normal amount, but it feels like a lot because for so long, I didn\u2019t eat enough. My brain is still trying to catch up.\n\nMy body seems to have stopped/slowed gaining around 6-10 months. The stretch marks on my legs I wrote about at month 6 continue to fade, although they are still prominent, and there are new ones on my inner biceps. They look worse on the backs of my legs than the front. I gained a great deal with a \u201cnormal\u201d starting weight, likely more than twice what I ever lost. It is uncomfortable, but I still trust the process, trust in a future where I feel less uncomfortable.\n\nI see the numbers people post here sometimes with a wizened cynicism. There will always be someone in a worse boat, someone for whom what you are going through would be infinitely preferable to what they are going through, and there is comfort in that even for me.\n\nI realized that the extreme water retention in my upper thighs and face dissipated at some point, although I noticed it in month 10. This isn\u2019t to say I don\u2019t have water retention and/or bloat (I definitely do), but simply that the puffy, angry retention that caused my skin to appear red has faded and I\u2019m left with \u201cregular\u201d recovery retention. My belly, for example, is still the \u201cpregnancy belly\u201d and my breasts seem to just sit on it, causing a lot of uncomfortable sweat throughout the day.\n\nI began having weird dreams in month 11. I\u2019d be on my way to class, but couldn\u2019t get there because I needed to organize my dorm first. I\u2019d try to drive to the airport, but would get stuck on the bridge with a boat passing through, needing to wait. I wanted to be elsewhere, but circumstances would always dictate I stay, however frustrated I was.\n\nI still experience the aches in my legs that onset around month 4. I can still run out of breath easily doing simple stuff. I will think I have improved, and then it will get worse again. It\u2019s all so slow that it\u2019s hard to tell. My energy continues to be low generally. I struggle with my energy levels not matching the ambitions I have for my favorite energy-heavy hobby. I\u2019m both bored and tired, and need a lot of sleep. [I still lack shape.](https://edinstitute.org/paper/2012/11/23/phases-of-recovery-from-an-eating-disorder-part-5#_edn17) I am still comparatively very large to past-me and often ruminate on this process and my body. I still experience anxiety when thinking about attending large gatherings of people I haven\u2019t seen in a long time. So, I make myself go. It\u2019s never as bad as I think it will be. I survive, keep on.\n\nMany aspects of this have been lonely for me. It\u2019s a relatively unique and uncomfortable experience. I think most people string along mildly disordered habits off and on until they die, or never started them in the first place. I seem to only know people in the first category, which is frustrating because finding people who eat \u201cnormally\u201d is a suggested component of the recovery process and my two options seem to be my teenage brother who I don\u2019t live with and my dog. I get frustrated I have to go through this at all. I hope very dearly it will all let up. I suffer from the idea that it will be different for me, it won\u2019t happen for me, that the pain and edema and exhaustion are forever permanent. I know logically that\u2019s unlikely. I queue up recovery podcasts and let the same facts and calm assurances wash over me, again and again.\n\nI gained a lot of weight publicly and without explanation. I don\u2019t think I owe anyone an explanation, but it sucks that I don\u2019t even feel I have the wherewithal to properly give one. Too few would understand, and I worry about debating causing a relapse. With close friends I haven\u2019t seen in a while I\u2019ll sometimes try and broach the topic to test the waters, and more often than not they\u2019ll begin telling me about their latest diet. It\u2019s shocking how progressive and avant-garde \u201ceating what you want, how much you want, when you want\u201d is in the broader culture I\u2019m in. It\u2019s lonely knowing that the repercussions for following that common sense after long periods of not will be dramatic and confusing and garner looks. I wish this process could be a physiological one instead of a psycho-societal-cultural one. But it is what it is, so I trudge on.\n\nIt\u2019s tough that my energy levels are so low, and people around me don\u2019t understand. Many people I know are vaccinated and want to do fun things, go fun places, and I\u2019m physically not ready. I\u2019m tired.\n\nAt various points I\u2019ve cried a lot. I am often frustrated and delicate, or perfectly peachy\u2014it\u2019s hard to know which it will be. I feel like a large baby when I sit and it can make me upset. I sometimes wish I could be coddled and taken care of, but I am mostly recovering alone. It\u2019s yet another frustration I have\u2014how poorly life is set up for being very sick despite chronic illnesses being a fact of life. I am both very lucky and grateful that a full recovery should be possible for me and really fucking pissed that I am currently sick, and that healing takes time it does. Recovery is, continues to be, an exercise in my patience.\n\nI am trying to get used to the sight of my body, which has been tough. I think when our eating disorder is most threatened, it screams the loudest. I\u2019m dealing with the mental schism that comes from caring so, so deeply about one thing for so long\u2014thinness\u2014and then pointedly, purposefully saying that it does not matter, it will not matter, I will do what I need to achieve my recovery without it mattering, it needs to not matter. I think I would cry if I had cancer and knew that no outcomes were certain, and that healing would take years. That\u2019s what ED recovery is, is it not? No real certainty, and years in the process. I honestly feel sometimes as if I am only \u2153 ways in at the year mark. But who can know? I think the worker bees in my body do, but they\u2019re not sharing their secrets. And that alone can bring me back down from the despair. I don\u2019t know where I\u2019ll end up, but I know I\u2019m going there, and that\u2019s what I get, and that alone has to be enough. A small part of me has always wanted to be there, has always known I would be happy there, if I could just get to it.\n\nThere are glimpses of normalcy. I didn\u2019t write for five years. It was like the spigot of creativity was swallowed by my calorie tracker until I felt I had nothing to say anymore. Now I seem to write incessantly.\n\nSometimes, my partner and I will be watching something, or talking about something, and something funny will happen, and I laugh like the fat mouse in Cinderella\u2014gleefully, loudly, with abandon. Nothing was truly funny for so long that these episodes feel like untamed emotional spills. I am so lucky to be able to laugh again.\n\nI meet my neighbors on the street walking my dog, and instead of being annoyed that they\u2019re curious about her, I feel patient. I have nice conversations with strangers, and see people who, even though I\u2019m an adult, and it\u2019s hard to make friends as an adult, that I could imagine being friends with. I see potential paths in my future a little more clearly. The uncertainty feels less scary, more like possibility.\n\nI\u2019ve thought a lot about my disorder, how I ended up in my predicament. I blame no one while looking at a whirlwind of circumstances that created, in my opinion, the perfect storm. I am happy, though, that the learnings I take into my future are simple\u2014whatever happens in the future, I must keep eating when I am hungry, eating what I want, when I want, and eventually this will be my past.\n\nIn April I visited my grandmother with my shrinking mother, my too-thin sister. I got the confused once-over that every woman in my family tries and fails to do subtly with me. Conversation was light. I asked my grandmother after a chat about food what her favorite sandwich was. My mother interjected before she had a chance to respond that, \u201cMother doesn\u2019t like sandwiches. As long as I can remember lunch has either been a salad, or a pretzel with mustard.\u201d\n\nAnd there it was, in the silence that followed. Our rotted inheritance. Three generations of women who had spent their entire lives trying to make themselves as small as they possibly could. How far back did it stretch, I wondered? Of all the legacies one could have, was this mine? Had any of us achieved the goal in the way we wanted, or was it a fool\u2019s errand from the get-go?\n\nIn that small sitting room there was a buzzing, an emanation. It was a feeling that used to propel me to restrict a little harder, push myself a little more, chastise more strictly, fall apart over my scale more dramatically as fuel for tomorrow. The anxious energy to not stop moving, and it rose and suffocated the room, distortions of the cultural learnings that kept all of us in that room trapped.\n\nMe, in my new casing, a small island. With this as our birthrights, can we get better?\n\nI have my answer for myself. If that\u2019s all I will ever get, I will be grateful. I am like an inlet that is developing off of the river, a slight refuge from getting swept away. The difference between reaching dry ground and drowning.\n\nA common refrain here is that eating disorders will kill you. I don\u2019t wish to refute it, but I propose an alternate scenario for your consideration, one in which you do not get better, one in which you stay alive until your old age. You string along attempting to stay as small as you possibly can, hating yourself more vehemently as your biology fights you, having been alive but in some ways never having lived. A life which you spent in flight and fear over the time spent alone in your bathroom, over the food in your cabinet, over the numbers attached to the clothes on your back. A life without a favorite sandwich, perhaps.\n\nWe went to Panera afterward for lunch, which I hadn\u2019t realized meant only unsweetened iced tea until after I\u2019d ordered a full meal. I wasn\u2019t super hungry, but it was lunchtime, and I wanted to not be hungry on the long ride home, and I wanted to see my family a little longer. My mother ended up taking all of my potato chips after I said I\u2019d be happy to share, and my sister ended up eating half of my sandwich after complaining about being cold in beautiful 80 degree weather. I felt like I was feeding hungry cats, but I didn\u2019t mind. As I got into my car to leave them I reflected on how I had food at home, food I was allowed to eat it. Even though I am fat, and they are not. We all deserved to eat, but I was the one who would.\n\nAround the same time that I confided in that one coworker, I got a fortune out of a fortune cookie that said, \u201cYou will make many changes before settling down happily.\u201d  It\u2019s been 7 years since I taped that small slip of paper to my desk. It\u2019s been over two decades since I began feeling I was wrong, too large. I\u2019m 30. I\u2019m making many changes.\n\n[6 Months in Recovery](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckeatingdisorders/comments/l9wits/6_months_in_recovery/) | [15 Months in Recovery](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckeatingdisorders/comments/pzij8m/15_months/)",
