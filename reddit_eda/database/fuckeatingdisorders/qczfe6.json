  "title": "ED recovery without being underweight is hard",
  "selftext": "Hey everyone, sorry if this has already been a topic here but I just have to get my feelings out there today.  I am trying to recover from a restrictive ED without being ever underweight or losing too much weight. It has taken me so much time (1 year of \"recovery\" and therapy and all that shit) to just be able to acknowledge that I in fact have an ED.\n\nIt is so hard to let oneself eat more when every recovery content I see is just about needing to gain weight because of being underweight. It makes eating more and listening to my body almost impossible. I know that if I listened to my extreme mental hunger for a while, it will potentially calm down. But I just cannot let myself even near the possibility that I might gain weight in the process. All the arguments like \"your body needs it\" and \"you need your body to be healthy\" don't really work for me because technically, my body IS healthy. \n\nDoes anyone feel the same and/or know how to deal with that?\n\nThanks and stay safe!",

      "body": "You can't say your body is healthy because it's a certain size the same way you can't say your body _isn't_ healthy because it's a certain size. Health is complicated and multifaceted, and having an eating disorder shows that your mind isn't healthy\u2014and what are our minds but part of our bodies? The way we think certainly affects how we treat our bodies, that's for sure.\n\nI'm in the same boat. I was never underweight, and was typically closer to the higher end of the BMI. Now that I'm in recovery, I'm much heavier. I deal with it by getting on with it; when I'm eating and sleeping and resting properly, I'm better equipped to keep a good head on my shoulders to remind myself that my body is healing and is doing what it needs to. Reading stuff like _Anti-Diet_ and listening to plus-sized podcasters really helps too. I'm sorry you're feeling this way. Believe me: I get it.",

It\u2019s easy to think you\u2019re healthy when you aren\u2019t underweight but the size and shape of bodies are a spectrum and it is impossible to gauge on sight how your ED has affected your health. \n\nIf you have suffered from a restrictive ED recovery will include healing the damage done by that restriction, weight aside. It\u2019s valid and it\u2019s just as real. I wish you the best of luck. There are others out there just like me and you. \u2764\ufe0f",

I had a little lapse recently where I had the ability to weigh myself for the first time in 3 months and it turns out my weight has for now stabilized a kilo or 2 above my lowest \u2014 which was also a \u201chealthy\u201d BMI. So that + other bad events in my life have me slipping back into fear of weight gain, thoughts about maintaining this specific weight, restricting, yada yada. \n\nWhat\u2019s keeping me going is the physical proof that I may have been a \u201chealthy\u201d weight, but I was still sick\u2014 I lost so much hair, my resting heart rate was ridiculously low, I was the most rude and manipulative bitch on the planet to everyone I loved. Those other two are fixed, but only now can I see any regrowth in my hair, and I\u2019m slowly feeling ok with the fact that I may at some point in recovery have a larger body than i ever have\u2014 but it\u2019s ok because my hair will have all the nutrients to get thick and curly again :) the only way out is through. wishing you the best!",

The fact that even though my BMI is healthy this ED has stolen my personality (literally have no personality anymore and I\u2019m boring as f to be around), damaged my heart, consumed my mind, and hurt my husband.

I developed an eating disorder trying to \"rectify\" being overweight. I ended up gaining more weight. I had to feed the mental hunger for a while and I've stayed the same weight the entire time. I feel like that never made sense because I was eating so much food but it happened. You don't know what will happen with your weight and it is so difficult to accept your body will change in ways you don't want it to. I'm struggling so much too but I get your struggles I guess.",

Also, it is a lot about trusting my own feelings and trusting that what my body is telling me IS in fact serious, no matter what some charts or some IG accounts say.\n\nWe just have to remind ourselves constantly that we **DESERVE** recovery no matter what it entails - if that is gaining more weight, that that's what's healthy for our bodies!\n\nPlease keep writing your stories and thoughts, I really do think it helps to hear them and to know that this is not something uncommon.\n\nHave a great day and always be kind to yourselves ;)",

Then, they'd encourage weight gain and say things about how thigh gaps aren't important (whilst still looking very thin, unfortunately it makes me question if they are really in recovery). \n\nI don't know, it just makes me feel like I can't gain weight or eat more if I never got as skinny as they did (never got a thigh gap, never restricted to the x amount of calories they ate, never got to x amount of steps or worked out for x amount of time for x amount of days). \n\nIt's hard to get past these thoughts, but it's most helpful when I find other accounts that are actually encouraging. The bottom line is that these numbers don't mean shit. Eating disorders look different for people but recovery is relatively the same. You deserve to eat and you deserve to do it unconditionally because your body and your mind needs it. It's not something you have to earn, it's something you SHOULD have.",
