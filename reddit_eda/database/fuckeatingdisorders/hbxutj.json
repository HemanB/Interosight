I've dealt with it myself.\n\nIt comes from a lack of deep understanding on the topic. It can be incredibly frustrating and dangerous and the ones saying it don't realise this. It's particularly infuriating hearing from people that doctors and psychologists (etc) have said similiar things. You can look any which way and be very sick and need help. There's still so much change that needs to happen when it comes to how eating disorders are addressed and understood. \n\nHave you spoken to anyone about what you're going through? I hope there's someone you feel safe to confide in. It's a very painful thing to deal with alone. Glad you reached out here. Sending you warmth.",
