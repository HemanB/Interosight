Skipping meals or 'running on empty' puts stress on the body and will increase obsessive thoughts and anxiety levels. Are there any activities you like doing that can help as a distraction and calm you, also? Going for a walk helps lot... Harder to think about food when you're walking... :-). It is an hour by hour journey that can feel easier with time. Feel better soon ...",
