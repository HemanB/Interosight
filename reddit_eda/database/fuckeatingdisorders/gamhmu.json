  "title": "Today my husband surprised us with kebabs and shawarmas and I enjoyed it so much that I could cry. I didn\u2019t feel like a piece of shit for eating for once and I haven\u2019t felt this way in a long time.",
  "selftext": "In self recovery for almost a month and a half and have gained some much needed weight and sanity.\n\nMy husband brought home kebab and shawarma combos with hummus and pita bread. I actually suggested it because it\u2019s a newish restaurant and is just down the street. Of course I was anxious AS FUCK but needed to challenge my ED. I kept looking at the menu for low calorie options for what seemed like a decade, but I just chose what was the most popular which was the shawarma combo. I was smiling so hard because it was so good and eating it while watching Netflix was such a nice time. We haven\u2019t had takeout in so long because I usually cook and takeout scared tf out of me. Everytime I would have to eat food at a restaurant or wasn\u2019t made by me I\u2019d always think, \u201cI\u2019m such a pig, ugh, I\u2019ll restrict tomorrow\u201d while never enjoying the food even though it tasted good.\n\nIt\u2019s so small but such an eye opener for me to realize how much my mindset has changed? Maybe because I\u2019m not at a severely underweight BMI anymore and my body knows it gets food? Idk how to explain it but I almost seemed angry when my husband brought food home. I\u2019d binge on it, hate myself while I\u2019m eating, not even enjoy the food, would secretly get super mad if my husband wanted some of my food? So fucking weird. \n\nI\u2019m excited to keep this up, try to have takeout maybe once or twice a week at the most, and just enjoy food and each other\u2019s company.",

      "body": "Honestly I think just gaining weight (gained about 7-8 lbs but not severely UW anymore) and the feelings kind of came naturally. It\u2019s like my brain isn\u2019t on famine mode anymore and doesn\u2019t make me have this shit personality around food and people when food is around. I don\u2019t think I would ever be able to enjoy food being severely UW no matter what I tried.\n\nI also think doing it more often so it doesn\u2019t have much power over you will help a ton. Like I can\u2019t just get takeout once every couple of months. I need to expose myself to it weekly so it\u2019ll just be a whatever thing that tastes good. Not right now where it gave me so much anxiety to look at the menu, heart racing when my husband brought it home, etc. the goal is to be able to just be like ok I feel like getting takeout, get takeout, done. I believe that if food won\u2019t have too much power on us like that then it\u2019ll be more enjoyable. But it takes challenges to do so.\n\nI\u2019ve been binge watching Megsy recovery\u2019s videos and hers have been the most helpful and real to me when it comes to anorexia recovery. She says, \u201cyou\u2019ll feel shit, but do it anyway. What\u2019s the alternative? A restricted life with limited experiences.\u201d That and the alternative could be death..",
