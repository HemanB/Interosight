She only wants to have conversations about weight, fat, thinness and food (she can't eat and will be restricting for the next few months). I've told her several times that I can't engage with her because I'm trying to mend my own relationship with food, whilst exercising and being kind. I feel like what she's doing is such a punishment, I don't want to punish my body, I want food to be a joy. (And I want to exercise because my body feels good doing so, not because I'm not allowed to eat otherwise kinda thing).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat's more, I've said to mum that the reason it makes me uncomfy is because much of the issues that aren't being addressed are deep seated issues going back to childhood. She's not ready to process that trauma, but I feel that, until she does, she's going to keep going round in circles with her dieting (as is the pattern with diets, making you feel like a failure). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel bad for her and for thinking like this but when most of the conversations are about how much she'll drop in a week...I can'ttttttttt!",
