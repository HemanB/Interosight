  "selftext": "Just out of curiosity because I was just talking about it and have had like five people set it off in the last month, does anyone else seem to have The Radar for other people who have or had EDs? Its like the Gaydar, basically, except it just makes me anxious and sad instead of happy like the gaydar. Am I weird for it? I don't do it consciously and am never actively looking or anything it just,,,happens? I also feel bad because I don't want to ever assume anything about anyone, but im almost n e v e r wrong when I get a confirmation. And for anyone else with The Radar- how do you deal with it ? Ive been recovered for a year so its not triggering (necessarily, but nothing i'd ever act on fuck that shit) but it does make me worried and sad",
