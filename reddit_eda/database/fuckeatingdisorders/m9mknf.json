  "title": "Ate pastry for breakfast as a big middle finger to my eating disorder",
  "selftext": "For some reason breakfast has been the most difficult meal for me to let go of my food rules. I was always mentally hungry after and I was sick of thinking about lunch for the rest of the morning. \n\nI got a chocolate pastry yesterday, which I would have usually saved for a snack, because it feels safe to have it in the afternoon. But I realllyyy wanted it this morning, and live out my Parisienne fantasy. I ate that pastry this morning guys! It felt so satisfying and enjoyable, and I just wanted to share this with yall \u2764\ufe0f",
