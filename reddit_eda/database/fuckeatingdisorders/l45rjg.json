Nothing on the side. Not even veggies. One single breast.)\n\n...never have I ever been so sure that recovery was right choice. I knew I was obsessive during peak ED but WOWWW",

My best bet,just give in. It will be scary at times,but it speeds up your recovery overall. Don't be afraid to reach out when you struggle. I still do it from time to time when I am close to sliping back into old habits and tell him about it. And he cheers me up and makes me forget my worries I might have had. He a really good person and I am very happy to have him. Best wishes and a good recovery to you!",
