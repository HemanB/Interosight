  "selftext": "I find a lot of solace in reading memoirs, and not just for the stereotypical thinspo bullshit. But I wish there was one that spoke to me.\n\nI wish they weren't all \"some shit happened, so I stopped eating as much, and then I stopped eating more, and then I was really skinni and hospital and some other stuff and then recovery, I'd like to thank my therapist/family/dog for helping me through this difficult time\".  \n\n\nWhy are they all super LW anorexia-based? Where's the \"I hated myself for fucking ever, and developed an ED, and then I lost a lot of weight, and then I gained a lot of weight, and I've been indulging in fucked up behaviours on and off for years and bouncing +/- 40lbs ever since, and weight loss isn't fucking linear, and sometimes I can eat almost nothing for three weeks and only lose 2lbs, and sometimes I can go on holiday and binge my face off non-stop for seven days and only gain 2lbs, because science is apparently broken\". Where's the \"I lost a shitload of weight really fucking fast, but because my BMI was normal/overweight to start with, literally no-one gave a shit or just praised me like it was awesome and not completely fucked up, even though if I'd been a low BMI when I started and done the exact same thing, it would have been a completely different reaction to my weight loss\"? Where's the \"I tried really fucking hard to embrace body positivity/HAES to conquer my demons, I tried intuitive eating but all it got me was consistent weight gain until I freaked out and went back to restricting, I tried to do normal person dieting but my body is a piece of shit so I have to do ED behaviour to lose anything which just keeps me trapped in this cycle\"? Where are the memoirs from the people who have tried so hard, for so long, but remain invisible?  \n\n\nI'm just so tired and I feel so invisible and more and more like my ED is of no concern because I'm not underweight.",

As someone who started morbidly obese and is currently trying to semi-recover while still having a technically overweight BMI, I find it hard to find any stories that resonate, or any in a similar situation to them. I\u2019m trying to find stories about people trying to recover while still not having a normal/underweight BMI, but I\u2019m struggling :( I just want to recover once I am a normal BMI but at the same time I know I\u2019m doing stupid and dangerous stuff to get there, and I am dealing with a treatment team so don\u2019t have too much of a choice not to try recovery right now lmao. \n\nAlso I lost all my weight from severe restricting only for like 7 months, then I suddenly started bingeing and purging and am still doing that while still trying to restrict. I feel like I\u2019m all over the place and it sucks lmao. I just want to read about someone with a similar story who is now doing well",

I feel like I'm doing everyone else an injustice by invalidating myself for encouraging this stigma. I'm so afraid that when I recover people will tell me \"but you weren't anorexic skinny\" or \"you weren't that bad, right?\". Of course there are other factors holding me back, but hopefully I can put this behind me, and get better.\n\nAlso don't they know that it's triggering when they show pictures and explicitly state their lowest BMIs? Trigger warnings aren't gonna stop people lol.",
