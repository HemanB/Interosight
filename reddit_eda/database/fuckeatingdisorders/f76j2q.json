  "selftext": "It only took me this fucking long to realize how stupid eating disorders are lmao\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be so nice? To be able to wrap your fingers around your arms, to not worry about your thighs chafing when you walk. \n\nIt would definitely make you a kinder and cooler and smarter and healthier person, and it would definitely not possibly cost you your fucking life. \n\nIsn\u2019t spending time on pro-ana websites with the username \u201cLittleAnaButterflyThinLittleUwUSmallBonesSpineDelicateDainty\u201c, or whatever the fuck, picking up tips on how to slowly but surely kill yourself so much more productive than spending time with loved ones? Or drawing, or painting, or singing, or dancing, or cooking, or moving TF on with your life? \n\nIsn\u2019t it so fun when you spend hours picking apart what\u2019s wrong with you, what you shouldn\u2019t have eaten today, how many more pounds you should lose, how disgusting and filthy you are for eating that slice of pizza yesterday, how you\u2019re totally gonna make up for it today? Not feeling like you\u2019ve destroyed yourself \u201cenough\u201d and idolizing girls on feeding tubes who are close to death? \n\nIsn\u2019t it so fucking amazing when you shut out all your loved ones because you simply don\u2019t have the energy to care anymore, you feel you\u2019re too ugly to be looked at, you\u2019re scared they may make you eat. And when you do talk to them, they only express concern for your health or anger at how you\u2019ve been acting lately. But who cares. It doesn\u2019t matter. \n\nIt\u2019s made you happier, it\u2019s filled the emotional void, it\u2019s fulfilled all its promises, right?",
