  "selftext": "okay this sounds so mundane but it made me think\u2026 yesterday i was at a grocery store with my dad and it\u2019s one of those stores that has foods from all over the world (with a particular focus on europe and asia but also good amounts of african and south american stuff) and they had this iced tea or some other kind of beverage that was low in calories and it said \u201cLOW ENERGY\u201d in big letters on the can and honestly that made me kind of think for a second. iced tea being low in calories is whatever because you know tea is just leaf water but when it comes to actual food the idea of something that\u2019s LOW ENERGY being healthier is so insane. even ignoring that calorie counts are slightly imprecise anyways it\u2019s crazy how like diet culture and stuff has twisted \u201cenergy\u201d into a bad thing to the point where my attempting to recover from anorexia ass is still kind of fretting over calories as if my body doesn\u2019t need energy to function. \n\ni assume most people reading this who are on this sub are either trying to recover or have recovered from an eating disorder and if you\u2019re in that situation than your body almost certainly needs as much energy as it can possibly get.",
