And IMHO, as having had an eating disorder, I think that people in recovery who are fixated on the number of their weight, they're not actually in recovery and very susceptible at falling back into their eating disorder habits if they're not careful of the triggers.\n\nWeight is subjective, and even those charts that compare height against weight and whether you're underweight, ideal weight or overweight, that's based on a national average and doesn't take into consideration many factors such as muscle or bone mass, which can be a factor in weighing more.",
