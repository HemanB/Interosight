From my understanding, it's because they 1) don't obsess over macros and calories, and 2) haven't fucked up their hunger cues enough to worry about overeating- when your endocrine system is still functional, you actually have the capacity to tell the difference between hungry and full, who knew? It's as simple as eating what you want, when you want, and in the quantity you want. A \"regular\" person doesn't need to have a set amount of food/calories they eat in a day. \n\nIt also probably helps that non-ED people pretty much never have strange binge cravings. The urge to eat 1839499 chocolate bars in a single sitting is a binge-cycle specific phenomenon, I'm afraid lol",

I'm basically trying to find how much portion i have to eat to stop thinking about food, to make my body satisfied. But first I had to under that the labeled portion size isn't \"my portion size\" and non-disordered people eat different amount of portions. So every day i try to increase the portions of a selected food -im trying slowly to don't be overwhelmed by it-. After eating i try to rationalize my feelings, like asking \"do i still thinking about food? Or do I want to have some more\". I also try to relate te amount I'm having that moment with the last meal. Basically asking to myself \"did i eat enough last meal\"/\"am i eating that much bc I didn't eat enough last meal or bc i really like this food?\" The period of time I restricted a food is also something i try to think about bc it def impact in how much of some foods you're eating on recovery. Also the lack of nutrients sometimes appears as our body craving for some random thinks, like I'm low-key obsessed with milk rn, not because I like milk that much -i Don't- but bc my body is lacking in protein. \nThe true, to do it is hard and overwhelming but slowly I'm understanding how much I need to eat for each kind of food and also I'm getting conscious about being normal a person's appetite changing from day to day.",

For example: people don't eat the same portion every day, people don't eat the same thing every day, etc. These nuances don't automatically invalidate my point that people's behaviors are largely shaped by developmental habits they learned in their childhood. There are a plethora of studies that support it. For example, studies where the mom didn't do home cooked meals for the kids, the kids are more likely to grow up eating packaged foods as adults and feeding their kids packaged foods rather than making home cooked meals. Of course these habits can be changed with effort, no one is saying they can't be changed. Habits aren't static.",

My sister sometimes eats a huge muffin in the morning, sometimes banana with peanut butter, sometimes just yogurt. It's so variable you can't just say 'oh someone who ate 1 piece of bread in the morning growing up will feel sick if they eat more than 1 piece ever'. That's just not true.",

Growing up I ate sugary cereal every morning, do I do that now? No. Because eating habits change as you grow. Portion sizes as children are vastly different to ones when you are an adult for several reasons - different energy needs, availability of food, cost, taste preferences, etc. I know lots of people who used to eat breakfast as kids and now don't, and vice versa. It's dumb AF to say that because you ate a certain way growing up, you're stuck with those habits forever/it's hard to change them. And I wasn't talking about people who gain 10 lbs a year \"stuffing\" their face every morning so I don't know why you're saying that, it's not apples to oranges.",
