  "title": "in perpetual quasi-recovery, because being thin is the only thing i have left that makes me worthy of respect",
  "selftext": "or at least it\u2019s how i feel. i\u2019m jobless,  (nearly) friendless, hobby-less, and joyless. sometime i wonder what the point is of continuing to persevere for a better future, when i am consistently let down and catapulted back to square one, and seemingly punished for even trying to better myself.\n\nhappiness has failed to last for me, and only serves as a dopey chemical reaction in my brain that my body has evolved to emit, to distract myself from the fact that the past few years of my life has been nothing but downward spiral. and despite any misplaced hope or delusion, i always end up back at square one.\n\nso i wonder what the point of full, uninhibited recovery is anymore, when being Below Average BMI (tm) is the only thing i have left.\n\ni hate everything about diet culture, ED culture, Instagram \u201crecovery\u201d culture, you name it. i reject the superficial, and the strident insistence by society that being thin is the crux of being stylish, and the default state of being a protagonist in one\u2019s own life. and the insistence (especially within alternative/artsy subcultures) of staying thin and waif-like, while ardently denying any desire to remain as such, as acknowledging disordered habits would burst the ~natural skinny~ aesthetic bubble. and many of them claim to be body positive as well, so it\u2019s an even deeper hole of cognitive dissonance that they embody (people online, people i have known in my life, etc)\n\nand i just.. detest the hypocrisy of it.\n\nbut i am not brave enough. so i will continue to restrict to compensate for bingeing. and to compensate for the fact that i feel inferior, and just want to hold onto the one last remaining thing that elevates me somewhat.\n\nsomeday, though, i hope to be truly confident in myself, and find my own identity in terms of the things that actually matter. separate from thinness, and from my eating disorder.\n\nbut i\u2019m not there yet.\n\n(thank you to anyone who actually reads this. i relapsed this weekend, after a couple months of progress, and just need to talk to someone who understands the dark place i\u2019m in.)",

I've had a couple of boyfriends who I rely on hard for friendship and companionship. I've had a few girl friends, but nothing lasting. No close girl friends or a group of girls since mine ghosted me 5.5 years ago... it's rough.\n\nI've been depressed and I've had OCD since I'm a young teen and I'm 24 now. I don't really know life any differently. I don't do much besides go out shopping sometimes and go to doctor's appointments and go hang out with my boyfriend sometimes. I'm having problems with him and if I lose him, I pretty much have no one again.\n\nI also feel hobbyless sometimes. I spend an enormous amount of time online or on my phone on instagram(which is basically online). I used to have more interests I guess, but I'm not really talented at anything. I find it hard to commit to anything new.\n\nI haven't had a job since the end of November. I quit cause the place was a shit show and yeah eventually the place closed a month later... I've been too anxious and depressed.\n\nMy cats dying... I'm crying a lot. I've been binging and purging more after I was \"recovered\" for 9 months in October. I don't talk to anyone about it really. Only my boyfriend knows I relapsed.\n\nIf you wanna talk, let me know.",
