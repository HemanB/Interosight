  "selftext": "And these meals actually looked more like meals than my usual. I usually eat 3 meals a day with lots of snacks, but these meals are often very low calorie/restrictive. The other day I posted about still losing weight despite feeling like I eat a lot and I was advised to increase certain calorie dense foods.\n\nSo for the last two days I\u2019ve had *toast* with my usual omelette and fruit for breakfast, and instead of a plate of veggies, fruit, jerky and dip for lunch I made an eggplant wrap with an *actual tortilla* and a cup of frozen mango. I\u2019ve also snacked on some dried fruit and had a chocolate that my grandma sent which I also never would have done. Oh! And I took a bite of the pot pie filling my mother made which I know for a fact was absolutely laden with butter, and in the past I would have vehemently refused to do so (or lied about having done it). \n\nDo I feel good? No, I\u2019ve actually been pretty nauseous all day, probably because my body isn\u2019t that used to \u201ccarbs\u201d (I hate referring to wheat products are carbs because hello, fruit and veg are also carbs and carbs aren\u2019t inherently bad etc etc) since I\u2019ve restricted them for quite some time. And of course my ED is telling me that I should feel horribly guilty for eating like this and that I\u2019ll be morbidly obese come morning. But I know this is what I need to do. I am dangerous close to a two digit weight and that isn\u2019t healthy for me. Hoping I can stick with this \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb",
