  "selftext": "Everyone tells me how good I look now. How proud they are of me. I hate it and it\u2019s killing me inside.\n\nThey ask how I lost the weight, and I say I just started eating less, which isn\u2019t a complete lie. But they don\u2019t know I\u2019m starving myself.\n\nI\u2019ve had one of the worst months ED-wise as I\u2019ve been binging most of the days and I\u2019ve been maintaining my weight and probably gaining too. I want to lose so much more but I can\u2019t and I feel so invalidated about it.\n\nI\u2019m exhausted at this point. I just want to eat like a normal person. I\u2019m sick of only being able to starve or eat until I\u2019m crying from being so full. I have no idea how to eat a normal amount. A small part of me wants to maintain my current weight and try to recover, but I literally only know gaining and losing weight. Not once in my life did I ever maintain my weight. \n\nI\u2019m scared that if I let myself eat, I\u2019ll never stop and fall back into my old eating habits pre-ED. I\u2019m scared that I\u2019m going to get fat again. I used to feel like a burden on other people just being in their presence when I was overweight. I still feel an immense amount of self hatred, but at least I can leave my house without feeling like everyone wants me to die. I\u2019m scared that my friends will judge me but will be too nice to say anything. I\u2019m scared that my mom will make comments on me eating too much again.\n\nI\u2019m scared of letting go of this awful disorder and I have no idea what to do.\n\nEdit: [I was not at all expecting this to happen, but I\u2019m getting help I think??](https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/e4a9ev/im_getting_help/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)",

(They're not so well either.)\n\n*ALL* my self worth was tied into the scale and the dress size. The fact that I became an alcoholic to deal with the mess was seen as a solution for weight gain.  \n\nIt took me decades of suffering to finally decide to recover, no matter what. \n\nThat I needed to be happy with myself and to break out of the denial that kept me thinking that all I needed was to be the next size down and *then* everything would work out fine. \n\nI realised last year that that size doesn't exist for me. That if I was happy with myself I would be happy. I'm still waiting for my body to calm down, and I am proper fat again. My big triumph here is that I stopped feeling suicidal when I ate. That shit is worth gold to me. \n\nI still have a long way to go, but I am committed to living a recovered life. ED can go suck a [perjorative].",
