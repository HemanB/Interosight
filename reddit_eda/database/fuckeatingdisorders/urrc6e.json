Some of their content has helped me and I'm very thankful for it. But like seriously, almost ALL of the ED recovery content, IE content, anything anti-diet related is amazingly white. Like we are not all going to recover into these conventionally attractive thin white bodies.... yet it's the only thing that ED-related content seems to show. Not to mention I feel like soooooooo many POC have undiagnosed EDs. It's crazy. And yet nothing is really reaching those people. But yeah we're all here fighting through it anyway!",

I don't think it helps anybody - even those few people who fit that body type, likely only find it reinforces their disordered thoughts. It's so unnecessary.
