  "selftext": "I used to be so scared to drink anything but black coffee. I didn't want to add sugar, syrups, or milk because it was just extra calories. Since I've been in recovery, my espresso machine is experiencing a whole new world of specialty lattes. Made an eggnog latte today with homemade eggnog (something I never drank while I was struggling) and it was delicious. Apple spice latte? Sure. Einsp\u00e4nner? Delicious.\n\nI don't even care anymore. My at-home coffee shop is decked out with stuff I used to be scared of.",

I haven't tried adding extra spices or flavors, but the apple spice latte sounds amazing! Going to have to try that.",
