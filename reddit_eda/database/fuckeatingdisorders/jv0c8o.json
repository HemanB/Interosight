  "selftext": "There\u2019s a new documentary about Lene Marie Fossen, a photographer who died from anorexia. It\u2019s called Selvportrett and it has English subtitles. Here is the link to the online screening, tickets are available for purchase from November 11th to 19th. https://www.lenemariefossen.com/the-documentary Content warning: it contains some graphic images. I was impressed by this documentary. It\u2019s very sad, but it contains a lot more insight than most depictions of eating disorders in the media that I\u2019ve seen.",
