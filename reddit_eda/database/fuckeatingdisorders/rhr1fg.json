  "selftext": "That this isn\u2019t a dieting sub, so do not recommend dieting/cutting out food groups/restricting calories or weight loss here. Dieting/weight loss is *not* compatible with recovery. Even if you\u2019re overweight, even if you\u2019re a \u201cnormal\u201d weight, and so on.\n\nIf that\u2019s what you\u2019re into, fine, you do you, but this is not the place to do it. Members are already struggling to listen to their bodies and nourish themselves, they don\u2019t need y\u2019all telling them that they should be eating less or differently or changing their body. Recovery requires you to eat according to your body\u2019s hunger cues\u2014yes, even BED and bulimia\u2014and telling people to practice restraint  (such as \u201cdon\u2019t keep binge food in the house!\u201d) is damaging at best and just reinforces the concept that food is the reason we struggle so much, that it should be avoided. \n\nThanks for coming to my December TED talk!",

      "body": "I entirely disagree. It borders both fatphobia and pro-ana/mia content which break the rules and it\u2019s my job as a mod to make sure members feel safe here. The issue with \u201close weight\u201d on an ED sub is as follows:\n\n1. It implies that being overweight means you cannot be energy deficient and that\u2019s entirely not true.\n\n2. It\u2019s extremely dismissive of overweight people with EDs who need to be able to eat freely, and yes, even very likely gain weight, in order to recover. Only 6% of restrictive ED sufferers are underweight. If your ED has caused you to gain past your set point, restriction isn\u2019t going to fix that; in fact, it\u2019s going to make it exceptionally worse and lead to other negative health consequences. Plus, restricting actually *reinforces* binge urges, hense why a lot of BED treatments are beginning to be tailored around an intuitive eating and HAES friendly approach. I do agree with what you said about unintentional weight loss, i should have clarified when I said *intentional* weight loss isn\u2019t compatible with recovery. And it\u2019s not. If you fix your relationship with food and you naturally lose weight, as some people do, then this doesn\u2019t apply to you. This is something that is frequently talked about in this sub so I didn\u2019t think it needed clarification. My bad.\n\n3. If you are struggling with hormonal issues (as I have myself), restriction doesn\u2019t fix them. Now you just weigh less with hormonal issues. And as someone who\u2019s family struggles with insulin resistance and diabetes (and therefore I myself am at a higher risk for), losing weight doesn\u2019t magically fix these things and there\u2019s really no scientific basis that universally claims it does. In fact, exercise, and treatments that don\u2019t fixate on weight as a whole, has been documented to manage these things a lot more effectively. Theres a reason more than 90% of all diets fail, and why virtually everyone who loses will gain more weight back than they initially lost.\n\n4. Even *if* intentional weight loss and restriction worked, EDs are extremely competitive disorders. You don\u2019t know who you\u2019re encouraging weight loss or food restriction to, or how damaging it can be to others reading the posts/comments and feeling invalidated in their disorder, like they aren\u2019t good at having an ED and need to try harder (the way many atypical ED sufferers feel).\n\nI understand what you are trying to say, and your struggles are valid, but these are pretty specific instances that you are describing; the whataboutism you\u2019re playing is irrelevant because you\u2019re discussing an entirely different scenario to discredit my initial claim that encouraging dieting and intentional weight loss *while in ED recovery* is not okay. Yes, everyone\u2019s recovery is different, but you should be focusing on nutritional rehabilitation (again, even if you have BED or bulimia) and healing your relationship with food and your body. Some people will end up fat and that\u2019s entirely okay and is not synonymous to being unhealthy either (not to mention the science to prove otherwise just isn\u2019t there). If you naturally lose weight in the process, sure. But I think it\u2019s weird to seek out faults in my post, with nothing but hypotheticals and anecdotes, because you feel defensive.",
