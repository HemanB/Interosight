  "selftext": "So to start this off I understand the \"one meal a day\" diet is a real thing, its still a dumbass diet, my girl friend is 5'8, 121lbs, shes only eating one meal a day and at most that one meal is probably only 1200 calories, she can eat but she sure as hell cant eat 1500 calorie like she supposed to she also works out so that 1200 calories turns into 1000, she wants a flat stomach, and i get that do i love her lonjas? (love handles) absolutely, do i love her meat on her body? yes i love her body but i understand why she wants it, its her body she can have a flat stomach but the problem is she wants to starve herself to do it, I relate to her a lot since i used to do the same thing, i starved myself for months and nothing ever came out of it, i only started loosing weight when i actual ate the right amount of calories (290lbs- 255lbs), I told her that but she isnt listening, i fear that this \"only one week\" thing will turn into a habit and end up hurting her, last thing i want is to see her hurt, Ive been trying to convince her and she said \"fine\" but i dont belive them, I need help on how to help her see her body as amazing, because it is shes stunning, I also need help on how to talk to her and get it through her head so she will listen. thank you guys!",

      "body": "Let her known that a study done on adults that followed the OMAD diet showed that they eventually: 1. Lost touch of their fullness/satiety cues, 2. Developed extreme hunger, 3. Developed binging habits, 4. Developed a preoccupation with food that they hadn't experienced previously.\n\nTrying to most of  your calories in a short time window also puts your digestive track under severe distress. The way you'll spike your blood sugar, hormones, etc? Your body can't handle it longterm. \n\nOn the other hand, under-eating chronically on top of the stress of fasting will raise your cortisol levels sky high. The body will start to breakdown muscle and bone, and will start shutting down hormonal processes in an attempt to lower its metabolism and thus consume less energy. This means that your girlfriend's body will start consuming itself. She'll be more prone to getting injuried, and her injuries will take a long time to heal due to a combination of stress and lack of materials available for repair.\n\nYou should tell her this, but remember, wanting to be thin is only a layer of an ED. Me parece super encantador que te gusten las \"lonjas\" de tu novia, pero creo que es m\u00e1s prudente no mencionarlo. Parte de lo que desencadena un desorden alimenticio es el deseo de mejorar, de controlar algo, de cambiar algo de forma visible. S\u00e9 que suena superficial, pero el descontento es mucho m\u00e1s profundo... Es lo que hace dif\u00edcil parar, incluso cuando ya no nos vemos ni nos sentimos bien. Si hablas con ella, deber\u00edas intentar encaminar la conversaci\u00f3n por ese lado. \u00bfEn verdad se va a sentir mejor cuando pierda el peso? \u00bfCu\u00e1l es el af\u00e1n? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 correr, por qu\u00e9 hacerlo maltrat\u00e1ndose? \u00bfNo ser\u00eda mejor trabajar en construir mejores h\u00e1bitos que pueda mantener a lo largo de su vida?

      "body": "Ugh this is so hard, OP and you are absolutely right to be concerned. Isn't it amazing that having even a small brush with our own ED can really illuminate how widespread these disturbing behaviors are in our cultures? \n\nIt sounds like you've given your girlfriend some very sound advice, and lots of love (good on you!) and you did everything right, but she's not ready to listen. Sometimes that's the painful thing about eating disorders, people see \"positive\" results (i.e. they start losing weight) and there is just no convincing them that what they're doing is unhealthy because they see weight loss, which they (falsely) equate to health. But as you know, these \"temporary\" behaviors do become habits and we can spiral into some very medically destructive behavior without realizing how much damage we are doing until its way out of control. \n\nIf she said she's only doing it for \"one week\", even though we both know what's likely to happen, just sit her down and say, \"Look, I know you feel like I'm not being supportive but I'm just really worried about your health because I know, because of what I experienced, that you're not eating enough to support your body and feel good. If this is really just for one week, then I can live with that. But in 7 days we need to sit down and make sure we have a plan to get you back on an eating schedule that is metabolically sustainable and I'd like to see you eating more than one meal a day so I know that you're taking care of yourself.\" And then once that seven days is over, I would re-present her with that good scientific information you and I both know about chronic restriction and eating disorders. [This is a great place to start](https://eating-disorders.org.uk/information/the-effects-of-under-eating/), it has good scientifically supported information about the myriad effects of chronic restriction that is not shaming about dieting (although I share your feelings about almost every \"diet\" being a bunch of BS).",

I, unfortunately, had to wait until I was over 18 to get help, since I could admit myself. I wish someone had tried to stick up for me before things were dire. She will resist with all her power and say things that frankly will not make any sense to you. That is the disease. It is a parasite in our minds that tells us engaging in unhealthy eating rituals is \u201cwinning.\u201d It\u2019s not. We\u2019re killing ourselves. There is the chance that her parents will completely disregard the problem. She is worth it to try, I promise. If other friends aren\u2019t part of this already, I don\u2019t suggest bringing them in; however, if more people are concerned, it might help her parents to be more receptive if multiple people come to them.

          "body": "First off, as someone with an active eating disorder, I admire you for your courage in writing this post. Eating disorders are scary and so hard to understand. It shows how loving and caring you are, especially at such a young age. My parents are not Mexican, but do not understand the severity of ED. I, unfortunately, had to wait until I was over 18 to get help, since I could admit myself. I wish someone had tried to stick up for me before things were dire. She will resist with all her power and say things that frankly will not make any sense to you. That is the disease. It is a parasite in our minds that tells us engaging in unhealthy eating rituals is \u201cwinning.\u201d It\u2019s not. We\u2019re killing ourselves. There is the chance that her parents will completely disregard the problem. She is worth it to try, I promise. If other friends aren\u2019t part of this already, I don\u2019t suggest bringing them in; however, if more people are concerned, it might help her parents to be more receptive if multiple people come to them. Just my two cents. There is no right way to go about this.",
