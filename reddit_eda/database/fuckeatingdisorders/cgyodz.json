  "selftext": "Went to Walmart to get some groceries. None of my clothes fit me. Figured I\u2019d try a few dresses on since it\u2019s summer. They where all too small and fit weird, made my stomach look horrible. I just stared at myself in the mirror. I looked so big. I started breathing heavy. Managed to hold most of it in until I got to the car where I had a full blown panic attack. After settling down I drove home in tears.\n\nBinge eating disorder sucks and I am so tired of hating myself. I\u2019m getting married in September and my mom and sister are all over me about my weight. This is the largest I\u2019ve ever been and I don\u2019t know how to stop.\n\nI\u2019d give anything to be normal, have normal coping mechanisms. My brain can suck it for always sabotaging me.",

Why are you thinking like this? What has brought it on? Try to start recognising your behaviours so you can identify patterns and diffuse their intensity.\n\nNext stage is to try to rediscover yourself beyond your ED. What are you good at?

The time recovery takes is not something important, as long as you keep holding on during that path. Putting a final date in your head to get to a goal is just a way of putting more stress in an anxious situation. \n\nYour marriage will be wonderful, you do not need to lose weight for September. It\u2019s going to be okay. You have the right to focus on yourself, and take your own time to recover. Nobody has the right to say otherwise. Not even your family.\n\nTake care !",

I went out one day with my boyfriend to get a dress for a party. I must have tried on 15 dresses and absolutely nothing fit. I was so fed up and sad I just left the dressing room and tried desperately not to cry in public or make a scene.   \nAnytime i try clothing on it leads to some really frustrating anxiety and often a panic attack.  \nYou are not alone",
