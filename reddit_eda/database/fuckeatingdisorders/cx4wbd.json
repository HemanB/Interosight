  "selftext": "I went to Panera for lunch to pick up a salad and the lady told me that I had a free pastry that was going to expire soon. So I did what I never do (usually I just let those rewards expire) and picked up one a candy cookie. I was really, really not expecting to eat it. As I drove home I told myself I'd leave it on the counter for someone else to eat. After I finished my salad I thought I should let myself at least have a bite and when I thought it tasted delicious and found myself wanting the rest of it I just went for it at ate it :)\n\nAccording to Google the cookie has 420 calories in it and that's how much/more than I used to eat in a day. Wild. I'm going to have to go out to dinner tonight as well... but I actually feel okay? Which is weird. I feel a little guilt for eating it when I wasn't hungry after my salad but I think this is a good sign that I'm stepping in the right direction.\n\nI'm counting this as a victory for the day.",
