  "selftext": "Today I\u2019m not going to restrict what I eat, I\u2019m going to enjoy my meal with my family. No skipping on a dish I like just because I\u2019m scared to eat it. I\u2019m going to eat because I\u2019ll be hungry and I\u2019m going to eat until I\u2019m satisfied/full. Just need to remind myself that food is NOT the enemy, my eating disorder mindset is.",
