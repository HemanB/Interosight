  "selftext": "i don't know if this is appropriate here or if i'm being super sensitive because i'm in recovery but the body shaming going around over her NORMAL & HEALTHY body is so so SO frustrating & making me extremely angry. there are millions of teen girls looking up to her & to see her being body shamed across all platforms is probably so damaging to their body image/self esteem. social media is already toxic as hell & villainizes any body that isn't a triple zero or perfectly proportioned & it's disgusting. there is absolutely no excuse for this behavior & it is so fucking easy to shut ur mouth & not comment on something that doesn't concern u ESPECIALLY other peoples bodies. it's hard enough recovering in a society where being rail thin is worshipped but it's even worse seeing how warped some peoples perceptions of how normal bodies look is. sorry for the rant but i truly have not been this angry over something in a while.",

So Billie is a celebrity known by lots of people, there are going to be some assholes who insult her. This happens to all celebrities as famous as her. It's still wrong. It just happens a lot to all celebrities and a lot of politicians. Just because what she did wasn't as atrocious as what a fan did doesn't make it okay for either of them. I think we should have higher standards for celebrities and not justify racism, homophobia, and sexism as being okay due to their age. \n\n\nBillie on the other hand is and was at the time of the video, a role model for lots of young girls. As a celebrity on an interview, I think that sort of message is unnactable. Because many people will hear it and might accept it or justify it because it came from *Billie Eilish*.\n\n\nThe fact these comments are normal for people of her age is worrying because it shows how normalised this attitude is in society.\n\n\nHad a 17 year old male celebrity said similar sexist comments about women, for example about girls with lose pussies having a big body count, I think people's reactions would have been a lot different. I think since we can't go 'boys will be hoys' anymore and excuse misogynistic behaviour we need to hold girls up to that standard.\n\n\nI just think it's such a shame how sexism towards males gets justified as normal. I just think she should have issued an apology and said her behaviour was wrong. I personally think Billie is hypocritical and seeing this sexist double standard makes me roll my eyes.",

Without excusing it, that is just the sort of behavior Id expect from someone her age and level of fame. That is to say that it is one thing for her to mock this nebulous \u201cugly/small dick dude that managed to get a cute girl\u201d than some grown man or woman specifically and publicly shaming a certain person for not meeting their physical standards of beauty. I could be wrong and this could be morally inconsistent so someone. \n\nEdit: for clarity",
