Until very recently, manufactured \"slim thick\" physiques, boob and butt implants and lip fillers, were seen as a sort of status symbol. Now these surgeries are more common - and thus more accessible - rich people are inclined to switch to something else to set them apart from \"inferior\" ordinary folks. Let's not forget that, in the West, people living in poor communities are more likely to be overweight.",

My marriage is a mess and I'm miserable there, so I'm figuring out all the practicalities of getting out without being too broke to put the heating on. I know a lot of people with a lot of varied joys and problems. There are so many priorities competing for my attention that fashion doesn't register any longer, and the people around me have very different goals and values to my peer group at 16 or 20, so my social circle doesn't reinforce this stuff either.\n\nYou can hack this a bit by thinking about your own values that have nothing to do with appearance, underneath the eating disorder. Like what kind of person you are/want to be, what you love in others. Kindness, psychological flexibility, intelligence, generosity, whatever. That can be ammunition when the media tell you who to be - would going along with this take me closer to or further from my values? I did this during daypatient (it's an Acceptance Commitment Therapy exercise) fifteen years ago and it stuck with me.",
