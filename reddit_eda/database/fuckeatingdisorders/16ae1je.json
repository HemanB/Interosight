  "selftext": "To the point where most people don\u2019t even realise they have some kind of that disorder. \n\nThe definition of an ED is \"a mental disorder defined by abnormal eating behaviors that negatively affect a person's physical or mental health.\"\nWhich basically implies that to have an eating disorder you need to let food control your life and everyday activities in some capacity. \n\nWhile I\u2019m in recovery I\u2019ve really opened my eyes in the enormous amount of dietary comments and thoughts a regular person you will meet has. Most of my friends will always make a comment about \u201cpunishing themselves by eating less next week\u201d because we just ate what society considers as \u201cunhealthy\u201d. A childhood friend of mine started going to the gym a year ago and completely changed, he now won\u2019t eat chocolate or \u201cjunk food\u201d unless it\u2019s dark chocolate because he considers it more \u201chealthy\u201d, he is at the gym 7 days a week and becomes depressed when he can\u2019t go, constantly body checks his gains and just last week made a comment about how \u201che would be extremely fat by eating this if he didn\u2019t go to the gym frequently\u201d which is just plainly wrong, right?\n\nMy aunt came by some days ago and didn\u2019t want to have a bite of the dessert my mother prepared because \u201cit\u2019s gonna make her fat\u201d and \u201cshe\u2019s been slacking off this past week\u201d\n\nHow are comments like that NOT considered  disordered? How are these same people talking to me about my ED (which I now admit that I have) but can\u2019t see the reality of their own minds? \n\nHow can they even question how I developed a thing like that when those comments are what I constantly hear since a baby. Literally since I was born, the first thing you comment about a baby is their appearance \u201coh how beautiful she is!\u201d.\n\nI don\u2019t think I should say this but battling this disorder for a year made me appreciate food so much more, and am actually glad that I see now the real consequences of a dietary culture, I just will NEVER make comments like that ever again, I will never see food as something bad, I will enjoy a fruit and a cookie the same exact way. Because it\u2019s just not worth it.\n\nbut how can you recover in a world where everything will literally trigger you?",

So many misinformed people form echo chambers of competitive disordered tendencies where certain foods and food rituals are antagonized to the point that people w EDs and mental health issues live in fear of having permanently damaged their bodies.",

All they talked about was losing weight and their new diets and myfitnesspal and tracking calories. They are all significantly smaller than me. I gained weight in recovery and it's hard not to want to jump on that bandwagon. It happens every year. \n\nThey don't even realize how disordered they sound when they talk about cutting out x and only eating y calories per day. It's exhausting. \n\nThis honestly goes doubly for my body building coworkers because everyone only sees them as the epitome of health. They are so disordered in my mind. \n\nThen again, I see an eating disorder in everyone because of my own experiences.",
