  "title": "A List of Resources & Worksheets for Eating Disorder Recovery",
  "selftext": "Hey all, I notice a lot of people here often looking for resources on recovery, or on specific aspects of recovery, such as preventing relapses, stopping calorie counting, stopping body checking, etc. So I wanted to put together a list of resources that may be helpful for those seeking out or interested in recovery.\n\nThe main resource in here is the list of 'Recovery Worksheets' from various online sources, most of these worksheets mainly use a modality called 'Cognitive Behavioral Therapy' (CBT) which helps people learn how their thoughts, feelings, and actions are interconnected, and how to stop the harmful behavior associated.\n\nThat being said, it's very important for me to mention that I am not a licensed clinical psychologist, and that recovery as a whole can differ a lot between people, what works for one person might not always work for another, so if you read through some of the resources below and don't find one to be particularly helpful for you, feel free to move past it and go on to the next, you know yourself and what you need best. Additionally, if you're currently in a position where you feel as though you need medical or therapeutic intervention and can't commit to recovery on your own, please do seek out the support you need. In the 'Additional Resources' section below, I've included a couple of links to low cost therapy options that might be helpful for some to utilize (they're only available in the U.S & Canada though - sorry about that, all the other resources mentioned however should be available worldwide).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Recovery Worksheets:**\n\n* [Tackling Avoided (Fear) Foods \\[PDF\\]](https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/~/media/CCI/Mental%20Health%20Professionals/Eating%20Disorders/Eating%20Disorders%20-%20Worksheets/Eating%20Disorders%20Worksheet%20-%2002%20-%20Tackling%20Avoided%20Foods.pdf)\n* [Types of Thinking Traps in Eating Disorders \\[PDF\\]](https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/~/media/CCI/Mental%20Health%20Professionals/Eating%20Disorders/Eating%20Disorders%20-%20Information%20Sheets/Eating%20Disorders%20Information%20Sheet%20-%2028%20-%20Unhelpful%20Thinking%20Styles.pdf)\n* [The Problems with Calorie Counting & How to Stop Counting Calories \\[PDF\\]](https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/~/media/CCI/Mental%20Health%20Professionals/Eating%20Disorders/Eating%20Disorders%20-%20Information%20Sheets/Eating%20Disorders%20Information%20Sheet%20-%2008%20-%20Counting%20Calories.pdf)\n* [Reducing Body Checking \\[PDF\\]](https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/~/media/CCI/Mental%20Health%20Professionals/Eating%20Disorders/Eating%20Disorders%20-%20Information%20Sheets/Eating%20Disorders%20Information%20Sheet%20-%2003%20-%20Body%20Checking%20and%20Avoidance.pdf)\n* [Questions to Ask Yourself to Challenge Negative Thoughts](https://i.imgur.com/fECR4q0.jpg)\n* [The Cycle of Self Injury \\[PDF\\]](https://www.getselfhelp.co.uk/docs/models/SelfHarm.pdf)\n* [Fact or Opinion? \\[PDF\\]](https://www.getselfhelp.co.uk/docs/FACTorOPINION.pdf)\n* [The 'STOPP' Method \\[PDF\\]](https://www.getselfhelp.co.uk/docs/STOPP.pdf)\n* [Preventing a Relapse \\[PDF\\]](https://www.anxietycanada.com/sites/default/files/RelapsePrevention.pdf)\n* ['My Relapse Prevention Plan' - CBT Exercise Worksheet](https://i.imgur.com/Vr67rFQ.jpg)\n* [Change Process Balance Sheet (Why You Want to Recover) - Exercise Worksheet \\[PDF\\]](https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/~/media/CCI/Mental%20Health%20Professionals/Eating%20Disorders/Eating%20Disorders%20-%20Worksheets/Eating%20Disorders%20Worksheet%20-%2001%20-%20Change%20Process%20Balance%20Sheet.pdf)\n* [Thought Record Sheet for Tracking Triggering Situations - CBT Exercise Worksheet \\[PDF\\]](https://www.getselfhelp.co.uk/docs/AnorexiaThoughtRecordSheet.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Helpful Articles:**\n\n* [Relationships and Intimacy in Eating Disorder Recovery](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mindful-musings/201911/relationships-and-intimacy-in-eating-disorder-recovery)\n* [You Don\u2019t Have to Feel Beautiful to Care for Your Body](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/beauty-sick/201806/you-don-t-have-feel-beautiful-care-your-body)\n* [Who Suffers From Eating Disorders?](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/beauty-sick/201812/eating-disorders-and-who-suffers-them)\n* [The Six 'Seductions' of Anorexia](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/hunger-artist/201808/the-six-seductions-anorexia)\n* [Let's Talk About Higher-Body Weight Anorexia](https://benourished.org/lets-talk-higher-body-weight-anorexia/)\n* ['How I Healed from an Eating Disorder and Stopped Hating Myself and My Body'](https://tinybuddha.com/blog/how-i-healed-from-an-eating-disorder-and-stopped-hating-myself-and-my-body/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Recovery Podcasts:**\n\n* [The Eating Disorder Recovery Podcast](https://eatingdisorderrecoverypodcast.podbean.com/)\n* [The Food Psych Podcast](https://christyharrison.com/all-episodes)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Books on Recovery & Developing Better Relationships With Food:**\n\n*Note: If you live in the US, UK, or Canada, you may be able to find some of these books at your local library to borrow free-of-charge.*\n\n* [*'Eat Up'* by Ruby Tandoh](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/36340052-eat-up)\n* [*'The Fuck It Diet'* by Caroline Dooner](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39893127-the-f-ck-it-diet?from_search=true&qid=ZafVJJMUec&rank=2)\n* [*'Rehabilitate, Rewire, Recover'* by Tabitha Farrar](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39286306-rehabilitate-rewire-recover)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Additional Resources:**\n\n*Note: If you're a university student or live in a college town and want to seek out counseling, your local university should also often have free or low-cost therapy options available to you.*\n\n* [GetSelfHelp.co.uk - Additional Free Online CBT Worksheets & Downloads](https://www.getselfhelp.co.uk/)\n* [Open Path - Low Cost Therapy Between $30 - $60 USD per Session (U.S & Canada Only)](https://openpathcollective.org/)\n* [Low Cost Cognitive Therapy Providers (U.S Only)](https://www.academyofct.org/page/LowCost)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBest of luck to you all.",

Do you forget to eat or worry that eating will make you vomit or choke?*\r  \n\r  \nANSWER is a research study for adult males and females (ages 18-45) with and without avoidant and restrictive eating habits. The study examines how avoidant and restrictive eating patterns are related to different hormones and regions of the brain. There are two visits, one at Massachusetts General Hospital and one at the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, both of which are in Boston. The visits involve brain imaging (fMRI), measurement of hormones (blood draws), and health surveys. Our goal is to provide information to develop better treatment plans for those struggling with avoidant/restrictive eating. Participants will be compensated up to $300 and will receive parking validation. Transportation costs can be reimbursed.
