  "selftext": "I am \\*mostly\\* recovered but recently I had to get oral surgery so I couldn't eat that much for the past week because it hurt like mf and let me tell you. AT LEAST 4 MENTAL BREAKDOWNS A DAY. just from having a low calorie intake for 3 days. im weight restored, my period is back, etc, but just 3 days of wayyyy less food than I normally have now to avoid pain, made me literally insane. I sat on my  couch and cried about how I was worse than everyone else, everything triggered me, self deprecating, suicidal ideations, and a bunch of stuff that doesn't even seem relevant to me now that I was finally able to 3 meals for the past 2 days, and I felt my mood improve as I could gradually eat more. idk that kinda blew my mind I thought id share. though it is the most obvious thing, like of course not eating would make you hangry and depressed but ya EDs can convince you otherwise and all I learned from this experience is I'M NEVER RESTRICTING AGAIN CAUSE ITS NOT WORTH IT I BECOME LITERALLY INSANE AND NOT MYSELF",

That I committed such an act of violence against myself.",

I ended up having a full blown panic attack and it did not settle until I ate. I ate, and I was completely fine. My recovering body is not messing around! It's like feed me now or I'm gonna lose it!!",

Like this week one morning I threw up my breakfast because I felt nauseous from my medication and it totally threw off the next few days because I missed out on those calories. It's crazy how much difference it makes!!",
