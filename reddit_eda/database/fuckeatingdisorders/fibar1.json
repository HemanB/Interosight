  "title": "Everyone was right - my therapist is horrible and fuels my eating disorder.",
  "selftext": "I have previously shared some interactions I had with my therapist, I should have listened and cancelled my appointment with her. Instead of getting help, \"therapy\" has fueled my eating disorder. \n\nTW for weight, I am 5'4 and have been right around 112 lbs for the past 6 months. I religiously track calories and have a very unhealthy relationship with food, the scale, and my body. I have low self esteem and self worth. I went to therapy per the request of my physician after losing 70 lbs and still feeling the need to lose more weight. \n\nMy therapist had anorexia and is recovered and I feel our sessions are fueling my eating disorder. First she encouraged me to eat 1000 calories per day (less than what I was already consuming), then she told me I'm not ready to stop tracking calories and I need to keep tracking and show her at my weekly appointments. \n\nI decided to stop tracking anyways - I also was out of town and went out to eat for several meals (not my choice). I'm sure some of it is water weight, but the scale says 119 now - I am freaking out. I shared my anxiety of this in therapy today. My therapist recommended that I diet and get back to my lower weight if that helps my anxiety. She told me she would let me know if I get to a bad place with my weight, and as of right now she isn't concerned (I haven't shared my height or weight with her, she is going by looks). So now I feel fatter than I already did - my therapist who told me I have an eating disorder is encouraging me to lose weight based on the way I look. Obviously I have enough fat on me to lose more. I feel so triggered. Back to calorie counting, I'm so upset with myself for trying to eat normally.",

I know the power those numbers have over me - there is no magic number that can grant me the power of self acceptance. \n\nYou are doing amazing. I'm proud of you.",
