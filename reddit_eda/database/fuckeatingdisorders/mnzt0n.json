Basically in my mind I had beaten my ED\u2019s, but something I noticed was eg I wore some new pants today and they were loose on the back part and I was like \u201cooh I\u2019m still in shape\u201d. I hate hate hate thinking that being one size is better than being another size. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m asking for but I\u2019m wondering if someone has struggled with the same issues during/after recovery? Someone that relates or have gone past that..",

That in itself is a huge win!\n\nI am by no means an expert in the subject matter, but cognitive psychology is fascinating to me, and I was fortunate enough to take a graduate course about it- the prof was wonderful and we had a small class size, so I was really engaged. Anyway, our brains likely have a \u201csemantic network.\u201d Essentially, we link different \u201cthings\u201d together based on pop culture, features, exposure, etc, and those \u201cthings\u201d can activate each other. Like, if I were to quickly show you the word \u201csleep,\u201d and then ask you if \u201cbed\u201d was a real word, you would respond faster and more accurately than if I asked you if \u201cduck\u201d was a real word. I believe this concept is particularly important in disordered thoughts. We can also trigger automatic thought cascades. For instance, \u201cface\u201d is linked with \u201cbook\u201d and \u201cface\u201d is also linked to \u201cnose.\u201d If I present you with the word \u201cface,\u201d you will respond equally as fast to cues for \u201cbook\u201d and for \u201cnose\u201d but probably not to \u201cduck.\u201d Now, if I present you with just the word \u201cbook,\u201d you will quickly respond to \u201cface.\u201d But you will also respond quicker to \u201cnose\u201d than you likely will to \u201cduck.\u201d This is what we call \u201cautomatic spreading activation.\u201d Basically, when I trigger one thought, your brain lights up linked thoughts, which light up thoughts linked to that... and we do that all without any conscious control.\n\nPeople with disordered eating spend a TON of our time forming and reinforcing specific links- eg, linking \u201cskinny\u201d to \u201cattractive\u201d and then \u201cattractive\u201d to \u201cworth\u201d and \u201cloose clothes\u201d to \u201cskinny.\u201d Thus we have a network where now \u201cloose clothes\u201d not only activates \u201cstill in shape\u201d but also dictates mood as it can activate the concept of self-worth. And it does this automatically, whether we want it to happen or not. \n\nWhere to go from here? Accept that it takes time to \u201cremodel\u201d semantic networks. You are becoming aware of them, which is fantastic. Because you recognize you don\u2019t want these links, you can start to \u201cunlink\u201d them by intentionally forming new links or setting up experiences. When the thought comes up, you intentionally choose to think of things you want linked instead to attractive, in shape, and worth.\n\nOthers have suggested wonderful ways in which you can do that. Unfollowing the triggers of course is wonderful so your automatic thoughts aren\u2019t reinforcing the links. Being presented with diverse bodies gives you more experience to \u201clink\u201d that diversity with positive concepts. But you also have to conscientiously choose to establish those links. Every time you think something negative about a larger-size body (which could be an automatic thing), you can reframe that thought and look for the positives and beauty of that body. \n\nYou also have to establish YOUR OWN SELF in that particular \u201csemantic network.\u201d For me, that means when I catch myself body-checking and activating the \u201cED pathway,\u201d I consciously choose to remind myself of the beauty in whatever area I\u2019m looking at. Many people with EDs do this by giving thanks to what their bodies do for them- eg, when they body check their thighs, reminding themselves how their legs carry them far every day. The recommendation to view your own body as if it were somebody else\u2019s also helps you form that link because sometimes our automatic \u201cED pathway\u201d makes it very difficult for us to accept us as we are- especially when we also have body dysmorphia.\n\nI hope this made some sense! The key takeaway: your brain is doing exactly what it is supposed to do, even though it causes more problems. Actively seek out diverse bodies, find the beauty and value in these people, and view yourself in them!! That can help retrain your brain to have a healthy automatic train of thought.",

That in itself is a huge win!\n\nI am by no means an expert in the subject matter, but cognitive psychology is fascinating to me, and I was fortunate enough to take a graduate course about it- the prof was wonderful and we had a small class size, so I was really engaged. Anyway, our brains likely have a \u201csemantic network.\u201d Essentially, we link different \u201cthings\u201d together based on pop culture, features, exposure, etc, and those \u201cthings\u201d can activate each other. Like, if I were to quickly show you the word \u201csleep,\u201d and then ask you if \u201cbed\u201d was a real word, you would respond faster and more accurately than if I asked you if \u201cduck\u201d was a real word. I believe this concept is particularly important in disordered thoughts. We can also trigger automatic thought cascades. For instance, \u201cface\u201d is linked with \u201cbook\u201d and \u201cface\u201d is also linked to \u201cnose.\u201d If I present you with the word \u201cface,\u201d you will respond equally as fast to cues for \u201cbook\u201d and for \u201cnose\u201d but probably not to \u201cduck.\u201d Now, if I present you with just the word \u201cbook,\u201d you will quickly respond to \u201cface.\u201d But you will also respond quicker to \u201cnose\u201d than you likely will to \u201cduck.\u201d This is what we call \u201cautomatic spreading activation.\u201d Basically, when I trigger one thought, your brain lights up linked thoughts, which light up thoughts linked to that... and we do that all without any conscious control.\n\nPeople with disordered eating spend a TON of our time forming and reinforcing specific links- eg, linking \u201cskinny\u201d to \u201cattractive\u201d and then \u201cattractive\u201d to \u201cworth\u201d and \u201cloose clothes\u201d to \u201cskinny.\u201d Thus we have a network where now \u201cloose clothes\u201d not only activates \u201cstill in shape\u201d but also dictates mood as it can activate the concept of self-worth. And it does this automatically, whether we want it to happen or not. \n\nWhere to go from here? Accept that it takes time to \u201cremodel\u201d semantic networks. You are becoming aware of them, which is fantastic. Because you recognize you don\u2019t want these links, you can start to \u201cunlink\u201d them by intentionally forming new links or setting up experiences. When the thought comes up, you intentionally choose to think of things you want linked instead to attractive, in shape, and worth.\n\nOthers have suggested wonderful ways in which you can do that. Unfollowing the triggers of course is wonderful so your automatic thoughts aren\u2019t reinforcing the links. Being presented with diverse bodies gives you more experience to \u201clink\u201d that diversity with positive concepts. But you also have to conscientiously choose to establish those links. Every time you think something negative about a larger-size body (which could be an automatic thing), you can reframe that thought and look for the positives and beauty of that body. \n\nYou also have to establish YOUR OWN SELF in that particular \u201csemantic network.\u201d For me, that means when I catch myself body-checking and activating the \u201cED pathway,\u201d I consciously choose to remind myself of the beauty in whatever area I\u2019m looking at. Many people with EDs do this by giving thanks to what their bodies do for them- eg, when they body check their thighs, reminding themselves how their legs carry them far every day. The recommendation to view your own body as if it were somebody else\u2019s also helps you form that link because sometimes our automatic \u201cED pathway\u201d makes it very difficult for us to accept us as we are- especially when we also have body dysmorphia.\n\nI hope this made some sense! The key takeaway: your brain is doing exactly what it is supposed to do, even though it causes more problems. Actively seek out diverse bodies, find the beauty and value in these people, and view yourself in them!! That can help retrain your brain to have a healthy automatic train of thought.",
