I\u2019m losing so much sleep and my anxiety is through the roof because I\u2019ve stopped eating again. Every time I relapse, I remember why I was trying to recover before. This shit sucks. Please just eat. Losing 5 pounds is not worth the insomnia, the obsessive meal planning, the body checking, the unhappiness, the FATIGUE (don\u2019t even get me started on this one!!) i just wanna have my fucking oatmeal like a person can I just let myself do that please",

I'd be exhausted walking home from class and think \"this is ridiculous just go home and eat the pop tarts you're craving\" but it wouldn't happen. Or it would, followed by immediate regret and attempts to \"make up for it\" with exercise or further restriction. It's easier said than done. \n\nMade me wonder a lot if I really had an eating disorder. Sort of a \"i don't have a legitimate problem I'm just faking it\" mixed with \"I'm not sick i could just eat normal anytime i want\"",

Many times I had thoughts like, \"*What* am I doing?! I'm not a dumb person, I know all of the consequences of this behavior--why, why, why?\"\n\nPart of starting recovery was realizing that the voice asking those questions was my real self. Your real true self is the one that is trying its best to get you to work towards whatever is best & most healthy for you--that reasonable, logical voice is you. All those thoughts designed to get you to engage in ED behaviors are the ED itself doing its best to maintain control over you. I think of it this way--the ED brain is like a parasite that has taken over your brain and will do whatever it can to stay alive and in control. It gains more power and gets louder every time you follow what it says. The less you engage, even though it is hard, the less power it has.",
