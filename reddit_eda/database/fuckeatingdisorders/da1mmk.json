  "title": "I refuse to live in fear of pasta.",
  "selftext": "I have had enough. My previous attempt at recovery was half-hearted at best, and the results were as half-baked as the pie crust I once pulled out of the oven and gobbled up in a fit of tears on the kitchen floor. Anorexia robbed me of my health, sanity, and love of food. It has made me afraid of spaghetti, and no human being should have to spend what precious little time they have on this planet in fear of those delicious, carby strings of joy.\n\nEarlier this week, I passed out in the bathroom and bashed my head on the cold, concrete floor. I genuinely did not believe that I was sick enough before, but I do now: according to my GP, I have several vitamin and mineral deficiencies, and my heart rate turned out to be lower than expected. I was told in no uncertain terms that unless I started to take my issues seriously, I would very likely end up in hospital with a plethora of health issues.\n\nSo I will no longer eat apples and steamed broccoli for dinner, and I will no longer weigh every single morsel of food that enters my mouth. I will no longer take pride in feeling cold all the time, and I will no longer count my ribs. Being good at starvation is not an accomplishment, and having a visible clavicle is not something I should be proud of  \u2060\u2014 it is a physical marker of malnutrition. The people who love me presumably don't want my legs to look like matchsticks: they want me to live a happy, fulfilling life. I'm about as adept at being happy as I am at making my bed as soon as I get up in the morning, which is to say I'm not very good at it, but at this point I know in my heart of hearts that being ravenous all the time and looking like a demented bobblehead doll come to life has not brought me even a step closer to the peace and contentment I so desperately crave.\n\nOnce I started eating, the extreme hunger hit me hard: frankly, I have been eating enough to feed an entire Ukrainian orphanage. I could probably enter a competitive eating competition and come out victorious. At the moment, I'm trying not to worry too much about *what* I'm eating - if the pesky ED voice tells me that I can't or shouldn't have something, I'm damn well going to have it (and in any quantity I desire). I've eaten quarts of ice cream, burgers, danishes, chocolate bars, and sweets with wild and reckless abandon. The other day, I almost fell asleep on a park bench after barging into my local supermarket in my pyjamas, buying all the food I was craving, and consuming most of it in a single sitting. I'm taking the hot flashes in stride, and I am going to honour my hunger for as long as it takes. For now, I would rather \"binge\" than restrict: it'll presumably all level out at some point, and even if it doesn't, that's another bridge we'll cross when we come to it. \n\nThe weight gain, fatigue, gastrointestinal discomfort, and the nagging, relentless ED voice are all terrifying and make me want to relapse, but I want to make peace with my body and learn to live life on my own terms again.",
