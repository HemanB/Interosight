As an Asian myself, I can tell you that the imaginary competition against everyone and everything in their (esp women's) minds due to the cultural standards with which they are surrounded is very real. An extremely high chance that your co-worker is feeling that pressure, even though there really is none. It's sad, but that pressure never ends - even when you're already considered skinny, you now have to be careful to _stay_ the skinniest one and make sure no one boots you from your \"throne\". So harmful, but if you can rise above that, then you are all set. Good luck to you and enjoy the heck out of that quinoa salad \ud83e\udd57",
