Also totally agree with u/geebabybee, of course there's a time and a place for self-disclosure and everyone's experience is different, but I think for the most part it can be incredibly helpful and comforting to know that the person who is there to care for you has been where you are and made it through.",

It's obvious that you are a highly empathic person, deeply care about what people are going through and you like to actively listen to them. These are essential qualities when you are a doctor. I'm happy to see that people like you are taking this road. Wish you all the best!",

It\u2019s not something thats diagnosed based on appearance. \n\nBut I acknowledge that isn\u2019t always the case. If I ever hear a colleague say something that reflects a poor understanding I usually at that point will try my best to challenge their views. It hits home because I remember being the patient and overhearing comments from the nursing staff. I never want that to happen to those I meet.",
