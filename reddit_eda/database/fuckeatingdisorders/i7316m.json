  "title": "Sometimes I feel we need more 'tough talk' in recovery.",
  "selftext": "Don't get me wrong, it's great that we are kind to each other, listen to each other's fears and worries and try to be compassionate and understanding. A caring, supportive environment is always the best to achieve full and sustainable recovery.\n\nHowever, I also do feel that...I don't know, us with EDs don't really like to be told certain things - we know those to be true, but we hate hearing them nonetheless. \n\nSo here's some ideas that I have that usually get me into heated arguments with other people in recovery:\n\n1. **it is a choice to engage in any kind of behaviour**. You can say all you want that \"I can't help but restricting\", \"I can't stop purging\", \"it's beyond my control\" etc., but the harsh reality is that you DO have a choice. You DO choose to engage in those behaviours. You CAN choose not to. You didn't choose to have an ED, but you do choose everyday to keep having one. There is no one, no one but yourself that forces you to keep restricting, purging, exercising or whichever other behaviour characterizes your ED. \nAnd so many people interpret this as \"it's your fault/you just have to do it\", whereas this is absolutely not the case. What I am actually trying to put across is that you DO have the control to change your actions. And this feels incredibly empowering. Knowing that, you also know what to do next - which doesn't mean you have to do it alone; you may very well have to ask for help. But it's still up to you. \n\n2. **your triggers are your problem**. Yes, society is shit. Yes, people are often assholes. Maybe they try to be nice, and they fail. Maybe they don't understand how you feel. Maybe no one does. But as an adult living in the real world you cannot expect anyone to accommodate your issues. You probably also say a lot of stupid stuff that might hurt someone else and you don't know anything about it. That's life. Recovery is also learning to be confident enough that you don't have to be bothered by any random comment you read or run back to your ED everytime you feel uncomfortable. \n\n3. **you have to quit all the excuses**. You can trick your therapist, your dietitian, your parents, your friends, strangers on the internet and everyone else into believing all you want them to believe. That you \"forgot\" to eat, or you \"just want to walk to manage anxiety\", or that you \"are doing everything you can\". But in the end, the only person that loses is you. Real life doesn't care about any shenanigans and if you're not fully honest with yourself and the others you will just be wasting time that no one will give you back, while the rest of the world goes on without really caring about you.\n\nThat's it, thank you for coming to my shitty ted talk.",

      "body": "I totally agree. Real recovery involves a *brutal* degree of self-honesty and taking a lot of responsibility for your behavior, reactions, and beliefs. And it's amazing how much of a difference that can make. Like, saying / thinking \"I can't help it, I just have to do \\[behavior\\]\" also reinforces to yourself that you can't and it becomes a self-fulfilling belief. If you want to recover, you have to do a lot of mental work to uproot all those beliefs that aren't conducive to recovery: you need to believe \"I *can* help it, I *can* choose to refrain from \\[behavior\\]\" and then you'll find, yeah, you actually can. You're right, it's super empowering :)\n\nIt just sucks that I think a lot of people aren't in a position where they can really tolerate or accept tough love, and they often push it away. I know I was in that position quite a lot in my recovery (or past shitty attempts at recovery lol). Took a while until I finally accepted that I needed to be honest with myself like that",

I don\u2019t agree with the author on some things (like therapy being useless), but ever since I decided to take full responsibility for my actions, recovery has become so much easier. I am not in control of my urges to b/p, but I can chose what to do when I get the urges. And so I (mostly) stopped b/p because I\u2019m not as weak as I think and my disorder does not control me. \n\nIt was hard to realise that I was making a lot of excuses and that I was consciously choosing to engage in disordered behaviours because it is easy, comforting and all I\u2019ve known for a long time.\n\nAs I said before, I don\u2019t agree with the author\u2019s views on therapy. I never focused on my ed in therapy but learning to be more self aware in general and realising how skewed my perception/thought process can be was extremely helpful and therapy played a big role in that. \n\nHad you told me I\u2019m making excuses and that I\u2019m in control a few months ago I would\u2019ve probably told you to fuck off and gone back to my disordered behaviours.

I think many issues surrounding ED are also wrapped in self-worth, self-identity, and how others view you, and that lens can be applied differently for different people. \n\nI can only speak for myself, but I personally find that I am my own worst \"tough talk\" person. Because I take out the failures that I see in my self (ED included) and use that \"tough talk\" to destroy myself, and use it to advanced my self-abuse. \n\nAnd for me, that tough talk is part of my cycle. I tough talk myself into starving because it is the only way I can control my weight. I use other people's \"tough talk\" as a way to bolster my own shitty thoughts about myself, and that tough talk then becomes internalised. \n\n(I am using this mostly as an example, this was some of the behavior I have, and fight against on the daily) \n\n> \"It is my actions that made me fat, and therefore, I must take the responsibility for that and change it, and the only way I can change it is to starve myself because otherwise I will continually fail and continue to gain weight. I cannot just \"stop eating\" I must do this because otherwise, I am lazy, weak, and can't control myself. And only I can do this because no one is going to help me lose weight. And Only I know how best to lose weight for me, because I have tried \"the right way\" before and always fail.\" \n\nAnd then when I do restrict, starve, and lose weight, that tough talk is replaced by encouragement, and people being happy I lose weight. I do not get tough talk from others when I am starving (outside my husband who knows what I am doing), so why would tough talk get me out of losing weight when it is what I want? \n\nFor me, if anyone was tough on me, I was simply tougher on myself as a result and it feeds into my ED. My therapist identified that I didn't need tough love, I just needed love.  And having the grace and kindness to not only forgive myself for what I have done to myself, but also give you the permission to recover. For me, that was how I had to empower myself. Not with tough talk, but with a soft touch. \n\nIt is likely that my experience is different because I am a guy and the expectation is different for men than it is for women, so I can take that on, I do have a blind spot because I only know how my therapists have worked with me, and I haven't seen how they work with women. \n\nFor the record, I am often that \"tough love\" friend. Who will listen, and then break things down quite bluntly because I hate inaction. I hate wallowing for the sake of wallowing. I try to move things forward, and it is that personality tick of mine that pushes myself into really extreme situations with myself because I am just harsh and tough on myself at base. I have seen that tough talk work and backfire. I try my best to use my tough love to empower people so that they don't feel helpless, but it can be difficult. \n\nAnd I agree, there is always a way out, but that is difficult to say to someone who is so malnourished that they are not thinking correctly, and is exacerbating all of their negative thoughts. It can also lead to suicidal thoughts, so I worry about that phrasing. \n\nSo, I circle back to my original point - There are many paths to recovery, and tough talk can be an effective tool when used correctly and at the right point in the recovery process. But it is not the universal tool that can be used for every occasion. \n\nThank you for the discussion, I think this is a great thing for everyone to be talking about.",

I use other people's \"tough talk\" as a way to bolster my own shitty thoughts about myself, and that tough talk then becomes internalised. \n\n(I am using this mostly as an example, this was some of the behavior I have, and fight against on the daily) \n\n> \"It is my actions that made me fat, and therefore, I must take the responsibility for that and change it, and the only way I can change it is to starve myself because otherwise I will continually fail and continue to gain weight. I cannot just \"stop eating\" I must do this because otherwise, I am lazy, weak, and can't control myself. And only I can do this because no one is going to help me lose weight. And Only I know how best to lose weight for me, because I have tried \"the right way\" before and always fail.\" \n\nAnd then when I do restrict, starve, and lose weight, that tough talk is replaced by encouragement, and people being happy I lose weight. I do not get tough talk from others when I am starving (outside my husband who knows what I am doing), so why would tough talk get me out of losing weight when it is what I want? \n\nFor me, if anyone was tough on me, I was simply tougher on myself as a result and it feeds into my ED. My therapist identified that I didn't need tough love, I just needed love.  And having the grace and kindness to not only forgive myself for what I have done to myself, but also give you the permission to recover. For me, that was how I had to empower myself. Not with tough talk, but with a soft touch. \n\nIt is likely that my experience is different because I am a guy and the expectation is different for men than it is for women, so I can take that on, I do have a blind spot because I only know how my therapists have worked with me, and I haven't seen how they work with women. \n\nFor the record, I am often that \"tough love\" friend. Who will listen, and then break things down quite bluntly because I hate inaction. I hate wallowing for the sake of wallowing. I try to move things forward, and it is that personality tick of mine that pushes myself into really extreme situations with myself because I am just harsh and tough on myself at base. I have seen that tough talk work and backfire. I try my best to use my tough love to empower people so that they don't feel helpless, but it can be difficult. \n\nAnd I agree, there is always a way out, but that is difficult to say to someone who is so malnourished that they are not thinking correctly, and is exacerbating all of their negative thoughts. It can also lead to suicidal thoughts, so I worry about that phrasing. \n\nSo, I circle back to my original point - There are many paths to recovery, and tough talk can be an effective tool when used correctly and at the right point in the recovery process. But it is not the universal tool that can be used for every occasion. \n\nThank you for the discussion, I think this is a great thing for everyone to be talking about.",
