  "selftext": "I know I may get downvoted for this but the linked [Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CUZmuUJpvsa/?utm_medium=copy_link) (in particular the second and onward photos) really changed my thinking.\n\nOur disordered eating mind takes healthy as an insult, and we may snap at people for it or give warnings to people to not say it, but I think we need to remember it isn\u2019t a bad thing. I am also triggered by this phrasing but I\u2019m coming to realize that if people tip toe around me forever (and allow me to not be a good friend/employee/student on account of my ED) then I\u2019ll never recover.",
