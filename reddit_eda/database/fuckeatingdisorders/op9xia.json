  "selftext": "So yesterday I got really hungry and ate after dinner, which was hard because it's one of my stupid rules. I felt bad, and forced myself to workout more this morning. I got to a point where I just couldn't go on, so I wanted to stop and accidentally hit my water bottle, which spilled all over the PC. Luckily, nothing's broken, but you know what my first thought was? \"You should skip breakfast\".\nI had to stop because... are you serious, ED?! I forced myself to do something I didn't want to do because of YOU, which led to an accident and the solution is to hurt myself even more? What kind of logic is that?\n\nAnyways, I'm gonna enjoy breakfast because this was a mess and I deserve to eat, especially when my ED tells me not to. Have a f*king awesome day people!",
