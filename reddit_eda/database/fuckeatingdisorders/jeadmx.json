  "selftext": "So last night I ate very little, just soup. I was doing well but on the verge of another relapse. \nBut I couldn\u2019t sleep, at the same time I was having this massive headache probably from restricting. \nI woke up my mom and told her I had his headache. She said I look sickly of the thinness that I\u2019ve become. I ate a piece of bread, chocolate with oats  and Mac and cheese at night, something I never ever ever thought I\u2019d do. \nI didn\u2019t binge like crazy, just ate til I was full. And I\u2019m not going to look at the scale.",

You should go online and look for a good hunger/fullness scale to reference before & after you eat a meal. Those things have really helped me personally because I LITERLLY have no idea when I'm full.\n\n On engaging in intermittent fasting or any kind of fasting/restricting, I highly recommend you DONT do that. (Its easy to say this also and very hard to actually practice if you have an ED.) That is almost guaranteed to lead to a binge. Its also not an effective or maintainable way to loose weight. If the weight loss is drastic and fast it WILL NOT maintain. Im currently in ED recovery & the most effective thing that I have found to prevent binging is by eating a bunch of small nutritious meals/snacks throughout the day, getting a reasonable amount of exercise, and becoming self aware of my emotions and urges that are contributing to my B/P & restricting behaviors. Also with the exercise piece do it to stay strong and to feel good NOT to burn calories and lose weight.\n\n Also scales don't mean shit. Our bodies naturally have weight fluctuations ESPECIALLY females   (This has been a very hard thing for me to accept). If you already have a disordered mind around self perception and weight than a scale is useless to you. :/\n\nLook into therapy if you can, these behaviors and habits are really really HARD to get out of and its going to take time and effort. The earlier you get help the better off you'll be. I didn't get help early enough & I had to be hospitalized 3 times because of hypothyroidism, heart problems, liver problems and severe dehydration induced from these behaviors.\n\nIm sorry your mom made that comment too, that would've made me feel so bad. You're seriously on the right track and I wish you luck! ;))",
