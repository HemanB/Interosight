  "selftext": "This all happened when I was maintaining a >!16!< BMI for like 3 months. It wasn\u2019t even that low and I could hardly stay that low of a weight because of extreme hunger.\n\nSome things that happened being that UW:\n\u2022 heart rate would SPIKE everytime I ate, it was kind of scary. It would continue to beat fast for the entirety of me eating.\n\u2022 brain fog af, felt slow and stupid attempting to continue conversations\n\u2022 my heart/chest felt tight when exercising. Another scary thing that would happen\n\u2022 joint pain!!! Sitting would hurt cus I had no fat. Laying down on my side would hurt. EVEN PUTTING MY PHONE IN MY POCKET hurt my hip bones\n\u2022 worst of it all was thinking about food every second of the day. It really sucks when calories, food are what you only think about especially when you have work to do or have to study. It\u2019s a sad life\n\u2022 so cold. I would have the heater on me for 15-20 minutes before I attempted to change in the morning. I was still freezing trying to change clothes.\n\u2022 obviously no period for like a year\n\nAs much as I hate my body right now, those heart problems kind of worry me if I did any long term damage. I\u2019m asian and look normal at that low BMI, but you wouldn\u2019t even think that I was physically deteriorating. Sometimes I look at other uw Asians, kpop stars and wonder how the fuck... are they okay? Do they have their period? Do they not have heart problems? People like Rose that\u2019s obviously super UW. How is that okay and how are people defending that she\u2019s naturally skinny?",

I always wonder about those UW kpop stars too, how the hell do they exercise and do all their training and shows without passing out and looking perfectly fine??! Do they not have any of the typical symptoms of being UW??? It makes me feel like I should be able to do it too without repercussions (which is a dangerous line of thinking)",
