  "selftext": "Seriously. I need to recover. My relationships are suffering, my academics are suffering, my work is suffering, my finances are suffering, my body is suffering. I don\u2019t have any energy to do the most basic tasks, I\u2019m emotionally unstable, I feel bad about myself for doing this, etc etc etc. I need to stop.\n\nBut then my ED brain is like \u201cBut...but if you recover you\u2019ll gain weight...and you won\u2019t be thin anymore...so...\u201d BITCH WHO CARES!?!? AND WHO THE FUCK ASKED YOU!?!?!?\n\nWHY!?!?!?!? WHY DO I NEED TO BE SKINNY!?!?!?!?",

No intellectual or logical reasoning, just emotional association. I don't know about you, though.\n\nIt's great that you recognize that you need to recover. It took me a while to get fully on board after my own realization, but it got easier the more I pushed on with it. Cheers for recovery, beat the ED brain (with a stick of butter)!",

I want to smile and laugh, see movies, roller skate, swim, spend time with my loved ones and go on trips and EAT without constantly judging my own body as I move through the life I want to have.
