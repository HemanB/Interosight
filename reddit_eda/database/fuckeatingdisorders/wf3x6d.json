  "selftext": "Is anyone else noticing that an increasing amount of recovery influencers on Insta are doing promotions for protein bars? \n\nIt is not sitting right with me, I feel it's predatory of these protein bar companies (who are, I think, inherently complicit in and a part of diet culture) to be approaching influencers and I am disappointed in these influencers for taking part in these promotions. \n\nI don't want to see recovery influencers partaking in any aspect of diet culture. What next - are they going to post about high protein meal replacement shakes?! \n\nThese low sugar high protein bars are diet cultures latest obsession. Deep in my ED I basically lived off them. \n\nI'm actually flabbergasted to see these influencers posting about them. \n\nAnd I think the companies know exactly what they're doing - and it's so fucked up. \n\nSorry, just needed to rant, surely I'm not the only one who's noticed this. \n\nI am just going to unfollow all recovery influencers who do this. But I almost want to call them out and be like - what are you playing at?!",
