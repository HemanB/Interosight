The way she turned around every product. The way she looked at food and the shelf\u2019s. Waited at the sweet isle but didn\u2019t bought anything. Put away the slightly higher vegan milk for the low cal one. The diet energy drink.\n\nDeep down I just Wanted to give her a hug and at the same time it made me also angry to know what is going on inside her right know. \n\nOnce you\u2019ve been to that place you can not - not see the signs. It\u2019s so sad how an illness can be so obvious to the once that suffer and so oblivious to the rest of the world.",

I just remember thinking she looked really tan and fit/toned so I told her that (thinking it's a compliment for most people) and she looked like a deer in the headlights and was defensive, like she scrambled to say something about not being able to work out lately due to injury...as if she took my compliment the opposite way and was saying she's not in shape. The next time I saw her she was obviously much thinner and didn't have the same muscle tone as she did before, so maybe she thought I was calling her overweight before then. That's when I found out she was going to treatment for anorexia soon. I remembered feeling the same way in high school, like people calling me \"fit\" or \"compact\" were calling me fat simply because they didn't say \"skinny.\" Now I'd love to be called fit or toned again lol. There are way worse things to be called!",
