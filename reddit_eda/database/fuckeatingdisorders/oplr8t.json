  "title": "it's time for me to leave this sub",
  "selftext": "I posted on this sub for the first time 10 months ago, worried about going to uni with an ED. since then, i went to uni and dropped out 6 weeks later, did a 20 week recovery programme, moved house with my family, got a job and finally recovered and i'm now getting ready to go back to uni and actually be happy and successful.\n\nlast October I thought I was beyond hope, I was planning my suicide, food was my 24/7 obsession, I couldn't sleep, couldn't think, couldn't feel happiness. I cried more that I spoke actually words. last October was the worst month of my life. I'm sure if I didn't force myself to accept help I would have ended up dead or in hospital.\n\nI have been living with anorexia for 5 years, it took 5 years of my life away and only now do I feel like I can actually breathe again. \n\nif you told my past self that in the summer of 2021 I would feel confident enough to wear dresses and short sleeves, and well enough to eat whatever I want, whenever I want, I would not have believed you. I truly thought I would never recover.\n\ndon't get me wrong, everyday I am vigilant of signs of relapse, but now I actually care about myself enough to take care of my mind and body, instead of thinking I deserved to starve. \n\nI think it's time for me to leave this sub, so I can take the final few steps required to close this dark chapter for good.\n\nif there is one thing that everyone here needs to know, it's this: you're not the exception, you're not beyond help and you deserve recovery, but unfortunately you won't believe that until you're well, so you're just going to have to take my word for it.\n\nGood luck.",

I knew that staying on that sub would have a detrimental effect on my recovery in the long run.\n\nin order to recover, you have to live as if you don't have an ED, any people who have EDs don't seek out ED content everyday, so that's what I'm doing. :)",
