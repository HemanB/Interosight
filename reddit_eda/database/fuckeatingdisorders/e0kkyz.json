  "selftext": "Just in case other people need to hear this. I constantly have to remind myself that I am more than just someone who has an eating disorder. So recovering does not mean I am loosing myself, my personality. In fact my real personality comes out more when I\u2019m healthy. Especially as someone who has been struggling for over ten years, it\u2019s hard to think of not having an eating disorder, and I probably will never even be \u201cfully recovered\u201d, because I have to constantly make sure I\u2019m not back sliding into disordered behavior. But I shouldn\u2019t be afraid to fully recover just because I don\u2019t know who I am without the label of \u201cmentally ill\u201d or \u201ceating disordered\u201d.  (I\u2019m 28yo constantly yo-yoing between recovering and relapsing but I\u2019m currently doing fine, just had to remind myself of this).",

Sometimes when I feel kind of discouraged it helps me to write down the things I want for my future as an exciting thing to look forward to. You mentioned wanting to leave your country, is that something you can focus on as a goal for your life? Like figuring out where you'd like to move to, and what you'd like to do with your life when you get there, etc.\n\nI'm not saying this to be like, \"Oh, just forget about that ED stuff and focus on this other thing instead.\" I know it's not that simple, and disordered voices don't go away that easily, but it might just be helpful to look at the other ways you exist in the world right now, other than through your disorder.",

I've been planning my future out for 3 years, and I actually used to literally count the days until my 18th birthday. I decided to study in an English college, not in London but close enough to it. I want to study psychology to become a therapist and do multiple other side jobs, including art (because it's one of the things that stuck to me for years now). I even figured out how to decorate my house, and I've been saving for college for 3 years now. \nI had plans to bring my therapy cat with me, but my parents gave him away because my mom didn't like him. Broke my heart, honestly.",
