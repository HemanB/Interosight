  "selftext": "When I was young, my mother, after a chemotherapy session tried to eat some chicken but ended up vomiting\nEver since I haven\u2019t been able to eat chicken in any form even though I used to be fine with it, the same goes for meat, though it\u2019s less severe (i can only handle one specific type) If I eat anything with chicken or meat, I vomit immediately and even the smell or taste in other foods makes me sick\nIs this food aversion, an eating disorder or something else?",
