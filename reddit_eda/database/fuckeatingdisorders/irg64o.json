During the week I try and eat by 7:30 AM for school and stuff.\n\nAnyways, today I was talking with my mum, and got up to make breakfast because I was hungry. I was halfway through doing so when I checked the time. It was 9:30 AM.\n\nMy ED wanted me to put it off, but I made it and ate it anyways. I\u2019m so happy :\u2019)",
