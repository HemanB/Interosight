  "title": "My 10 tips for dealing with weight gain, fear, and other recovery tips!",
  "selftext": "Hi friends! I recently discovered a way that helps me counteract these thoughts, and I thought you guys may find it useful.\n\n1.) *Recognize this is an ED thought*\n\nYour ED is terrified of weight gain, so it\u2019s going to make you as terrified as it can so that you won\u2019t gain weight or recover. What helps me is saying to myself (whether aloud or in my head) \u201cI recognize this is an ED thought and I\u2019m no longer going to engage.\u201d\n\nIf the thought keeps returning, I just say to myself \u201cThis is my ED, and I\u2019m not engaging.\u201d Or simply, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n2.) *Do your research!*\n\nSeriously. This helps so many people who I know. Do your research on the process of recovery! I\u2019ll link my personal favorite(s) down below! You aren\u2019t a special snowflake or unicorn. The rules of recovery also apply to you. You also need food.\n\n\nhttps://letsrecover.tumblr.com/recoveryguide\n\nhttps://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/stages-recovery\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/mirror-mirror.org/getting-help/working-through-the-weight-restoration-phase-of-anorexia-nervosa\n\n3.) *If you\u2019re scared to do it, you HAVE to do it*\n\nIf you\u2019re scared to eat xyz, guess what? You have to eat xyz. No neural rewiring will occur if you don\u2019t challenge yourself. You will never teach your brain that it\u2019s okay to eat whatever you want if you don\u2019t work on challenging your ED.\n\n4.) *Rapid weight gain won\u2019t last forever*\n\nSeriously. It won\u2019t. Your body will probably gain super fuckin\u2019 fast at first because it\u2019s scared. Plus, food and water weighs something, babe. Trust me. You retain an ungodly amount of fucking water and food at first. It\u2019ll go away. I\u2019m on my 2nd week of \u201cAll In\u201d and my bloating is slowly going away. It\u2019s nowhere near as bad.\n\n5.) *No two bodies are the same*\n\nDon\u2019t let your ED use this as an excuse to not eat enough. Nah, tell that fuckface to suck it.\n\nWhat I mean is, what may be enough weight for one person, may not be enough for someone else. You may need a higher weight. Does that makes you a bad person? Nope! Does being smaller make you a better person? Also nope!\n\n6.) *Don\u2019t overcomplicate it*\n\nYou want chocolate? Eat the chocolate. \u201cBut it\u2019s not that easy!\u201d It really is. It does get easier. I just gotta make your brain learn your fear foods are just food and can\u2019t hurt you!\n(Just don\u2019t eat any food you are allergic to please.)\n\n7.) *Don\u2019t pinch new weight*\n\nAlso, try not to bodycheck. It\u2019ll only make you feel worse.\n\n8.) *You are not gaining weight \u201ctoo fast\u201d*\n\nImagine you fell down and cut your knee. Would you say \u201cHoly fucknuts! It\u2019s scabbing too quickly! Now I gotta pick it because it\u2019s healing too fast! Slow down, body!!\u201d No, you wouldn\u2019t. Your body is just healing itself. Trust me, other people HAVE gained as \u201cfast\u201d as you are.\n\n9.) *Don\u2019t dwell/brood after meals or snacks*\n\nIf you\u2019re struggling, ask a trusted one for support. However, don\u2019t just sit there and dwell on your guilt. Play a game, meditate, watch YouTube, or do anything you enjoy to distract yourself! Trust me, it\u2019ll help big time!\n\n10.) *Find your identity OUTSIDE of recovery*\n\nDon\u2019t make recovery your whole identity. Find who you are without your ED. Otherwise, once you recovery fully you\u2019ll feel a bit lost. Find who you are and what you\u2019re passionate about.\n\n...\nThank you for reading all this! Feel free to ask any questions! I know I\u2019m no expert, but I hope this helped! :)",

      "body": "This was amazing thank you so much!!!!! NUMBER TEN. NUMBER TEN. NUMBER TEN!!!I lost myself in my ED, I envy people\nWho have built their lives (socially, career, learning, creative expression) while I was busy doing ED shit. I feel so behind, but remembering who I want to be AS A LIVING HUMAN ON EARTH helps me see past ED. No amount of my skinny was ever sustainable anyways. I literally lost any other real interests in my ED outside of fitness/food/health. While embarking on my super uncomfortable recovery journey, I found a purpose (a college degree in sustainable energy) and a hobby (surfing) that I am so passionate about that they sometimes give my ED a swift kick in the dick.\nThat being said, I\u2019m still riding the struggle bus in terms of eating confusion, and emotional/night eating. But I\u2019m a hell of a lot healthier than I used to be before I at least tried recovery. Also damn that pinching, that will set me off. As will more than one second in the mirror. \n\nDiscomfort is the touchstone of growth!",
