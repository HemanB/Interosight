  "selftext": "I\u2019ve been recovered for almost five years and about two years ago decided to see if I could offer any advice/help to people on various ED recovery subreddits. Two years later this is the only one I\u2019m still on. I won\u2019t name any names as I don\u2019t wish to attract people to them, but the other two ED \u2018recovery\u2019 subreddits are dangerous to say the least. \n\nThey claim to have rules against pro-ED content, yet they are pretty much never enforced, the largest one is basically disordered people giving advice to other ill people. This isn\u2019t 100% of the posts and comments, but it\u2019s a good 70%. They demonize foods, spread unscientific nonsense about food, encourage fatphobia and demonize recovery and it\u2019s all permitted. \n\nWhat saddens me is that people may go to those subs genuinely wanting help with recovery and will likely get the complete opposite, whether that\u2019s from disordered comments people leave, or from seeing how other pro-ED behaviors are treated as normal or even good. \n\nThank you mods for fighting the good fight with this sub, even though it seems like a losing battle sometimes.

It\u2019s very difficult to gain weight and go through the refeeding phase but like. Being sick with an ED is miserable too.
