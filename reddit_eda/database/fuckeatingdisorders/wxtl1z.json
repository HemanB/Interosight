In fact, I think it's pretty offensive that diet culture is so prevalent and not only do people buy into it, but lack the self awareness that talking about it so openly is harmful to those with EDs and people in larger bodies.\n\nYou are totally valid in being upset by it and if you need to remove yourself or establish verbal boundaries, you have a world of people who understand and support you in doing so!",

I did ask my mum to a)  not tell me what she eats (because it\u2018s usually not a lot plus followed by a justification) and b) not to be judgemental towards the foods I eat. \nShe\u2018s often asked me how she can help me with my ED and that\u2018s the best way I know how. But a tshirt with these rules would be great haha",
