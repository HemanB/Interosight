  "selftext": "Let's cut the whole back story and preface this with acknowledging that I was very ill and disordered for years. At the beginning of 2018 I suffered a terrible relapse and almost died; it was pretty bad and I was far too stubborn to accept help from counsellors and I (and many others) thought I was going to die. I had some great friends who would literally force-feed me and try to help me however they could, they were on the brink of an intervention to pull me out of uni and call a hospital.\n\nThe something happened. In February I realised I didn't want to live not eating bread and having my pals shove 600kcal flapjacks down my throat; I hated looking sick and being weak and cold and having brittle hair. So I decided to brave it and eat something. It began with a two protein shakes and an evening snack. Slowly, I added more foods and dealt with the horrendously uncomfortable but essential bloat; I challenged chocolate, cake, hummus, bread - all of the other foods I'd rejected. Every. Single. Day. I was very open about my challenges and encouraged discussion on social media which was useful.\n\nI worked a physically demanding job and have always been quite active in running, and shortly afterwards realised there was a direct correlation between the amount of food in my body, and my ability to lift heavy boxes at work or run faster/longer (I'm a scientist and knew this, but doubted the trends y'know).  I still struggled to eat some things but my (then) exceedingly slow metabolism meant that I was gaining weight on well below 2000 calories per day. Shopping was still a challenge, eating out was unthinkable, dessert had to be meticulously planned but I was no longer at risk. \n\nOne day, I decided to try running 15km (when two months previously, I couldn't even make 5km). I managed, and bumped into my pals when I returned and exclaimed \"I'm dying\". Their response: \"No, you're the exact opposite of dying. For once\". They remarked how alive and energetic I was, much more fun to be around, intelligent, insightful, and loving.\n\nThen I kept going. My pals encouraged me to see a counsellor again who was relieved she could help me, slowly my weight plateaued, my hair and nails started growing, the hilarious bloating subsided, the constant aches left, and I began running 40km each week and lifting weights. That's where I am now only 6 months later. I now eat 1900-2300kcal per day, dependent on exercise, mostly of nutritious foods but I always eat some chocolate and wine and if I want ice cream (which I'm craving quite a lot right now) I'm going to eat ice cream.\n\nI've never looked better, I've never felt better, and I've never been better. That doesn't mean I'm cured - I broke down over a pear in the supermarket last week, I panicked about cocktails recently, and I can't stop buying unsweetened almond milk when it takes like watery mud. I can deal with these things and I will challenge them.\n\n6 months ago, I thought I was going to die. Seeing what this new and improved bod can do and feel makes recovery totally worth it; not just for oneself, but for everyone.",
