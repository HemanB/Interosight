  "selftext": "Guidelines [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vPk9JbgWrGCL4LbjAmVbVW-g2fD5DFBP_P-8ov2F4sY/edit?usp=sharing). \n\nThese harm reduction guidelines were adapted from Yale University\u2019s COVID-19 Guidance for Substance Users During COVID-19/Coronavirus. The purpose of \u201crecovery-neutral\u201d guidelines is to help anyone with disordered eating minimize the exacerbation of ED behaviors and side effects during the COVID-19/coronavirus pandemic. \u201cRecovery-neutral\u201d does not mean pro-ana/pro-mia. These common-sense guidelines are inclusive towards people in and out of recovery. Please feel free to share or add any comments/suggestions to help make this a more comprehensive free resource for people at home.",

We are building a gentler corner of the internet :)\n\nWould love to see you on my free Wednesday night SMART Recovery online meeting 8-10PM EST. We've been running online for years so are very familiar with the format by now. We start with a 15-minute guided meditation and follow with constructive discussion. You can join through the Zoom app or at zoom.us/meeting with the meeting ID 256 864 709.\n\nI hope this helps. Take care. Recovery into a joyful life free from ED thoughts and behaviors is is entirely possible.",
