My mom wouldn\u2019t let me use our treadmill at the time. \n\nAbout 1/2 a mile from my house a car pulled up to me, a man stepped out of his car, got in my face, began asking my age, and attempted to lure me into his car. Another car pulled over and honked their horn and told him to get his car out of the road. The man pulled out of my community at over 90 miles per hour. I was so scared to walk home. I knocked on the door of the house I was in front of and they let me wait inside, I called my mom and we called the police. \n\nYeah don\u2019t walk at night. He was definitely trying to kidnap me. I was so scared.",
