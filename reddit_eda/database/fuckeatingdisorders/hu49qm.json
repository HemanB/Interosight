  "selftext": "My friend and I had plans to go out and eat so in my head I had everything worked out today, I knew what I was going to be eating at what time. Now she's cancelled on me so im still in bed at 1PM because I'm afraid to go downstairs in case my parents make me eat breakfast and I'm also exhausted from fasting. I'm just laying here thinking I wish someone could tell me it's ok to eat, which my logical brain knows is ridiculous but my ED brain is telling me I have to wait and avoid food as long as possible because I didnt follow my plan today and that's a reason to punish myself I guess?? Ugh I'm so tired of this",
