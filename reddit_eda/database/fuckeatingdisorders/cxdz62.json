  "selftext": "... and I LOVE IT\n\nI started recovering by myself just 3 weeks ago at a BMI of 13 and now I\u2019m up to around 15.5.\n\nI haven\u2019t really noticed any changes physically in my appearance, but since my whole motivation to recover is under the guise of self improvement and becoming my best self, it wouldn\u2019t matter anyway.\n\nFor those out there in recovery trying to accept their new body, just remember the real reason you\u2019re doing this. Self improvement. You are becoming the best possible version of yourself and every day you are one step closer to living your best and healthiest life possible.\n\nI hope you all have a great day and allow yourself to take another step towards becoming a better version of yourself, you deserve it :)",

And remember that even when you're passed the bmi of 18 or 18.5 or whatever that arbitrary minimum is, you will likely need to keep gaining to maintain health and recovery. There has been studies that say if you can recover to a BMI of 23+ then you are more likely to sustain recovery <3 Overall, the number's don't matter, your body will gain to where it needs to be for optimal health as long as you are eating and not suppressing it.",

My weight hasn\u2019t budged since recovery (and I\u2019m on a cut, so I want to go down a little healthily). I\u2019ve been down because my body won\u2019t respond the way I want it to.\n\nBut you make me think about all the muscle I\u2019ve gained and how every day tasks are so much easier. It\u2019s nice to have energy to do things!\n\nWhile I still don\u2019t have the stomach of my dreams, I\u2019ve got my health and strength.",
