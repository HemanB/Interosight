  "selftext": "when i was in recovery after heavily restricting, i binged. a lot. for months, all i could think about was food. i would wake up and eat three breakfasts while thinking about what i was gonna eat for lunch. i would snack throughout the whole day, and eat huge portions at dinner. at night, i would raid the kitchen and go to sleep completely stuffed. \n\nmy appetite was so strong that i had no way of restricting. it was a very primal urge to eat that i couldn't really suppress - i felt as if i might explode if i didnt eat. and as i followed my appetite, the binges became smaller and smaller. i started being able to focus on other things besides food. i began feeling more satisfied at dinner, and stopped being scared of binging at night. and eventually, after months of being terrified of my own hunger, my brain caught up with my body, and i feel completely normal again. i think about food when i'm hungry, and i eat. then i move about my day until i become hungry again. it's very hard to imagine that kind of future when you're in the midst of extreme hunger, but you will be fine eventually.\n\nedit: 2 years since i made this post and i'm completely recovered, in case you're scrolling through old posts here. i can't give a linear timeline, because that's gonna be different for everyone. if you've been depriving yourself to the point of obsession, you're gonna have to eat a lot no matter what.",
