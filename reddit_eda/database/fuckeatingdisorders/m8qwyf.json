  "selftext": "I just need to rant for a minute. \n\nI have been in recovery for 6 years. I do okay, sometimes I have symptoms and sometimes I act on them, but I\u2019ll always get myself back on track. I\u2019m in a place where I\u2019m pretty content with the fact that I\u2019ll always have an ED, and I\u2019ll always be in recovery. It\u2019s not daily excruciating pain anymore, it\u2019s just a small occasional itch. \n\nBut it does eventually come up with any romantic partner that I get serious with. It\u2019s still a part of my identity and I did some life long damage to my body. So it\u2019s important to let them know about it. \n\nEVERY TIME, I swear, every single freaking time, they say \u201cyou\u2019re not the only girl I\u2019ve dated with an eating disorder, I wonder if that says something about me.\u201d\n\nThese are nice, caring men. The man who said it a few days ago is someone that I\u2019m currently head over heels for. But the second I tell ALL of them about my ED, they just lose all common sense. My ED suddenly becomes ABOUT THEM?!?\n\nAt this point, I always respond with either \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure everyone in this country has some type of ED\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s tragically common, especially among women.\u201d and yet they always try to bring it back to them. \n\nThere must be SOMETHING in THEIR nature that attracts them to women with EDs, or attracts women with EDs to them. It couldn\u2019t possibly, for even a moment, be that 28.8 million Americans have a diagnosed ED. That having an ED is so glorified by TV and the internet that many more people will self diagnose. \n\nNo, not at all, it\u2019s something about THEM. They must be so fucking caring or loving or accepting. Or maybe they\u2019re just attracted to people with trauma? EFF ALL OF YOU!!! It makes me sick to think that my personal journey, something that took time and tears and pain to overcome, is now being used as this guy\u2019s ego boost or weird moment of self analysis or whatever. \n\nMy ED, and the ED of all of the other women you dated, have nothing to do with you, you selfish pig. Having an ED is just an extremely common problem in our society, and if you date, you\u2019re bound to date someone who has had one. And your refusal to acknowledge that or desire to use it as some sort of badge for yourself just continues the narrative that an ED makes a person unique. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t make you unique, if anything it makes you human, and dating someone with one doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re special, if means you\u2019re alive and going on dates.",

However, I was trying to open up to you about something incredibly vulnerable and by saying what you did all it did was flip the conversation to being about you. EDs are an epidemic, statistically it's just a matter of time before you date a woman with one. To make it about you reduces mine and other women's struggles to being about you is hurtful.\"\n\nUghhh idk lady. ): again I'm so sorry, sending you love.",

      "body": "It's such a ridiculous idea to begin with. People need to mind their own business. I know probably three women who are so thin that they are almost certainly either restricting or have a non-ED health problem. And it's none of my business. I know more than three women who have EDs, and I'd never guess by looking at them. Also none of my business. It would be creepy to even bring up the subject in any context, I think even in a committed relationship (although that is more complicated).\n\nSame goes for any other health condition. I've dated a number of women who have ADHD, and, like you say, it has nothing to do with me. There are tens of millions of people who have it. My current girlfriend has it and it often works its way into conversations, but only when it's relevant.\n\nA guy who talks this way is (consciously or not) attempting some kind of gaslighting or attempt at control by continuing to bring up a stigmatized and traumatic condition that he can hold over your head. It's not an ego boost. It's emotional abuse. \n\nSource: I've been emotionally abusive in other ways and I've learned to recognize it.\n\n(Ordinary male ego boosts generally involve success at sports, accomplishing difficult tasks, or hooking up with women who they deem to be \"out of their league.\" If a man feels like he is getting an ego boost by being violent or abusive, he is a psychopath.)",

          "body": "Eeeek, I had an ex who knew about my mental health history and felt the need to go on a giant rant and cry about his ex being hospitalized for EDNOS and how hard it was for him because he loved her so much. And he did it while I was in his car, not that close to my house, so it would have to be a significant amount of effort for me to get home. Having never been hospitalized myself, something about the way he was discussing things seemed obnoxious. (He loved having these weird, nonsensical pity parties all the time, usually for manipulative reasons. Like, he was THAT guy who had a random, nameless relative \"die\" every time I wanted to break up with him.)\n\nGlad I might never have to speak to that manipulator again.\n\nSorry for the rant :/",
