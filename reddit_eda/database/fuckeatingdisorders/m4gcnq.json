Obviously I was not entirely successful, but I did try.\n\nI responded in greater detail to u/xleabrax.\n\nPretty much I posted it over here for discussion, as the fiction doesn't bother me at all (though I can't say I find it particularly horror or fun but that's really a non-issue). However, the real life implications that do happen are awful.\n\nI wanted to know if I was even crazier than I realized to think that it was just sad for those real life kids...",

I'm just so tired if it all, which is part of why I eventually started to give up on control bc it's *exhausting*. So it's been quasi-recovery with ups and downs forva couple years for me.\n\nMy apologies for rambling about my own drama.. but I'm trying to say I believe EDs can become so insidious. Especially because there's no getting away from it. Not to downplay other addictive behaviors, but recovery for an ED obviously can't be to just not eat.. I wish it was easier for us all, but I've realized being realistic can actually aid in moving forward, at least for me.\n\nSo to see people view it with such callousness... Yes, that bothers me.",

And I've been working on my own (admittedly fairly quasi-) recovery for a couple years now after many more years of very active ED struggles.\n\nI tried to carefully look at the sub rules before posting on and I'm not here to cause any drama, trigger anyone, or argue if others actually like that post.. Honestly, I just found it shocking (not in a good way) and this was the best place I could think of where I'd have a chance to gain more perspective?\n\nI really am confused as I am not usually easily triggered by others these days (I manage to do it to myself), but I wonder if others might be? And I tend to have an overly dark, ridiculous sense of humour (that I mostly only share with close friends  that I feel I won't hurt), live horror, am not easily scared and often cuddle up to laugh at b-side horror movies. \n\nSo, clearly I am crazy and none of you know me. But (if anyone even sees this post and it's allowed to stay up...) am I the one who is being overly sensitive here? \n\nI just can't figured out what type of reaction this was even supposed to gather?

While of course it's mainly anonymous (I truly hope so anyways right now - I've never felt so exposed online) and in here it's just two sentences about fictional characters... There actually are very real people who behave that way to their own children and others in general.\n\nI truly don't think the OP was made particularly maliciously in the fictional world.. but in the real world there are real people and real consequences. Why ever let it be last think to push a child over the edge?\n\nAnd I posted it onto this sub intentionally because I wanted honest discussion with people with different viewpoints that I thought nay have more \"experience\" here.",
