  "title": "Things to keep in mind during recovery",
  "selftext": "Hey guys, I\u2019m gonna keep this short and sweet so I can get right to the point; I realize that many people don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with their body when they start recovery from a restrictive ED. There are so many things I myself wish I knew before diving into recovery, so I thought I\u2019d compile the most common/important things together in a list for you all, in hopes that it will help y\u2019all who are just starting recoveru.\n\n1. **Your body is gonna do some wack shit for awhile:** you\u2019ll likely retain a fuckload of water within the first few days/weeks (I promise, it\u2019s not true weight gain yet); you\u2019ll be hit with severe body aches and extreme exhaustion to the point you can\u2019t leave the bed and sleep for 14+ hours every day. You\u2019ll be bloated and bowel irregularities are basically a nonnegotiable, necessary evil. Take this time to really, *truly* rest for at least a few weeks, if possible.\n\n2. **No, you\u2019re not developing BED. Yes, it\u2019s normal to eat thousands of calories in a single day:** I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve seen y\u2019all freak out over the possibility of having BED right after choosing to recover from your restrictive ED (not talking shit, I absolutely understand the fear and the lack of knowledge surrounding extreme hunger). But that\u2019s just not how BED works; the DSM-5 has made it clear that true binging cannot coincide with restrictive behaviors as it is then classified as an abnormal circumstance that leads to rhe large consumption of food. In other words, it is impossible to binge early on in recovery when your body is struggling with months/years of malnutrition. You need to eat back *all* of those calories you restricted over the span of your ED, *on top* of your normal daily caloric intake (which can range anywhere from 2500-3500kcal). This can round out to a lot of food, but I\u2019m telling you right now it\u2019s normal. I ate upwards to 11,000kcal the first month or so. The most important rule to follow is, if you\u2019re eating out of hunger, it\u2019s not binging.\n\n3. **Extreme/mental hunger should always be honored:** even if you\u2019re at a \u201cnormal\u201d BMI. Even if you\u2019re technically overweight by BMI standards. Even if your doctor or psychiatrist (who aren\u2019t nutritionists or dietitians, btw, and have little to no academic learning in nutrition) tell you to eat at some arbitrary number that leaves you feeling unsatisfied and hungry. Extreme/mental hunger can be so hard to cope with, especially if you don\u2019t fit into the \u201cemaciated anorexic\u201d stereotype. But you can\u2019t work around it either; the only way out is through.\n\n4. **2000 calories ain\u2019t it:** you need to eat more, probably *much* more than this in recovery, and very likely *after* recovery as well. 2000 is what most 10 year olds eat. And on a similar note, you also dont need to follow some made up TDEE you got from the internet. Those calories are what you\u2019d need if you were in a coma and not moving and don\u2019t account for the various factors in your life. Walking, breathing, typing, even eating burns energy. Honor your hunger.\n\n5. **A starved brain is incapable of doing the important psychological work and the neural rewiring essential for long-term recovery:** this is the paradox of why eating disorders are so difficult to treat; the starved brain is irrationally terrified of food and weight gain to the point it can be fatal, but the only way to overcome those fears for good is to is first eat and gain the weight. You can prep yourself and brace for the inevitable panic attacks and emotional breakdowns, but you cannot rewire your brain when it is still malnourished. You have to gain the weight first and allow your brain to heal as well.\n\n6. **Dont expect weight restoration to solve all of your problems:** this might seem to contradict number 5, but bear with me. I read all of these things about how weight restoration would bring me mental clarity and miraculous neural rewiring\u2026 that wasn\u2019t the case whatsoever. I mean, don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014I\u2019m definitely *much* better off, but you need to learn the skills to fight off relapse for long term recovery/remission, hopefully with a professional if you have the option of doing so. Don\u2019t assume you just need to gain weight to get rid of the eating disorder.\n\n7. **Your body decides your set point, not you:** I feel like so many of us get caught up by this one. Our weight is influenced by any *number* of factors, including genetics, sex, height, and environment. Your body knows what weight it functions best at and it will probably be at a weight higher than what you\u2019re comfortable with. But you *cannot* fully recover until you accept that your body calls the shots. Please challenge that fear of weight gain and of being at a higher weight because it\u2019s going to hinder your recovery if you don\u2019t. Ask yourself these important questions: what\u2019s so wrong with being at a higher weight? Who told you being at a higher weight was unacceptable? Would you tell a loved one that they are any less deserving of kindness, love and respect because they are at a higher weight?\n\n8. **Youll probably overshoot, and it might not taper off:** basically, you gain \u201cextra\u201d weight above your preED set point weight. One thing I read (I can try to find the source if you\u2019d like) that suggested that the longer and/or more severe we restricted, the higher we\u2019d overshoot. But here\u2019s the thing: overshoot weight is *necessary* weight. The body has a set fat to fat free mass (muscle) ratio; it first must regain optimal fat levels before it can restore muscle mass, hense why we look soft and dough-y after weight restoration. The excess fat will be used to support long term healing, balance hormones levels, and overall used as an insurance policy of sorts in case you decide to restrict again and it will have energy to keep you going if that happens for however many months/years. If you developed your ED as a child/teen, it may not taper off as weight gain is a normal, healthy part of aging into adults and we typically don\u2019t stop growing until age 25. I restricted pretty dedicatedly both as a child for 3ish years and as an adult for 6 years and I overshot by *a lot.* I kept hoping and hoping it would taper off soon because so many people said it would, but it hasn\u2019t and as much as I hate to admit, it may never will. This is also something you will have to accept and work through in order to prevent a relapse.\n\n9. **Let go of exercising and compulsive movement:** At least temporarily for conventional exercise or general movement, until your weight and body have stabilized. Firstly, the severe swelling, bloating, body aches, extreme fatigue, and extreme hunger will not only make it exceedingly difficult to maintain an exercise routine, it will likely make these symptoms significantly worse. Your body is severely depleted of energy and requires a ridiculous amount of rest. Now, obviously you don\u2019t need to do absolutely nothing for a few months to a couple of years, but you may require bed rest the first month or so (I did); after you finally start to experience the benefits of increased energy, I still suggest to keep it away from conventional exercise until you are sure your weight is stable and you can choose to exercise from a place of enjoyment rather than a compulsive need or as compensatory behaviors. I know some people say the continue to exercise but I don\u2019t really recommend it, personally.\n\n10. **Weight loss is not compatible with recovery:** you cannot focus on weight loss while actively trying to recover. You have an eating disorder; you can\u2019t just tell your brain, \u201cI\u2019m gonna restrict again but this time will be different!\u201d It won\u2019t. On top of that, your body gives fuck all about what you *want* to happen, all it knows is that suddenly there\u2019s not enough food coming in and you\u2019re back to square one before you know it. You cannot choose to lose weight and actively remain in recovery. It\u2019s counterintuitive. I encourage you to let go of the idea of manipulating your body/weight and accept your body at whatever weight it ends up at because you are worth more than some arbitrary BMI number that was created to represent white European men *only* (yup, no women or non white individuals whatsoever) in the 1830s. \n\n11. **Junk food and sugar are your FRIENDS:** firstly, I want to say that you should stop giving moral value to food altogether. ALL food is good food. ALL food has nutrients. Take an apple and a cupcake for example; we know the two are different nutritionally speaking. An apple has fiber and various different vitamins and nutrients such as vitamin C and potassium\u2026 but what you might not know is that a chocolate cupcake has magnesium and other essential minerals including calcium, sulfur, zinc, iron, copper, potassium; flavonoids with antioxidant properties; and vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5, B9 and E. Not only this, it is a great choice for those in an energy deficit due to restriction due to its higher calorie content. I tell y\u2019all all the time here to honor your cravings for these foods because they hold a significant purpose in recovery, contrary to what diet culture will have you believe. Junk food will literally save your life where low calorie foods such as fruits and veggies will fail you. You are going to suffer from gastrointestinal distress that will be exacerbated by fibrous fruits, vegetables and whole grains, leading to painful gas, bloating, cramps, and irregular bowel movements. High calorie, nutrient dense foods will actually be easier on your digestion and metabolize much quicker, which will promote faster healing. And remember: once you\u2019re weight restored, you *do not* have to go back to restricting these foods. Eat them when you want, because restricting them will cause you to fall back into ED habits, even if you think you have control over them. You are allowed to eat the foods you crave for the rest of your life.\n\n12. **As much as your ED will try to convince you, you aren\u2019t the exception to recovery:** We often feel like we\u2019re the exception to the rules of recovery, that it won\u2019t work for us because [insert ED reasoning here]. it will most likely feel like you\u2019ll eat endlessly forever, you\u2019ll be hungry forever, you\u2019ll gain forever. That your metabolism is irreversibly damaged\u2026 and as someone who thought the same exact thing, I can tell you with certainty that your eating, hunger, and weight will normalize (\u201cnormalize\u201d meaning your body will find the middle ground that is healthiest for you). Your body isn\u2019t stupid, it\u2019s the result of millions of years of complex evolution whose sole purpose is to keep you alive; the last thing your body has in mind is to keep you eating and gaining until you die. I promise you that you aren\u2019t gaining as quickly as you probably think. In fact, there is no \u201ctoo quick\u201d in recovery.\n\n13. ***DON\u2019T*** **compare yourself to everyone else and their recovery:** everyone is different. Don\u2019t compare your progress with some YouTube or IG influencers who only gained x or xx lbs while you gained more or look different or eat more. *Your* recovery is *yours* and you are doing what you need to do. Try not to stress about others whose background you don\u2019t know, because for all you know they could still be struggling. You\u2019re doing your best and that\u2019s what matters.\n\n14. **Recovery isn\u2019t linear, so take your time:** challenge yourself and your ED with opposite actions and unlearning societal norms that harm you, but don\u2019t push yourself too far too quickly. Take your time, go at your own pace. You have an eating disorder and deserve to be kind to yourself. Recovery will have ups and downs and sometimes you might slip for a little while, tomorrow is a new day, fuck even a minute from now is a new moment. Don\u2019t beat yourself up for small mistakes and learn from the big ones. Okay? Okay.\n\n\nIf you have anyting else to add, or have any questions feel free to leave a comment! Hope this helps some of you out. \u2764\ufe0f\n\n***Edit:*** y\u2019all thanks so much for all the rewards. \ud83e\udd7a\u2764\ufe0f",

Your body needs to rest in order to recover and exercise burns more calories, which means you have to eat *more* on top of recovery amounts (that are already particularly high, especially if you have extreme hunger). This makes physical repairs of the body significantly more difficult because you\u2019re burning off much needed energy that it needs to heal. And to top it off, it can cause even more weight gain in the long run because your body is literally fighting you to gain weight at all. The desire to continue exercising when you want to recover is counterintuitive and disordered; you can *always* go back to exercising or sports once you are weight restored and nutritionally rehabilitated. It isn\u2019t going anywhere!\n\nI also really encourage you to reflect on why you only allow yourself \u201cwhole foods.\u201d All foods are processed in some way. All foods have a purpose; continuing to give moral value to food (aka, \u201cwhole foods is better\u201d) will set you back in recovery.",

Only 6% of ED sufferers are clinically underweight, which means that 96% are either \u201cnormal\u201d weight or overweight. So that in and of itself should say something. If you\u2019ve been restricting for long periods of time, regardless of your weight, you\u2019re going to have to basically eat back all the calories you denied yourself to fix the damages of your eating disorder.\n\nSince all bodies are different and no two recoveries are the same, nobody will gain the same amount of weight. It all depends on your set point, the severity of your illness, and the duration of it. It may or may not be proportionate to someone who is underweight, but if you were overweight prior to your ED, you may be overweight *after* your eating disorder and that\u2019s totally fine. Even if you are currently underweight. Even if you are currently at a \u201cnormal\u201d weight, and so on.\n\nWeight isn\u2019t a sole indicator of health and BMI is a shitty, unscientific method that shouldn\u2019t be used at all, tbh. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s anorexia, ARFID, OSFED, atypical anorexia, bulimia, weight gain is basically inevitable and should be encouraged. The only exception would be BED, in which case refeeding isn\u2019t the goal. *However*, restriction should still be discouraged as it only perpetuates the desire to binge and doesn\u2019t resolve the real problem\u2014resolve/cope with the emotional stressors and/or trauma that leads to binging and you\u2019ll stop the binging.",

It all depends on your set point, the severity of your illness, and the duration of it. It may or may not be proportionate to someone who is underweight, but if you were overweight prior to your ED, you may be overweight *after* your eating disorder and that\u2019s totally fine. Even if you are currently underweight. Even if you are currently at a \u201cnormal\u201d weight, and so on.\n\nWeight isn\u2019t a sole indicator of health and BMI is a shitty, unscientific method that shouldn\u2019t be used at all, tbh. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s anorexia, ARFID, OSFED, atypical anorexia, bulimia, weight gain is basically inevitable and should be encouraged. The only exception would be BED, in which case refeeding isn\u2019t the goal. *However*, restriction should still be discouraged as it only perpetuates the desire to binge and doesn\u2019t resolve the real problem\u2014resolve/cope with the emotional stressors and/or trauma that leads to binging and you\u2019ll stop the binging.",
