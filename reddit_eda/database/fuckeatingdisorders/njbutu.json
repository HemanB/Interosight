One of which is that full recovery can really only be achieved if the sufferer chooses it themselves and not other people... not to mention studies have shown very similar brain activity between drug addicts and ED sufferers",

Why I drank was the same reason I developed an eating disorder. \n\nI will say, that for me, recovery from being an alcoholic has been a bit easier than recovery from an eating disorder. Today, it\u2019s been 8 years since I had a drink. With drinking and drugging, it\u2019s possible to completely abstain from using. But with the eating disorder, it\u2019s been more difficult because trying to moderate a behaviour is harder for me than abstaining  altogether.",

I cried a lot reading that book, and it definitely made addiction/SUDs more personal to me.",
