  "selftext": "The latest trend, for lack of a better work, I\u2019ve been seeing lately is being a \u201cnOrMaL/hEaLtHy\u201d weight and therefore less deserving of recovery, especially when it comes to eating.\n\nEating disorders are *mental disorders*, the body and therefore it\u2019s weight is not something that specifically defines an eating disorder. Did you know that only 6% of those diagnosed with eating disorders are clinically underweight? That means the other 94%\u2014you know, the vast, **vast** fucking majority\u2014struggle with an \u201catypical\u201d eating disorder due to their weight, despite suffering from the very same consequences of malnutrition. You are sick enough. *You are sick enough.* **You are sick enough.** ***YOU ARE SICK ENOUGH***. And you deserve to nourish yourself and to eat.\n\nAnd let me be perfectly clear: I don\u2019t give a flying fuck what your weight is, *if you are restricting, especially for extended periods, you need to eat and you need to eat a fucking lot.* point blank, period, end of story. And if anyone tells you otherwise, I will personally square up with them (not really, I\u2019m a baby, but I will support you emotionally because fuck them).\n\nObviously this isn\u2019t a \u201cshut up and eat\u201d post, because never is it ever that simple. This isn\u2019t a post encouraging you to recover (there are countless posts already doing that here). But sometimes we need the validation and reassurance that we are sick enough, and we *do* deserve to eat just as much as anyone else even if we don\u2019t fit into the \u201ctypical\u201d definition of eating disorders.",

I started recovery about a month ago only a few lbs away from \"healthy,\" and in just one month I've gone well into the \"healthy\" range-- but still no end in sight for my refeeding/ weight restoration plan until my body decides to give me a period back. I feel guilty for gaining more weight and eating so much all the time when I'm \"healthy,\" so I cannot thank you enough for this reminder T\\_T",

You know deep down your disorder just wants you to make excuses for it\u2019s continued existence! it\u2019s never too early to recover!",
