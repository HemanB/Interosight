  "title": "I ate breakfast!",
  "selftext": "Last night I was at a range I felt comfortable with calorie-wise and was off to bed, but as I was falling asleep and a bit stoned I realized how fucking stupid calorie counting is and how hungry I actually was and got up out of bed and proceeded to eat like a full fucking meal and it was AMAZING! I don't want to call it a binge because I was just hungry and eating, and I woke up feeling horrendously guilty and had the urge to go run everything off and not eat all day. But instead, I got up, I made myself breakfast and I ate it! I definitely feel full and guilty and confused, but I've got shit to do and I need food to help me do it, so my restrictive brain can fuck the hell off.",
