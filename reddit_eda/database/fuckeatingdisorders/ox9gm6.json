I understand wanting to relate to others, but there is a difference between venting about your own struggles and straight up sharing behaviors and discussing how to maintain/lose weight. \n\nPlease be mindful of rule 2 before posting and expect that most responses are going to encourage recovery or the path towards recovery. Comments/posts encouraging ED behaviors are not allowed.",

You can share your vents and rants, and if you have anything that helped you reduce a behavior then that can be shared, like how you reduce your binges (for example). But anything to promote weight loss or how to trick/hide from your family is not okay. \n\nExample of what\u2019s okay vs not okay for a vent:\n\nYes: *I hate how sneaky my ED makes me. I feel like I\u2019m such a liar to my loved ones.*\n\nNo: *I hate how sneaky my ED makes me. Like today, I did [specific sneaky behavior] and I felt like such a dumb ass.*",
