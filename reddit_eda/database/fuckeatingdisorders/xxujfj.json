  "selftext": "So you are telling me that what doctors have recommended me to use because \"they know what's best for me and you don't\", what I literally tortured my body over, screamed and cried thousands of times over, is.... borderline pseudoscience that barely works half of the time? \n\nNever in my life i have been in the \"normal\" category of the bmi, not even as a child, and doctors have blamed all of my problems on it. If I only could get into the normal range of the BMI scale my life would be so much better, the only cause of my issues was me, and i could fix it! \n\nThe balding and amenhorrea, among other things i experienced, did not matter. \nI was in the healthy bmi range therefore these problems were imaginary, all in my head, because they are issues that only people categorized as \"underweight\" experienced and i surely was not in that category. \nI had no choice at one point and gave into the extreme hunger, \"failing all the hard work\" and failing in front of my doctors. I got there, how could i not be disciplined enough to stay there instead of giving up!\n\nAnd now I get to find out that it is a hundreds of years old system invented to categorize exclusively white male populations on a group level, not individually, that works barely 50% of the time for them imagine for everyone else!!!! And whose cap was changed from 27 to 25 for no reason other than \"its a simpler number\". \nI spent my whole life worshipping it, thinking it would make me a human worthy of sympathy and dignity once i reached that number, thinking it would finally get people to see a person and not a deformed thing and it would finally solve my health issues. \n\nAnd now the absolute opposite of what was told is happening before my eyes, i have never been as healthy as i am now, at a \"non normal\" bmi. \n\nI am sorry for these posts these days my recovery is turning out to be a painfully long and difficult journey",

That health and healing are things you feel, not things you compute. That taking the time to check-in and self-evaluate and be honest with myself about how I'm really doing, is more important in the long-run than validation from a medical system that does not acknowledge or value my whole health. I was never outside a \"healthy\" BMI range, even at my sickest, and my life was still down the tubes: and I refuse to be gaslit by people wholly unconnected to me. Don't get me wrong: I rely on physicians for my general health, I'm not at all against science or clinical care. But I no longer seek 'treatment' from physicians for my issues with ED-related stuff because I know they rely on metrics that are not meaningful to me (I am years into recovery so obviously this wouldn't apply for someone who is still medically restoring.)",

I\u2019ve never been in the normal range, always outside or on the upper end.  When my bmi went outside 27, I got a long talk from my doctor and my parents. The only time I got to the \u201chealthy\u201d weight for my height was when I had a full blown eating disorder. My pediatrician praised my work but never thought to ask more questions. Yes I was exercising but I was doing this everyday for hours at a time. I was so tired, hungry, and super anemic. But guess what, mu weight was normal which meant what I was doing was okay.  My period stopped and k thought it was the birth control, I now believe that wasn\u2019t the case as it came back eventually. I hate that EDs also have weight limits.\n\nI\u2019m not within the \u201chealthy\u201d bmi range now but I am so much more healthier than I was then. Not anemic anymore, periods are regular, my hands got their color back.  Labs come back fine so my new doctor and for the first time she hasn\u2019t gotten on me about my weight. I was shocked when I complained about an issue and they prescribed medication (I was put on psychiatric medication). I didn\u2019t go to the doctor for 5 years because of this.  \n\nI totally understand where you are coming from. I live for the day that bmi is seen as unreliable and not used as an indicator of health.",
