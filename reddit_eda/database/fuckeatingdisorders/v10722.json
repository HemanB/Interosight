  "selftext": "I went to old navy yesterday and they have these jeans called them 3n1 fits you. It fits three sizes in one. So if you are starting to weight restore in recovery and are gaining and things don\u2019t usually fit and are in between. They will fit you no matter what. It\u2019s best to go inside the store to try them on but I went and got three pairs because I\u2019ve heard so many good things and they do live up to the hype!",
