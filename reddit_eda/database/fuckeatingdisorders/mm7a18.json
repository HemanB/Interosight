  "title": "I was trying on jeans in a dressing room and heard the girl next to me almost break down...",
  "selftext": "TW: talk of weight and clothing sizes \n\nwas trying on jeans with my mom yesterday at Levi\u2019s (skinny jeans r out now in case you didn\u2019t know and it\u2019s all about loose and bootcut babyyyy (honestly never thought I\u2019d see the day but I\u2019m happy about it tbh)) \n\nanyways. I\u2019ve gained some weight but for the most part I still see some ab definition so I consider myself a least a little thin and this fact keeps me from spiraling into self hate and restriction (for the most part). I was hating on myself mentally as I tried on jeans because I was wearing a size 26 (which is what I actually fit in) but I should have been a size 25 because at my low weight that was what I would have fit in (ED logic) But this post isn\u2019t about me.\n\nAs I was trying stuff on I could hear a girl in the other room talking about how she didn\u2019t like how the clothes fit her. The dressing room girl was telling her how good she looked and she just kept disparaging herself and I could hear she was on the verge of tears cause her voice kept cracking. She didn\u2019t want a pair of mid rise jeans cause she \u201cknew she would never be confident wearing them\u201d. She said her husband encourages her that she looks good all the time but she doesn\u2019t like how anything looks on her. A couple times I heard her sigh in frustration because things didn\u2019t fit her. \n\nShe ended up leaving without buying anything and was apologizing to the dressing room girl saying that today was just \u201cnot her day\u201d and she just looked so sad. \n\nFrom her voice I thought that she was my age but when she walked out of the dressing room at the end I saw that she was actually around my moms age (late 30 or early 40s)\n\nI just wanted to hug her and tell her that we all struggle and that she can rock any jeans she wants and that she shouldn\u2019t get discouraged because some sizes don\u2019t fit, and that she deserves to feel confident and that she is beautiful and that none of this actually matters. \n\nWhich made me realize and wonder why I can\u2019t extend the same kindness, understanding, and sympathy to myself when I try on clothes, or when I disparage myself, or when I feel unconfident. \n\nEd really do be like that.",
