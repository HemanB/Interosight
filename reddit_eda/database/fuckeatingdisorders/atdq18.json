  "title": "\"Financial Anorexia\"",
  "selftext": "This is a term that honestly perfectly verbalised things that I didn't even realise I was struggling with in my eating disorder. The obsession that those with EDs (especially restrictive EDs) have with restricting financially as well, due to the belief that spending less money = good and proper, spending more money = greedy and wasteful, to the point that anything that isn't a 100% necessity is considered an indulgent purchase that we're undeserving of and foolish to spend money on, in a similar fashion to how food is viewed in that black-and-white light as well.\n\nI find the phenomenon of financial anorexia interesting because it really shows how complex eating disorders can be and the kind of mental strain they can have on the rest of your life, and how it's rarely ever just about \\~fitting into a smaller pair of jeans\\~ or aesthetics, but rather a deep-seated obsessive mentality on what makes one \"good and worthy\" and what makes one \"impure and worthless\".\n\nI'm sitting here writing my grocery list for the week and realising I was feeling bad for wanting a jar of raspberry jam that I don't \"really need\" and it's a useful reminder that anorexic mentalities work in more ways than one. Anyway, curious to hear others thoughts on the phenomenon.\n\nAlso: [A good article on Financial Anorexia and how it works](http://eatingdisorderspecialists.com/eating-disordered-behaviors-manifest-money/)",

      "body": "I struggle with this a bit when I was seriously into my bulimic period. I was literally flushing money down the toilet with BP food and ended up coming up with an insane system of spreadsheets, budgeting, and coupon clipping so I could purge in peace knowing I'd at least spent the minimum possible for an enjoyable (lol) purge.\n\nNow that I'm back in restriction land, I'm a lot more cavalier about spending on food. If I dialed back my coffee habit I would easily be <200/mo \u2013 a ton by r/frugal standards, but eating basically whatever I want and even getting take out every once in a while is worth it to me as long as I'm still maxing out retirement accounts and investing. If you're only eating ~1000ish a day and don't spend too much on proteins it's a cheap way to live.",

      "body": "I was diagnosed but don't really see myself as a true anorexic/disordered.\n\nBut during treatment one of my greatest guilts was the money being dumped on medical bills. It consumed me. I would see the insurance send the bill and what they covered and tally up how much money was being wasted on me, which I would then add to an estimated total money spent on me as a person by my parents, which I hoped to save up and give back to relieve the guilt I felt. It made treatment so much worse because every appointment felt like I was digging a deeper grave for myself. It drove me to try to \"recover\" as fast as possible, which meant my actual mental aspects got worse as I started binging until I was in pain or at least nauseated, several times a week. The binges also brought me guilt as I was a healthy eater type, and only binged on high-fat \"healthy\" things like hummus, peanut butter, nuts, the last of which I knew were expensive and brought me guilt as well (which is why I opted for PB - much cheaper!)\n\nNow I struggle with spending on things for myself. I need to justify what I eat, what I own, ECT. I got into minimalism and \"purged\" my belongings multiple times and it helped since I owned less and could stop looking at the evidence of waste in my room. When I used to own a Nintendo, it plagued me at night as I knew its cost and how it was a waste on me. \n\nI'm also a really big fan of shopping in discount stores and clearance aisles. It's basically my hobby to tour the clearance section of the supermarket, looking at things, buying near expired goods for myself, like beaten up cans of soup, browned bananas, misshapen and off color vegetables and fruit. I've calculated the costs of my meals and my daily intake over and over.\n\nAnyways, I guess it all fits. I knew that money restriction and just overall self-denial is part of all this- sleeping little, working lots, spending little, no social life, little food- all for a pure spirit in a way",

If I don't absolutely need a food, then I feel like I'm being gluttonous or excessive if I decide to purchase it. This seems to be another outlet for evaluating self-worth, and for people who think like this, there is a high value placed on ability to not spend money. I like how you described it as 'indulgent' - it really feels like I'm being quite lavish when eating or spending more than the bare minimum to get through the day.\n\nI've actually been thinking a lot recently about my finances and how my friends/family say I always tend to not spend my money on things for myself and I should buy more... But I can never really justify many purchases - especially food-wise. If I won't remember eating something in a couple weeks, is it truly worth it? I still tend to think of things like this.

There are so many amazing works out there on the (very strong) tie between poverty and eating disorders. \"Thinness\" as a general concept is often marketed by diet companies as something that's glamourous, high-end, care-free, etc, and that reels in a lot of people struggling from poverty. Not to mention how the whole \"obesity epidemic\" ~~propaganda~~ rhetoric relied heavily on targeting people who ate at cheap fast food places and bought cheap easy-to-consume food at supermarkets and convenience stores, i.e.: something that less financially stable people often have to rely on. \n\nSociety's widespread hatred of bigger bodies is in a lot of ways tied with classism and society's hatred of the poor, so it's absolutely no surprise that a lot of people who grew up poor end up developing eating disorders as a way to escape that. Not to mention, like you stated, the complex relationship people can generally have with food when food was so scarce and a source of financial stress in their past. ",

So I'd go and spend $70 on food for the week when realistically I absolutely did not need to spend that much, then not even eat it all and instead binge on junk food.

If I don't absolutely need a food, then I feel like I'm being gluttonous or excessive if I decide to purchase it. This seems to be another outlet for evaluating self-worth, and for people who think like this, there is a high value placed on ability to not spend money. I like how you described it as 'indulgent' - it really feels like I'm being quite lavish when eating or spending more than the bare minimum to get through the day.\n\nI've actually been thinking a lot recently about my finances and how my friends/family say I always tend to not spend my money on things for myself and I should buy more... But I can never really justify many purchases - especially food-wise. If I won't remember eating something in a couple weeks, is it truly worth it? I still tend to think of things like this.
