I personally only eat blah blah blah...\" And before I could respond, my godsend of a secretary chimed in and told him to cut it out because it was just one cookie. I went to thank her later and she shared that she struggled with ED in the past and hates food related guilt trips. To this day, she is the only person who knows me whom I told I used to have an ED and still struggle to this day.

Their are so many different ways that different people can be triggered by things a person can say, it\u2019s not fair to make it their problem when it\u2019s ours to deal with. Yeah it sucks and it\u2019s hard when triggered, but like any other mental illness, find a way to deal with it that doesn\u2019t involve asking other people to change for your behalf. It\u2019s not their problem.",

Especially when it's supposed to make you guilty for what you eat. My friend went through a phase when everything sugar was the devil and he literally would count how many grams of sugar I had when I ate around him. Mind you, I don't even drink soda or anything, he would count stuff like fruit and bread and then try to guilt me into not eating it. I wanted to punch him. But there's really no way of saying \"do you know how long it took me to eat sugar normally again?!\" without giving yourself away.",

I'm pretty sure the effects reverse when you go off it but I'm not sure, that may have just been for the epilepsy related aspects. \n\nMy partner's parents have been on it for a couple years now and live the most boring lives in a dietary sense. I always have to bring food when I visit them because I can't deal with it. I don't know if they are talking to their doctors or not about it but people really need to be doing that before restricting.\n\nRegardless it's shit to try and talk about your diet to people who didn't fucking ask. I had a roommate that wouldn't shut up about it even after I told her multiple times I had an ED and it was triggering to have her talking about being fat in the way she was. I'm pretty sure it was internalized sizeism so while I don't judge her for having those hangups, I judge her for not respecting boundaries. And yo-yo dieting has some really horrible effects on the body.",

It goes past my issues with anxiety, people are so clueless and their need for validation and praise goes past care for others. Yes Karen I know that you started keto and you have found the secret to happiness and become immortal because you eat nothing but bone broth and zucchini noodles but Karen maybe think about the fact that while you are to you, the only person in the universe, some of your coworkers have life threatening eating disorders, more than you probably think, and you shilling your diet that is often used to fuel eating disorders is having a really negative effect on those around you. Also just, no one cares. \n\nOr...a good \"shut the fuck up you carb deficient bitch before I shove a loaf of bread down your throat\" always works...\n\nNo but for real though, I usually go with something like \"I'm glad you've found something that works for you, but I have an Eating Disorder and discussing this kind of thing can be detrimental to my health, I hope you understand\". If they don't stop I'm usually more blunt and rude, they never stop of course.\n\nDon't even get me fucking started with IF. Bitch, I have a drastically decreased life expectancy and severe health issues largely because of my addiction to fasting, dont start telling me how well eating one 500cal meal every day is working for you, I don't need to hear it. (I actually told one of them that once, they felt so bad lol. Honestly, as they should, I'm sick of it. People need to think before they speak)",
