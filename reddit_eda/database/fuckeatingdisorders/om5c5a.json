I also went from not thinking about food (still very insecure about my body since I was like 12 though), to dreaming about the food I can\u2019t eat 24/7. I went through a year of this until COVID happened and extreme hunger hit and I finally ate all the foods I\u2019ve been craving and missing. I\u2019ve been free from the shackles of tracking everything I eat and craving everything, to just letting myself eat what I fucking want and not binging on it when I felt like that would be the only time I could eat it.\n\nI truly want to understand how this can be healthy in the long term",

Just look at all the diet subs on reddit alone! \n\nThere is a *lot* of  disordered thinking around food and exercise on there but people on dieting subs/boards usually believe they have \"a healthy mindset\" going on around these things.",

      "body": "Actually, studies show that at least 70% of women have a disordered relationship with food and their bodies. They may not have eating disorders, but just because many people intentionally lose weight doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re automatically healthy. Weight is not synonymous to health. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that studies have shown that people at higher weights are generally healthy; the ones who aren\u2019t usually have gained weight as a symptom of a chronic illness rather than the weight being the illness itself. Therefore, losing weight doesn\u2019t diminish the illness (oftentimes it exacerbated it) but individuals who aren\u2019t fat are less likely to face discrimination in the medical community and receive the care the initially needed when they came in with a larger body.\n\nEdit: are you asking how dieting can be healthy in the long term, or how intuitive eating can be healthy in the long term? If IE has lead you to eating freely without reactive binging, whereas \u201cdieting\u201d has lead to all the aforementioned consequences, remember that eating disorders are a mental disorder\u2014however, the affects of starvation are the same regardless of how disordered one\u2019s thoughts are. You will still experience extreme hunger, reactive binges, extreme fatigue, hair loss, amenorrhea (if you are an individual with a uterus), slowing heart rate, dizziness, etc. I think it\u2019s safe to assume dieting (in terms of restriction outside of allergies) is going to lead to at least a few of those symptoms.",
