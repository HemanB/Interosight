I used to do 1100-1300 easily now 1500 is agonizing.\n\nI close my eyes in a brief prayer. \"God has afflicted me thus for abusing my poor, hungry body. a land of plenty He has bequeathed and all I cared about was my vanity.\"",

But my bf reminded me that I exercise a lot so I\u2019m hungry, and that my guy friend doesn\u2019t do a lot physically. It\u2019s scary though knowing I might be eating enough where I don\u2019t lose weight and that I might even gain. \n\nYou\u2019re right about the restricting part, it\u2019s gotten way too hard.",

      "body": "When I was bad my body was maintaining on 1000 calories per day, with exercise, and I'm 5'7\". Once I began to recover I was gaining weight on anything above that but I learned to live with it and continue eating until now - I've gained 13kg (about 29lbs for all you imperial unit users) in 8 months and I'm maintaining on about 2100 calories. On days of strenuous exercise I eat up to 2600 calories and it is fine; sure there's a little jiggle around my stomach but that is absolutely not a problem because at least I can eat normal amounts of food now AND I have energy. Keep eating, listen to your hunger cues and your metabolism will catch up and weight gain will plateau.",
