  "selftext": "I\u2019ve been in recovery for about 3 years. My relationship with food is pretty solid (apart from a couple of issues I have around food that my body reacts sensitively to) but today I woke up with urges to fast.\n\nI haven\u2019t ACTUALLY eaten yet but, man, am I going to? Hell yes. Because why? Because I need energy (aka food) to feel GOOD. I need energy (aka food) to be able to get the MOST out of this day. I don\u2019t deserve to punish myself for any damn thing, and neither does anyone else who may be reading this right now.\n\nFuck eating disorders.",
