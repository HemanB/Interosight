  "selftext": "It's like my will to recover lasts an hour or so.\n\nIt's Easter today, and there's abundant food in my house. Delicious food.\n\nI woke up, and I said to myself: I can't restrict anymore. I have to recover. I have to gain weight. I have to do it. No matter how shitty it feels. I have to do it. I have to dive into it face first.\n\nSo I \"binged\" - ate thousands upon thousands of calories from breakfast all the way over to lunch.\n\nUp until mid-lunch, I felt fine. I felt confident and in control. I felt free.\n\nThen, after lunch, panic ensued, and I purged. I knelt in front of the toilet and, well. It was horrible.\n\nThis has already happened multiple times over, and I don't know how to deal with it anymore.",

      "body": "I've been dealing with this for a while and it's been... a struggle. But I think what has helped me is the way I go about it. Eating thousands more clapries than usual is much more likely to make me panic and have a breakdown and purge than eating just a few hundred more. More than anything, I focus on having normal eating habits (breakfast, snack, lunch, maybe snack, dinner, snack). It doesn't matter if lunch is half an oreo and 12 strawberries with a glass of cranberry juice, it's eating at that time that matters. It's just easing into the eating rather than forcing yourself to eat a ton",
