  "title": "I ATE LIKE A NORMAL HUMAN (TW)",
  "selftext": "After some tough talk with my family I realized I need to change my life, I am a 14m who weighs 78 pounds. I always was skipping meals or replacing them with just protein shakes. I weighed all my food(even celery like wtf) but today that all changed! I had cottage cheese, turkey, and Kim chi(yes weird combo but I like it) for breakfast and I didn\u2019t weigh any of it! Then I worked out and drank a protein shake. I did it plan on it but got to school and actually had a snack. It was a delicious RXbar and I loved every bite! Then for lunch I was feeling stressed so I had tuna and celery(safe foods) BUT I just had a big delicious bowl of lasagna soup for dinner!!! That used to be one of my favorite soups but I was always so scared of the calories and cheese but today I felt like a normal teenager. Food wasn\u2019t the only thing I was thinking about and I genuinely had a good day.",
