  "selftext": "Hey guys, I'd figure I'd keep this update thing rolling in case it helps someone out!\n\nBasically I have a 5 year history of anorexia with b/p, orthorexia, and exercise addiction. I started recovery in summer 2018. It was awful, I went through some of the worst depression and anxiety of my life and I relapsed a bunch in the 1st year. At first, I genuinely thought I was failing recovery, but now I understand why they say it isn't linear lol.\n\nOh, side note, I didn't attend any inpatient/outpatient treatment (though I should have). I basically recovered at home and saw a therapist who knew nothing about eating disorders. I would strongly recommend actually going to treatment. I gave myself refeeding syndrome on accident and prolonged my recovery mentally and physically because idfk what I was doing.\n\nSo on the physical side of things, I'm weight restored and stable. My extreme hunger is gone (it look forever to go away), my periods back, my hair is thicker, and my teeth are healthy. I have the energy to actually do things now, be social and feel excited for things. My sense of humour has come back which has been so important. I generally feel stronger and more resilient, physically and mentally.\n\nOne thing thats really sucked was being diagnosed with arthritis and nerve damage, which my neurologist thinks was caused by my eating disorder. I'm not sure whether its from under eating or overexercising...  honestly I didn't even know that could happen (I'm only 23). Anyways, PSA, because my back and head hurt everyday and its absolute shit.\n\nI still have behaviours that I'm trying to weed out. I struggle with body checking and sometimes choosing safe foods on purpose. But, a lot of the things I used to struggle with are easy now. I can eat whatever I want with minimal guilt, I don't compulsively exercise anymore, I can wear tight clothes, and look in the mirror before showering without dying inside. I no longer feel as though everyone cares about my weight gain. Also, I don't get triggered nearly as easily. Before, even the mere sight of someone really thin could send me into a spiral.\n\nI'm not going to outright say I'm happy, healthy and thriving in recovery, because that would be a lie. I've been trying to work through some of the trauma that led to my ED, which has helped. Turns out a lot of my instilled beliefs stem from my childhood and contributed to my ED. I kind of had to reteach myself how to exist without self destructing, which hasn't been easy at all. I still deal with underlying depression and anxiety/OCD that makes daily life harder. Its a lot better than what it used to be though, and I have many days where I feel calm and content with life.\n\nSo yeah, sorry that was long, but it felt good to write. :)",
