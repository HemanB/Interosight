ED might have influenced my feelings towards sex but I don't think it changed the workings of my body.",

Mentally or physically!\n\nI personally think sexuality can change as we change, so it adds up that our physical or mental health can be a factor. I struggled with my ED for ~15 years. There were periods of time where I was definitely asexual and periods of time where things were fully functioning. I felt confused often until I decided that whatever it is when I\u2019m feeling it is whatever it is haha",
