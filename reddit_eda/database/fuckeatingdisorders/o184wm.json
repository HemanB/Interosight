  "selftext": "I am diagnosed with ARFID, a type of eating disorder characterized by restrictive food intake (and in my case, a general lack of interest in food- I just do not experience hunger so it\u2019s hard for me to eat).\n\nDuring my recovery process I was prescribed the eating supplement ensure (a drink packed with calories and nutritions). By doctor orders, I am to take it between meals and as a supplement when I can\u2019t bring myself to eat food. \n\nI only started taking it the last couple of months, but almost EVERY TIME I drink it this asshole straight out scolds bc eating \u201cjunkfood\u201d and \u201ccandy\u201d is not real food?? \nHe straight out threatened to stop buying it for me as a punishment one time, and cherry on top called me an \u201cincapable toddler\u201d for relying on it. \n\nLike bruh",
