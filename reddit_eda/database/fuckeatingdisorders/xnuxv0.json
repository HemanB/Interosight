I\u2019ve seen even non-ED people mention this for hormone and blood sugar health and it has honestly saved my life. Basically, eat high protein and fat for breakfast. Could be salmon and avocado, eggs with butter, etc. I have found if I even eat some fruit at breakfast, I crash no matter what I pair it with. I don\u2019t do low carb or whatever, but in the morning, if I focus on protein and fat only\u2026 I don\u2019t crash all day! If I do this, ALL my low blood sugar symptoms resolve. I can eat more so what I want for lunch or dinner and not worry about feeling low later in the day too. My life is so much better now. Sounds so simple but it really really works. Start the day with protein and fat. I don\u2019t know where you are in your recovery through and through, but I hope this can really help.",
