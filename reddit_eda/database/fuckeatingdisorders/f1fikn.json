  "selftext": "I am with my bf. He has a healthy relationship with food: he likes it, he eats and exercise to stay healthy. he eats crap too.   \ni used to make him eat more clean and tonight I have ate with him tons of sweet stuff. I definitely feel not that much guilty and I wont call it a binge since it was such a shared nice moment (me feeding him, and preparing nutella with savoiardi) and I enjoyed!\n\nI'm not feeling bad or in urge to vomit. I enjoyed and I want more even tho I cant wait to go back to the gym and exercise in a healthy way.\n\nFeeling so positive!! <3 xx love this community, it helps so much all the time and I wanted to share a victory!",
