  "selftext": "what i mean is that in so many relapses i have tried to work restriction into my life, to adapt and make accommodations for the addiction so i could coexist with it while maintaining a semblance of happiness. but it\u2019s just not fucking possible. it Will weigh on you in little but significant ways. with everything you turn down, every moment that you don\u2019t let yourself enjoy, every bit of energy you deprive yourself, you will lose yourself again. you have to remember that that\u2019s what it will take from you\n\nwhen i\u2019m choosing recovery, life can feel like christian lee hutson\u2019s music",
