  "selftext": "i hope this doesn't trigger anyone and i really don't want to come across rude or insensitive. \nbut im really jealous and envious of those who can recover and still look pretty and barely gain any weight. i gained SO much SO fast because i was so hungry. but i feel so guilty when looking at all the \"recovery influencers\" who are still slim after being in recovery for a while, and being able to have normal sized meals (not huge meals like me because I'm just ravenous).. they're also able to have a social life outside of their recovery, whereas i have totally isolated myself because I'm so ashamed of how my body looks. then i see on social media these beautiful individuals in recovery who post \"keep going \ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\udc96\" and it's just stressing me out because ITS SO EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.",

Maybe I'm not as Ill as I thought? Maybe my recovery isn't valid? Everybody is different and every body is different, the likelyhood is that they are maybe not fully recovered and you are really only seeing what they want you too. Focus on what is important, you and recovering for you.",

I\u2019ve still gone through periods of isolating myself from people because I hated how my body looked with gaining weight even if it wasn\u2019t realistically very much weight. My ED didn\u2019t really believe that it wasn\u2019t very much weight.

I\u2019ve still experienced all the mental distress of ignoring the ED thoughts. \n\nEating disorders are mental illnesses and that means what weight you are doesn\u2019t necessarily effect how you feel, and that carries over to recovery. Recovering into a slim body doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you **feel** pretty or beautiful, no matter how others may view you. I pretty much followed the path you describe in here, but only now after over a year of (more or less) recovery do I actually feel pretty sometimes, and I can assure you that encouraging to people to continue because it gets better has never been any easier for me to say just because I\u2019m still quite slim.",

It struck me as purely attention seeking having little to do with actual recovery and the \"meals\" were meager, totally insufficient. I think that if someone wants to be an influencer but doesn't have celebrity or talent this is a niche that will attract viewers and they know that. Otherwise, who would spend 10 minutes watching someone sip a drink and talk about nothing? Lol. It was insufferable.",
