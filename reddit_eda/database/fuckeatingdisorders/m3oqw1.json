  "selftext": "I fucking did it.\n\nI made it to March 2021. I gave up purging, compulsive exercising, and food restriction every single day, for 366 days. I gained the weight, I honored my extreme hunger when there seemed to be no end in sight, I ignored the exceptionally terrible thoughts about myself every time my body demanded more food. I kept telling myself it wasn\u2019t my fault that my brain was fucked up when I\u2019d grip the new fat deposits distributed to my trunk and, in that moment, seriously contemplated relapse. On March 12, 2020, at approximately 10:30 am, I gave up the  simultaneously monotonous and chaotic lifestyle that is anorexia that I had been drowning in for years, and clung to recovery like it was my lifeline.\n\nI\u2019m not foolish enough to call recovery a cakewalk, however. In fact, it\u2019s been quite the opposite experience; the entire process has been the most difficult fucking thing I\u2019ve ever had to do, to date. I cried almost every day for months, and I still frequently fall apart. As recently as December, I would say to myself over and over, \u201cIf I can\u2019t be thin, I\u2019d rather just be dead.\u201d Absolute nothingness would have felt better than the constant psychological agony I was in every waking moment. \n\nOf course, despite the shitshow I perceived my own recovery to be, I now understand that a sick brain cannot think healthy thoughts until it is not sick anymore. A malnourished brain is a sick brain. So it\u2019s no surprise to anyone that, when I was told things do in fact get better with time, I just had to trust them with nothing more than blind faith. \u201cIt gets better when you gain the weigh,\u201d I naturally scoffed at such claims\u2014I mean, haven\u2019t we all? We all think *we\u2019re* the exception. *I* was the exception. What if I\u2019m always this hungry? What if I\u2019m stuck in this disgusting blob of a meat sack for the rest of my life? What if I never accept myself post recovery? What if, what if, what if.\n\nSpoiler alert: I wasn\u2019t the exception. I\u2019m no longer consumed with thoughts about relapses and losing the overshoot weight.  The uncertainty will end. It just takes time, and I\u2019m still in the midst of the unraveling of it all.\n\nNow, my fears haven\u2019t necessarily dissipated. I\u2019m still hyper aware of the physical sensations that my body experiences. The way fat folds when I sit, stand, bend down, breath in and out; the way my stomach dominates the space I take up, especially when I bloat; the way my shirts naturally fit tighter now that I\u2019m no longer flat chested. I\u2019m still terrified that this is my body now. And, naturally, it\u2019s fucking uncomfortable. But Ive been telling myself, \u201cI can tolerate my body just for today,\u201d every single day for a year. What\u2019s another year? Or two years?\n\nMy eating disorder has plagued me since childhood, and succeeded in digging it\u2019s nails into my veins once more in early adulthood. Learning to cope with my body dysmorphia and this incessant need for control in healthy ways means flipping my whole world upside down. My body is still recovering, and the least I could do is give it some leeway. It unreasonable to expect my body to fit into such a tiny, rigid box when such rigidity is the very thing that was killing me to begin with.\n\nLong story short, I do believe recovery is worth it. And I hope you all choose it eventually, when you\u2019re good and ready. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nI think I\u2019ll do either a Q&A or a month-to-month overview of my recover and the psychological and physiological outcomes in the next day or so, so if there is anything you\u2019d like to ask feel free to.",
