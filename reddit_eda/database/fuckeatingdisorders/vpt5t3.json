  "title": "Serving size of oats",
  "selftext": "Does anyone actually eat a half cup of oats? I don\u2019t have a measuring cup but I do have a measuring scale, which (unfortunately for my ED) is much more accurate. Do people actually eat 40 g of oats and feel full? I don\u2019t use my food scale anymore but when I free poured sometimes I was curious as to how much and it was always 50-60 grams and sometimes more. \n\nSeriously, how do they feel full? Is it the toppings? I cant have PB in the house bc my brother is allergic and I refuse to buy protein powder because I literally\u2026 considered dry teaspoons of it meals and snacks. And they always put almond milk in it. Never like\u2026 soy or coconut or whole milk. Or fucking WATER. Growing up my mom made me put 2% milk (not a restriction thing I just thought American whole milk was gross) and a bit of butter and that filled me up. But almond milk or water???? \n\nAnd I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s recovery influencers, it\u2019s like gym bros too?? Huh?? Y\u2019all are big boys how is 150 calories enough for you??\n\nIf I eat that little I either gotta get another portion or eat a bit of cereal or some shit. Im sorry Im BAFFLED. I have had these thoughts since my first failed recovery attempt in 2019 when I actually measured out 60-80 g because I was like \u201cfuck the wiead girlies\u201d ONLY TO FIND OUT ITS NOT JUST THEM. IM REALLY FUCKING MAD ITS PEOPLE IRL TOO. \n\nIn the worst of my ED I went down to an oatmeal package worth of >!27 g!< that\u2019s >!100 calories!< exactly. Measured out using loose oats because I didn\u2019t trust the packets but also they were kinda more expensive for what you get. \n\nThe best thing in recovery that happened to me was a friend giving me TWO packets of plain oats and putting a HEAPING teaspoon of jam in it. She used water only because she preferred it and asked if I wanted to put oil in it and offered some almonds. I said no but snacked on two almonds while it cooked. AND THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I FELT FULL AFTER EATING OATS IN MY LIFE. At the time I also got full early and put oats on my fear list BECAUSE OF THE STUPID 40 G SHIT. \n\nMy brother and dad also eat two packets of the sugar kind. So maybe I am wrong and not everyone follows the half cup thing. I also like to think that they\u2019re tall men and need more food than me especially since my brothers active. BUT I ALSO NEED MORE FOOD IM TRYNNA GET MY PERIOD BACK AFTER FOUR YEARS. I do not care y\u2019all can slap me if I continue to measure my oats after I get my period back. I will always eyeball it and it\u2019ll probably be more than a half cup who CARES. \n\nI\u2019m sorry I really love oats but these motherfuckers are ruining my brekkie and occasional lunch or dinner. Suck my dick 40 g gym bros an extra 10-20 g won\u2019t kill you.\n\nEdit: I literally didn\u2019t expect anyone to respond to this post. But from what I\u2019m understanding we all have different preferences of oat, whether you\u2019re in recovery or not. Sometimes 40 g fills you up depending on how you cook it, sometimes you need a bit more. I\u2019m just glad I\u2019m not the only one to overthink this shit. Eat your oats how you want, but remember that one packet alone cooked with water isn\u2019t a meal, it\u2019s a snack.\n\nEdit 2: I just had like over 80 g of oats with almond milk and a banana and an hour later i\u2019m super hungry I feel like y\u2019all lied to me. Maybe protein helps but egg whites and protein powder remind me too much of me at my worst so i\u2019ll have to find another way",

Unfortunately it doesn't seem like that works the same for everyone else but I'd say to anyone who has problems with measuring food obsessively to at least try it. \n\n\nObviously you have to be at a point where you can trust the package enough and some people might actually be more accepting than they'd think. I think if you have a problem with nutrition labels, which is even more common for sure, any food, portioned or not, is going to seem \"wrong.\" But with the packets- again, for me personally -I find it so helpful. \n\n\nI'd like to say if you're more of a binger that might be something to try but everyone's at different points in recovery. \nHonestly I think a lot of it is that you can eat the whole package because it's just one portion, you don't have to stop yourself. Kind of the same appeal Halo Top always had for me - I could eat the whole container and it's fine but Ben and Jerry's not so much. \n\n\nI know this post was specifically about oats, OP, but I figured I'd add my experience with regards to pre-portioned food in case someone else here might find it helpful. While I'm at it some of my favorite foods that come like that are: Skinny Pop or a similar brand, Goldfish, cereal variety packs, salad dressing cups, Pringles snack packs, and Jif to go cups but unfortunately when I went to buy those last week there had apparently been a recall on all Jif products so I had to get the Skippy packets which are more inefficient and messy than little cups.\n\nTL;DR: Many of your favorite foods might come in packaging like that so if anyone thinks it might help them, I'd say to check around online if your store doesn't have that option for a certain product.",

Unfortunately it doesn't seem like that works the same for everyone else but I'd say to anyone who has problems with measuring food obsessively to at least try it. \n\n\nObviously you have to be at a point where you can trust the package enough and some people might actually be more accepting than they'd think. I think if you have a problem with nutrition labels, which is even more common for sure, any food, portioned or not, is going to seem \"wrong.\" But with the packets- again, for me personally -I find it so helpful. \n\n\nI'd like to say if you're more of a binger that might be something to try but everyone's at different points in recovery. \nHonestly I think a lot of it is that you can eat the whole package because it's just one portion, you don't have to stop yourself. Kind of the same appeal Halo Top always had for me - I could eat the whole container and it's fine but Ben and Jerry's not so much. \n\n\nI know this post was specifically about oats, OP, but I figured I'd add my experience with regards to pre-portioned food in case someone else here might find it helpful. While I'm at it some of my favorite foods that come like that are: Skinny Pop or a similar brand, Goldfish, cereal variety packs, salad dressing cups, Pringles snack packs, and Jif to go cups but unfortunately when I went to buy those last week there had apparently been a recall on all Jif products so I had to get the Skippy packets which are more inefficient and messy than little cups.\n\nTL;DR: Many of your favorite foods might come in packaging like that so if anyone thinks it might help them, I'd say to check around online if your store doesn't have that option for a certain product.",
