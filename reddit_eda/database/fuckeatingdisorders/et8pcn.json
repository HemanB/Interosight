  "title": "Why is everything about calories?",
  "selftext": "The explore page on my instagram is full of comparisons and charts of the calories in food. The nutrition subreddit, and all of reddit it seems, is about calories --> \"healthy food can have more calories!\", \"don't have snacks between meals because they have calories!\". If anyone mentions at all that not all calories are equal, they get downvoted to hell and linked to fatlogic. \n\nIt annoys me to no end when people post calories count accurate to the nearest calorie especially their daily intake. Like even if you weighed everything yourself, there would be uncertainties in the amount of sugar in each of your fruits. If it was prepackaged, that precise number is only possible because the number is +/- standard deviation divided by sqrt(N) where N is the thousands of products made but the particular one you bought is still +/- s.d. At most, your precision for each item of food might be to the nearest 10 calories. Across the whole day, you're looking at a +/- 50 kcal range. \n\nAlso, as anyone who has found kernels of corn in their poop knows, not all food is digested. The digestive system is not equally efficient at processing all energy sources. Some people genetically have a higher fraction of brown fat, allowing them to burn fat more easily to stay warm. BMI is supposed to be applied to populations, individual health risk is more to do with genetics, visceral vs. subcutaneous fat, muscle vs fat% etc. etc. etc. etc.\n\nBut fuck having a nuanced discussion right? Let's keep pretending we care about health.\n\nTLDR: nutrition is like quantum physics. some people think they know everything when they know fuck all about it",

I know it's my problem to avoid my triggers but when reddit is shoving the word 'calories' in my face absolutely everywhere and not always in accurate ways it's super unhelpful. I'm not denying that calories are important to nutrition but they really aren't the only things that are important to having a healthy lifestyle.",

But once its brought up or i see it theres no stopping the disordered thoughts about food. Its so annoying, awhile ago I got a post therapy treat at starbucks that was a heavily modified frappuccino that's my go to safe good treat and some random woman i dont even know saw me grab it when they called it and said to her friend \"it still has at least X amount of calories even with the almond milk and sugar free syrup\" and it made me so upset i couldn't even drink it. If i was a drug addict at least i could just not be around other users but with this theres no getting away from how many people are just willing to throw around calorie counts for funsies\n\nNutrition is more than just calories! A good balanced diet of grains and protiens and veg and fats are all so important and i just want to be able to regulate that without the counting but everything seems to pull me back to the number talk",
