  "title": "Your Average 'Recovered and Leaving Sub' Post",
  "selftext": "Hello all, haven't talked much on here in quite a while as I've pretty much recovered and getting on with my life as a graduate. \n\nThought it was time for me to leave the sub. I'm only making a post to say that because some of my posts from when I was struggling were very popular, so if you remember me, I want to show that proper, full recovery from an earing disorfer is possible.\n\nI probably won't be able to give any novel advice (let alone anything more advanced than common sense), but my personal recommendations are: \n\n1. You need to eat way much more than you think you do. \nEDs change your way of thinking and you need to break through any 'maximum limits' you have in your head. Those 'limits' only exist to keep your ED happy, not you and your body. \n\n2. Don't try to set a 'target weight' for recovery. \nObviously this doesn't often work if you have had medical intervention, but if you're recovering on your own. I tried to stop gaining weight 5kg below my set point. It blew up in my face. \n\n3. Eat the food you actually want. \nDo not try to 'fill up' your desire for biscuits or pizza or ice cream with vegetables or rice cakes. Instant binge trigger. \n\n4. Your body dysmorphia is lying to you. \nFor months I was convinced I'd gained 'so much weight'. But then I got weighed recently for a medical thing and I'm the same as my set weight from a year ago. \n\n5. If you binge in recovery DO NOT compensate for it. \nIt kept me stuck in the cycle for months.\n\nThat's all I can think of. I wish everyone well, I hope you all recover and have lovely lives \u2764\ufe0f",
