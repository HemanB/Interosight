  "selftext": "The title is basically the realization I just had. I\u2019ve been trying to restrict back to \u201cnormal amounts\u201d to be able to slowly move into a more healthy routine of eating habits and so on however I\u2019ll be very upfront- it was literal hell. And I\u2019m talking HIGH restricting, basically what a normal person would convine in a day yet I was miserable. The cherry on top of the sundae was the reaction my body had to these few days of seemingly normal amounts however. My hair immediately started falling out like crazy more than before( and it was BAD before) so now I\u2019m here, after a night of honoring all my hunger. For the love of god please, no one here is a special snowflake and your body IS NOT a science experiment. Our bodies are fragile and weak right now and if they\u2019re asking for something, trust me it\u2019s for a reason. And anyway I\u2019m so sick of being hungry to the point of breaking down in tears, or having half of my hair fall out every time I brush it. If that means eating EVERYTHING I truly want and gaining weight, so be it, I\u2019m tired of putting my and others\u2019 mental health at risk. Also I\u2019m stopping my classification for these night eats as ,,binges\u201d because I\u2019ve come to understand they\u2019re FAR from binges. I wish everyone a calm day/night and remember if anyone wants to share or needs support they can always do that under my posts! \u2764\ufe0f",

I knew I wasn\u2019t eating as much as a truly wanted and needed, especially since I was compensating with excessive exercise. I was convinced I was doing the right thing because I was out-eating most normal people, but your body doesn\u2019t care what others eat, only whether you\u2019re eating enough for your body and energy needs!",

I was trying \u201cintuitive eating\u201d as well until it turned back into telling myself I\u2019m not actually hungry to the point of feeling like shit, and crying when it was actually time to eat (which sucked considering I had made so much progress.)
