  "selftext": "Fuck you in particular, ARCTIC ZERO. You don't deserve to be in the same freezer aisle as ice cream. Your first ingredient is water. It's like eating a bunch of ice blended with a hint of artificial flavor. It's not good.\n\nGone are the days of being willing to suffer through these sorry excuses for ice cream. I deprived myself for too long. \n\nWhile we're at it, Halo Top can fuck off too. \n\nIn the immortal wisdom of Ron Swanson, \"be ice cream, or be nothing.\"",
