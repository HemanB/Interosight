  "selftext": "Today I've had a bowl of oatmeal, two low-calorie breakfast drinks, and an English muffin with bacon and an egg. Just finished a regular-calorie breakfast drink. I've gained 1/2 pound total in my two\nweeks of recovery so far. Well, GUESS WHAT ED, I'M GONNA GO OUT FOR DINNER WITH OLD FRIENDS AND YOU BET YOUR ASS I'M GONNA HAVE FRIES. AND I'M GONNA HAVE A PINT OF BEN & JERRY'S LATER, BECAUSE I AM LITERALLY STARVING AND MY BODY NEEDS THAT FUEL. And if I don't finish it, that's okay too. And if I want salad tomorrow, I'm gonna have that, because my body needs nutrients from plants. And then tomorrow I'm going on the ferry and you bet your ass I'm gonna have the salmon and potatoes and grilled pak choi. Because it's delicious and it will help heal my organs and shit. I'm starving. Can't wait for dinner! \n\nAnd if I feel bad after that, and I want to purge, then I'll use my superior anti-purge technique of getting myself off and vaping. Because I deserve to eat. You do too. It's okay to eat and it's okay to eat \"junk\" from time to time.",

You may get second thoughts mid-recovery, but stay strong. You deserve recovering more than anything. Whenever I have the really bad urge to purge, I try my best to distract myself too. I play video games, read, draw, call a friend, take a nap, scroll through social media. . .anything to stop me from engaging in self-destructive behavior. What your eating disorder might think is \u201cjunk\u201d food serves a purpose for your body and gives it the fuel you need when necessary. Keep trusting it\u2019s needs and everything will fall into place. ",
