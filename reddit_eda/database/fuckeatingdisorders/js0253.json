  "selftext": "Hey ya, \nSo I\u2019m been on the road to recovery \nAnd my hunger has finally kicked in\nLet me tell you \nI\u2019m eating loadss \nLike one bowl of oatmeal with tofu and cocoa will not do\nI get hungry again \nMake my myself two slices of bread and an egg with kimchi \nSo that\u2019s two breakfasts already.\nFinally the hunger subsided \nAnd it\u2019s only 8:30 am lol\nI still have the whole day to go.\nLast morning,\nI ate from 5:30 am which I have literally never done. I had to eat because I had to go to the gym beforehand. I\u2019m only doing this because I want to regain my muscle and strength and not to burn calories)\nMy dinner ended at around 7:30pm\nSo no more fasting, nothing\nYesterday I easily ate over 5k, could it be even more than 7k-10k? Possibly!\nI promised myself I wouldn\u2019t weigh myself \nBut this morning, my dad asked me to (he has been getting worried about my thinness)\nAnd yes I have gained than what I weighed two weeks ago but it\u2019s so little.\nI mean, I literally thought I gained at least 10 lbs overnight because of how much I ate. \nI didn\u2019t eat til I was nauseous of course. I was just really hungry. \nAnd whatever I ate felt like it went right through me. Like when I ate, the hollowness was still there. It\u2019s like my body was shrieking in a ghostly manner : moorree food lol \nFinally I ate til satiety.\nI\u2019ll keep doing this til I can\u2019t see my ribs anymore.\n\nEven the coach at the gym said just keep eating, make sure you get your protein, but just keep fueling yourself. If you get too fat in the future, we can always cut. But for now, just eat. And now, I get it.\n\nWe need fat to survive. I\u2019m finally getting it.",
