  "selftext": "... and I still ate breakfast. I hadn\u2019t weighed myself in a a couple of days, extreme hunger has been very bad so I\u2019ve been eating a lot. Suffice to say I\u2019ve gained a couple of pounds. It\u2019s probably just bloating and water (given I haven\u2019t pooped today) but yeah. \n\nI still ate breakfast, still had snacks, still had lunch, and while I\u2019m fighting the urge to restrict today (and have been all day tbh), I know I need to eat dinner. Gonna cook a comforting meal since my stomach feels a little icky. But it\u2019s gonna be ok. I can gain weight. I\u2019m allowed to gain weight. It\u2019s ok.",

It personally took me a while to get over the satisfaction I felt with an empty stomach, since the more it hurt, the more I felt accomplished. Your brain learns to release feel good hormones when it does that, due to the lack of food it normally gets the rush from, so it can literally be addicting physically. \n\nYour body's brain is attempting to rewire itself, and that can cause the teetertottering you're feeling, but it will set itself right eventually.
