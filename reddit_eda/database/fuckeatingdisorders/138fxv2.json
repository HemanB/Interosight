The fear of developing BED makes us all want to go back to our restrictive EDs, which will eventually result in reactive eating because of the constant undereating. We need to be kinder to ourselves and get rid of those negative emotions when we start to eat more again. Also, BED is an eating disorder as valid as AN and I don't get why it is so feared in the ed community when AN has been proven to be deadlier than BED, even if the restriction turned into BED there's nothing wrong with that, you're still worthy of respect and you deserve to get the help you need, but again, this isn't the case for most people. People lurking in ed subs are still fairly disordered and if the sub is left unmodded or modded by the wrong person they can end up allowing pro-ana content, so yeah, be careful with them because the \"pro-recovery\" thing is so vaguely used nowadays.",

      "body": "this is a complicated topic and what happens is based on the specific person, so of course nothing i say applies to every individual. i think people are correct in that restrict/binge cycles are very common but that's different from going from AN to BED. EVERY time i was bingeing in my ED and feeling out of control it was because i had heavily restricted before. and i think in recovery there can be a messy middle ground where you're getting out of a scarcity mindset, getting out of malnutrition, figuring out hunger cues, and it can look like BED because your body and mind are going haywire lol.\n\ni think if people come from a history of restrictive eating it is rare to develop BED in place of it, and more common that people get freaked out by EH and the messy middle ground. EH lasted for 4-5 months for me but can go on for more than a year for some people, which is a really long time to persevere! but while we shouldn't erase the experiences of the people who later developed BED after AN, i don't think it's fair or accurate to suggest that it's \"common\" to develop BED if you try to recover from a restrictive ED. the last thing we need here is to make people more scared to recover and frankly to weaponize the experience of BED sufferers to keep people sick, instead of lifting up and supporting them too",

      "body": "Imo the main difference between reactive/extreme hunger and a binge eating disorder is whether or not it becomes a chronic cycle. It is my belief that after any period of deprivation it is completely appropriate and necessary to make up for the deprivation with a vast consumption of whatever it is that has been lacking (for example we would not think twice about chugging water when dehydrated or having a long sleep when exhausted). Therefore if you are starving you need to eat. A LOT. I know it\u2019s so scary especially when we can\u2019t specifically know how much for how long, but this is where we have to give some trust to our bodies and not try to resist these cues that are there to save us. The \u201cBED\u201d in my mind is more the result of a persistent resistance and then the inevitable reactive hunger that becomes a perpetual cycle over a period of time. I think the only way to avoid this cycle is to from the beginning allowing the body to heal and eventually the extreme hunger will subside and normal eating will resume. Otherwise, yes I do think it can become a never ending cycle of restriction and binging which is more or less what BED is (contrary to the misconception that it is simply just some form of out of control gluttony). Bottom line is our bodies are so incredibly smart and if we allow ourselves to trust them rather than attempt to override their instincts, they most always will get us to where we need to be:)",

          "body": "This, in my opinion, is why so many people can't fully recover. The fear of developing BED makes us all want to go back to our restrictive EDs, which will eventually result in reactive eating because of the constant undereating. We need to be kinder to ourselves and get rid of those negative emotions when we start to eat more again. Also, BED is an eating disorder as valid as AN and I don't get why it is so feared in the ed community when AN has been proven to be deadlier than BED, even if the restriction turned into BED there's nothing wrong with that, you're still worthy of respect and you deserve to get the help you need, but again, this isn't the case for most people. People lurking in ed subs are still fairly disordered and if the sub is left unmodded or modded by the wrong person they can end up allowing pro-ana content, so yeah, be careful with them because the \"pro-recovery\" thing is so vaguely used nowadays.",
