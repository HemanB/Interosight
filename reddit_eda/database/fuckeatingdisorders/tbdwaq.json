  "selftext": "Eating more today made me realize something obvious: despite what my ED tells me, my weight isn\u2019t really that interesting to other people. It\u2019s disordered, self centered and quite silly to think otherwise. I caught myself thinking \u201cwhat would happen if I gained weight in recovery and went back to uni?\u201d. Well, the answer is: nothing. People have more interesting stuff to do than thinking about my weight: socializing, having fun, studying. All the things I\u2019ve been neglecting trying to lose weight to impress exactly no one.",
