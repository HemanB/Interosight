  "selftext": "Since Netflix recently added Zoey 101, a Nickelodeon show, to their roster, I revisited it for my childhood nostalgia. Like other kids shows, although the humor was cheesy, there was a charm to it. But OMG. It\u2019s like the writers on this show were TRYING to instill a fear of food and weight gain into young girls and boys at such an early age. \n\nFor example, the main character and her friends (all thin young teenagers)are all staring at ONE slice of chocolate cake. One of the friends says she feels \u201cweak\u201d because she got the chocolate cake and tries to pass it off to her friend, who then refuses it because \u201cshe\u2019s trying to be good\u201d, and then passes it to the other friend, who also refuses because \u201cthat slice of chocolate cake has like a billion calories in it! \ud83d\ude31 \u201c. The friends then decide to \u201conly\u201d take one bite of the cake slice and that\u2019s it. They savor it, and then take one more bite. The friends all exchange satisfied, but guilty looks and the scene ends -_-.\n\nIn another episode, the opening scene starts with the main character saying \u201cUgh, bagels have 300 calories in them\u201d. Along with instances of characters (both girls and guys) saying that macaroni and cheese is \u201ctoo carb-y\u201d, calling Thousand island salad dressing \u201cfattening, slapping candy out of each other\u2019s hands, and feeling guilty for eating salad with a bag of chips, it\u2019s no wonder I felt influenced to restrict certain foods even at a young age.\n\nAnother Nickelodeon show, iCarly, shows a teen girl and her guy friend being angry at another girl for DRIZZLING BUTTER on their popcorn, because now it has \u201ctons of calories and is super unhealthy.\u201d \n\nYet another show, Victorious, shows guys complimenting a petite character for weighing 90 pounds -_- (This was Ariana Grande\u2019s character).\n\nThe common theme? They all demonized food and showed unhealthy food relationships to generations of impressionable kids. (They were all directed by Dan Schneider too, a recently revealed pedophilic show director).\n\nI just feel so creeped out and upset by all the diet culture in media that was aimed for CHILDREN -_-",
