  "selftext": "Weighed myself today and was shocked to see that it\u2019s the highest I\u2019ve been in over a year. The past few months, I\u2019ve been self-recovering from restrictive AN, and eating ALOT. Honoring all cravings and hunger. After seeing the number, my ED voice immediately wanted to start screaming at me. So instead of listening to these disordered thoughts, I came up with a list of the ways gaining weight has made my life better. Feel free to comment your own!\n\n- I can actually shave my armpits without them being literal caves!\n- No longer constantly freezing\n- I can wear rings again since they don\u2019t fall off my fingers anymore!!\n- My smile looks so much more joyful since my cheeks are fuller :D\n- Butt and boobs are slowly coming back\n- Cuts and scabs actually heal now!\n- I don\u2019t have to shop in the kids section anymore\n- Real poops. Nuff said.",
