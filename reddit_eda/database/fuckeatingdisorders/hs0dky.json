  "selftext": "Edit : follow up post on why all-in won\u2019t lead to obesity :[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckeatingdisorders/comments/hsexv8/follow_up_post_why_letting_yourself_eat_will_not/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) \n\nHello, I want to share my experience and hope to help some of you who are going through recovery or thinking about starting. **RECOVERY WORKS** if you truly commit to it 100%. It is mentally challenging but I truly believe you all have the strength to work through it. And when you do, what's waiting on the other side is **so, so, soo worth it.** I also want to mention that EDs can be caused by many things - for me, it was caused by **restriction**. I can't say this method will work for everybody but if you can relate to my ED story, I'm almost 99% sure it will.\n\n*My ED background*: I'm 24 F, ED since 15, started out with orthorexia, absolutely obsessed with \"clean eating\" and exercising,  got to a really low weight, then the binge urges kicked in and I turned bulimic. Endless cycles of binging and purging, gaining and losing the same 20 lbs. I thought that I just had weak will power and that if I just tried \"harder\" I can stop binging, stick to a \"perfect diet\" and obtain my \"perfect physique\".  I have soo many journal entries of my \"last binge\" detailing everything I ate (massive 10K binges), followed by a restricting or fasting plan to make up for the binge. It never worked. No matter what kind of diet I was on, low carb, high carb, IIFYM , OMAD, etc etc I've tried them all. I even read brain over binge and tried to just \"let the binge urge go away\" but that never worked for me either. The urge was just SO strong and I could never win against it.\n\n*Deciding to recover:* I've tried to recover several times before but always relapsed back to restriction when the weight gain was too much to handle. But every time I decided to recover again, I rebounded to a higher weight than before.  Finally, in June 2019, I was so desperate that I was willing to try it again, but fully committing to it. I hated who I was and what my life was becoming. I became a liar, a thief, and a terrible friend due to my ED. I lost my period and my health. I felt like I had nothing to lose at that point. My binging and purging was making me so hopeless and miserable, &amp;amp; I wasn't even losing any weight anyway.\n\n*How I recovered:* Some of you might know this as going \"all-in\" - removing all restrictions around food.  **Not only the type of food but also the amounts you eat, when you can eat, how many times you can eat, remove ALL restrictions.** I was doing keto and intermittent fasting prior to recovery, but the day after I made my decision, I said fuck it to my food rules and meal timings.  I used to be obsessed with \"clean eating\" so it was **extremely** scary and difficult for me to eat \"junk food\", and yet I would go through loaves of bread with PB, whole sleeves and packages of cookies, rice, noodles, fried foods, boba, etc etc. My hunger and cravings were intense; I ate from the moment I wake up until I go to bed, sometimes even waking up in the night to eat. I only stopped eating if I truly felt full and satisfied, not because I thought I \"should\" stop. This is the hardest part of recovery because of how mentally challenging it is to eat the foods that you've been labeling \"bad\" , dealing with guilt, shame and fear surrounding the weight gain. But **giving in to your hunger and cravings is absolutely** **necessary and crucial,** in fact, **I would say the more you can truly let go and just eat, the faster you will recover.** If your let your ED voice hold you back from eating, you will stay in quasi recovery where your body will hold on to the weight &amp;amp; you'll still have all of the ED thoughts and patterns. Eventually, you will give into restriction and start from zero, and probably rebounding to a higher weight when you try recovery again. So please, trust me and trust the others who have gone through this, so you only have to do this once. Give in to your cravings and gain the necessary weight, because that is the only way you will lose the binge urges. **Doesn't matter if you aren't underweight to begin with (I was not), it is still the same process, because the binge urge is largely mental. It is triggered by restriction.** \n\n**How you eat at the beginning of recovery is NOT FOREVER. The more you give into cravings, the less attractive the food will seem and the less desire you will have for it.** It becomes just another food option you can choose, rather than something that is bad and evil and will make you fat and therefore you MUST NOT EAT it (this is exactly what triggers binges). After a while you will find yourself satisfied after only a few servings, or sometimes you wouldn't have any cravings at all. Nothing is off limits for you so your body no longer thinks it is necessary to \"go all out\" whenever you have a particular food. I can guarantee you that. I never thought it was possible to say no to cake (because I truly didn't want it rather than restriction), or stop eating after a few bites of something, but now that is exactly what happens. I don't even think about food at all until I'm actually hungry, and I still let my self eat whatever I want. Your food preference will change throughout recovery. Some days I want to eat whole foods and other days I want fried chicken or pizza. **I no longer label foods as good or bad, they're just food with more nutrition or less nutrition.**  \n\nAs my appetite normalized and I started eating a more \"normal\" diet, my weight dropped effortlessly without trying, without counting calories or restricting anything, I couldn't believe it. I now maintain a very healthy weight I am happy with and it takes NO EFFORT at all. But I must warn you that **you have to forget about losing weight when you start recovery.** You will have a very hard time letting yourself truly give in to your cravings while you have thoughts of weight loss in the back of your mind. You are not recovering so you can lose weight. You are recovering so you can get your life back, feel happy, enjoy life, say yes to spontaneous and new experiences, enjoy food, get your health and period back and so much more. **Losing weight is a side effect of you being healthy mentally** \\- when you truly heal yourself from restriction and love your body, your body will love you back by being healthy. **The perfect weight for you is not a number, it is a state of being - you will feel energetic, vibrant, light, and you will maintain a healthy body/weight without trying.** \n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR on how to recover:\n\n* remove all restrictions. Eat whatever you want, however much you want, whenever you want.\n* Do not judge yourself for eating anything. If you want cake for breakfast, have cake for breakfast. If you want an entire loaf of bread, have it. Detach all morals and labels regarding food.  \n* Eat until you're truly satisfied and do not want more, not until your head tells you it's too much.\n* Repeat the above steps and have FAITH in the process. \n\nI know gaining weight is easier said than done, so I want to share some tips that helped me during that time :\n\n* Do not body check. Cover mirrors if you have to. \n* Buy new clothes that fit you. Toss out clothes that are triggering, even if they are new or expensive. \n* Do not weigh yourself\n* Clean out your social media and make sure you don't see anything triggering. Follow body positive and recovery accounts instead\n* When you feel guilty about eating or gaining weight, write down everything else you gain besides the weight. ex: getting your period back, having more energy, better sleep, better mood, more presence in life &amp;amp; in relationships, etc. Read this list every time you feel guilty.\n* See this process as a challenge. Letting yourself eat isn't you being \"weak-willed\" , in fact it takes a MUCH stronger person to go through recovery, deal with weight gain and etc. It takes tremendous mental strength and definitely says something about you as a person. Believe that you have what it takes to conquer this challenge.\n* Tell people you trust and get support, or find support online. Support is very important because you will have moments of doubt and you might need someone else to reassure you. If you are struggling right now you can PM me, I will be there for you.\n* If others ask, tell them is a medical condition and that the doctor said you have to gain weight to be healthy. Or if you are into fitness like me, simply tell them you're bulking. This is also why support is important. Some people might not understand what you're doing but you must know that is the best thing for you to do.\n* Journal your thoughts\n* Watch Youtube videos of people doing similar things, like Stephanie Buttermore, Kayla rose and others \n\nThis was a very long post if you read it all the way through, thank you. This is all I can think of for now and I sincerely hope it helps somebody. Feel free to ask any questions or reach out to me for support. I'm rooting for all of you and I believe you can reach the light at the end of the tunnel.",

Initially there will also be a lot of water retention as well, but it will come off as you go . As for the weight thing , I can\u2019t promise what weight you\u2019ll be after recovery, but I do think the body has a natural set point range it prefers , so probably something similar to your pre ED weight but may not be how much you weighed when you were heavily restricting/purging. I\u2019d suggest just not attaching to any weight goal for now and focus on recovery and trust your body to do it\u2019s thing . Your metabolism will heal and your appetite will change . \n\nAs for clothes , it depends how triggering it is for you. If you can stash it away and not see it / have it not trigger you it might be ok, as long as  you\u2019re not holding onto the idea that you\u2019ll fit into them again .

They use food as a coping mechanism to escape whatever issues they didn\u2019t want to deal with . That is true binge eating disorder which is totally different from restriction induced binging . That\u2019s why I mentioned in my post that this is specifically for dieting and restricting induced binging . It\u2019s highly highly highly unlikely you\u2019ll eat yourself to be obese because your body has a built in mechanism to prevent that kind of weight gain if you don\u2019t have the same emotional attachment to food as the 600lb people . Food is basically their drug, the only thing that makes them happy. It\u2019s a different situation.",

As for stretch marks , that is also something I\u2019ve learned to just accept- and honestly it is a very normal thing to have on anyone . This whole journey really is about learning acceptance and being okay with your body no matter what . Even if you can\u2019t LOVE the way you look, at least try to be neutral . See your body as a tool that allows you to go through life and experience things . If the purpose of chalk is to write on the black board , is it really necessary to be hung up on the size , shape , and color of it ?   Also, were you actually happy or confident when you were smaller ?  Some food for thought :)",

I need to build muscle and burn fat\u201d.\n\nAnd I started off doing things that I just enjoyed . I like to dance so I took dance classes . I like lifting so I lifted weights . NEVER any cardio or anything for the sole purpose of burning fat .\n\nI think it\u2019s important to only workout when you truly want to because you will build a positive connection in your brain . Then you will see exercise as something fun and you like , and you\u2019ll naturally want to do it because it feels good . So now I\u2019m back to a 3-4x exercise routine but I thoroughly enjoy that, not forcing it at all. But whenever you force yourself to workout out of fear of weight gain, you\u2019re building a negative connection and soon you\u2019ll start to see it as a chore . \n\nHope this helps!",

It felt like an excitement almost , like \u201c I want to move my body! \u201c instead of \u201c man I should workout since I haven\u2019t for 3 months . I need to build muscle and burn fat\u201d.\n\nAnd I started off doing things that I just enjoyed . I like to dance so I took dance classes . I like lifting so I lifted weights . NEVER any cardio or anything for the sole purpose of burning fat .\n\nI think it\u2019s important to only workout when you truly want to because you will build a positive connection in your brain . Then you will see exercise as something fun and you like , and you\u2019ll naturally want to do it because it feels good . So now I\u2019m back to a 3-4x exercise routine but I thoroughly enjoy that, not forcing it at all. But whenever you force yourself to workout out of fear of weight gain, you\u2019re building a negative connection and soon you\u2019ll start to see it as a chore . \n\nHope this helps!",
