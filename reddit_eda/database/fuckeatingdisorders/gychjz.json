  "selftext": "It was mental torture. \n\nMy BMI was >!16!< and I consumed >!1200-1400!< calories which may not even seem that bad. I maintained that BMI for 3 months until my body couldn\u2019t handle it anymore and I absolutely couldn\u2019t stop eating for 2 weeks straight once I started self recovery. It\u2019s been 2.5 months now. \n\nI\u2019ve had body issues and restricting my food intake since I was 12, but it really got the worse about half a year ago when I wanted to lose \u201cjust 5 lbs\u201d after a vacation, which spiraled to seeing how I could manipulate the numbers and \u201cI\u2019ll lose a little more just in case I need wiggle room\u201d and all that temporary bullshit. \n\nLooking back now, as sad as I am to put myself through that, I feel like I needed that first hand self experience to realize how miserable and torturous that was. I\u2019m able to go out to brunch with friends now (albeit still get hella anxious hours and days before, but I need to keep doing it), I\u2019m able to eat peanut butter and pastries that I banned myself from eating for far too long, I don\u2019t have chest pains anymore, I\u2019m not thinking about food 24/7, etc. I\u2019m still not at a healthy BMI and am in this quasi recovery thing, but gaining >!7 lbs!< was honestly the least my body needed. Fuck the mental torture and sad life I had. I need to make up the years from restricting my damn social life when everything opens up again.",
