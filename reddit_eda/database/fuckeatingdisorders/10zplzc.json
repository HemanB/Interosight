  "selftext": "This is my first time posting on Reddit ever and I just had to rant because I\u2019m just so upset and mad at our fatphobic society.\n\nSo a little background: I\u2019m a bit underweight at the moment from severe restriction and I had all the symptoms of restriction: no period for about 8 months now, being cold all the time, hair loss, dry skin patches, low libido and no energy to do anything.\n\nRecently I got a part time EMT job and it was a wake up call for me to start recovering since I had to transport and lift patients safely and I was putting their health at risk if I dropped them or couldn\u2019t transport them properly. Also I was just so sick of everything that my ed has taken from me (my social life, personality, etc) so I went full force into recovery a few days ago or the all in method as u call it. I have extreme mental hunger but I honor it fully and honestly the hardest part has been digestion issues which causes me so much pain every time I eat.\n\nYesterday, I went in for my EMT training shift and they told me that if I could not operate the gurney with at least 200 lbs on it, I was going to have to take time off (at least a month) to build strength and come back. Of course only being a few days into recovery, I didn\u2019t have my strength back and failed to do so. I was so disappointed in myself because it was just another aspect of my life that my eating disorder took from me all because I foolishly believed that being skinny was the best thing in the world. While waiting for my Uber back to my college dorm, I started to cry, and I couldn\u2019t stop even when my Uber got there. My Uber driver was an old man and he was clearly trying to make me feel better but he ended up doing exactly the opposite.\n\nHe asked me what was wrong to which I responded just having a bad day. Then, he proceeded to say well at least you\u2019re a very pretty and skinny young lady. He kept going and told me there\u2019s other girls on campus who are bigger and don\u2019t look like me and that being skinny in America is already a reason why I shouldn\u2019t be sad.\n\nI think this was possibly the worst thing that I could\u2019ve heard in recovery and I\u2019m just glad I\u2019m so set on recovering since this was definitely really triggering. Im having a really hard time mentally from recovery, getting laid off (kind of), and this event, and also physically from so much food, bad digestion, and bloating. My friends and family don\u2019t know about my ed and I just simply want a hug and reassurance from someone that everything is gonna be okay.",
