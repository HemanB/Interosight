I am finally able to keep one down and i savor every bite and thank the pb&j gods for their contribution to my sense of purpose. Not only do i keep it down, i feel good about it. Even if i eat it too fast. I'm sorry pbj but i just missed you so much and i cant help myself. Now you may do your magic and become one with me. We should live together happily ever after. I should write a love song about you. Thank you, pb&j.",
