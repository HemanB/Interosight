  "title": "\u201cBefore\u201d pics make me rage",
  "selftext": "I need to vent. This is long but it helped to just write it mid panic attack. \n\nI\u2019m 12 years very strong in my recovery but something happened over the weekend that triggered me. I didn\u2019t use any behaviors and I don\u2019t feel in any danger of using behaviors but I want to run and scream, I just have rage in my belly.\n\nI was in a \u201cvirtual retreat\u201d over the weekend, like feelings and writing and shit. You\u2019re encouraged to open up and be vulnerable.\n\nWhen it was one woman\u2019s time she shares a poem. Before she did the facilitator said \u201cshow the picture first, you have to show it.\u201d\n\nWithout any kind of trigger warning the woman showed the camera a \u201cbefore\u201d ED pic. Everyone gawked at the emaciated woman, \u201coh wowww! Don\u2019t even recognize you!\u201d [meaning ooo that\u2019s proof her disorder was soooo bad!!! \ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude11]\n\nAnd then she read a very triggering poem about being a very small size. Then another talked about exactly how little she weighed when she was anorexic. The host had an ED at some point so I was surprised she encouraged this.  (although she never received treatment and clearly she\u2019s not educated on the matter)\n\nY\u2019all. I felt so many things in that moment, feelings I haven\u2019t felt in years. I am so proud of how I have taken care of myself since, I have flexed every recovery muscle I have.\n\nBut then, my whole body sunk, my heart started racing, I felt lightheaded, like I was going throw up. Ten years ago this would have probably caused a backslide if not full relapse. I definitely would have been going to the accompanying IG post for thinspo every day. I can imagine what my mean ED voice would say to me about it. It would have been particularly harsh because I never \u201clooked sick\u201d enough to be noticed, but I certainly ravaged my body.\n\nI didn\u2019t speak up at the time because I was just trying to stay present. But today I sent the facilitator an email and posted in the FB group for the retreat. I spent days writing about it, consulting my therapist, my sister who\u2019s a therapist, and one of her colleagues. I sat on it for days so I could drum up some compassion.\n\nThe backlash was actually shocking. Even though I explained why \u201cbefore\u201d pictures are harmful. That the severity of your ED has nothing to do with your weight and size. And that sharing pictures and numbers is dangerous and glorifying, especially with no TW. I wrote eloquently and with kindness and compassion but shared my anger and that my anger is self love. I shared links from many articles and the NEDA website that backed my point. \n\nI don\u2019t know about you all but when I\u2019m triggered like this I have to be outspoken asap so that my ED voice has no room to sneak in. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve made it this far. I\u2019ve been on self care overload since. Relapse is so scary to me. I refuse.\n\nOne woman in the group commented and said they felt unsafe because I was \u201cshaming\u201d the facilitator and they felt attacked. The facilitator said she didn\u2019t feel shamed and that she \u201cheard me\u201d but then said she wasn\u2019t glorifying ED\u2019s, and continued to dismiss and invalidate what I was saying. The poet said she created art and art is supposed to be provocative.\n\nI want to scream. Someone in that group could have relapsed because of that with no warning! Someone\u2019s ED voice said \u201csee, they\u2019re all looking at how skinny she is, you\u2019ll never be that bad, no one will ever care enough about you. Now go do XYZ behavior.\u201d\n\nMy therapist raged hard with me, like she was almost more mad than me.\n\nI\u2019ve lost too many people to their ED\u2019s and \u201cthinspo\u201d stole so much of my life. To me, numbers and photos shouldn\u2019t be shared, at least so casually and without explicit boundaries.\n\nIf you\u2019ve read this far, thank you. It\u2019s been therapeutic to write, and helped me calm my panic attack (which would explain typos).\n\nPlease tell me some of you share this rage. This pain. Survivors guilt? I\u2019m not sure exactly. It\u2019s been so long and I still have to relive this.\n\nETA: I ended up taking down the post, leaving the group, and blocking a few people. I wanted to tell others I see them and speak up for them but their responses sent me into a panic attack and I can\u2019t do any more.",
