  "title": "it's one of those days where i genuinely don't care",
  "selftext": "i woke up at around midnight & i couldn't sleep due to having extreme hunger (which sucks since i'm at a \"normal weight\") i feel as if i'm unworthy of this but i responded anyway. i got whatever i craved & ate it & put on some of my favorite old early 2000's movies to drown out the noise of my ED voice & just enjoy my time. i remember back when i was deeply struggling & this happened i would never ever think to get up to make myself something to eat because it wasn't my \"allowed time\" & i had to wait until 11am to be able to actually consume any type of food. i would spend my time scrolling through food items & what i wished one day i could buy at the grocery store. it was something i never thought i would get again but recovery brought it to me. trust me it isn't easy & i have struggles every single day about how my body looks & how much i'm eating but i always say \"tomorrow is another day\" & maybe i won't eat as much but if i do it's okay & there is always the next day. the only way out is through. i often cry for my past self because i was truly dying slowly & did not have much time left at only 20 years old. i am almost three months in recovery now & i know sometimes i say that i would take it back but on days like today i know that i wouldn't. i took about a two hour nap & am experiencing extreme hunger again but i am just rolling with it. i am tired of working against my body instead of working with it. i may have a breakdown in a day or two lol but i hope all of u take this leap one day because i promise in the long run u won't regret it! u deserve life <3",

I couldn\u2019t sleep ever. Now that I have been through the bulk of my extreme hunger, I found out that.. I don\u2019t really like peanut butter!! Did it take me eating a whole jar in one go during my recovery to find this out? Yes! But you could put it in front of me and I can finally say, \u201cno thanks.\u201d For me, eating at ANY meal time would feel like restriction. Whether I ate small or ate at a buffet, it felt like I could never get enough. So I gave into my extreme hunger and the night sweats the bloating and ... it\u2019s so worth it. There is no constant cravings or food rules or I can\u2019t eat this because it\u2019s breakfast/lunch/dinner. It\u2019s honestly great to eat whatever. Naturally, my hunger is subsiding and I no longer have to eat until I\u2019m stuffed to the brim. Each fear food that I created in the past has bit me back though. In the midst of eating the whole package of Oreos (to which I didn\u2019t care), I was wondering just why I loved them so much. I realized it was because I didn\u2019t allow myself to eat frosting. I would buy it and throw it away. But nope, not anymore. \n\nTomorrow is another day is also my mantra! Remember, your journey is not to lose/gain weight. It\u2019s recovering and soothing your body to be able to thrive healthily. For so long we have deprived BOTH the physical and mental aspects. Yes, you might be full from the meal you ate 5 minutes ago but your mind is still making up for years of negative thoughts. I can\u2019t explain how great it is to not be so food focused because it so boring. Just remember, you are that much closer to your recovery goals. Any thought of restriction or over exercising or purging should be hushed with eating. Eating because you\u2019re  hungry, eating because you\u2019re not, eating because you want to prove the ED monster wrong.",
