  "selftext": "I\u2019ve been recovering. I feel great, and have the energy to enjoy going out again. Me and my boyfriend went to a breakfast diner downtown. I ordered an italian sausage omelette with toast and subbed fresh fruit instead of homefries (not for ED reasons, I just don\u2019t really like this place\u2019s homefries), and a lavender mimosa. Me and my boyfriend also split a giant grilled muffin, it was so good! I was struggling though because we were sitting at the bar, and the girl next to us CLEARLY showed ED signs. Underweight and sickly looking, subbed fruit for home fries, no toast, and got a wrap with only veggies in it. It was so so hard not to look at her the whole time. I feel like I\u2019m sort of failure for being able to recover so easily and gain weight. I couldn\u2019t help but feel competitive when looking at her. I\u2019m so proud of myself for eating what I wanted to for the rest of the day after seeing her, but man it was hard. I hope one day I can get over looking at other people\u2019s food and comparing myself to them.",

Maybe i didn't articulated it properly. \n\nIts just that the risk of suicide isn't something many people think about when they think of eating disorders.\n\nEating disorders usually are associate with low weight. When it comes to eating disorders it's a silent killer and really dangerous. Especially since lots of people think \"healthy\" weight equals being recoverd. But your absolutely right the most victims come from people suffering health issues",

I definitely find myself feeling competitive and jealous around bodies shaped by restrictive EDs, but I just keep reminding myself that there are only two end goals there and I\u2019m on the path that ensures I will be alive and happy in the long term.",
