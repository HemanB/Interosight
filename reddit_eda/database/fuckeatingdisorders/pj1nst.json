  "selftext": "Ok, disclaimer. Of course I don\u2019t mean all men and boys. Let me give you context. Also TW for describing some of their stupid comments.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was looking through body positivity and ED recovery posts on Instagram. People were posting about loving yourself at every size, eat how you like and not how others tell you to, benefits of recovery etc. A good majority of comments are all from actually intelligent people, commenting more positivity and spreading the love. That\u2019s great! But THEN come the grown ass men with \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t be promoting obesity!\u201d,  \u201cas long as you\u2019re eating healthy you\u2019re fine!\u201d, \u201cfat isnt healthy!\u201d, \u201cshe\u2019s so unhealthy why does everyone look up to her!\u201d Ok, you get the picture.   \n\n\nIts not just that. In real life too, I get comments about giving into extreme hunger from my Dad and male Friends. \u201cStop eating so much junk, it\u2019s not healthy\u201d and \u201cmaybe try eating fruit and veg instead if you\u2019re so hungry\u201d and they make jokes about how much I\u2019m eating. GRRR!! I also used to get comments when I was really ill a while ago \u201cyou look fine to me\u201d.  It\u2019s always men! Ok, some women do say dumb things too but it\u2019s 90% men. I also read posts on here about how peoples boyfriends make comments about their body and it triggers them, and I just think, grrrrrrrr.\n\nWhy are men so blind when it comes to ED\u2019s, the body positivity movement and any topics related to that? I just wish they\u2019d shut up and educate themselves before ranting on like idiots. They just think theyre so entitled to give their shitty opinion all the time. Fuck them. This is why I\u2019m gay.",

When I got to the point of realizing that my weight might be an issue I was told *by* cishet men that they preferred \u201csmall/petite women\u201d (not that I had asked) and of course searching for any validation to keep my body at an unnatural, low weight, these comments always fucked me up.\n\nAnd then you go onto fat positive influencers or fat recovery accounts just to read all of these fatphobic comments about someone who literally has zero impact on their life. Tbh I hate when men say \u201cI just don\u2019t find fat people attractive, it\u2019s just a preference,\u201d like it seems really weird to go out of your way to shit on someone for their body and call that a preference, imo. Directing all of that misplaced anger toward women who\u2019ve found freedom in expressing themselves outside of manipulating their bodies for men isnt productive and damaging for *everyone*.\n\nA comment I read from The Anti-Diet book that really resonated with me: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to smash the patriarchy on an empty stomach, or with a head full of food and body concerns, and that\u2019s exactly the point of diet culture.\u201d",

It seriously gets my blood boiling.\n\nOh, and of course, the famous \u201cpreference\u201d card. Shitting on women because they don\u2019t want to have sex with them. Pretty damn sure the women probably don\u2019t wanna have sex with them either, I don\u2019t think patriotic idiots are attractive, I think that\u2019s a shared opinion. \n\nIve never seen that quote before, that\u2019s amazing.",

Seriously though, men going out of their way to reject women who don\u2019t know they exist is peak toxic masculinity tbh.",
