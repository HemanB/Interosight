  "selftext": "Yup, I\u2019m making one of these again.\n\nThis is a recovery focused sub, and for most of us that means we had/have to gain weight and entirely shift the way we view food, weight and our bodies. Intentional weight loss is not something that should be discussed here. Saying to other members, \u201cwhat helped me is losing some weight\u201d is harmful. It\u2019s suggesting to someone, whose circumstances and experiences you don\u2019t know, that they need to change their body. Members, especially fat members, should be able to recover despite what they weigh without feeling invalidated for their ED.\n\nIf you wanna lose weight, that\u2019s fine, it\u2019s your body. But you have countless other subs *specifically for that* so use them. I will not be debating this, thnx.",
