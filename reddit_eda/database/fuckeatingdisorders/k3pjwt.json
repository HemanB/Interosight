  "selftext": "8 months ago during the beginning stages of self recovery I was where some of you are now. Googling information about extreme hunger. Needing reassurance that it\u2019s normal and will stop. It WILL stop ONLY if you allow yourself to eat. And not feeling like a bottomless pit for once is honestly one of the best things about recovery. Not thinking about food 24/7. Being able to live life and eat things that wasn\u2019t carefully made and measured by you. Not feeling like you messed up your day and needing to binge because you ate something you didn\u2019t intend you.\n\nI\u2019m sitting here chillin. Not thinking about food. Not looking up Yelp photos of food. Not hungry. Not stuffed. Not making myself go to sleep hungry. 8 months ago, none of this would have seemed real. I\u2019m literally so happy because my mental space has been cleared from all that bullshit. I can eat a pastry and not feel like I need 10 more. This is because I had to fight and force myself to eat things everyday that wasn\u2019t made by me. I had to challenge myself everyday. It got easier and it was 100% worth it because I don\u2019t have that \u201cfuck it, might as well eat everything!\u201d Mindset anymore.\n\nTrust me this has been one of the hardest things in life. Forcing myself to eat fear foods- basically anything I didn\u2019t make. It was realllly hard at first but you need to challenge yourself for it to be easier. When something becomes normal (eating regular things, fear foods) then it doesn\u2019t become a big deal. \n\nI allowed myself to eat. I ate loaves of loaves of bread and peanut butter during the first few weeks of self recovery. I COULDNT stop eating. I woke up to my stomach sooo tender because of all the food. My body craved FATS sooo badly and that\u2019s what I gave it. Yes I gained weight fast. and you need to gain weight if you\u2019re experiencing extreme hunger. Period. \n\nIt will go away. I didn\u2019t believe it would ever go away either. But it did. And you will be okay. Just let it happen and eat. Don\u2019t let this shit suck you out of life anymore.",

Now I can look at a box of cookies and be like \"meh, I don't think I feel like having a cookie right now\". I can have ice cream sitting in the freezer untouched for days. I almost never feel stuffed after eating. All of this would have seemed impossible to me in the past.",

      "body": "Omg, I have been in AN (6-7 months) recovery for 2 weeks+ ish now and I CANNOT STOP EATING.I meant it literally. I have extreme cravings for foods and my mind is restless until I give in and start eating... and when I start I can\u2019t stop unless I feel nauseous from a full blown \u2018binge\u2019.My pre recovery bmi is 12 and now im almost fully weight restored, it only took TWO WEEKS. I would have two servings of food as my main meals and still find myself having snacks afterwards and it would not stop until I feel physically uncomfortable. I am ALMOST weight restored from consuming 3-5k calories EVERYDAY for 2 weeks now but it doesn\u2019t stop. I still experience brain fog and feel like physiologically and mentally I am yet to fully recover but the weight and fat mass are piling up too quickly... I can\u2019t sleep at night unless I eat alot to the point of extreme fullness before I can sleep peacefully or I\u2019ll find myself wide awake till the sun rises, unable to curb the cravings and mental hunger no matter what i do to distract myself. I need help... my dietician told me to just try my best to curb the cravings and desire to eat but it\u2019s SO hard to fight it because I can\u2019t stop thinking about food... :(",
