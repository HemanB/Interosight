  "title": "I don't have an eating disorder (prose about DENIAL)",
  "selftext": "(reposting from my older account given the attention this sub has lately)\n\nI don\u2019t have an eating disorder. I only eat 1200 calories a day, with less than 30 grams in carbs, take a multivitamin, exercise weekly with an intensive powerlifting routine, and drink 12 glasses of water a day. Because of this, I don\u2019t eat the following: bread, cookies, cake, cereal, oatmeal, fruit, mushrooms, tomatoes, onions, brownies, pasta, thick sauces, ketchup, potatoes, chips, beans, and more. I don\u2019t have an eating disorder- in fact, I have quite a lot of order, and I am healthier than 99% of people and certainly all of my friends.\n\nI don\u2019t have an eating disorder. I\u2019m cold all of the time because I have such low body fat. I hate not being able to go swimming in \u201cwarm\u201d pools in the summer because they\u2019re still too cold for me, and I hate that I can\u2019t stand walking past the freezer aisles in the grocery store because they chill me to my bones, and I hate that I have to hide under my comforter to do my school work because I\u2019m too cold in my room, but it\u2019s the price to pay to be this beautiful. I don\u2019t have an eating disorder, but I wish that I wasn\u2019t so cold that I would be able to wear something outside of layers of thick sweaters and pants to show people the body I\u2019m starving to achieve.\n\nI don\u2019t have an eating disorder. Did you know a tablespoon of peanut butter has almost 100 calories? I know a lot about caloric information. At home, sometimes I\u2019ll walk around the grocery store for 2 hours at a time, admiring the foods I don\u2019t eat, and reading all the nutritional information for the different products, but never bothering to buy anything. I don\u2019t have an eating disorder, I just like to be informed about what I\u2019m putting in my mouth\u2026 and what later comes out.\n\nI don\u2019t have an eating disorder. I only throw up when I\u2019ve eaten so much, my stomach literally can\u2019t handle all the food inside me. Sweet things make me throw up because I never eat them. Also when I\u2019m drinking, but that\u2019s just because alcohol makes me nauseous. I don\u2019t have an eating disorder, but I just can\u2019t stand the thought of the donut I just ate sitting inside me all day, and I\u2019m not even throwing up the whole thing.\n\nI don\u2019t have an eating disorder. I\u2019m not sure why I have headaches all the time, or why my stomach alternates between ravenous and incredibly nauseous. I must be anemic, because I feel that I\u2019m going to pass out in all my classes. I can\u2019t have an eating disorder, because the best part of my day is eating. When I go to lunch, my body is so intent on finally being allowed to nourish itself, that I shove people out of the way to the cafeteria, I get anxious waiting in line, and I always make sure to sit alone so no one disturbs my bliss. I eat as slowly as possible, and scrape the plate for every last crumb of food. Of course I don\u2019t have an eating disorder, how can someone with an eating disorder love food that much?",
