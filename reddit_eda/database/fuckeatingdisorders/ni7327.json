  "selftext": "So I've been in all-in recovery for 4 months but I was quasi recovered for a year previously.\n\nDuring my quasi recovery I had a protein pancake obsession and literally ate them every fuckin morning. The thought now makes me 1. Feel extremely ill and 2. Feel sorry for my past self because I literally handwashed our blender on a daily basis -- yet it was so worth it to me because breakfast was the highlight of my day. ESPECIALLY because it took a full hour to make and eat. I liked to spend as much time with food as possible.\n\nI can't wrap my head around it since food is so insignificant to me now, though I know that fixation was natural for a body experiencing famine.",

I feel like I should try something else on the menu but the staff would probably freak out because they know my order by fucking heart and start making it as soon as I walk in the door.

My aim in doing this was 1. To stop being hungry all the time and 2. To regain my passionate personality.\n\nSince I\u2019d been in a calorie deficit for two years, I was starving all the time at first. A lot of people say their hunger settles after the first month but it took me like 2 months just to stop needing >!10,000ish calories!< a day (although I did get my period back after the first month since I\u2019d gained about half the weight back by then) and I\u2019m still eating a lot (though no longer gaining).\n\nA lot of people have a difficult time with this because it requires completely ignoring your ED and trusting that your body knows what it\u2019s doing AND learning to like your body at a higher weight\u2014 all of which are insanely hard, so it\u2019s good to have support if you go for it. Personally, I read around 10 recovery books as well as every single recovery blog post I could find, and watched a bunch of Tabitha Farrar\u2019s YouTube videos and that helped me warm up to the idea and challenge preconceived notions I had eg that \u201cthin people are more attractive.\u201c\n\nThe reason \u201call-in\u201d works is because, as well as restoring the weight you lost which allows for greater clarity of mind, you are wiring your brain to no longer be afraid of weight gain by eating all the foods you were scared to eat previously. In a nutshell, you\u2019re teaching your brain that weight gain is a good thing because you\u2019re going out of your way to gain weight.\n\nOtherwise, there are other great recovery methods so you could look into those too\u2014 this is just what worked for me.",
