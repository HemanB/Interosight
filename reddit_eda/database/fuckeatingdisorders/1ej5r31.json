  "title": "Yall gotta stop posting every damn thing you eat in a day\u2014it breaks rule 4.",
  "selftext": "There is absolutely no reason to list every single thing you ate in a day. Especially when many of the posters/commenters that are guilty of this are still restricting and are more concerned with seeking validation (usually a \u201cyou didn\u2019t eat too much!\u201d So they can justify continuing this behavior) than whether or not the contents will trigger other members.\n\n**But why does it break rule 4?**\n\nBecause it breeds competition among members, a common behavior among ED sufferers. If one user ate xxxx calories by honoring their extreme hunger or from a reactive eating episode, and saw that another user had, say, two cookies, a few handfuls of granola, a half cup of fat free yogurt and a whole pint of \u201chEaLtHy\u201d icecream and is freaking out despite the fact they likely still didn\u2019t meet their minimums, it could cause the first user to compare themselves to the other\u2019s intake. Thus it could begin the cycle of feeling guilty or like a failure for eating so much when others are clearly sicker than them (note: they aren\u2019t, that\u2019s just the thought process), and may lead to a relapse or further restriction to prove they\u2019re sick enough.\n\nIs that always the case? No, of course not. But this is **a safe space** and everyone deserves to feel safe here. It is *not* a space to seek validation on your restrictive mindset from members who also need support.\n\n**Note**: I don\u2019t care that you post about a specific food or that you\u2019ve eaten nothing but oatmeal during extreme hunger\u2014I care if you list quantities and possibly calories depending on the context. If you have any questions about this rule, please don\u2019t hesitate to ask and I\u2019ll try my best to clarify! And if you see posts like the ones mentioned here, for the love of god, *please* report them. I\u2019m not always monitoring this sub but I do get notifications for reported posts immediately, and there are two other wonderful active mods who will see to them if I don\u2019t.",
