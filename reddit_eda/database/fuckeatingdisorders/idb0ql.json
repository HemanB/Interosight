I\u2019m 24 but I wanna go trick or treating, or at least eat some fucking candy (haven\u2019t done in years, even when I took my nephew I just gave it all away because of the anxiety it caused me or it just sat until it was too old to eat) and watch horror movies without restricting the day before and after and hating myself afterwards. And same for thanksgiving and Christmas too! I\u2019m so excited to finally get things for Christmas that aren\u2019t fucking food related for once.",

      "body": "That's a fantastic goal!  You could make mini goals/steps leading up to the fall to help you achieve it.  For example, last Christmas I had a goal to go rock climbing in red rocks with my partner.  I have always been terrified of eating out because I couldn't track the calories.  Plus, there was the fear of stepping away from the gym for 1.5-2 weeks.  I started by being okay with taking rest days once a week then twice a week.  Grabbing a random doughnut or ice cream with my partner was another small step along with not restricting around doing so.  Then I built up to eating a full meal out more regularly. \n\n\nIt was so worth it!!!!!   I got to enjoy a new experience and be more present in the moment.  My strength and body went back to normal after a week or two.  You can do this!",
