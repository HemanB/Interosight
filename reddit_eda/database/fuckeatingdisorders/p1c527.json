  "selftext": "That\u2019s the post. For the first time in years, I had three meals and didn\u2019t \u201cintermittent fast\u201d and shit. Had breakfast (major challenge), lunch that had a sandwich with TWO slices of real bread, none of that fake ass one slice sandwich shit, and dinner. I was so scared at the beginning of the day, but now I\u2019m kinda in that state of \u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck anymore\u201d? Yeah all that food in me is triggering, but I love the feeling of being mentally and physically at peace, along with reduced thoughts of food and body image. I was able to make memories today. Today was a good day, that\u2019s all I\u2019m trying to say.",
