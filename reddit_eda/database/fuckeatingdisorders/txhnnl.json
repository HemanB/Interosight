I need to actually eat properly and stop compulsively exercising. nothing bad will happen if I sleep all day and not move at all. nothing bad will happen if I just eat and sleep and rest all day. nothing bad will happen even if i eat 1000 more cals than usual or 2000 or 3000 and don't exercise it off. nothing bad will happen if I actually satisfy my extreme hunger and STOP COMPENSATING.\n\nin fact, good things will happen. i will gain happiness. i will gain my life back. i will gain my energy back. i will be able to accomplish my actual goals. i will have friends again. i won't be miserable every single night because i'm so exhausted from overexercising and restricting. i will go to bed full and satisfied. i will not be constantly thinking of food.",

To know someone out there has almost literally the same thoughts as me doesn\u2019t make me feel so alone.  \n\nToday I have 40 mph winds outside and was going to force myself to battle them just to get my walking in (desk job).  It\u2019s ok if I don\u2019t, the world is not going to end.  And, if I don\u2019t, I still can eat the same amount I normally do (and need to eat way more).  \n\nI think of gaining weight often as a failure, but looking at that things you outlined the GAIN is so much more than that.  \n\nStay strong!  Good vibes only!  \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb \ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffb",
