  "selftext": "yall I feel like sometimes we even fail hardcore at supporting each other to recover, like EDs are competitive as fuck so like \"omg ur doing so great eating that it makes me feel like shit that I'm not recovering\" and like yeah, sometimes I do genuinely feel like that, but sometimes I feel superior for *not* being in the healthiest place? Like how tf does that make any fcking sense this disorder could fucking kill me but I feel like I'm winning if someone else is doing better at recovery than me? \n\nTl;dr EDs are competitive and make no sense and sometimes I wonder if unmonitored ED spaces are a good idea tbh",
