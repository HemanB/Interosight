  "selftext": "growing up in an abusive environment conditioned me to think this way. i think it\u2019s been one of the main catalysts for my eating disorder. \n\ni hurt and deprived myself just so that i could look like the girl who had her shit together. i was a people pleaser. i kept my apartment spotless, worked hard in school, and developed hobbies based on what i thought others would approve of. i had the \u2018perfect\u2019 routine, diet and exercise all carefully calculated. \ni hid what i thought were flaws well and acted like i was living this perfect example of life. nothing could go wrong as long as i held up this image. \n\nnow that i\u2019m in recovery though, i\u2019ve realized that no one actually cares. no one bats an eye at what my life looks like from the outside unless theyre going through some sort of identity crisis themselves. i know this because now that the i\u2019m in a better place mentally, i don\u2019t care about other people\u2019s image either. not in a dismissive, mean way, but in a \u201cwhat\u2019s on the surface is only the tip of the iceberg\u201d kind of way. \n\ni realize that living this superficial life really prevented me from realizing that wow, i\u2019m a human being and i\u2019m 1 in 7 billion. let\u2019s go deeper into this whole life thing while i\u2019m here and find peace in the fact that i\u2019m just another living thing. i don\u2019t have anything to prove. ive gained a lot of weight recently? who cares. i didn\u2019t put in 110% effort into that class and my apartments been a mess all week? whatever. some idiot might give me a hard time about those things but maybe it\u2019s them that needs to take a time out and get their ducks in a row. \n\nso yea, sorry if that didn\u2019t make any sense. just venting.",

      "body": "I feel this so hard. I grew up in an emotionally/verbally abusive environment, when nothing I did was ever good enough. I became such a perfectionist. I moved to the other end of the country, and my anxiety started making me so sick. I eventually dropped out of university and felt like I didn't have anything to base my worth on, and that's when I started starving myself.",

I think there's such a big importance in getting rid of that \"invisible audience\" that you feel constantly judging you in your mind. Because truly, even if people \\*did\\* care (which 99.9% of the time they absolutely don't), why should their fleeting opinion dictate how you should live your life?",

      "body": "Thank you for voicing this feeling. While it is hard when people do pay attention or criticize you in the short term, they usually are just nosy and giving attention in that moment. After the interactions are over, they forget about you.\n\n It is very helpful to remember that while you are special in a way (usually to the people who care about you), you are not *that* special. Meaning you are human like everyone else, and like everyone else you will struggle with something. It sucks that our particular struggles involve EDs, but no human gets by without facing some adversity. In a way, it is comforting.",
