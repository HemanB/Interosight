  "selftext": "So I have this guy friend that looooves to tell me how unattracted he is to me for whatever reason. One day he says he just prefers \"skinny girls\". I looked him dead in the eyes and told him he shouldn't bring my figure or weight into any conversation because he knows I'm still recovering from an ED. \n\nIt is so strange to me that all my other friends and family referring to my body as healthy and the \"ideal body\" can be forgotten when fuck head friend says I'm not skinny enough for his dumb little dick to get hard as if I give a shit. Now, I can't look in mirrors again and threw away my scales batteries I used to monitor foster cats weight. I just can't.\n\nI confronted him about it a second time and he said he \"knows how hard it is to lose weight\" after I told him how his comment made me feel in regards to my ED. I am done being his friend. I have worked far too hard to love myself and be healthy for one person to fuck it all up and not give a shit.",

Because in reality, the first time he told you that he was unattracted to you was the moment he deserved to be cut out of your life (and let me clarify that it is NOT your fault that you didn't cut him out right then, hindsight is 20/20) but there are tons of guys like him. There are way too many misogynistic losers who loooooooooove to \"subtly\" make girls/women feel bad about themselves because it makes them feel like \\~big strong boys\\~, and it is never your fault for being a victim to that mistreatment, but I hope you can come to understand that you never have to sit there and take comments like that, not even from \"friends\".",
