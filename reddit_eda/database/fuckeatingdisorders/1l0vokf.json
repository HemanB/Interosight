  "selftext": "As the title said, I am so happy right now. I finally got to the point where my weight is just a number to me. I don't know how. I'm the heaviest ive been in four years and I've never been happier about it. I'm very visibly overweight as of right now, and I started recovery right when I hit a \"\"normal\"\" BMI (ugh, stupid scale). \nIt just goes to show: If you start hating your body, you'll never end up loving it for what it is by forcing it to change. Take that, eating disorder.\nMy fiance and I are getting married next month (if all things go well). We affectionately call me fat and chubby and I've never felt cuter before in my LIFE (I'm sorry if it's cheesy or cringey to say hsjfkg).\n\nI'm still pretty early in recovery and I know I'll have more ups and downs. I just really REALLY wanted to share this with someone because all of my friends are asleep.",

I had fainting episodes and I had cuts that would never heal.\n\n That gave me the courage to start, and finally feeling some sort of peace gave me the courage to keep going. It took a little to be able to accept my  new body and that it was going to keep changing, so I stayed away from mirrors and tried to keep myself off of social media and the scale. It's all internal work when it comes to being okay with weight gain and I was scared for a while.\n\nI say do it, go all in. You are worth living a life that you want to live. Do it scared, and the fear will go away eventually",

The \"All or nothing\" kept me relapsing and stuck mentally. When I realized that a mess up was just a mess up and I could keep going with recovery, I actually began to heal because I no longer punished myself for going against recovery, helping me stop the guilt of being in recovery because what kept me stuck in the ED was guilt",
