  "title": "Why are 'recommended portions' so tiny when we're supposed to eat around 2,000 calories each day?",
  "selftext": "TW: Calorie numbers...\n\nSay you have cornflakes for breakfast. Only eat 40g, the box insists - that's a recommended portion! 140 calories. Add a little more for the milk.\n\nThen say it's soup for lunch. A pretty common occurrence. Except the 'recommended portion' of soup is half a can - less than 150 calories.\n\nFinally, for dinner is the tried and true meat and two veg. A chicken breast, around 200 calories, plus whatever healthy greens you choose to go with it.\n\nI simply don't understand why these portions are 'recommended' when, if obeyed, they'd have us all on  a starvation diet. Is it simple legalities? For example, food companies cannot recommend you eat a full can of soup because its salt content may be high? Or is it just taken for granted that people will be snacking in between meals? In any case, I think it's stupid.",
