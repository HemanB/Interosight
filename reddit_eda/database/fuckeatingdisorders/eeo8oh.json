  "selftext": "I was taking a walk with my best friend yesterday and she wanted to get her nose pierced. She then asked me if I'd get a piercing too, since my birthday is tomorrow she was ecstatic to offer me the piercing as a gift. \n\n\nSo I did it. I got my navel pierced. *sigh* I don't have a flat stomach, I am very self aware of this body part. But I've been wanting to get it pierced for a while now.\n\n\nThe hard part is... I wanna be okay with the fact that I can feel pretty and girly whether I have a flat stomach or not. Body perfection is not a thing. Plus... I love looking down and seeing the sparkly jewel :)  \n\n\nAnd honestly it was so fun to do something spontaneous (no ED overthinking bs) and although we are \"grown-ups\" (she's 31 and I'm turning 28) we were giggling like teenagers and sooo happy with our new piercings :)\n\n\nSo this is a big FUCKYOU to my ED. Thanks for reading xxx",
