There are some traumatic situations where a person might be incapable of going on living if they continued to experience their life fully. For example, a young person targeted with severe sexual abuse without any support system. In a situation like this, an eating disorder may numb their emotional capacity, leading them to not commit suicide when they otherwise would have. Provided the ED itself does not kill them, at a later point in their life this person will have to recover from their eating disorder and process their trauma, but they may have greater access to support at that time. I guess none of this contradicts the idea that there is nothing good about eating disorders because there was nothing good about that hypothetical. I suppose I was just trying to explain that EDs can serve a lifesaving purpose, despite the incredible price they demand in return.",

There are some traumatic situations where a person might be incapable of going on living if they continued to experience their life fully. For example, a young person targeted with severe sexual abuse without any support system. In a situation like this, an eating disorder may numb their emotional capacity, leading them to not commit suicide when they otherwise would have. Provided the ED itself does not kill them, at a later point in their life this person will have to recover from their eating disorder and process their trauma, but they may have greater access to support at that time. I guess none of this contradicts the idea that there is nothing good about eating disorders because there was nothing good about that hypothetical. I suppose I was just trying to explain that EDs can serve a lifesaving purpose, despite the incredible price they demand in return.",

She's very gentle with suggestions for things for me to eat and never forces me beyond my capacity, so long as I eat and within reason, like I can't get away with having weet bix and water for dinner because it's insufficient, but I can have an omelette and/or vegetables and that is okay because it's something substantial and I'm also okay with that. I do get very overwhelmed because I have very few safe foods, but I'm challenging myself almost every day to expand my horizons.\n\nAn afterthought is I hope my original comment may lead people into recovery, this isn't an exaggeration or fearmongering, but the actual reality of this shitty condition when you're stuck in the deep end, and a true hell to endure once you decline to this point which is frankly inevitable. Deterioration of your health is the unavoidable outcome, but you don't have to, you just have to choose recovery. The sooner the better.\n\nMuch love to you!!",
