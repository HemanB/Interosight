  "selftext": "I'm terrified this treatment for many reasons.  I've had so many and I'm in on Social Security Disability for my EDs. I'm also currently overweight/ medically obese, so that's always fun when meeting the new group.  This is my millionth treatment, but feels like this first one for a lot of reasons...\n\nMainly my therapist has gotten me to feel my feelings for the first time at 43. \n\nI can hear the fucking lunch tray cart rolling  and I haven't met the group yet. It's triggering to cry but I'm totally going to and I feel bad about that. \n\nI need support, love, prayers, words of encouragement, whatever.  This is going to be a long day with another snack and dinner before I'm done. \n\nLove you all.  I promise to fight and give it my all.  \n\n\nI fucking hate Ed!",
