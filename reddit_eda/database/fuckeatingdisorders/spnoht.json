  "selftext": "I've only restricted intentionally for 18 days. (Although I've been \"weird with food\" for much longer than that.) I'm not that far in, and I don't restrict to the levels some people do. And yet, I'm taken seriously by my online friends, by my doctors, by my mother, by redditors. Why? I provide my weight for context, and I am underweight.\n\nNo questioning of behaviors, no asking about my fears or obsessions, nothing about the mind. Only the body. \n\nSome people have bodies in the \"normal\" or \"overweight\" range, and they take forever to get treatment, and people congratulate them on their weight loss. It's disgusting. They need help as much as I do.\n\nThe fact that when I do it it's disordered and when people bigger than me do it it's normal is very harmful. Restricting has made me more aware of how the world treats other people with actual eating disorders, and it's terrible.\n\nIs there more information on this somewhere?",

We\u2019re told to not focus on weight with our disorders yet it\u2019s all insurance companies, doctors and even society focuses on to validate us. \n\nIt\u2019s why we should not be medicalizing weight and weight gain/loss and instead be focusing on habits (are you eating well? Have a balanced relationship with food to nourish you? Are you moving mindfully/found exercise that brings you joy and community? Are you sleeping well? Hydrating? Etc). If your weight changes? Then so be it. \n\nTldr; our society focuses on weight. There are books, documentaries and shows about this. Fat phobia is very much so ingrained in our medical community and sadly even In mental health. Locally a big obesity researcher also runs an Ed recovery center which scares me as his attitudes are\u2026. Frightening.",

But the thing is, I have very bad water retention/edema in my legs especially, and that makes my weight fluctuate so much (ranging between edge of underweight, and about 10-15 lbs above that) (I'm petite too so that really makes a difference).\n\nIt feels like fucking shit because I know I need to recover but I am so scared to be honest to ask for help or go to the ER because I'm worried they'll be like, \"yeah right, there's obviously no way you restrict and exercise that much, you're not like emaciated or something.\" And right now I feel like I just need to get to that underweight mark so badly, but I also don't even know if my health right now will allow me to get to that weight. I've been looking things up like \"how to prevent cardiac arrest\" and \"how to get a do not resuscitate\" and \"symptoms of impending heart attack\" and \"how to tell if low heartrate is from anorexia or being fit from exercise\".\n\n\"Anorexia\". I guess if the edema were to go away, then maybe they would then think I am actually anorexic- but if it stays, then somehow it's nothing to be worried about. It hurts so badly and I know it's just a socially constructed diagnostic criteria, and that I definitely have all the symptoms of AN, but it's like it can't possibly be that bad, right? Even though I've lost my period for almost 2 months now too and under my eyes are so purple. It's like I literally cannot keep in perspective how dangerous this is unless I feel like I am on the verge of passing out or worse.\n\nI did go to an urgent care a couple weeks ago and the doc said not to worry about 10-15 lb weight fluctuations and obvious edema because \"people have fluctuations all the time due to a lot of factors like amount of muscle, fluid intake, etc.\". I told him that I exercise 2-3 hours a day even when I feel horrible and he literally said it's not too much exercise because some people train for marathons and exercise even more than that...\n\nUgh.... My point is I get it. Feel free to PM me if you want to talk anytime.",
