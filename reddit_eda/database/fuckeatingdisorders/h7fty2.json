I'm not triggered by my weight and I am so much less sensitive. \n\nSide note: I guess those strong emotions we have come in waves? 3 months ago it was about how awesome my dad was and now I miss people I haven't seen in 10 years.

I heard a theory that the closer you get to the natural size/shape where your body functions most optimally, the ED thoughts and behaviors get less severe. the curiousity about whether it was true really helped keep me going when things were rough in early recovery. I found it to be pretty accurate.\n\nalso yes to the strong emotions and memories that seem to come out of nowhere. They say these      Things come up when your body and mind knows you have the ability and resources to handle them. I don\u2019t know about  this, but it can be a roller coaster.",
