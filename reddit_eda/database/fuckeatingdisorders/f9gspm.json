I realized my brain wasn't going to shut up until I ate more, so I ate more. \n\nSuddenly, I didn't want more food. Suddenly, I could concentrate on things. Suddenly, I had energy to go about the day. \n\n^(WOW ALMOST AS IF EATING ENOUGH FOOD MAKES YOU NOT WANT MORE FOOD WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT)",

Now, i can either a) respond to the hunger if i have food, or b) know it will be at most an hour or two until i can (if im in class, i cant exactly just get up and leave to buy a sandwich).",
