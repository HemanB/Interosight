  "title": "I FINALLY FUCKING DID IT",
  "selftext": "I finally took my really first step forward in recovery, I had a session with tabitha farrar and I felt so fucking Empowered to just unrestrictedly eat and honour my mental hunger whenever I thought of food.\n\nI fucking ate chips and chocolate for the first time in 2 and a half years, followed by fries and ice cream.\n\nAnd for dinner, I had two piece of toast with thick peanut butter. (Since I\u2019m getting use to the bloating)\n\nHell, I might have desert.\n\nTomorrow I\u2019m going to the grocery store with my mom and I\u2019m going to pick out whatever the fuck I want. I\u2019m going to cook dinner for my family and cherish each moment with the people that mean the most to me. \n\nI\u2019m going to accept my new body that I will honour each day by giving it the rest and nourishment it needs. I\u2019ve been sick for far too long, I\u2019ve let Anorexia take control, but I\u2019m taking that control back.\n\nI will love every single part of my body. \n\nI\u2019m not looking back, I\u2019m leaving AN behind. \n\n\nI also want to thank this community for giving me the hope and courage to fight this illness that has stolen so much for me. We all deserve recovery and we all deserve to honour and nourish our bodies \n\nevery.single.fucking.day\n\nRegardless of how much we\u2019ve already ate\n\nRegardless of the time of day\n\n\nWe all deserve to be fully recovered \u2764\ufe0f",
