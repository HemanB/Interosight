  "selftext": "You\u2019ve lost hair.\nYou experience insomnia. \nYou have no energy. \nYou lost your period. \nYou get more headaches and migraines. \nYou get nauseous, especially in the mornings. \nYou don\u2019t feel hunger because you\u2019re so used to ignoring/fighting it. \n\n\nThese are my reasons to eat. I told my therapist all of this and how I fell out of recovery from pandemic stress/job loss/lack of control a year ago and guess what?? These things aren\u2019t normal or healthy. Having to say it all out loud to someone made me realize how bad I got AND THAT I NEED TO EAT. We all do. Not eating is harming my body and realizing that is a major step towards getting back to recovery for me. \n\nWhat are your reasons to eat?",
