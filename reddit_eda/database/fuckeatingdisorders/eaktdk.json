  "title": "Eating disorders and isolation - losing all your friends to stay thin",
  "selftext": "Hi guys, hope your week is going well.\n\nWhen I started my hellish descent into ED, I was relatively popular. People applauded the chubby girl gone thin, asked me for diet tips, all that.\n\nAs time went on, I found it difficult to go out. Going with friends meant eating, as eating was a social thing. All low calorie options meant I\u2019d have to restrict later, and I wasn\u2019t going to waste the daily intake on some pack of fries after a spontaneous trip to Maccas.\n\nAfter graduating, I failed to stay in touch with a lot of people. I lost my best friend of 12 years. I lost my friend group. I have nothing waiting for me in the city I grew up in beyond my mother - I threw it all away in a desperation to have another rib prod out.\n\nLooking back at it, I have regrets. Many regrets. I totally shattered my mental health, I lost everyone I loved... but, them leaving gave me the incentive to recover. Nobody wanted to be around me when I was ill.\n\nIt still hurts. I still struggle to maintain relationships to this day, and it takes a lot out of people to try and be close with me. I\u2019m getting better and all that, but it did disrupt things.\n\nI still feel lonely. I AM lonely. But I just wanted people to know - losing your friends to be a size 0 isn\u2019t worth it.\n\nJust some late night wondering.",

I hate it too, I have skipped out on so many socializing opportunities because of my fear of having to eat in front of other people or having extra calories from beer (even though I dearly love it). I have friends I guess, but I never hang out with anyone anymore and it does suck. I'm an introvert so I'm ok with being alone, but actually spending time with and talking to people is nice and I miss that. \n\nI guess the only thing we can do is force ourselves to face those fears. Good thing about beer though, is it helps!",

Telling someone with a restrictive order that a \"bit of excess fat\" is a bad thing is *fucked up.* ''\n\n\\-> I understand that , its why i am in this group because i have binge eating disorder it wasn't easy for me i failed every time , i just meant to tell OP to try , i do understand its a disorder and very difficult to handle and it might not work out , but i mean is it a better option to tell op eat no food and have this positivity bullshit that rarely gets results mind you , sometimes there is a positive to being negative and telling it like it is\n\n''Weight loss *isn't* always worth it. ''\n\n\\-> if your at a healthy weight or too much lean then yes its not worth it , but if your for sure have excess fat especially in the waist like a lot over the B.M.I or when by Dexa scan's standards then it is always worth it , its just my opinion\n\nAlso in my comment i said excess fat can harm you key word ''excess'' am not talking about the average bit chubby person , that's fine\n\nlastly though i see that i should have made what i was trying to say more clear , still don't think i have done wrong to be down voted so much i still think my comment holds merit , Main OP should try to eat healthy and its not the same as an alcoholic taking a shot , alcohol by itself is not so friendly with one's liver , but food is nourishment to the body if not processed and fucked with like the standard american diet\n\nSuccess is not final and failure is not fatal it is the courage to continue that counts , so [u/nishikikiyama](https://www.reddit.com/u/nishikikiyama/) , it might actually not be a bad idea to try and fail and fail and fail and learn and learn along the way to develop a healthy relationship with food , i believe recovery is possible and is tedious and long , but don't be afraid to try and go out with friends and eat , remember it takes months and years to become obese of fucking up each single day , you have nothing to be afraid of\n\nALL OF THIS IS JUST ADVICE , DO WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU WANNA DO :D",

For example, \"Stacey spoke out against capitalism, therefore she must be a communist\" (she may be neither capitalist nor communist, or a capitalist who disagrees with portions of capitalism). \"Roger opposed an atheist argument against Christianity, so he must be a Christian\" (When it's assumed the opposition by itself means he's a Christian).
