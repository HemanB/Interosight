  "selftext": "After a week of eating totally unrestricted on my honeymoon, I can't go back to eating bland, flavorless crap. I tried some of the ol' eating disorder staples the other day...and it was disgusting. It tasted like nothing and sorrow.\n\nThat doesn't mean eating *junk* food. It doesn't mean eating desserts all the time. It does, however, mean the bullshit foods that I've eaten in an attempt to cut calories.\n\nCauliflower rice in broth?  Burgers without ketchup? Salads drenched with mustard and red pepper? Bland crap smothered in zero calorie sweeteners in a feeble attempt to impart some kind of flavor?\n\nNo more. Food can taste good *and* be healthy.",
