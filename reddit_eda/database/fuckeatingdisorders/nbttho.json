  "selftext": "Look I get it, if it hasn\u2019t worked for you, it hasn\u2019t worked for you. But I\u2019ve seen a lot of hateful posts/comments regarding this form of recovery and I think it can be really harmful and invalidating to others in this sub.\n\nI don\u2019t care if you don\u2019t believe in the science of it or think it\u2019ll make you gain and gain forever\u2014other people are using this method to successfully recover and that *should not* be invalidated, nor should it scare away others who are just dipping their toes into recovery. \n\nIf you don\u2019t personally fuck with it, then you don\u2019t have to do it. But that doesn\u2019t give you the right to shit on what is working for others either. Full stop, period, end of story. Thanks for coming to another one of my TED Talks. \ud83e\udd17\n\nEdit: I chose to lock this thread because there have been a few comments, independent of each other, that are either false, subtly fatphobic, or both and I am no longer going to debate them. This is a recovery focused sub and we do not tolerate fatphobia (like it\u2019s literally in the rules, guys) or bashing other forms of recovery.",

Often people don\u2019t understand that weight gain (especially obesity) are very often a symptom of something else, and not because someone \u201clacks control.\u201d We put the entire blame for being fat on the individual, and ignore the real underlying health and socioeconomic problems that are entirely independent of ourselves; we force the emphasis on weight because diet culture has taught us that weight is relevant entirely by itself, and it. Is. Not.\n\nWe know fat people can be healthy. We know living in poor conditions that significantly exacerbate stress lead to chronic health problems, including heart disease and others that can have weight gain as a symptom (it is *not* just an \u201covereating\u201d problem). We know glorifying thinness and wellness culture are the reasons eating disorders (both restrictive and binge eating) and BDD are on the rise. So yeah, there is *way* too much emphasis on weight, even in the ED recovery community.\n\nEverything else, I agree with. I was someone deeply entrenched in diet culture, on top of being predisposed to anorexia due to genetics and environmental factors and I get the irrationality\u2014to an extent. I don\u2019t obviously can\u2019t change everyone\u2019s minds and I don\u2019t want to, but nobody is entitled to my emotional labor when they won\u2019t listen anyway.

The point is never the individual, the point is the average, and there's no black-or-white definition of what \"healthy\" even means anyway.",

Often people don\u2019t understand that weight gain (especially obesity) are very often a symptom of something else, and not because someone \u201clacks control.\u201d We put the entire blame for being fat on the individual, and ignore the real underlying health and socioeconomic problems that are entirely independent of ourselves; we force the emphasis on weight because diet culture has taught us that weight is relevant entirely by itself, and it. Is. Not.\n\nWe know fat people can be healthy. We know living in poor conditions that significantly exacerbate stress lead to chronic health problems, including heart disease and others that can have weight gain as a symptom (it is *not* just an \u201covereating\u201d problem). We know glorifying thinness and wellness culture are the reasons eating disorders (both restrictive and binge eating) and BDD are on the rise. So yeah, there is *way* too much emphasis on weight, even in the ED recovery community.\n\nEverything else, I agree with. I was someone deeply entrenched in diet culture, on top of being predisposed to anorexia due to genetics and environmental factors and I get the irrationality\u2014to an extent. I don\u2019t obviously can\u2019t change everyone\u2019s minds and I don\u2019t want to, but nobody is entitled to my emotional labor when they won\u2019t listen anyway. A saying I really liked was \u201cyour privilege doesn\u2019t erase your struggles, but your struggles don\u2019t erase your privilege.\u201d\n\nAlso, I\u2019m 100% not trying to come at you at all. I tend to come off really aggressive through text so if i did I apologize.",

          "body": ">I mean, it is fatphobic.\n\nThat's the point - it's not. Not necessarily. Or at least, not in the sense of \"phobia against fat *people*\". Many of us in recovery do not give a shit about fat people honestly - I mean that in a positive sense. You can be afraid of getting fat without having a negative opinion of fat people.\n\nWhen I was at my lowest weight people would comment and say things. Would they be ok if they were at that weight? No. Were they against thin people? Obviously not.\n\n>We know fat people can be healthy. \n\nWe know that everyone under any circumstance *can* be healthy. I was \"healthy\" at my thinnest. I know plenty of smokers who are healthy. You can, or cannot, be anything.\n\nAdditionally, not everything is about diet culture - obviously diet culture is a thing, and a huge thing in EDs, but it can also be irrelevant. For me personally, I had to google what it was at first because not only I had never come across the term, but I never really experienced it in my life. Bringing diet culture into the discussion can be problematic sometimes because it could end up trivializing a person's complex history and upbringing to a one-line issue. \n\n>Also, I\u2019m 100% not trying to come at you at all. I tend to come off really aggressive through text so if i did I apologize.\n\nSame for me - what I try to do is to stimulate a debate, I'd never want to be mean, nasty or rude against someone :)",

          "body": ">You cannot have a positive view of fat people and not want to get fat. \n\nThat's really untrue. Most people in real life really (and luckily) have nothing against fat people while not wanting to become fat themselves. Just like people don't want to smoke but they don't have anything against smokers.\n\nThat was true for pre-ED me btw - I didn't *want* to become fat but at the same time fat people were never really on my radar. I had/have some in my own family as well. \n\n>Diet culture specifically stems from fatphobia and racism\u2014especially towards black people.\n\nDiet culture is rife in places with no black people at all, or even with an ethnically homogeneous society. I think you're oversimplifying the issue, or maybe you're applying an American-centered bias.\n\n>Idk what you mean by \u201ceveryone can be healthy.\u201d Is that an insinuation that fat people can be healthy but doesn\u2019t mean they are?\n\nNo, it means that fat people can be healthy just like overly thin people can be healthy, smokers can be healthy, binge-drinkers can be healthy. The point is never the individual, the point is the average, and there's no black-or-white definition of what \"healthy\" even means anyway.",
