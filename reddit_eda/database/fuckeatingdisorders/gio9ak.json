  "selftext": "I can't remember the last time I had a normal birthday. When I turned 15, I snuck downstairs after everyone went to bed to binge/purge my own cake. At 16, I refused to eat cake and blew out a decorative candle. I spent my 18th birthday in PHP. And last year, at 21, I celebrated by drinking vodka from a measuring cup because I was too afraid not to know the calories.\n\nI'm anxious, and my body image is ridiculously bad, but this is such a big deal to me. I'm so glad I was able to do it (also, it was fucking delicious).",
