It was very difficult for me because my BMI hovered around 18.5 so I was never clinically diagnosed with anorexia or an ED, even when I was hospitalised for a suicide attempt and told them I was starving myself/had lost about 2 stone in a month (which my mum confirmed to them). We always kind of skirted around it, even when my mum would put her hand around my wrist to see how thin it was or when I hugged her rubbed my back to check how prominent my spine was. It was never an open \u2018I have an eating disorder\u2019, it was always lumped in with depression for me.\n\nMy cousin has BPD and struggled with severe bulemia/anorexia for years to the point where she was in rehab for it and not allowed to walk up stairs etc because she was so incredibly underweight. On a totally selfish level it is really invalidating for me because my family just see that extreme as \u2018eating disorder\u2019 and not what I went through. I still struggle with the thoughts now I\u2019m nearly 30 and last year was the first time I said to my mum and sister \u2018I had an eating disorder\u2019 - which they acknowledged thankfully but I could never ever tell my wider family. My cousin\u2019s EXTREME struggles with her personality disorder mean that my own mental health issues have never really been taken seriously or validated by my wider family. My family\u2019s support and sympathy was always poured into my cousin so they kind of assumed I \u2018got better\u2019 when I learned to manage my disorders, they have no idea I still really struggle sometimes. My grandma (who I am really close to and love dearly) has even said to me before, \u2018Oh well you were never as bad as cousin,\u2019 as if it\u2019s a competition or what I went through wasn\u2019t \u2018as bad\u2019 so it\u2019s ok. Like I seriously tried to kill myself at 16, it couldn\u2019t have been much worse.\n\nSo yeah, it\u2019s fucking hard. I have always been pretty open about struggling with bad depression/anxiety but my ED was always this monster I kept in the closet until very very recently. Thanks for asking \u2764\ufe0f",
