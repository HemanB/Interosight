  "selftext": "when i was debating on whether if i wanted to recover or not, i was scared of becoming \u2018overweight\u2019 and people around me kept saying that i could just lose weight in a \u2018healthy\u2019 way with exercise and diet etc. however i literally developed my ED with a diet. now i\u2019m scared i\u2019ll become a weight that is considered \u201cunhealthy\u201d, and be bodyshamed for not wanting to diet to lose it. the diet mindset lead me to disordered eating, and the disordered eating to a full blown eating disorder. i so desperately want to let go of my obsession with my weight, but it feels like i\u2019ve had it ever since i was born, thanks to diet culture",

I'm trying to recover, but people are still telling me I'm an inspiration for losing so much weight, and that I look so much fitter/better than before I started dieting. I don't think they mean it this way, but to me it all just sounds like, \"Doesn't matter that you're mentally destroying yourself, you look great on the outside so it's worth it!\" The pressure not to regain and look like a failure is insanely hard to fight against most days.",
