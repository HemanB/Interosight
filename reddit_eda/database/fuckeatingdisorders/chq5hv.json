  "title": "Got my period finally after almost 2 years",
  "selftext": "I hadn't had my full period since Aug 2017. There was some spotting up until April 2018 then nothing. Yesterday afternoon it finally came. I thought I would never get it again. I havent been doing anything extreme. No binging, no restricting. I have just been eating exactly what I want when I want. Very intuitively.  Which has turned out to be a lot of grains, beans, dairy, and vegetables. Sometimes chicken. Pretty healthy oddly enough... I dont know my weight because I dont weigh myself.  And I wear mostly loose clothing or yoga pants. I have been doing restorative and yin yoga almost everyday, going for walks in nature, attempting  meditation, and feeling my feelings. Its been very raw, emotional, and difficult to not have an addiction to fall back on to. But I am happy I didnt give up.",
