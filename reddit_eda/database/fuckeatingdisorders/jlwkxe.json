  "selftext": "i just saw this sort of comment under a picture of a tweet with a girl who recovered from her eating disorder. it really affected me tonight & showed my how cruel people can be even on a RECOVERY post. it doesn't matter if the girl was dying in the before but god forbid she becomes \"overweight\" in recovery so people think she obviously looked \"better\" & more acceptable with her eating disorder. which is just so!fucking!wrong! let people figure out a healthy way of eating. let people find confidence & comfortability in themselves. let people breathe. let people figure themselves out. give people time. recovery is not linear & eating is not as simple as it seems especially for people with ED's and STOP commenting on their bodies it is not hard. i have so much respect for the people in \"larger\" bodies that society deems as unacceptable but are still continuing on in recovery u are truly the epitome of strength because sometimes the world is truly ugly.",
