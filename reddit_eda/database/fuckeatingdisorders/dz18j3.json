  "selftext": "Real ice cream. Not shitty icy powdery halo top. REAL ice cream. It\u2019s been way too long. And I may have almost cried in the lead up, but I barely felt any anxiety eating it. I felt actual glee. My partner said I looked like a child eating ice cream for the first time. I guess I kind of was.\nIn the act of repeating challenges I\u2019m aiming to have ice cream at least two more times in the next week.\nI got this. You got this. We got this. ED ain\u2019t got this.",
