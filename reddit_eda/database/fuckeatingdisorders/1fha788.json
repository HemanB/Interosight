  "title": "People don\u2019t understand eating disorders AT ALL",
  "selftext": "I\u2019ve struggled with an eating disorder for the past three years - first purely restrictive, and then/now turning into bulimia. My biggest hurdle in recovery is making sure to eat regularly and consistently to reduce binge urges, and break cycles. Basically, it\u2019s something that\u2019s 99% effective but my brain convinces me otherwise.\n\nMy family are really supportive and after I was discharged from the NHS, and not allowed back when I continued to struggle - paid for private treatment. But, I really really hate that my parents just don\u2019t \u2018get\u2019 how eating disorders work. These are just a few of the things they\u2019ve said to me in the past week:\n\n- There should be a buddy system like AA, where people who have recovered support someone struggling. This is a great idea theoretically but in practice is probably really dangerous for the person who\u2019s recovered to be in that headspace\n\n- Saying \u2018I don\u2019t want that\u2019 because it\u2019s full of processed junk, I want to eat clean (they\u2019re not orthorexic, but continue to label meals as being \u2018healthy\u2019 in front of me)\n\n- My dad doing intermittent fasting to lose weight for high blood pressure. This frustrates me because when I\u2019m around him, he doesn\u2019t have breakfast with me. And, he\u2019s not doing this with the support of a dietician or trainer, he just decided to and I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s really working because he snacks a lot\n\n- When eating with me (which I find really helpful) they will often just eat half their portion, and leave food because they don\u2019t like it. We went for burgers the other day and my mum only ate half hers, and didn\u2019t understand why it upset me so much\n\nI know they are trying but I know I\u2019m much more mindful with how I talk about food and health around others, and I want them to be too\n\nEDIT: I am 28 for anyone who was assuming I was a child - I know I\u2019m ultimately responsible for my health ",

      "body": "This is difficult. And sadly, sometimes I think it's best that our loved ones don't fully understand, even though it's unhelpful... I think the only way someone can really understand an ED is to experience one, or to specialise in it as a career. And I wouldn't want my parents fully understanding if it means they have to suffer through it.\n\nSounds like there's lots of comparisons going on... You comparing your diet and portions with your parents. I understand why, but want to say that it's likely the ED focussing on comparisons. Remember lots of people have disordered eating habits, and no eating disorder. Remember that although normal people may be able to live healthy lives with these bad habits and skewed beliefs, but as someone with an eating disorder, you simply can't. We'd take it to the extreme. Just because we can't, doesn't mean everyone else has to follow the same criteria we do in recovery like it's the only way to be healthy. Some people have bad habits and they are just that, they aren't the same as the extremes we take things while in the midst of an ED. People do things that are unhealthy, and that simply can't be our concern. I found the further I got into recovery, the less I compared in this way... Other people's diets are their issue, and we should only be concerned with what is right for us. Easier said than done, but it gets easier as recovery progresses and the acceptance builds that this is what WE need to do to be healthy.\n\nIntermittent fasting is infuriating and very popular ATM. If his goal is to loose weight for BP, he's certainly not helping. British Heart Foundation very recently published new research to tackle this trend - the study concluded that just one single stint of fasting for 8 hours can dramatically decrease your cardiovascular health and increase cardiovascular disease. That's after one fast! Consider finding this research and sending him a link. Also remember this research for yourself!!!\n\nMy best advice... Try not to battle with them. Your priority battle ATM is fighting the ED, not fighting to change loved ones perspective. If they want to understand more, they'll do more research. My Dad never wanted to understand... I had to accept that challenging his comments or trying to discuss it with him often just opened me up to more triggering comments, more heartache and more struggle. My Mum eventually wanted to understand more, and got research/support for carers signposted to her by professionals, which helped her and our relationship. But I didn't change her perspective and understanding, she was just given the resources and the choice. I would advice not directly challenging dialogue with them regarding ED, especially if it ends up triggering you when you have tried this in the past  Instead, and at most ... Start sending them research, interesting articles, other patients/carers accounts etc. anything you find that you think they'll benefit from reading. I would most certainly focus this on resources specifically for carers, and not for sufferes. What might be helpful for us to read, might be more alienating for them. They'll be more accessible and relatable for them, framed in a way and perspective that they will be able to understand and access, aiding their overall understanding of EDs. If you send resources that are designed for patients, they won't be accessible because they still won't get what it's like. But they do get what it's like having a loved one with an ED. These resources often include advice on what not to say/do, what to say/do. Doing this works well because it's not you giving them the information, it's professionals who have made these resources... There's more legitimacy from the resources that they will be more willing to listen to. As annoying as it is... You're their child (no matter how old you are!) there's a dynamic there that undermines you teaching them anything, let alone something that is so complex to understand. It's likely you alone encouraging them to be more mindful of what they say/do around you will just be shut down or they'll go on the defensive/feel attacked, like we're in some way implying they cause it (even though thats not our intention, and definitely not what we're doing!). Receiving the same advice from experts/professionals in whatever format will just hold more legitimacy for them to accept and act on it. It's stupid, but I suppose that's psychology.\n\nBut most importantly... Remember it's not your job. It's their choice. You can lead a donkey to water, but you can't make it drink. You can give them access to information, but they still might not engage with it. The sad fact of reality is the only person's thoughts, knowledge and perspective we have any sort of control over is our own, and even then that's not always doable. Your main priority is your recovery and health, your own choices...  and there's going to be shit that gets in the way of that or undermines it, but ultimately sometimes all we can do is try and brush it off and carry on. Sometimes the most peaceful route for everyone is these moments is just to walk away and not engage. Try not to let the ED hijack these moments and feelings, keep calm and carry on. Good luck!",

I didn\u2019t know quite how to explain to them what I was feeling because it sounded stupid in my head. \n\nLook, I\u2019m 28 and am an adult so I know these things shouldn\u2019t upset me so much, but it\u2019s such a fundamental lack of understanding. My parents are both keen to start family therapy, which I agreed to, but I always feel like I\u2019m the issue and they don\u2019t really understand my eating disorder, and often just randomly come up with theories as to why I have one. It\u2019s just a bit frustrating when they clearly do want me to get better.",
