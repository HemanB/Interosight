  "title": "Advice for hair loss from Anorexia and in recovery with extreme hunger?",
  "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nSo I just started a formal recovery from anorexia nervosa. One day I got home from exercise and a 2x2 inch square of hair had exited my scalp\u2026 and I can\u2019t lie, it was at that moment that I grabbed the biggest bowl of Reese\u2019s puff cereal with an enriched protein shake as the \u201cmilk\u201d and like 6 protein bars and just went to town because I\u2019d had enough. I need my hair. So of course after a massive energy restriction, limitation of most food groups, and over exercise my body is really not having it and I am experiencing extreme hunger over the last month and doing my best to honor it (it\u2019s really all carb, sweet, and fat cravings). The gain of mass on my body is really, really upsetting but I want to undo all the trauma I\u2019ve done to my body and be free more than anything. However, my hair keeps falling out. Like a lot. My already weak ponytail is now looking more like the tip of a tapered paint brush for thin line work art. It\u2019s bad.\n\nMy question is why is my hair still falling out so much? Could honoring extreme hunger be a shock to my body that is making it worse? Is this normal in recovery? Will it stop soon? It\u2019s been over a month into \u201cphysical\u201d recovery. Honestly, I had mentally-compensated with over exercise to feel better about honoring extreme hunger so perhaps that may have something to do with it from the stress of that? But I just herniated both my calfs so I can\u2019t even walk now so exercise, movement, and sport are off the table for a long time anyways. :( (maybe good tho for my hair.. :) )\n\nDoes anyone have any advice to keep my remaining hairs in my head? And to stop it from thinning and receding so much? Or any key items or products to consume or use to get my hair healthier. Shampoos, topicals, etc. My previously long, thick hair is a key part of what makes me feel beautiful and kept together and I don\u2019t know how to cope with the damage I\u2019ve done.\n\nEdit: it also breaks off like nobody\u2019s business. I imagine from restriction that my existing hair will be weak especially at the top from malnourishment but dear god I just want it to at least stop falling out in clumps and thinning everywhere. Fuck eating disorders lol.",
