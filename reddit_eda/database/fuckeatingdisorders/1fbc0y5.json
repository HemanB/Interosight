  "selftext": "Posting here because this is the only honest \u2018recovery\u2019 sub on this app. I swear the main ED sub is 90% anti recovery. They allow numbers and details about BMI so people are free to make disordered comparisons, they allow really fatphobic comments and posts and most of the time when people post, instead of anyone giving them helpful advice they just say \u2018yeah, me too.\u2019 It\u2019s not 100% pro ED like some sites, but it\u2019s certainly anti recovery. \n\nI just can\u2019t understand how a sub like that could be helpful to anyone unless they want to be validated to continue in their disordered behaviors. Just a vent, I\u2019ve seen some particularly disordered posts on there this afternoon and I\u2019m just really worked up. ",
