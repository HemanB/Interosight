  "selftext": "When I was actively restricting, it was always such a bizarre fucking concept to hear that people could eat and just\u2026 stop when they were full and satisfied. I was always so constantly fixated on food and when I allowed myself to eat, it never felt like enough even though it always resulted in uncomfortable fullness due to stomach shrinkage. I never felt truly satisfied, and I always thought that if I allowed myself to eat freely, I\u2019d never be able to stop. And that shit was scary, because no one around me seemed to have that problem. So clearly it must be a *me* problem, right?\n\nSo I understand where you all are coming from when you bring this up. You know that my advice is to just eat despite the fear, but right now I just wanted remind everyone that I was once there too and I get how fucking hard it is to do that. I see you, I empathize with you, and you are not alone.",
