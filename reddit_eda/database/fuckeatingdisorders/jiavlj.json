  "title": "I\u2019ve decided to not weigh myself and not count calories whatsoever.",
  "selftext": "My weight has plummeted to almost 34 kg , 5\u20191.\nI was watching supersize vs superskinny and I realized that even the anorexics shown in the bits had higher BMI than I do. \nI\u2019ve had this compulsive obsession to hit over 20k steps at least and if I didn\u2019t I would fast all day and only eat a few hundred calories. \nI don\u2019t know what clicked today but I\u2019m done. I\u2019m done spending hours on the grocery store and the person in there asking if I need help. I\u2019m done checking celebrities BMI and competing. I\u2019m done having feeling my ribs and having difficulty sleeping because I can feel my bones so bad. \nI\u2019m done having this urge to keep moving all the time.\nI\u2019m done restricting and being obsessed with food whilst convincing myself that I\u2019m not hungry.\nI\u2019m done not having my periods and being okay with it.\nI\u2019m done feeling like I\u2019m in control when I\u2019m not.\nI ate A LOT of food today, a lot of fear foods as well. Biscuits, chips, yoghurt you name it.\nAnd I don\u2019t care about the calorie count.\nI don\u2019t care how much I\u2019ll be weighing tonight or at least for a long while.\nI actually feel full today and not through stuffing myself with low calorie vegetables and I\u2019m actually happy; no anxiety whatsoever.\nToday I feel like has been the actual start of my recovery day.\nWhen I\u2019m ready, I may start lifting weights and put on some muscle.\nI want to thank you amazing peeps so much for the help along the way.\nIt\u2019s kind of crazy how liberating this is.\nI love you all!",
