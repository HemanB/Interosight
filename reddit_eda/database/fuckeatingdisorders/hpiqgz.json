  "title": "Almost 1 year into recovery...I feel weird about how far I\u2019ve come, almost as if I never struggled enough in the past with my eating for me to even consider myself having recovered from an eating disorder.",
  "selftext": "I ended up recovering alone with the help of some ed recovery group chats and that\u2019s all. I\u2019ve maintained a normal weight for the past 11 months without weighing or counting calories. I only struggled with disordered eating for about a year and a half and now I\u2019ve been recovering for almost a year. I feel so...invalid. Like I wasn\u2019t ever even sick... I\u2019m scared to even mention to my friends that I\u2019ve been recovering for one full year cause they might say stuff like \u201cyeah ok that\u2019s cool but you werent even sick...\u201d \n\nAlso the turning point for me to recover was when my ed convinced me that I couldn\u2019t go on my family\u2019s annual summer vacation because of the scary food there. So one day before we left I insisted that I couldn\u2019t go. My family was furious and while they were gone I was so angry with myself that I binged the entire time they were gone. I\u2019ve been recovering since then. BUT my family is going on this same vacation this year. They never knew the reason I didn\u2019t go last year so they keep teasing me about it. I\u2019m absolutely terrified to see my family this year because I know they will bring up why I didn\u2019t go last year and I just won\u2019t have an answer. None of them really knew I struggled with ed. I just needed to vent. Thanks for reading if anyone did.",
