  "selftext": "Fuck being a killjoy, an irritable skinny legend. Fuck revolving my whole day around calories, being anxious about eating out, being hyper vigilant around the scent of forbidden foods. Fuck having low libido for my husband. Fuck the chest pains. Fuck the binge on peanut butter sandwiches and fast food one day, restrict for 6 days and hate life after. Fuck not being the person who can just grab a donut from the break room. Fuck counting calories and thinking too hard on my next meal and settling for a ok meal when I could have had a better tasting meal. Fuck taking out things like cheese and olive oil when I love them. Fuck getting cold as hell and taking my heater with me everywhere I go. Fuck almost feeling like passing out everytime I take a shower. Fuck not having a period and being at risk for osteoporosis. I feel like I\u2019m getting dumber as the days go by, cant talk as well as I did before. Fuck a 16 BMI when I\u2019ll never be satisfied. I\u2019m almost 27 and I\u2019m done. I\u2019m letting myself gain to a healthy weight and just scheduled an appointment to my doctor next week to admit to her my lack of period and restrictive eating habits. I\u2019m done with this bullshit.",

That\u2019s such an amazing thing to consider but just remember this feeling because the restrictive tendencies will come back so fast and you want to restrict so badly but just continue to challenge yourself! One thing that helped me was having to eat every three hours to restore my hunger cues and make sure I\u2019m feeding my body enough, and that\u2019s not eating like a bag of 100 cal popcorn and half of string cheese every three hours, that\u2019s like a sandwich or a serving of pasta or a smoothie! it was super hard to force myself to eat every three hours, especially if I wasn\u2019t hungry, but in the end it was super worth it and I can start listening to my body better now.",

My hair and nails grow faster. I get sick way less. I feel so much less hazy. My memory! My memory improved so much. I never realized how much it was fucking up my life until I started to make improvements. I cant wait for you to get those same feelings back too \ud83e\udd7a it's a new lease on life truly",

Sometimes when i'm stuck of doing these things  i gone crazy and dont give a fuck about anything and eat like a shit during 2 or 3 days (i eat everything i want, and i like it). After 2 or 3 days i start regret and thinking i eat TOO MUCH during the precedent days and this may make me gain at least 3kg because i feel really fat. When i weight myself i'm often surprise to see that i only gain 1.5kg ( or much less that i was imaginating). That makes me feel less anxious. And helps me to understand that i haven't to restrict so hard because even if i eat with more pleasures i can maintain my weight (and not become fat like my brain imagine)",
