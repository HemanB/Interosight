  "selftext": "I suppose even thought I don\u2019t want it, my body has decided to chose recovery for me.\n\nI feel so bad for constantly making posts like this here, but I don\u2019t have anyone else to confide in right now. I\u2019ve been so back and forth with my recovery. I get really positive about it and then I sort of fall down when it comes to actually succeeding in anything and just fall back into behaviours after one day. \n\nI\u2019m finding things really difficult, I have to gain weight and I\u2019ve managed to gain a little, but I\u2019m still at risk of a lot of health problems due to my weight and the damage I\u2019ve done through the duration of my ED. I\u2019m currently finding any further weight gain to be really difficult to deal with because I don\u2019t want to image life at a higher weight, and looking healthy again. \n\nHowever, no matter how much I want to restrict, and lose weight I can\u2019t. I\u2019ll spend the whole day restricting only to binge after dinner, feel super guilty, and then even after I\u2019ve binged I\u2019ll still go to bed hungry after planning to restrict the next day. I\u2019ve been stuck in this binge/restrict cycle for 3 weeks now and it\u2019s awful, it makes me feel like I have not will power, like I\u2019m losing control, and I just feel so disgusting all the time. I\u2019ve done a lot of reading and I understand that this is a natural response is not only to the short term restriction, but also the longer-term restriction that has happened during the time I\u2019ve had my ED. So instead of punishing myself, blaming myself, and talking badly to myself about it - I\u2019ve decided that this is a signal from my body that it can no longer hold on to this suppressed body weight, and can no longer deal with the restriction. I know the only way to make these binges reduce in some way would be to stop restricting during the day, so I shall do that. My body is obviously in need to energy, it obviously cannot survive this much longer, and I know I can\u2019t either. I guess even if binges continue to happen at night, I\u2019ll probably feel a lot less guilty because I haven\u2019t set myself up for restriction. Starting tomorrow, I will give myself full permission to eat unrestricted, and to rest. I will stop weighing myself, I will stop listening to food rules, and I will not feel guilty about the amount I\u2019m struggling with recovery. It\u2019s okay to not struggle as much as I thought I would, it\u2019s okay to enjoy the recovery process. That doesn\u2019t invalidate me, in the sane way that not being okay in recovery doesn\u2019t make me a failure. \n\nWhat I\u2019m beginning to realise is that recovery is not something that I can engage in when I feel like it, and ignore if I\u2019m too tired, unhappy with my body, and feeling generally negative. It is unconditional and right now needs to be my main focus. It\u2019s so hard, probably the hardest decision I\u2019ve ever had to make but I\u2019m going to listen to the people who are recovering, and those who have recovered and hold on tightly to the idea that it will get better and that all this anguish will be worth it soon.",
