  "selftext": "If you tried to sell me the idea of recovery for this exact reason, I\u2019d be sold then and there. Most of my ED life (16 BMI) I had to fight myself from eating sweets and thought I had a sugar addiction. Every pastry wasn\u2019t enough. I needed more. I literally felt like an addiction who couldn\u2019t stop at a single pastry like normal people. I\u2019d eat 5-6 pastries (donuts, cookies, danishes, whatever) at the office break room and would still have to fight myself to not eat any. Then restricted the rest of the day/next couple of days then the cycle continues.\n\nI\u2019m not seeing a therapist. I\u2019ve been doing self recovery for 2.5 months now and am almost at a healthy weight but since gaining 7 lbs I\u2019ve been way at ease with pastries. Being able to NATURALLY stop has been amazing. Not fearing having them in my apartment has been amazing.",

The magic of recovery! \n\nI think it has a lot to do with your body starting to learn that there is no scarcity of food...both in your mind AND physical body. \n\nAs soon as your mind thinks something it enjoys is limited...it wonders why. It goes to the primal conclusion that there must be a famine. Thus, it wan't as much of that thing as it can when it's there! That's why when you can enjoy and eat something like that without the mental punishment and restrictive....you can relax and actually feel satisfied! \n\nKeep up the good work!",

It was always a war and I felt like I had to follow an abstinence model because I was addicted. \n\nMy understanding of this is that the closer to get to the weight where your body functions optimally, the less obsessed with food (particularly calorie dense) you get because your body no longer needs to repay the energy debt caused by your ED. Before that point your body is looking for foods that are the most energy dense easily processed and absorbed by your body (stuff we think of as \"junk\"). \n\nI also think to a limited extent, there is also a something to the idea of legalizing things--if you always have the option to eat stuff you used to label as \"off-limits\" the less tempted you are by it. \n\nWhatever the case, it is incredibly amazing when this happens. I am really happy for you :)",

      "body": "Ohhh I feel you. I was eating so much peanut butter and nuts everyday for a week... it was like I was possessed and couldn\u2019t stop eating when my body finally had some real food. Probably averaged 6k-7k cals a day for a week. The first 3 days, I think I only gained a pound. Yeah my body basically said \u201cfuck calories\u201d and I ate whatever I wanted. The first week I really did not want anything but pbjs and nuts. I think it was hard to gain weight at first because of something called \u201chyper metabolism\u201d that happens during refeeding. I do suggest eating whenever you\u2019re hungry if you\u2019re experiencing extreme hunger, but if you can plan something with a dietician that would be better. I don\u2019t suggest doing what I did because my heart was racing like crazy, I woke up in sweats, and my entire abdomen was sore and tender to the touch for a couple of weeks. But then again, I was just so fucking hungry that I don\u2019t think a dietician\u2019s plan would have helped. Anyway my inbox is always open if you want to talk about recovery more! I\u2019m so glad you\u2019ve decided to recover and pls hang in there!",
