  "selftext": "This is the heaviest I\u2019ve ever been in my life but what\u2019s crazy is that actually being nutritionally rehabilitated has made me SO rational, like I can\u2019t imagine myself going back to restricting and being scared of food like I used to? It just seems so stupid and wasteful now especially because I know eventually I would need to recover again, my ED would shift into a different one, or I would just simply die. I think the only reason I\u2019m mentally recovering is because I\u2019ve been so honest with myself, I think you have to want recovery with everything in you to get to this point because I would\u2019ve never been able to get here if I tried to recover last year. \n\nMy extreme hunger has also calmed down quite a bit recently, I\u2019ll have days I feel like I can\u2019t get satisfied and days I feel satiated way quicker. I\u2019m really really struggling with the weight gain and the guilt but I do my best to just ignore my external body currently and fighting the guilt by honoring my MH. \n\nThe point is, i genuinely did not believe that I could ever get to a point of allowing myself to eat freely and that my mental hunger would never ever go down/away even after reading multiple posts on here from recovered people saying EXACTLY THAT. I think the only thing keeping me sane about my really drastic weight gain right now is perspective from people that have already gone through this process. \n\nI\u2019m still really struggling and have a long way to go, but the struggle now compared to when I started is very different and i genuinely think it\u2019s because the trust I had in recovered people on this sub encouraging going all in. \n",

Somebody else does too. On one hand it means none of us are the special (or profoundly terrible) exception that the ED claims we are - but on the other hand, it means none of us are truly alone in our suffering or victories. You think your victory is small and not worth celebrating? Someone else is experiencing that same milestone. Celebrate for the both of you.",

And the worst part of it is that the journey to that point is absolutely awful, consuming, isolating and just genuinely horrible. \n\nIdk about you but I got to a point where I would wake up every hour, I was peeing myself, my muscles wasting away, all I could think about was food, no energy to talk to people and engage, hair falling out/not growing, etc etc. So even though I feel absolutely horrible about my weight right now, I like to remind myself that it wasn\u2019t better when I was restricting and if anything I felt worse because not only was I deeply unhappy with my body, I was also starving and living in a horrible cycle. At least now, I\u2019m only struggling with one thing \ud83d\ude29 and I just have to trust myself and my body to regulate itself slowly.",
