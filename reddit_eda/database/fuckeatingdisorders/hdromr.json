  "title": "Why are ED books for teenagers so poorly written",
  "selftext": "I'm rereading some books from the library. As for the ones written for teens... it makes me effing angry how they portrait EDs. They're all like \"Susan is 15 years old and chubby, so she diets and then a month later she's 1,73m and 31kg\".\n\nYou know why it bothers me this much? Because when I was 17, I was shorter than that and heavier than that and I thought all those books meant I didn't have a problem. I was underweight, but compared to the girls in the stories I was plump. But the fairies, the feathers, the long haired pixie girls were much skinnier. Beautiful princesses get rescued. They go to a clinic and have friends visit them, and when they come out of the therapy, boom, Prom Queen.\n\nOh, I was underweight. Staring at the fridge, unable to eat one slice of bread if it wasn't in the calculated allowed amount. Bruises where my bones hit the school chair. But never \"good\" enough. Never the hero of a story. Heroes lost weight hard and fast and then stood at the window crying, long princess hair flowing in the wind. I was the scrawny nerd with a mullet and no valid problem. Eff those books.",
