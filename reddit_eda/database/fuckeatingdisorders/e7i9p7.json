  "title": "\"Wow, you lost a lot of weight! What's your secret?\"",
  "selftext": "Earlier today, I decided to grab a coffee with a good friend of mine and ran into a waitress who used to work at a local restaurant. I decided to say hi and ask her how she's doing. This innocuous question prompted her to comment on my weight loss and to ask what my *secret was*.\n\nI couldn't help myself and said, \"I actually just gained over 14 pounds and struggled with anorexia this year.\" Needless to say, that cut the conversation short, and while I'm okay with how I handled the situation, I'm beyond tired of the fact that people feel entitled to make comments about other people's bodies and tend to assume that any weight loss *must* be a good thing.  I spent most of my life as an overweight person and was underweight for the majority of 2019. I'm struggling with body dysmorphia and recovery, and relatively innocent (but invasive and impolite) comments like this one aren't exactly helpful.\n\nHow are we supposed to feel okay about ourselves when our bodies are subject to such scrutiny? I try to keep in mind that most, if not all of us have grown up in a society that's deeply fatphobic and obsessed with diets, and that we must try to be graceful when dealing with people who aren't far along their body positivity/neutrality journey, but it's so bloody effing difficult sometimes.",
