  "selftext": "My new psychiatrist seems pretty good! She listens when I talk about my mental health, and aurally asked how I was doing, which surprised me.\n\nShe went over my blood tests, and my cholesterol was 10 points too high.\n\nSo she started talking to me about dieting. She literally said the words: \u201cNo cookies or ice cream.\u201d \n\nI haven\u2019t had ice cream since October, when I had a little bit at my mom\u2019s birthday party. Right now I\u2019m currently terrified of deserts and can\u2019t bring myself to eat one. I\u2019m struggling to eat anything at all these days, I have maybe one meal a day. \n\nI\u2019m just so frustrated that she would say something so nonchalantly when she doesn\u2019t know the patient\u2019s history.",

Nothing to be worried of the nurse said but I did ask her why and she straight down told me that as I was not eating ENOUGH fat, the proportion of \"bad\" cholesterol was slightly over average but that if I did include more fats in my diet aka nuts, oil, avocados, ect, that would balance it out. She also told me not to restrict on what we could deem as \"unhealthy fat\" aka cookies or fried foods. That wasn't the point. The point was eat FATS. All sorts of FATS and don't be scared of them. \nI don't know your medical history so I can't tell but if you're coming from a restrictive past, there's maybe more into it than stopping eating cookies and your psychiatrist shouldn't just throw rules at you without looking more into it.

I don't have a ton of choice when it comes to doctors, thanks US healthcare system, but I would try someone else after this encounter. One way I've learned to broach the subject of ED with new clinicians during a consult, is to simply ask them if they have experience treating patients \\[for whatever you are there to be treated for\\] with ED. Based on their response to this, I can usually tell if I feel comfortable disclosing, and if not, then I wrap it the fuck up. I'm not paying copays through the nose to continue seeing someone I can't fully trust, but that's totally me. I completely understand how this made you feel. What a bummer.",

Two reasons:\n\n1) Differential diagnosis. Especially when it comes to mental health, it is super important that your clinician rule out your ED before treating your symptoms as whatever mental health issue you are there to be treated for. \n\n2) Medication management. If they're prescribing you medications that may suppress your appetite OR prompt changes in weight, they REALLY need to know this presents additional risks for you. Medications have side effects for everyone; ideally clinician and patient together decide if that benefit-to-cost ratio is therapeutic. \n\nMental health treatment should be supportive of your recovery, not working against it, and your psychiatrist can't make sure that happens if they don't know the full picture.",
