  "selftext": "EDIT: I took some time to consider what others have said and I absolutely agree that she very well might still have an eating disorder; that said, if she does she\u2019s absolutely not in recovery and likely restricting and therefore my point still stands that she still should not be used as an example in recovery. All that said, I appreciate being called out because it isn\u2019t fair to assume someone\u2019s health, psychologically or physically.\n\nShe didn\u2019t have an eating disorder. She had disordered eating, sure, but she did not having a full blown ED\u2014she has never even described herself as having an eating disorder.\n\nTbh I feel like people use her as an example for what we WANT after recovery despite the fact that she continued to exercise, she refused to give up her physique for the most part and talks about dropping weight\u2014all of the things we\u2019re supposed to avoided in recovery\u2014because she remained muscular and thin. If she didn\u2019t, I doubt she\u2019d be as hyped up as she has been, especially in the ED community.\n\nI\u2019m happy she eats intuitively now, but when I watched her videos as per someone\u2019s recommendation I felt more triggered and upset with myself than motivated. I don\u2019t look like her weight restored. Even when I started exercising again. And I know many of us don\u2019t.\n\nI just feel like she\u2019s not a great example considering she clung to her physique and exercise in a way that we with eating disorders simply cannot do if we want to recover fully.",

She also had to learn to not fear gaining weight so that she could become healthier.  I agree that she most likely had disordered eating and not an ED, so she may not be the \u201cperfect\u201d example of recovery for people with EDs.  However, I don\u2019t think anyone is the \u201cperfect\u201d example of ED recovery for everyone, because we are all different in regards to ours lives and our own experiences with EDs.",

      "body": "I agree that she\u2019s not a good example of ED recovery but not because she doesn\u2019t have an eating disorder but rather than she refuses to acknowledge the psychological aspects of her ED. I don\u2019t propose to know how or why her body returned to a fit shape so quickly. But I do see a woman posting body checking photos of herself nearly EVERY single day, and showing off her outfits and squatting in front of the mirror too often to consider her as recovered. She really had to  think about her actions and beliefs when she was at her heaviest so that she could find her way through that time, but almost as quickly as she she lost that weight the body checking and \u201cworking for your calories\u201d beliefs all returned.  She may even agree she \u201cmight have\u201d an eating disorder but I think she doesn\u2019t want to work through it. Her mentality sorta shows in everything she does. When she started reading books for her book, it became about how many books she could read in a year. When she began solving rubik\u2019s cubes, it quickly became about how fast she could do it. She is an all or nothing person in her mentality and a perfectionist, which I know most of us ended up here in the first place with that way of seeing life. \n\nI don\u2019t think her science is wrong but I do think she\u2019s the type of person who will find science to objectify her reasoning for believing in something bc of her black and white thinking. What I mean to say is she only challenged her beliefs about health/fitness when she was so hungry that she was desperate, and THEN found science to justify going all in. And if she decides it doesn\u2019t work anymore, her ED will find the science for that too. That to me is also a little ED-ish. Not using your internal emotional wisdom/growth/honesty/reflection about yourself but relying on black and white objective truths/numbers/stats. Some people rely on science as an objective truth and emotional crutch for decision making. Our world is weird that way, there is actually science for completely contrasting things and when you\u2019re looking for absolute truths, you will realize that it\u2019s pretty tough to find the \u201cReal\u201d answer. Does that make sense? I do agree with set point theory however she herself doesn\u2019t prescribe this for everyone and to me that is admitting that she is picking and choosing what she wants to believe for herself. (Also distancing herself from her weight gain by framing it in a statistical/scientific way is just an emotional defense mechanism but that\u2019s just my opinion lol). \n\nTo me the only useful part of her all in theory is that if you eat enough and don\u2019t restrict your weight settles into one weight that doesn\u2019t change much. That\u2019s about it. The end point of balance is the most important. Those of us who come from ED recovery usually have had to do what Stephanie did, but most of us will end up over our regular weight for a while and MAYBE down a couple oz in the end lol not back to an fab fit athletic physique. But again the main point is, we would be RECOVERED, mentally and emotionally. So the way our body looks wouldn\u2019t be such a big deal anymore. We wouldn\u2019t even be thinking about it. We\u2019d be absolutely neutral and wouldn\u2019t be posting selfies every day to the world. I do agree with the science on set weight theory. There is a steady state between starvation and binging. But it doesn\u2019t look like Stephanie because she\u2019s not recovered and hasn\u2019t done the heavy emotional work of recovery. \n\nI guess tl/dr she\u2019s not a great example because to me she\u2019s not recovered and doesn\u2019t really want to be because she profits too much from being thin, beautiful and fit.\n\n*sorry for all the edits I\u2019m just clarifying my thoughts!",

I personally found eating \u201call-in\u201d much less restrictive than exchanges, much less stressful than eating intuitively and trying to decide how much food was ok, and my hunger-fullness signals actually returned and my food focus faded unlike with any other method I\u2019d tried previously.\n\nI had bulimia nervosa. I understand this may not be the best method for every bulimic or for many people with other EDs, but I wish I\u2019d known it was an option much sooner. It\u2019s hard not to want to spread the word. Also, the number and popularity of Steph's videos make her an easy resource to point to.\n\nALL THAT SAID, I would recommend Kayla Rose instead. Kayla was Stephanie Buttermore's inspiration, someone who had an ED and recovered, and she creates much more ED-related content.",

That's one of my greatest fears and having those mollified is at least valuable. I can learn to trust my hunger cues, eat moderately healthy, and eventually my body will take care of the rest.",

I think, for me personally, her videos helped a lot with understanding that fitness is absolutely **not** all or nothing, and you can eat intuitively and 'all in' and still be strong and work out. and working out also isn't a thing you have to do to change your body, you know?  i also just like watching her for the sake of her positive and supportive energy regarding openness with food and intuition around it. again, this is just me and my mindset on my point in my journey, right now.\n\nidk, its completely valid to not watch her if her story is something that triggers you, but many people definitely do find solace in her story, to some degree.\n\nedit to say that i don't think she should be used as the posterchild for recovery, because her recovery from xtreme hunger does not depict traditional ed recovery. Just that her videos still helped a lot of people, including those in ed recovery.",

But it doesn\u2019t look like Stephanie because she\u2019s not recovered and hasn\u2019t done the heavy emotional work of recovery. \n\nI guess tl/dr she\u2019s not a great example because to me she\u2019s not recovered and doesn\u2019t really want to be because she profits too much from being thin, beautiful and fit.\n\n*sorry for all the edits I\u2019m just clarifying my thoughts!",

I personally found eating \u201call-in\u201d much less restrictive than exchanges, much less stressful than eating intuitively and trying to decide how much food was ok, and my hunger-fullness signals actually returned and my food focus faded unlike with any other method I\u2019d tried previously.\n\nI had bulimia nervosa. I understand this may not be the best method for every bulimic or for many people with other EDs, but I wish I\u2019d known it was an option much sooner. It\u2019s hard not to want to spread the word. Also, the number and popularity of Steph's videos make her an easy resource to point to.\n\nALL THAT SAID, I would recommend Kayla Rose instead. Kayla was Stephanie Buttermore's inspiration, someone who had an ED and recovered, and she creates much more ED-related content.",

I think, for me personally, her videos helped a lot with understanding that fitness is absolutely **not** all or nothing, and you can eat intuitively and 'all in' and still be strong and work out. and working out also isn't a thing you have to do to change your body, you know?  i also just like watching her for the sake of her positive and supportive energy regarding openness with food and intuition around it. again, this is just me and my mindset on my point in my journey, right now.\n\nidk, its completely valid to not watch her if her story is something that triggers you, but many people definitely do find solace in her story, to some degree.\n\nedit to say that i don't think she should be used as the posterchild for recovery, because her recovery from xtreme hunger does not depict traditional ed recovery.

      "body": "Hey thanks so much for sharing your point of view! I agree with you as well but I have a few personal opinions which I will share cuz why not lol...\n\n I personally have the belief that our desire change our otherwise physically healthy bodies to look a specific way is in itself a shade of disordered. It\u2019s just disordered in a more functional way. (That is just my opinion so please take it as that!) Despite the fact that it is in our culture to do this and despite the fact that it is something generally accepted as normal and in fact a point of pride, I still just can\u2019t see this to be particularly healthy behavior. I don\u2019t think of it as a behavior that is ingrained in us, i think it is something we pick up as we grow older (the idea that we can and should alter our bodies). It just becomes very tricky to see it for what it is when we are in the same society that we are trying to make an observation on.\n\n I agree that it\u2019s not black and white. But I believe where the shades of grey lie is in that there are very many shades of \u201cdisordered\u201d from functioning disordered to highly non-functioning disordered.  The only time something is actually clinically diagnosed is when it\u2019s interruptive to daily life, but that doesn\u2019t make the behaviors safe just because they aren\u2019t clinically diagnosed. So when someone casually goes on a diet, it is still a disordered behavior but largely overlooked because everyone does it. When someone rigidly over exercises, that\u2019s still disordered too. I\u2019m not saying it an issue that now SHOULD be fixed by everyone, but i believe it\u2019s honest to acknowledge that these behaviors are mildly disordered at the least (orthorexia). Stephanie has said she felt a deep sense of pressure to look like the rest of the fitness industry to be taken seriously. This is fair, and in fact it\u2019s the reason women alter or suppress their natural weight, to conform to society at some degree. It\u2019s not a wrong thing to do but i believe it is in one shape or another, a reaction to societal pressure (in the same way that some women eat less because of guilt, or pain, or eat more because of pain and hurt). Body conformity comes from the psychological desire of wanting to belong. That discrimination does do harm and we as a society do need to work on being more accepting of body diversity. The alternate side of that \u201cdesire\u201d is fear of not belonging.\n\nI think in the end it\u2019s just down to the definition of what \u201ceating disorder\u201d and how serious it should be before it\u2019s classified as a disordered, how common it really is in our society, and what we choose to do once we know these behaviors are affecting us in a negative way. I would hate to think that there are people who would turn away from this subreddit thinking they aren\u2019t \u201csick enough\u201d but also, if they just aren\u2019t ready to address their issues yet, that\u2019s fine too. I just hope we can live in a society one day where we don\u2019t feel the need to change ourselves to be loved and accepted! :)",

          "body": "I agree that she\u2019s not a good example of ED recovery but not because she doesn\u2019t have an eating disorder but rather than she refuses to acknowledge the psychological aspects of her ED. I don\u2019t propose to know how or why her body returned to a fit shape so quickly. But I do see a woman posting body checking photos of herself nearly EVERY single day, and showing off her outfits and squatting in front of the mirror too often to consider her as recovered. She really had to  think about her actions and beliefs when she was at her heaviest so that she could find her way through that time, but almost as quickly as she she lost that weight the body checking and \u201cworking for your calories\u201d beliefs all returned.  She may even agree she \u201cmight have\u201d an eating disorder but I think she doesn\u2019t want to work through it. Her mentality sorta shows in everything she does. When she started reading books for her book, it became about how many books she could read in a year. When she began solving rubik\u2019s cubes, it quickly became about how fast she could do it. She is an all or nothing person in her mentality and a perfectionist, which I know most of us ended up here in the first place with that way of seeing life. \n\nI don\u2019t think her science is wrong but I do think she\u2019s the type of person who will find science to objectify her reasoning for believing in something bc of her black and white thinking. What I mean to say is she only challenged her beliefs about health/fitness when she was so hungry that she was desperate, and THEN found science to justify going all in. And if she decides it doesn\u2019t work anymore, her ED will find the science for that too. That to me is also a little ED-ish. Not using your internal emotional wisdom/growth/honesty/reflection about yourself but relying on black and white objective truths/numbers/stats. Some people rely on science as an objective truth and emotional crutch for decision making. Our world is weird that way, there is actually science for completely contrasting things and when you\u2019re looking for absolute truths, you will realize that it\u2019s pretty tough to find the \u201cReal\u201d answer. Does that make sense? I do agree with set point theory however she herself doesn\u2019t prescribe this for everyone and to me that is admitting that she is picking and choosing what she wants to believe for herself. (Also distancing herself from her weight gain by framing it in a statistical/scientific way is just an emotional defense mechanism but that\u2019s just my opinion lol). \n\nTo me the only useful part of her all in theory is that if you eat enough and don\u2019t restrict your weight settles into one weight that doesn\u2019t change much. That\u2019s about it. The end point of balance is the most important. Those of us who come from ED recovery usually have had to do what Stephanie did, but most of us will end up over our regular weight for a while and MAYBE down a couple oz in the end lol not back to an fab fit athletic physique. But again the main point is, we would be RECOVERED, mentally and emotionally. So the way our body looks wouldn\u2019t be such a big deal anymore. We wouldn\u2019t even be thinking about it. We\u2019d be absolutely neutral and wouldn\u2019t be posting selfies every day to the world. I do agree with the science on set weight theory. There is a steady state between starvation and binging. But it doesn\u2019t look like Stephanie because she\u2019s not recovered and hasn\u2019t done the heavy emotional work of recovery. \n\nI guess tl/dr she\u2019s not a great example because to me she\u2019s not recovered and doesn\u2019t really want to be because she profits too much from being thin, beautiful and fit.\n\n*sorry for all the edits I\u2019m just clarifying my thoughts!",

I think, for me personally, her videos helped a lot with understanding that fitness is absolutely **not** all or nothing, and you can eat intuitively and 'all in' and still be strong and work out. and working out also isn't a thing you have to do to change your body, you know?  i also just like watching her for the sake of her positive and supportive energy regarding openness with food and intuition around it. again, this is just me and my mindset on my point in my journey, right now.\n\nidk, its completely valid to not watch her if her story is something that triggers you, but many people definitely do find solace in her story, to some degree.\n\nedit to say that i don't think she should be used as the posterchild for recovery, because her recovery from xtreme hunger does not depict traditional ed recovery.

The point of recovery is to regain your health, you won't ever be as healthy as you can without exercise. Strength training and a bit of cardio are crucial to building a strong body, which should really be a goal after you're recovered. I don't think it's good for almost anyone on the planet to just never exercise. \n\nI should go for a walk speaking of that. Anyway, sorry for the initial misunderstanding there. I didn't realize you meant a temporary break. I never really quit cycling during my regain, and averaged about 75 miles a week during it all.

The point of recovery is to regain your health, you won't ever be as healthy as you can without exercise. Strength training and a bit of cardio are crucial to building a strong body, which should really be a goal after you're recovered. I don't think it's good for almost anyone on the planet to just never exercise. \n\nI should go for a walk speaking of that. Anyway, sorry for the initial misunderstanding there. I didn't realize you meant a temporary break. I never really quit cycling during my regain, and averaged about 75 miles a week during it all.

You're not going to have much of anything in terms of muscle if you just walk, you need some strength training for that. I don't claim that cardio builds any substantial muscle, except for intense climbs and sprints on a bike or something similar. Without strength training, it is very easy to get an overly high bodyfat percentage even at a normal weight. This is unhealthy by itself. There is plenty of people who fall into the healthy bmi range who still have an excess of bodyfat. \n\nRunning and cycling were related to cardiovascular health gains. Your overall stamina and endurance will never ever get any better without doing more vigorous cardio than walking. Do you think you will be at your best cardio capacity for running or cycling by just walking or would you assume you would need further hard work to achieve better conditioning to hit your peak? Answer is self explanatory. Harder cardio offers more cardiovascular health benefits than walking. Walking barely increases heart rate as it is. \n\nI don't think anyone owes me their health, they owe it to themselves. I'm just stating that there is a lot left on the table if you quit your fitness journey at taking walks. \n\nI won't address much on your statement that the unhealthiest version of you was the one that exercised the most.

You're not going to have much of anything in terms of muscle if you just walk, you need some strength training for that. I don't claim that cardio builds any substantial muscle, except for intense climbs and sprints on a bike or something similar. Without strength training, it is very easy to get an overly high bodyfat percentage even at a normal weight. This is unhealthy by itself. There is plenty of people who fall into the healthy bmi range who still have an excess of bodyfat. \n\nRunning and cycling were related to cardiovascular health gains. Your overall stamina and endurance will never ever get any better without doing more vigorous cardio than walking. Do you think you will be at your best cardio capacity for running or cycling by just walking or would you assume you would need further hard work to achieve better conditioning to hit your peak? Answer is self explanatory. Harder cardio offers more cardiovascular health benefits than walking. Walking barely increases heart rate as it is. \n\nI don't think anyone owes me their health, they owe it to themselves. I'm just stating that there is a lot left on the table if you quit your fitness journey at taking walks. \n\nI won't address much on your statement that the unhealthiest version of you was the one that exercised the most. We both know why that was. \n\nCheers I suppose? You didn't really give a good answer as to why just walking will do it all. If it was, no one would be lifting weights and doing harder cardio. Pushing yourself above walking is the right direction. Obviously there is something to gain from the harder stuff in regards to both health and overall fitness.",
