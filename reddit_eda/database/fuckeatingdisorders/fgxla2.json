Please realize that your disorder puts you in more danger than your average person if you do contract any illness, especially Coronavirus. Wash your hands, avoid touching your face(which I do all the time ugh), and stay home whenever possible. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you are in an affected area, please try hard to eat more than normal to try to build strength and try to limit behaviors that are depleting (exercise & purging). Any ways you can strengthen your body and immune system in this time is vital.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBe safe! Stay strong!!!",
