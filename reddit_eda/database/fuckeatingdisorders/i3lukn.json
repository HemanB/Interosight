  "title": "\"Anorexia was right\"",
  "selftext": "I started trying to recover some months ago and I have now reached a low healthy weight (around 18.5, 19 BMI) and I am facing a mental hurdle as I desperately don't want to get any fatter than this, but at the same time I am craving food almost constantly. I eat a lot more than I did, but also exercise much more to make up for it - I do a long run every morning and walk for several hours in the afternoon. It's such hard work just maintaining. Normal portions do nothing for me. Even large meals barely fill a hole, and having been extremely underweight for a long time I find myself with an extreme aversion to feeling hungry. I drink so, so, so much water to try to kill the constant craving. Sometimes I think \"See! Anorexia was right - no normal amount of food will ever satisfy you, greedy pig.\"\n\nI've been starving myself and purging for years to stay thin. I have no idea what my set point could possibly be. Some people have to spend their whole lives hungry to avoid getting fat. It makes me miserable to think I might be one of them.",

I am barely underweight but the moment I started eating \"normally\", I couldn't and still can't stop thinking about food.\n\nI did it to get back my period..and I did after 1 month. But although I felt happy in the beginning, I immediately started thinking \"okay now that you got your period it means you're officially a fat pig. Enough of this, time to lose the weight again\". But it's been a month since I started eating more (got my period this past week) and I still can't properly restrict. I have walk 10.000 steps every day regardless of how tired I am or how sleep deprived and it's taking a toll on my mental health. \n\nI'm eating huge amounts of healthy food to stop the hunger- to the point where I feel physically sick (it takes around 1kg of food to make me feel sick, but I'm terrified of purging although I used to be bulimic in the past, so I don't do that anymore). And even though I physically can't eat more, I'm still craving food.\n\nEvery day is a living hell. I wake up tired and hungry, I try to not eat but I can't stop myself. If I eat an apple, the next thing I know I've eaten 3 apples and I'm on my way to the fridge to get more. I miss not eating, and I miss feeling good when I was hungry. Now I feel so bad if I don't eat.. Weekends are the worst cause I don't have work to keep me busy, so I always inhale 2000+ calories, then for the whole week I desperately try to make up for it, but I still don't lose any weight.\n\nIt's so much worse than when I was deep in the anorexia mindset.\nI'm not motivated and I can't concentrate. I thought eating more would give me energy and improve my mental state, but I just eat, sleep, think about what I'll eat next, repeat. Sleep quality is awful too. I keep sleeping after I eat so at night I'm wide awake. I keep making mistakes at work and I keep forgetting things.. I was doing great when I was restricting. I was waking up motivated and the only thing I could think of was work, studying and being \"perfect\"..now I'm fat and a failure. I'm crying every day, wishing I hadn't let myself go. The jeans I ordered 3 weeks ago don't fit me anymore. Everything is tight but I refuse to buy new clothes, I want to punish myself, to feel uncomfortable, to bully myself into losing the weight again.\n\nI also believe I'm one of the people who have to spend their whole lives hungry to stay thin. But when I was thin I wasn't feeling as hungry as I am now.. It's frustrating.\n\nSorry for sharing my story on your post. I don't know how to help. I just guess it's some normal reaction to chronic restriction. I'm not ready nor will I ever be ready to go all in as others suggested. Seeing people's end results scares me even more. Seeing their before and after pictures is my worst nightmare.. What if my set point is at an overweight bmi like my mom? She's been big her whole life and my body resembles hers. I know if I wasn't purging half my life and starving for my other half, I'd be big. I can't take such a risk. What about the extra skin and the fat cells that'll grow?",

The jeans I ordered 3 weeks ago don't fit me anymore. Everything is tight but I refuse to buy new clothes, I want to punish myself, to feel uncomfortable, to bully myself into losing the weight again.\n\nI also believe I'm one of the people who have to spend their whole lives hungry to stay thin. But when I was thin I wasn't feeling as hungry as I am now.. It's frustrating.\n\nSorry for sharing my story on your post. I don't know how to help. I just guess it's some normal reaction to chronic restriction. I'm not ready nor will I ever be ready to go all in as others suggested. Seeing people's end results scares me even more. Seeing their before and after pictures is my worst nightmare.. What if my set point is at an overweight bmi like my mom? She's been big her whole life and my body resembles hers. I know if I wasn't purging half my life and starving for my other half, I'd be big. I can't take such a risk. What about the extra skin and the fat cells that'll grow?",

You either gain the weight, whatever it is, OR you will be signing up for death.\n\nI equated anorexia, poor mental health, deteriorating quality of life to death itself. Isnt that how anorexia feels? So that's how I kept pushing through. The weight gain itself is nothing compared to all, and I mean, the entirety of all the anorexia symptoms that are making you slowly kill yourself. \n\nI remember in recovery when I started feeling better, mentally, physically...I started crying, tearing up because I couldn't believe how good it felt. Like I was experiencing the world for the first time again, in wonder. Like a child. Hold on to that. \n\n\u00c1lso, it's important to remember that the weight gain isn't just weight gain. You will fix organ damage, nerve damage, fix your brain, skin, hormones, hair, nails, bones. There's so many benefits. \n\nBeing body neutral instead of body :positive: helped. This body + brain is helping me go through the day, walk, do my school work, love my family, friends, experience memories, go through life.",

      "body": "Hm, honestly they weren't. The majority of people didn;t say a word, didn't care. Actually when I gained weight, I had so many people comment on how healthy, bright, glowy I look, and that I look happy. I had a few sentences like a speech prepared when I met people I hadn't met in a long time, something along the lines of \"Actually, I am recovering from an eating disorder, and I need/needed to gain weight, but I am/feel much healthier now\"even before they brought my weight up. This way, I was more in control of the situation. What helped was acting a little confident in my statement that I was healthier now that I've gained weight. I also convinced people that I was underweight naturally. What I personally did was post on my social media at the time to my group of friends that \"I'm sorry if I;ve misled anyone. I'm taking some time to take care of my health\". Something along these lines. You don't have to tell other people you have an ED but finding a way around to sort of take control of the narrative and the situation def helped stopped people from making judgements. I told my close friends, so they were all super aware and supportive. I had lengthy speeches to my parents about my recovery and they were supportive in the end. All this work was worth it in my opinion. I didn't view is as \"justifying\"myself, but clarifying to others what was happening so I could take control and not be anxious abt other's judgements. If people offered any unsolicited advice, I would steer the conversation away.",
