  "selftext": "I\u2019ve been avoiding buying this specific candy (Trader Joe\u2019s mini pb cups, lol) for this reason - I used to eat tons of it and only it, felt guilty and out of control and restricted in response. So I haven\u2019t bought it in probably like 8 months? Anyways, I wanted to buy some candy and I bought it on a whim. Was pretty nervous about it tbh. But I ate a handful, didn\u2019t feel out of control, felt satisfied, and put it away.",
