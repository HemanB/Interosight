She didn\u2019t lose weight intentionally or anything. Like, I\u2019m not even trying to complain or anything. I am high key kinda shocked and also really want to lose more weight now. \n\nTFW your friends body existing triggers you because you never actually recovered.\n\nEdit: Sorry this is worded so obnoxiously.\nOk second edit cause anxiety: I just needed to vent this out somewhere.",
