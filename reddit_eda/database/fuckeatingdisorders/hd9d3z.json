  "selftext": "If you have health insurance, call them up and see if they are waiving copays and deductibles at this time due to the pandemic. If they are then you will be able to receive online eating disorder treatment for free if it is via telehealth. This is the only way treatment was possible for me, it was finally affordable. I did IOP and night treatment for a few months and not a dime was spent. Thank god thank god. Please look into it if you need some help. Love you all and stay safe",
