My thought process was literally just, \"oh wow, this is fun! I guess I need to take care of my body so I can keep playing and improve my skills\". And from there my self confidence improved a lot because I started putting my energy into something I was passionate about instead of restricting.",

You were sick, you weren't confident or in control, You were ill + the disorder was just doing what it does. When you're fully recovered without a care in the world is when you'll feel that real confidence and it'll shine so bright, it won't be there straight off the bat and it may take a while to get comfy into your skin again, but after some time and healing, you'll get there.",

      "body": "This isn't advice, but I think it's interesting that so many people can relate to this experience, because I've kind of had the opposite. I had moments of \"confidence\" in restriction (more like a false & disordered sense of accomplishment), but I mostly HATED my appearance and spent wayyy more time worrying about it than I do now. I still have bad days, yes, but once I got past the initial stages of weight restoration, the eating disorder thoughts really did get quieter for me. The bad body image is less all-consuming now\u2014I experience it in passing storms instead of as a constant downpour, if that makes sense.\n\nI'm still not someone with a great self-esteem, but my self-esteem revolves around much more than my body now. I really benefited from treatment in a group setting\u2014among many other things, it helps to hear about your strengths & good qualities from people who have similar experiences.\n\nYou have so many things that make you unique and wonderful, I promise. It will get easier to recognize these positive qualities over time!",
