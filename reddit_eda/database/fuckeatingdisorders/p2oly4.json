I have lots of mental and physical illnesses  (4 autoimmune diseases including Lupus) so anyway after trying like 20 different med cocktails i was just recently put on the last resort med lol last resort because they actually give it to nursing home pts that wont eat to stimulate their appetite lol my last med trial did the same but gave NO MENTAL BENEFITS at all so i stopped that after 2 months. The 1 I've recently added however (aka the fat pill) has helped my anxiety and OCD intrusive thoughts  TREMENDOUSLY . Like, better than anything i ever tried. So much so that even though I've gained weight,  the relief from my debilitating anxiety outweighs  (hehe) the weight gain. I'm currently at the lower end of a healthy weight now and feel so much better!! I gained alot quite fast but my mental state is the best it's EVER been.  So im just trying to control my intake and exercise,  but unlike before, i don't have a total breakdown if i overeat or don't exercise.  I honestly didn't believe i would keep taking it  because of the weight gain aspect, but damn it's helped me so much mentally that i plan to try to stick with it!",

But that is a very straightforward addiction, as difficult as it is to beat. \n\nAlcohol has social and self-medication elements on top of the addiction itself, but it seems like people who are ready to stop can deal with those things.\n\nEDs can be the worst psychiatric conditions that people are capable of recovering from, combinations of multiple disorders that vary from person to person. \n\nVery different things, but none can be treated without first making a decision to stop.
