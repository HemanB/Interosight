Of course you don\u2019t have to answer if you\u2019re uncomfortable in doing so. I\u2019m only asking because I\u2019ve not had mine for over two years now & although I\u2019m now in recovery & hoping it\u2019ll return at some point, I worry that it won\u2019t & that maybe I\u2019ve just permanently harmed my body in some way?",
