  "selftext": "Yep. As the title says. I had donuts, a good part of a whole gingerbread house, steak, cake, and wine. And as hard as it was, I didn\u2019t binge, purge, or even have a mental breakdown. \n\nIt\u2019s a first for me, and it feels even more special because it\u2019s on Christmas. I realized how freeing it is to just eat as much as I want to without worrying about what I\u2019m eating.\n\nAnd when I stepped outside after dinner, it wasn\u2019t to run and burn off calories but instead to just look at the stars. I hope you all had a wonderful Christmas as well.",
