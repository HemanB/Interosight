  "selftext": "And that shit fucking HURT. Like, oh my god. I was 100% sure I broke that bitch.\n\nI didn\u2019t, I just badly bruised it and the hospital gave me crutches and a basic pain med prescription but said over the counter stuff would work as well.\n\nAnd I know that if I was still restricting, I would\u2019ve for sure broken it. I know for a FACT. I used to joke with my bf that I can\u2019t get into skate boarding with him because if I fell, I\u2019d literally shatter, I was so fragile. So yeah, recovery is totally worth it if it saves me from brittle bones that break from the slightest fucking breeze. \ud83e\udd74",
