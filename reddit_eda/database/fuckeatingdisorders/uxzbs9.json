  "selftext": "Today I said fuck it to my Anorexia, and after a day of eating a really healthy amount of food, I dealt with a lot of bloating afterwords (which is perfectly healthy), and I decided to say fuck it and wear a bikini cause I shouldn\u2019t be ashamed of how I look in recovery, but then when I got to the pool where there was a woman who was VERY underweight, and I almost felt guilty that I didn\u2019t look like that anymore?\u2026 idk, just a hard day in recovery seeing someone looking how I used to..",

Her body doesn't impact my body, I need to stay in my own lane. It helps me not continually focus on other people once I've noticed they are smaller than me.",
