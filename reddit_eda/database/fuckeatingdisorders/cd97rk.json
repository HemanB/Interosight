Try not to let the uninformed opinion of a stranger on the internet feed into the the disorder. You are worth recovery & it is possible. I hope you can find your way to recovery \u2764\ufe0f",

Like you I went from 135 to 170 in a span of 8 months and after talking to my therapist he asked if I thought I had BED and I said it didn\u2019t feel right saying I had that because I worried that I was trivializing what other people go through. The truth of the matter was that I was massively unhappy and depressed and eating 2-3K calories every night and hating myself immediately after. \n\nJust know that every ED or mental health disorder manifests itself differently in everyone and also that people can be assholes.

Lots of love to you. You can do this. Recovery is hard but you can do it. \n\nI have had disordered eating since I was 8 years old. Last year I started finally trying to get treatment for it. It becomes comfortable and then when you step outside of your ED you might get scared. Take the leap, honey. You will be grateful you did. \u2764\n\nEdit:I would like to add that I'm 20. Almost 21.

I was big almost my entire life and dealt with disordered eating pretty much since I was about 5. I remember sneaking junk food ALL the time and basically binge eating in secret. Last summer I really started restricting and over exercising and fell into a full blown ED around Thanksgiving. I reached my lowest weight in March and after many concerned comments from family and friends, it was like a switch flipped and now I can't stop eating. I've gained 22 pounds in 4 months and it's terrible in a whole different way.\n\nLike others have said, eating disorders are a mental illness and there are a spectrum of behaviors and symptoms. Not every person experiences anorexia, bulimia, BED, etc. the same way. But you are still valid and worthy of treatment. I finally started therapy at 37 years old. Stay safe. \u2764",
