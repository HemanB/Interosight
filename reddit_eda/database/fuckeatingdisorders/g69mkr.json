Basically, it just increases seratonin creation in your body, like making more happy energy in your body. it's supposed to help with all of these issues and kinds of thinking.\nI was unsure about medication because I didn't want a medicine that messed up my body or made stuff in my mind, but this one is just increasing a natural process in your body. The psychiatrist says it's one that's commonly prescribed to start, so you might check it out.",
