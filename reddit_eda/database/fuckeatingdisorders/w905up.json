I realized I was healing when I thought I\u2019m gonna have a chocolate bar instead of a protein bar Cus i enjoy it more lol Ik you\u2019ll be able to get there. It\u2019s important to realize if ur eating enough through the day and have variety at ur meals ur likely getting enough protein. You\u2019ll also hopefully get to a point where ur not so obsessed with popcorn and u just let urself eat chips lol. It\u2019s great",
