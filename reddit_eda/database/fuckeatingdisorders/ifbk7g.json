  "title": "I ate a fucking banana!",
  "selftext": "With peanut butter!! I work a pretty labor-intensive job and usually fast through my 8 hour shifts, but today I was in a fuck it mood and the break room had bananas and small cups of pb, which made the part of my brain obsessed with portion control happy. I ate that shit and for the rest of my shift the usual fatigue and muscle cramps I get towards the end werent so bad. Its almost like the food I ate provided my body with the energy it needed, what a concept. \nBananas and pb are two things I never eat anymore bc they're so high in calories but today was a nice treat. I'm not recovering yet but at least sometimes we can say fuck it",
