This included cottage cheese and yogurt.\n\n3. Ate a sizable lunch (with a sandwich!).\n\n4. Had a few cherries and a spoonful of this new salsa I wanted to try, then put it in the fridge. I didn't feel the need to finish either.\n\nDidn't bother logging this in MyFitnessPal. I'm going to the gym in not too long and I don't know what I'll feel like eating after...but it can be whatever the hell I want.",
