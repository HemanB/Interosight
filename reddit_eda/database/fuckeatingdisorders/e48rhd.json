  "selftext": "It began with a desire to be Fit.\n\nLose a few pounds--\n\nI didn't hate myself.\n\n(Yet.)\n\n\nThere was a disclaimer at the top of my plan:\n\n\n\"Some people would call these things eating disorder behaviors,\n\nBut I'm going to be safe.\n\nJust lose a few pounds,\n\nThen a healthy diet.\"\n\n\nAnd then:\n\n\n\"It'll be nice too--\n\nTo focus on something else.\"\n\n\nDepressive waves were brushing against the sand in my head;\n\nMaybe Fitness could prevent high tide.\n\n\nI would be safe,\n\nI wouldn't lose control,\n\nIn fact more control seemed to come with every bite that wasn't taken.\n\nIt was all according to plan:\n\nA random mix of low-cal foods and excercises,\n\nGood job,\n\nYou're losing weight,\n\nYour fasting is fantastic,\n\nBut as for fast enough--\n\nIt wasn't fast enough.\n\nNumbers, oh ok,\n\nNumbers would make it faster.\n\nFitness and Health.\n\nWho cares now?\n\nNumbers will be what matter.\n\n\nDays, calories, inches, BMIs, pounds, halves of pounds.\n\n\nNumbers turn to happiness--\n\nTo be specific the shrinking of them.\n\nBut tide rises and falls while you play on the swings at the Emotions' Playground near the beach.\n\nSmaller numbers were a beautiful thing,\n\nBut turns out my Fitness Plan has nothing to do with salt water.\n\n\nSalt water,\n\nSalt water helps weight-loss right?\n\nTo bathe in, to drink?\n\nAdd that to the other strange things you have in the Fitness Plan--\n\nYou'll need to lie about them,\n\nLie about a lot of things.\n\nLie about when, where, who, how, say you're sick or busy,\n\nBut just don't eat;\n\nThat's all you have to do.\n\n\nExhaustion took away exercise,\n\nIn the meantime chew up food to manage cravings, \n\nBut don't forget to spit it out. And\n\nTreat the laxatives oppositely:\n\nThe directions say don't chew--be sure to swallow.\n\n\nThese things are worth it,\n\nLook how fast you're losing weight!\n\nSoon someone will ask you,\n\n\"How can you have such self-control?\"\n\n\n\"Eating is euphoric,\n\nBut have you tried starvation?\"\n\n\nI prefer starvation.\n\n\nOver candy, over pasta, over vegetables and fruit and ramen noodles and orange-flavored chocolate and chips and over all food in fact. \n\n\nActually I prefer it over a lot more things,\n\nOver college, over work, over writing and morals and family, over absolutely everythi--\n\nSquriming from embarrassment in front of Who I Used To Be,\n\nI erased the disclaimer and wrote instead:\n\n\n\"I Fucked Up.\"\n\n\nBut oh my God! I'm finally more than underweight! How can I stop now?\n\n\nThere's no need to be that concerned anyway.\n\nI might be drowning during high tide,\n\nBut on the swings at the Emotions' Playground,\n\nSometimes I go high enough to avoid the water.\n\nSo there's still no point in talking about it.\n\n\nFine, so I want to tell someone,\n\nI'm dying over here.\n\nMy heart is fluttering and pulsing in pain,\n\nI'm weak and shaking and clutching at chairs when I almost faint;\n\nMy period's stopped and my hair is thinning,\n\nBut maybe it's all a good thing because\n\nEven if it hasn't been that long,\n\nMaybe it means I'm finally allowed to acknowledge that I'm sick.\n\n\nThough I really can't tell anyone,\n\nI'm not at that holy number yet,\n\nThe goal weight,\n\nThe Ultimate Goal Weight that is.\n\nGod, stop being dramatic,\n\nI don't want my skin to be vacuum-sealed over my bones--\n\nWell,\n\nMaybe I do.\n\nBut I'm nowhere near that,\n\nThere's no reason for concern.\n\n\nMy body still disagrees with my Fitness Plan's philosophy that not-eating is the only way to survive.\n\nBut my Fitness P--fine, Eating Disorder-- says bodies know nothing about how to survive.\n\n\n\"These aren't just rules, these keep you ALIVE.\"\n\n\nAnd it's true, without this\n\nI am nothing.\n\n\nLife was once just something to put up with,\n\nIt was the grating Christmas song playing on the speakers while waiting in the self-checkout for self-starvers line.\n\nAll I wanted was to buy my Diet Coke and gum.\n\nBut the song wasn't just annoying anymore,\n\nIt was painful to listen to and made\n\nResentment and panic rise.\n\nIt drained every bit of hope from my blood,\n\nDehydrating my body more than laxatives ever had because well,\n\nWho wants to live this way?\n\nI want to run from it,\n \nI want to end it,\n\nEnd this.\n\nAnd I don't mean by leaving the store.\n\n\nBut the craving for that goddamn \"thin enough\" number remains stronger than any of the times I've wanted lunch,\n\nIt stops me from leaving\n\nAnd does so more than once.\n\n\nHey... what's the plan after \"thin enough\"?\n\n\n.\n.\n.\n\n\nAlright I know I want that number I know I said I can't die until I have that number but I can't do this I really can't the self-checkout line is too long and that Christmas song reminds me of bad days at the beach and I can't do this anymore I really can't do this I want to die but not truly so what should I do should I get help YES I know it means I'm a failure but I still remember when the world was good and you were happy and not because it was an earned binge day but because life was beautiful and\n\n\nI remember when you weren't defined by the fact that you're talented--wait, no--\nso bad at starving yourself.\n\n\nYou may not have ever fully understood what the purpose of your life was, \n\nBut at least before this,\n\nYou knew for certain that it wasn't to reach a number on a scale.\n\n\nAren't you tired of wasting your money on low-cal food that you throw away the next day because it's too tempting,\n\nOf doing those scary, insane things that you're too embarrassed to talk about,\n\nOf not being able to write or hold a conversation because your head is crowded with images of bread and butter,\n\nOf lying about EVERYTHING,\n\nOf being suicidal...\n\nOver bloating?\n\n\nBut if you do this,\n\n\"This\"\n\nAs in saying the words 'eating disorder' and 'I'm not okay',\n\nAnd you agree to going away--\n\n\nThe romance that suffering brings as a consolation prize won't be there to ease the pain anymore,\n\nAnd there will be nothing left of you.\n\nIt'll get worse before it gets better;\n\nWhat if it doesn't ever truly get better?\n\nAnd as for the numbers--\n\n\nGo ahead and eat if you really want to die that badly.\n\nSomewhere there's a memory\n\n\nOn a hill in the dark with stars and jokes,\n\nOf real swings in a backyard filled with dandelions,\n\nAt a concert that gave ethereal dreams birth,\n\nOf a cold morning with orange juice and slippers in a living room,\n\nWith people--\n\nAnd you used to think those were better than starving.\n\n\nGo ahead and eat if you really want to die that badly.\n\n\nAnd maybe if you do\n\nAnd somehow death doesn't come as you suspect it will--\n\nAfter all,\n\nEating calories is contradictory to your life's purpose--\n\nYou'll get to choose a new one.\n\n\nGo ahead and eat\n\nBut only if\n\nYou really want to live that badly.",
