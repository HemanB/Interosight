  "selftext": "Yes it feels even worse than binging.\n\nI'm not really afraid of feeling full (I mean I am, but that's not the point). I'm more afraid of NOT feeling full after a meal, which always happens when I eat normal meals. At least if I skip a meal or massively undereat I can tell myself that it's obvious if I don't feel full. But if I eat a normal meal and then I still not feel full/satisfied (which, again, happens pretty much all the time), then what's left? It just means I'm fucked and there's something wrong with me.\n\n(and adding protein/fibre/water, eating mindfully or something like that doesn't help either - I've eaten more protein than you humans can imagine lol)",

If you had just been in a barren desert for hours and were extremely thirsty, you would need more water than someone who was hydrated and in a comfy house. If that makes sense? \n\nI found that for a long time, I would have a proper meal with family or friends, then dessert, then another kind of supper, when usually no one else would. But it worked for me. And I now find that extreme hunger decreasing. It's a very normal part of recovery!",

There's so many things about \"normal eating\" that I find impossible. People think it's insane when I don't eat, they understand when I binge, but the way they eat is what baffles me beyond belief.",
