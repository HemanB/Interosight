  "selftext": "I'm sitting here after my lunch feeling so sad and depressed because I religiously followed my meal plan and I want more but I can't because my meal plan should satisfy me and I'm at a normal weight. Lunch was a 'normal' portion and felt so small and miserable at the same time.\n\nI know that if I start eating more right now, I would end up eating thousands of calories. And then I can already hear those voices telling me I'm an emotional eater, I've swung the other way and I'm just binging mindlessly to numb my emotions and I use recovery as an excuse to stuff my face so I have to restrict forever.\n\nEvery day is like this. My whole life is like this.\n\nI will never make it. I will never get through it.",

While looking for help I came across a post on extreme hunger (I believe it was Tabitha Farrar) and I just ate. I didn't give it any second thoughts. I gained a lot of weight in a short time but I didn't care. I was happy and finally felt free.\n\nThen I approached a healthy weight, got scared, went to a dietitian and a therapist, read a lot about the 'healthy' way to recover and the emotional aspects of EDs and so on...and here I am.",
