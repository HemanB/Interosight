  "selftext": "Y\u2019all, I have to address this far too often. Read the rules before posting. Fatphobia is against the rules. Only 6% of ED sufferers are underweight, and yes, some people *will* end up in a larger body, or were *always* in a larger body. Are they less deserving of  honoring their hunger, of a healthy relationship with their body? If you haven\u2019t guessed, the resounding answer is **NO**.\n\nIf discussing weight in terms of ending up in a fat body makes you uncomfortable, I **highly** encourage you to address that discomfort. Fat people are people too, and deserve to live comfortably in society. Consider the advice you offer here because it can be really fucking harmful for members who *already* have a fear of weight gain; instilling fear with misinformation is inappropriate and, quite frankly, wrong. I\u2019m seeing way too much if it lately in a recovery sub I\u2019ve worked my ass off to be a safe space for *everyone*, especially people in larger bodies who are *vastly* underrepresented in the ED community. Fucks sake.\n\nThanks for coming to my TED talk number 10285728 on fatphobia, bye.",

Society fetishes thinness to a harmful extent\u2014there\u2019s a reason the dieting and weight loss industry bank $7 billion a year.

The issue when you are unwilling to address that fatphobia and spread harmful, and often false, rhetoric about fat bodies.\n\nI said it in another comment, but the leading environmental factor in the development of eating disorders is the sociocultural idealization of thinness. Yes, EDs also exist outside of fatphobia, but many, especially those in larger bodies, people\u2019s EDs stem from fatphobia. Mine was partially linked to fatphobia. Control was an aspect, but it was also the endless pursuit of thinness for me. As it is for many others.",

However, for the sake of this conversation I\u2019m going to point out that 1) fatphobia isn\u2019t just a \u201cwestern\u201d problem, and 2) the \u201cglobal west\u201d is vague and problematic at best. The tendency of dividing countries into two groups often leads to the illusion that countries residing in the two groups are of two different kinds; that members within one group have a lot in common, whereas those characteristics are not found in the other group. If that were true, then why, for example, is fatphobia just as big of an issue in Asia (the East) as much as it is in the Americas and Europe? While it may be true that fatphobia may not have permeated your family\u2019s belief system (and that\u2019s great!), it\u2019s anecdotal. Jamaica has an anti-obesity campaign and nine in ten Jamaicans want the government to take action against obesity. There *are* fatptobic ideologies in most countries, even if it\u2019s not as dominant as it is in the Americas and Europe. Which I never claimed to begin with.\n\nSecondly, yes the beauty standards that you mentioned is absolutely whitewashed. Fatphobia was *literally* created by white people (specifically white men), and it has caused, and continues to cause, real harm to people of color, and especially to the black community *in* the US in particular. It\u2019s entire origin is to suppress. And considering the global affects white colonialism has had on the world, is it any wonder it\u2019s presence reaches pretty much world-wide, even if not as pervasive as it is in the white-dominated countries?\n\nLastly, I never once said *all* EDs are caused by fatphobia. I said the leading *environmental* factor is the sociocultural idealization of thinness. And it is. If you translated that as absolutely no other factor in the development of EDs is a valid one, then again I apologize because that\u2019s not what I meant nor what I said. The fact is that fatphobia does play a role in the development of many EDs, and not *just* in the western world.",
