  "title": "Fuck reddit and its promotion of disordered eating habits",
  "selftext": "Listen, I get it. Reddit is KNOWN to be fatphobic. It's known as one of the biggest centers of fatphobia on the internet, I get it. \n\nBut GOD, at the worst of this relapse, I looked at WAY too many progress pictures on the intermittent fasting subreddit. And now someone on /r/dataisbeautiful posted their analysis of their fifteen day water fast??? OP talks about how great they felt, and how good their sleep was. There are other people in the comments saying they've been on water fasts for three weeks, another one 25 days. I'm sure there are even more in the thread talking about their \"fasts\", but a quote from the 25 day one strikes me: \"After day 5 you feel like you have rocket fuel in your veins. Feels amazing.\"\n\nDoes it??? Does it fucking really?? Because in *my* experience, if *I'm* fasting, I can barely get up from bed to use the bathroom and my hands are shaking too much to write a simple sentence on my phone. That doesn't even begin to cover the brain fog. Even the fucking proana advice forum said that it would be wise to bump up my calories at that point because you NEED food to survive. \n\nPeople saying it clears your mind are liars (though I guess I'm willing to concede that I don't know what it feels like to only do this short term), but god. That was the absolute worst thing about this relapse for me. I do fandom roleplay (it's a hobby [or another maladaptive coping mechanism] fjdjsj) and I have a roleplay partner I send paragraphs back and forth to, and I just couldn't. I couldn't focus enough to type up a paragraph in 24 hours, when before I started my disordered habits up again, I could shoot off several within the span of ONE hour. I don't know what kind of mental energy these people are talking about. \n\nAnd I get it, disordered eating habits don't mean you have an ED, blah blah, but holy shit. Habits like this really, really need to be shunned. This isn't okay, but Reddit treats it like it's fine (and healthy!!!) to starve yourself.",
