At least I was an adult,  and knew I was struggling with that voice in my head and wanted help. And really,  I knew how wrong intellectually she was being,  even if it did affect me emotionally. \n\nBut to be that young and hear that basically makes you feel worthless for not \"struggling enough\" even though you probably really were quite a bit. I remember how different it was to be a minor and have to hide your behaviors while knowing you weren't supposed to be doing them,  but being scared of your own feelings and feeling helpless. To have an adult completely negate those things going on,  is so detrimental. \n\nI think the medical profession has come a long way and most doctors these days know that they don't have the expertise to deal with these things and they should refer anyone that are exhibiting any problems to the appropriate professionals. \n\nBut it still isn't optimal. Doctors in the U.S. only get one small class on nutrition.  Most doctors know virtually nothing,  and their psych rotation isn't usually that extensive either if they are planning on going into another specialty. Certainly not extensive enough to deal with eating disorders regularly as most psych units, medical floors,  and Emergency rooms hardly have any ED patients. \n\nMy own dad is an Internal Medicine physician,  and he had no idea what to do or say when I told him I was bulimic at 17. He chose to pretend I didn't say it,  because he was at a loss. But that was 20 years ago and I think the media and internet have greatly helped to expose the epidemic EDs are.  So hopefully these type of doctors are dinosaurs and less people will have to hear these responses. \n\nHugs to you for your struggles,  and I'm sending healing energy your way.",
