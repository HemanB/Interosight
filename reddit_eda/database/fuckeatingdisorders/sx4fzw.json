It is possible to develop solidarity, vulnerability, encourage openness  and cultivate a lead by example attitude to recovery, while also encouraging people to share about the less kosher parts of the ED such as the sense of superiority-inferiority that we struggle with. I was part of a peer support group (two trained facilitators in recovery, 5-10 members patients at the hospital, mostly AN but some BN and BED) for a year and it saved my life. It was not held within hospital walls or run by clinicians. The format was always the same: 1. go round the room with a check in (short statements about how your week has been or how u feel rn), 2. facilitators pull out a couple common themes, react w their own experiences and observations, then come back to the room w an open question 3. discussions opens up. people allowed to speak directly in response to someone else, share and free associate, express solidarity, concern, gently offer advice. facilitators freely participate and help manage time and support anyone when more challenging things come up, or remind people of the rules (no numbers, don\u2019t name specific staff, be mindful when describing behaviours and try to do so minimally, only what is necessary). 4. facilitators sum up meeting 5 quick check out. here we would do something called the \u2018fuck it bucket\u2019 which is basically passing around an imaginary bucket into which you\u2019d put a behaviour or tendency that you will try to let go of the week ahead. some real examples were stop weighing cereal, say no to a stressful request from a family member, or conversely say fuck it and have the carrot cake you didn\u2019t manage last week. All I can say is the group was incredible and people just didn\u2019t seem to want to compete etc. That doesn\u2019t mean i\u2019m other contents competition and toxicity didn\u2019t thrive. Some of the patients were on the inpatient ward and just came for the hour; they described all the usual things that happen in these settings. but somehow in group people got a chance to take break from it. i think we felt i certainly did more in control, like this is our healing space and everyone is sick and suffering and everyone deserves to be integrated. we actively worked to engage the new and quieter people and support the old timers. it really was amazing.\n\n\nironically though, once i was discharged and later weight restored but struggling in lockdown the hospital didn\u2019t let me come back to the group. not sick enough apparently \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude43",

Wanting attention: Not saying everybody with a personality disorder does this, but many do. Also, many people without a PD want others to give them attention, say they are proud, be concerned about them, feel special, etc. I would say that doing things for attention is often stigmatized, people inherently do things that benefit them and I tend to feel sympathetic for these people, they are clearly filling a need that should be filled but isn't.\n2. Wanting validation: I think this tends to be perpetuated by people who are attention seeking, if people are telling their worst horror stories that can instill a mindset that if you haven't x, you are not valid/sick enough. I think that if we stopped debating who is valid as a society, AND people stopped attention seeking behavior that might encourage debate on what/who is valid, we could dissipate this reason a bit.\n\nI also think that our society unfortunately associates weight loss/thinness with successfulness and bring disciplined, which can cause competitiveness among ED's.",

It is possible to develop solidarity, vulnerability, encourage openness  and cultivate a lead by example attitude to recovery, while also encouraging people to share about the less kosher parts of the ED such as the sense of superiority-inferiority that we struggle with. I was part of a peer support group (two trained facilitators in recovery, 5-10 members patients at the hospital, mostly AN but some BN and BED) for a year and it saved my life. It was not held within hospital walls or run by clinicians. The format was always the same: 1. go round the room with a check in (short statements about how your week has been or how u feel rn), 2. facilitators pull out a couple common themes, react w their own experiences and observations, then come back to the room w an open question 3. discussions opens up. people allowed to speak directly in response to someone else, share and free associate, express solidarity, concern, gently offer advice. facilitators freely participate and help manage time and support anyone when more challenging things come up, or remind people of the rules (no numbers, don\u2019t name specific staff, be mindful when describing behaviours and try to do so minimally, only what is necessary). 4. facilitators sum up meeting 5 quick check out. here we would do something called the \u2018fuck it bucket\u2019 which is basically passing around an imaginary bucket into which you\u2019d put a behaviour or tendency that you will try to let go of the week ahead. some real examples were stop weighing cereal, say no to a stressful request from a family member, or conversely say fuck it and have the carrot cake you didn\u2019t manage last week. All I can say is the group was incredible and people just didn\u2019t seem to want to compete etc. That doesn\u2019t mean i\u2019m other contents competition and toxicity didn\u2019t thrive. Some of the patients were on the inpatient ward and just came for the hour; they described all the usual things that happen in these settings. but somehow in group people got a chance to take break from it. i think we felt i certainly did more in control, like this is our healing space and everyone is sick and suffering and everyone deserves to be integrated. we actively worked to engage the new and quieter people and support the old timers. it really was amazing.\n\n\nironically though, once i was discharged and later weight restored but struggling in lockdown the hospital didn\u2019t let me come back to the group. not sick enough apparently \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude43",
