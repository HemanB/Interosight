If you feel inclined to share, I personally find that people understand better if you explain it from the phobia angle or explain that it's an anxiety disorder that is related to food it really helps. \n\nPeople will argue with you all day long if they think you just won't eat something, or even worse play the \"what do you eat\" game - \"do you eat vegetables?\" no. \"Do you eat corn?\" that's a vegetable, so no. \"What about broccoli\" still a vegetable, so FUCKING NO.
