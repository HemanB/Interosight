I still find it strange seeing how much in common I have with people on this subreddit, a lot of us have experienced the same or similar things with regards to ARFID so maybe that is the best route to spread awareness.

Except more often than not you've never had a negative experience with a certain type of food (like food poisoning or choking), but you still have that mental association that it is not safe meaning your brain sort of rejects it! \n\nNot sure if this made sense but thanks for reading and thank you for your discussion!",

I'm the same I cant pinpoint anything so I'm assuming I cant remember cos I was so young. idk but I'm like this from as far back as I can remember.
