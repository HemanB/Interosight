My family would try any means necessary to get me to eat, to keep me alive, setting timers with punishment if I didn't finish my food, not willing to make any adaptations. I used to sit at the dinner table and cry as I watched the timer count down. I can just regain my ability to eat (at all), but a stressful situation can easily put me back into starvation mode, and then it can take up to 6 months for me to slowly work my way back to eating regularly. When I was formally diagnosed with Autism in my 30s, I was also diagnosed with ARFID. Everything started to make sense. I've been called a picky eater by everyone in my life repeatedly. I now find it a highly triggering and offensive term because of the damage caused by other people's assumptions about me. \n\nCurrently 40yo, 125 lbs, 5'5\". In the last year alone, I have lost more than 50 lbs due to starvation. I have dropped below 90 lbs before. I'm so exhausted all the time from barely eating that it can be hard to get out of bed. Of all my issues, ARFID sucks the most.",

I can just regain my ability to eat (at all), but a stressful situation can easily put me back into starvation mode, and then it can take up to 6 months for me to slowly work my way back to eating regularly. When I was formally diagnosed with Autism in my 30s, I was also diagnosed with ARFID. Everything started to make sense. I've been called a picky eater by everyone in my life repeatedly. I now find it a highly triggering and offensive term because of the damage caused by other people's assumptions about me. \n\nCurrently 40yo, 125 lbs, 5'5\". In the last year alone, I have lost more than 50 lbs due to starvation. I have dropped below 90 lbs before. I'm so exhausted all the time from barely eating that it can be hard to get out of bed. Of all my issues, ARFID sucks the most.",
