  "selftext": "I'm in bed right now just thinking and I'm so incredibly upset. I broke off a ~3 year relationship in 2022, and am just now getting to a place where I am thinking about looking for another romantic relationship. The main thing holding me back seems to be ARFID. I can't go on dates to restaraunts, even when I go with friends it's an incredibly embarrassing experience and \"picky eating\" is a big turnoff to what feels like the vast majority of people. Every other person on dating apps describe themselves as a \"foodie\" or have writing in their bio that says things like \"let me cook for you\". If I wanted to go out with them, I worry they'd feel the need to cater to my limitations rather than choose something they like and they'd begin to resent me for that, or feel embarrased by me. My negative feelings are further compounded by the fact that in a conversation earlier today the person I'm romantically interested in described ARFID as a major factor in a previous relationship ending. This person knows about my autism/ARFID but it seems they don't understand the full extent. I'm really into this person and I wish I could go on restaurant dates with them and eat some of their cooking but I just can't and I'm so sad. I want to try new foods, I want to be \"normal\", but I can't. Even thinking about trying the most basic staples (pasta, pizza, cheese, bread, etc) fills me with so much anxiety when I imagine the potential taste/textures in my mouth. If I can't even try that how can I try something like eggplant parmesan (their favorite dish)?  \n\nTldr; Romantic, even platonic relationships seem to have food as a central, crucial aspect to enjoy together and bond over and it's just not something that's possible for me and I am incredibly upset. Sorry for wall of text.",

      "body": "To be honest, I\u2019ve never really had an issue with ARFID holding me back romantically. I may be an outlier on that, but my long term boyfriend has been kinda wonderful. \n\nMy boyfriend is someone with a wide palette. Being Hispanic, he has a ton of cultural foods & whatnot that he enjoys and has. He doesn\u2019t expect me to eat his food, because he respects my limits & always says he\u2019s just happy I am spending time with him above all else. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s considered a foodie but he\u2019s someone who loves trying foods & making all sorts of assortments of meals\n\nWe don\u2019t do any form of food dates\u2014 we do hobby dates. Hobby dates allow us to focus on our interests or develop a new interest. It\u2019s a lot more involved and feels more like you learn about one another by doing it rather than just\u2026 sitting and eating. Frankly I find sitting still and speaking to someone whilst anxiously waiting in a restaurant full of overwhelming things to be the least romantic thing\u2026 however I also am very autistic\n\nI also feel dating is more successful if you know a person from a hobby group rather than date randoms online a majority of the time. In the group environment there\u2019s a lot less pressure and the same common interest\u2014 whatever hobby is being participated in. It just allows for a better understanding of one another and feels easier to bond naturally\n\nEither way\u2026\n\nIf someone doesn\u2019t date you solely because of something out of your control, they likely aren\u2019t the type of people you want to be dating in the first place. Being a partner means boundaries & acceptance & middle grounds.\n\nI need to pace, alone, in the kitchen, while I eat. So usually I will eat my meal before my boyfriend. My boyfriend likes to eat around others, so when he eats I will simply be with him wherever he\u2019s eating and engage with him. That is our middle ground \n\nAnyway, good luck!!",

Before we dated I was absolutely the kind of person that said I would never Date someone who was a picky eater, and I placed a lot of stock in that, but it\u2019s funny when you meet the right person you just realize how little that kind of stuff matters. \n\nI totally accept my partners eating habits now, and I advocate for them. I don\u2019t tolerate people making fun of picky eaters around me. I\u2019m still a huge foodie, and through our relationship my partner has also started to evolve into a foodie and has vastly grown their list of safe foods, which is awesome! But I also want to be clear I\u2019ve never pushed them into that, or required it, I think I\u2019ve just given them total acceptance when it comes to their food choices, so they feel less pressure and in turn will be more open to trying new things. \n\nAnyway, long answer to say; it\u2019s not make or break. And even the people that may think they care, will realize they don\u2019t care when it comes down to it. So good luck :)",

If you find someone who isn\u2019t that into food (I think I would actively avoid someone who describes themselves as a foodie), even if for the first couple of times you steer them towards somewhere you could at least have a side order or something, that might help rather than ruling out going to restaurants altogether?",

      "body": "i know this may not be a popular sentiment in this comment section, but in my experience arfid absolutely severly limits your pool of potential partners when you're interested in dating. forget dating apps, forget meeting people naturally and attending a casual get-together with no weird hiccups or conditions, and forget attempting to make a good impression on anyone when you love them. the fact that you have a problem with food is always a factor that stains the experience in the vast majority of cases, and this goes beyond just romantic relationships.\n\nthe only option left is to operate on the hope that you'll eventually find \"the one\" who both loves you unconditionally and completely accepts your baggage. i know this is what probably happened to a lot of people here, but i think even they would agree that something like this happening is super circumstantial and luck based. you can't force finding someone who is that open and caring, as most people look for *their* version of a perfect partner\n\nit certainly stings to be considered conventionally difficult to date, and in my time it has brought on great loneliness, but i've managed to cope with it lately. just my personal experience",

Food is so social but doing things like picnics where you bring your own food, going out just for coffee or a drink if you can tolerate that. I found going on walks, playing games, doing arts and crafts, creating little adventures around your city, taking a class together, swimming, and plenty of other non food activities are great. Also if there is a food you like and can eat you can center activities around those foods. If you're okay with popcorn, go to a movie. If you like boba tea get a drink and walk in a park, if you can do simple fast foods going to those places for a snack while you're out and about works too. That all just buys you time until you really know the person and are ready to tell them more about arfid and how it affects you.",

Once you are over it you realise food isn't scary. You get used to things tasting bad and you can just chew and swallow.

      "body": "I imagine this experience with having your ARFID ending a previous relationship and is affecting your current love interest is triggering and I think is a good thing that you are acknowledging that so you could avoid the pattern of getting into these types of relationships. I personally have just learned about this being a diagnosis so before I would describe it as an extreme version of picky eating and be real upfront about it. Same thing I do with my other mental illnesses. I have used it in a sense of humor/ice breaker type convo to get a feel for how they respond. I have even put it as a joking part in dating apps in my about me. The successful relationships I have had before the person found it interesting part of me and want to know more. I would say especially adding in autism you need a partner that is patient and understanding and some people are just not that type of person. It really does suck and is embarrassing but if the person is really interested they wouldn\u2019t view it as a deal breaker. My current gf has seen me have to spit out bites of food or return something I just couldn\u2019t eat. If I\u2019m going out to dinner with a group I would just eat before and then go for drinks or just have bread. I try not to let my food limitations dictate where we go unless I\u2019m desperately hungry I just plan around the outing. Definitely not convenient and it does make dating difficult but if your partner doesn\u2019t understand or isn\u2019t willing to the relationship probably isn\u2019t going to go anywhere long term",

My best friend dates a girl with ARFID and whilst my friend is not a huge foodie, their relationship is really strong and ARFID has never been an issue within it. So it's possible to date with ARFID, and if it's possible than it's possible for you. Hobby dates as recommended below are certainly the way to go however if really is just luck as to whether or not the other person is willing to accommodate that.

I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s considered a foodie but he\u2019s someone who loves trying foods & making all sorts of assortments of meals\n\nWe don\u2019t do any form of food dates\u2014 we do hobby dates. Hobby dates allow us to focus on our interests or develop a new interest. It\u2019s a lot more involved and feels more like you learn about one another by doing it rather than just\u2026 sitting and eating. Frankly I find sitting still and speaking to someone whilst anxiously waiting in a restaurant full of overwhelming things to be the least romantic thing\u2026 however I also am very autistic\n\nI also feel dating is more successful if you know a person from a hobby group rather than date randoms online a majority of the time. In the group environment there\u2019s a lot less pressure and the same common interest\u2014 whatever hobby is being participated in. It just allows for a better understanding of one another and feels easier to bond naturally\n\nEither way\u2026\n\nIf someone doesn\u2019t date you solely because of something out of your control, they likely aren\u2019t the type of people you want to be dating in the first place. Being a partner means boundaries & acceptance & middle grounds.\n\nI need to pace, alone, in the kitchen, while I eat. So usually I will eat my meal before my boyfriend. My boyfriend likes to eat around others, so when he eats I will simply be with him wherever he\u2019s eating and engage with him. That is our middle ground \n\nAnyway, good luck!!",

      "body": "Thank you for your advice and for sharing your experience. I feel a bit more level-headed now that I'm fully post-meltdown, and I realize that in past relationships I've never had food as a common interest, and have fully enjoyed those relationships while they lasted, with the relationship-ending factors being completely unrelated to food. Those past relationships have also all started organically through friends/hobbies, not through apps or actively seeking a relationship. I think you're right that hobby groups and such might be the way to go for me, not apps/randoms. \n\nI also agree that I should find someone that accepts this part of me and is willing to work with me as I try to expand my diet. Yesterday was a catalyst into me finally looking into counseling so that I can at least be able to eat enough foods to keep me healthy. I am just sad to potentially have to cut my losses with my current \"situationship\".\n\nThank you again for your kind and detailed response.",
