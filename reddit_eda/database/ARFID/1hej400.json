  "title": "the picky eater\u2019s recovery book: closing thoughts",
  "selftext": "i just finished reading the picky eater\u2019s recovery book! i just have to restate, this book is an incredible tool for anyone with ARFID. it\u2019s super accessible to read and breaks every step of treatment down perfectly. i can\u2019t overstate how excited i am that information like this is so widely accessible. i was delighted to see the authors address body image concerns as well, because even though ARFID doesn\u2019t require them to be diagnosed, it\u2019s still very possible to experience it!!\n\nBUT, i have two critiques:\n\none, the authors frequently use BMI as a tool/point of interest in their ARFID treatment. while i understand that weight is an important factor in ARFID, especially for those who need to gain weight, i was a little disappointed to see it in this book. BMI is just such an old formula that is frequently inaccurate, and it\u2019s used too often in diet culture for me to think about using it on myself. IMO, weight gain/loss deserved a more nuanced take in this book if the authors couldn\u2019t address it without using BMI\n\nsecond, they use myplate as a reference for a \u201cnormal\u201d meal. they do address that a \u201cnormal\u201d meal can look different for everyone, but again, it\u2019s too rooted in diet culture to be included in this book for my tastes. for me, myplate was a frequent reminder in my childhood that i couldn\u2019t eat \u201cnormally,\u201d and using it as a guide for my meals feels icky. obviously this isn\u2019t the same for everyone, but personally i wish the authors didn\u2019t include it in this book. \n\nif you read all the way, thank you! i just wanted to word dump my final thoughts. all in all, this book still gets 5 stars. even though i\u2019ve been in treatment for years, i still got some use out of it, and i recommend it wholeheartedly!!",

They should have separate section on the changing your eating habits for those who are overweight which is as compassionate as the rest of the book is. While I found it frustrating I got enough from it and figured out what steps I needed to take on my own based around their goals. I need to change my grazing to regular snack times, force myself to do regular mealtimes, and choose more of my healthier safe foods for snacks. But at 57 that\u2019s pretty obvious - how to do that is harder and while I can apply some of their advice trying to pick out what\u2019s useful and what isn\u2019t requires having a fair amount of knowledge and not finding the guidance triggering.",
