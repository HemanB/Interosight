  "selftext": "Apparently when you are very deficient in vitamins like zinc, vitamin C, vitamin A, or have not enough protein, your mucocutaneous tissue (lips, genital regions, basically all the skin that transitions to wet tissue) can become extremely fragile. \n\nI experienced this in the corners of my mouth and my perineal area \ud83d\ude2d, unfortunately. Like, going to the bathroom or even wiping slightly too hard creates fissures and it's difficult to heal. For me, that tissue basically has very little stretch. It tears easily, and literally bleeds. I'm a girl, so you can use your imagination as to what else has become impossible. \n\nI'm not sure what *exactly* is the cause because I'm deficient in ALL these things. \n\nYeah, it sucks. I guess I didn't think vitamin deficiency could happen to me. I'm taking vitamins now (even though they're gross).\n\nHas this happened to anyone else? What helped? ",

I\u2019ve been a similar and way less extreme situation before due to IBS; never found a real remedy besides increasing my fiber intake to make stool pass easier. \n\n If you can tolerate it, kale has vitamins K, A, C, as well as fiber, which may make it less painful to use the restroom. Baked potatoes, strawberries, and blueberries are good sources of vitamin C. Maybe Emergen-C, when taken with a lot of water, could help with vitamin C deficiency but I\u2019d still talk to your GP about other remedies.  I blend the aforementioned fruits and kale into a smoothie to get all the vitamins at once and I make smoothies pretty often so perhaps that would help with the vitamin deficiencies\u2026These are just the first ideas that come to mind; hope they help and you get better soon.",

I would bleed longer when I was cut and I bruised from things just leaning on me. All our vitamins are very important in healing and building tissues to prevent fragility. I\u2019ve been on multivitamins for about 3 months now and will be on them forever. I had to take over 1000 mg of vitamin C to bring my levels from 3/85 to 80/85.

I also used to have oily skin but the deficiency in Vitamin C made my skin crack, break and become dry AF!! I was also vitamin A deficient for about 1-1.5 years around 2022 and had to take 3x the dose recommended due to being so severe. I had problems seeing, as well as feeling more \u201cblind\u201d at night then usual (my vitamin A is now normal).

I find baby carrots and sugar snap peas to be the easiest to eat mindlessly.

          "body": "I was diagnosed with scurvy (aka vitamin C deficiency) which is rare in a 1st world country. I would have wounds appear for no reason and they would struggle to heal. I would bleed longer when I was cut and I bruised from things just leaning on me. All our vitamins are very important in healing and building tissues to prevent fragility. I\u2019ve been on multivitamins for about 3 months now and will be on them forever. I had to take over 1000 mg of vitamin C to bring my levels from 3/85 to 80/85. This took about 3 months and can down lower my dose before stopping the vitamin C (as I will get it from 1x fruit a day). I also used to have oily skin but the deficiency in Vitamin C made my skin crack, break and become dry AF!! I was also vitamin A deficient for about 1-1.5 years around 2022 and had to take 3x the dose recommended due to being so severe. I had problems seeing, as well as feeling more \u201cblind\u201d at night then usual (my vitamin A is now normal). My bloods would also be repeated every 8 weeks - to check for reabsorption syndrome, I\u2019m due again soon but so far everything\u2019s going okay. I also have the gastric sleeve which made things 10x harder/worse. \n\nI\u2019m happy to chat more, or show photos on here of what my skin looked like!",
