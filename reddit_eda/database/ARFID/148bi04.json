When I graduated from highschool I went out looking for some casual work, I started working a large grocery chain and shortly after started work at the Deli department, being exposed to a lot of different kinds of meats and their smells allowed me to get more comfortable around meat. Eventually I decided to try a bit of ham that I really like the smell of as well some of the hot roast chickens we cook. After that I started trying out a lot of other things from the deli to the point now where meat isn't really an issue with me and now is one of my top safe foods. With these meat boxes specifically I was with my mate who's Lebanese and we went shopping for some random things and decided to have some lunch there and went to a kebab place and I decided to try out one of their meatbox's.",

It's tough justifying trying new foods when you have to pay for a whole meal first, that starts feeling wasteful very quickly. \n \n \n \nBut when you can take home stuff that's gonna go bad anyways, try a meal that was sent back by a customer, or let's be honest just snack while you work on the ingredients you're not supposed to, slowly safe foods start getting added.",
