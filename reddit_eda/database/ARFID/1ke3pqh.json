And for whatever reason it's a noticeably different texture. I spent years hearing \"it's the same thing, the ingredients are completely the same, see?\" when they even *look* different. I know my safe foods well enough to notice. \n\nDoes anyone else experience similar things where people will insist that different versions of the same food (size, shape, brand, etc.) are \"the same\"?",
