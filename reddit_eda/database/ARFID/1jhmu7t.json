As soon as any leftovers go in to the fridge / freezer, they are never coming out the same. \n\nThis stems from getting ice cream today, my mom didn\u2019t want to wait to order it (i was currently making my dinner) so she just put mine in the freezer saying \u201cit\u2019ll be the same\u201d ,, no the hell it wasn\u2019t \ud83d\ude2d ",

I will NOT eat leftover pizza, mac n cheese, anything that is fried or crispy, or sandwiches. Nothing that will separate or get greasy in the microwave. Most times I add a bit of water to whatever I am reheating and that helps with the taste and texture a lot, especially if you\u2019re using the microwave.",

Or oxidation of fats in the food, which I think many people just can't taste, but we definitely can. It also causes protein denaturization, and the reheating causes hydrolysis as water molecules in the food break down further, making things more starchy and changing the texture. \n\nIt is literally NOT the same.  I wish it was. I'm disabled. I don't enjoy making my life harder. It's hard for me to cook multiple times a day. I'd rather eat cold food than reheated food, though. But not everyone can stomach that. \n\nI prep my ingredients for meal planning- chop veggies, mix sauces, portion before hand etc so it's easy to pull out and cook, etc. instead of cooking in advance. Every time I try cooking in advance I wind up throwing out so much. Now I just cook small, unless it's something that I know will be enjoyed cold.",

Or oxidation of fats in the food, which I think many people just can't taste, but we definitely can. It also causes protein denaturization, and the reheating causes hydrolysis as water molecules in the food break down further, making things more starchy and changing the texture. \n\nIt is literally NOT the same.  I wish it was. I'm disabled. I don't enjoy making my life harder. It's hard for me to cook multiple times a day. I'd rather eat cold food than reheated food, though. But not everyone can stomach that. \n\nI prep my ingredients for meal planning- chop veggies, mix sauces, portion before hand etc so it's easy to pull out and cook, etc. instead of cooking in advance. Every time I try cooking in advance I wind up throwing out so much. Now I just cook small, unless it's something that I know will be enjoyed cold.",
