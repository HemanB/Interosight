I saw a video on Facebook about a woman showing her boyfriend with ARFID trying new foods, and the comments were all so hateful and judgmental towards him even though the video contained a thorough explanation of the condition as he ate the unfamiliar foods, looking extremely happy as he realized he enjoyed them.\n\nEveryone is so close-minded when it comes to ARFID, it's just ridiculous. How are we supposed to get better when no one cares to learn?",
