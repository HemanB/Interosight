  "title": "I ATE SAUCE!!",
  "selftext": "As long as I've lived, I haven't been able to eat any sauce or liquid-ish condiment. No ketchup, mayo, pasta with red sauce, none of it. It's been years upon years since I've tried, too, as it's never been something I dared dream of.\n\nBut today I conquered! My bf and I were making tandoori chicken with rice and peas, which he eats with sauce and I without. But I tasted a bite of his food, and it wasn't terrible! I felt like I could've eaten more if it!! The sauce even had onion in it!!! This is a miracle!!!!",

Then I just do it. Sometimes it turns out well, sometimes it doesn\u2019t. One step at a time. Great accomplishment!! \ud83d\ude0a",
