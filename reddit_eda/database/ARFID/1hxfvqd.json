  "selftext": "Japanese food has been a favorite of mine for sensory reasons for ages. I don't know why, but a lot of dishes are just pleasing to the palate in ways I can't really explain. \n\nJust lost one again. \n\nThis time, it's raw salmon. I've always liked the taste, the texture, the springiness. With rice and soy sauce? Always an easy pleaser in poke bowls, sushi, etc.\n\nShit Brain: you know that's flesh right? That's flesh. If you bit into a living dish that's what it'd be like. That's flesh. \n\nAugh. \n\nI really really really really REALLY REALLY hope this isn't the start of something bigger and worse. I've been decently functional for the last x many years. But safe foods are suddenly getting pointed at by Shit Brain and I HOPE it's not a trend.\n\nNot particularly looking for advice, but I won't ban it either. Just. Idk. I want someone to get it. ",

Every time you think it do that same action. Make it an action you don\u2019t do much. Then do a new action and think positive thoughts about the dish. For example press your index finger. Make sure it\u2019s consistent. Do it for a few weeks and you should be able to train your thoughts to appear from your motions just like a Pavlov dog \ud83d\ude05. Once that\u2019s definitely set try the fish again doing the happy motion (pressing your index finger) and seeing if that works. \n\nIt can take a while especially for more stubborn brains but it can work. I loved spag bol but then my brain made spaghetti out to look like worms/maggots when my husband joked it once looked raw and wriggling. Took me a few weeks but I did fix it. Granted I don\u2019t have ARFID I have quite severe OCD but the two conditions can overlap. \n\nJust a thought to try.",

      "body": "Yes, the majority of the field agrees it is a thing. It\u2019s an easier way to understand the version of OCD. What we do see is that the \u201crituals\u201d exist they\u2019re just often only happening in my brain or directing behavior. So maybe we don\u2019t check a doorknob, but we walk a certain way down the sidewalk because it \u201cjust feels wrong\u201d and that\u2019s often connected to something else that day. That\u2019s not a good example. We\u2019d also sometimes classify some of my responses as rituals because I fall into a comfort task to avoid the bad feeling that come from ocd causing me to avoid the undesired thing. In contamination OCD, I find I have rituals they\u2019re just not noticeable or visible particularly. For example, I realized that if I touched something dirty, even if I washed my hands, the tips of those fingers would be contaminated for me. Or like I\u2019d try to move something gross with just one finger trip or use just my nails to move a napkin. Then, indefinitely until like a shower maybe, I would kind of quarantine that finger without putting much thought into it. I starting trying to be really present in what I\u2019m doing and I noticed I hold things weird and then I was like wait, that\u2019s ocd! Forcing myself to fully grip things is still not something I can totally do. Picking through and examining food is another type of ritual. \u201cDelusions\u201d are also just magical thinking in OCD. Like if I don\u2019t touch anything with my finger that I used to open the car door, nothing else will be infected. Even if I\u2019ve washed it, it\u2019s still dirty. Now, if my dog licked that finger it feels neutral again and is \u201cclean\u201d but not clean for my mouth. There are levels. These levels are also delusional to the degree that we take them in OCD. Same with like if I eat a weird piece of rice or a bug something bad will happen is a delusion/magical thinking. Same thing if it\u2019s more defined, like if I eat a bad piece of rice it will give me a disease. Another good delusion of mine is that I would like to say \u201cbut obviously that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d But my brain says WHAT IF IT DOES and then I\u2019d be a liar or possibly have caused this to happen because I brought attention to it. Just\u2026trust me, there are delusions lol. Just not always the typical ones.",
