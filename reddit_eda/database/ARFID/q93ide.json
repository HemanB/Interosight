Not by my mom, but by my aunt and my preschool teacher. My teacher always made sure I was the very last to leave the table at lunch (\"can't leave until you eat\"). She would always sit by my side and yell at me to eat, in front of all the other kids. My aunt once took away my books when I didn't eat enough at lunch.\n\nIf your kid is having trouble eating and is underweight, you take them to a freaking doctor. You don't guilt trip them and burn their stuff. She is so sure she has the right to destroy her kid's properties it baffles me.",
