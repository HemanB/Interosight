If you knew how rarely they thought about you, you would not worry about it. \n\nJust be proud you are different and explain it to others as an interesting thing. There is absolutely nothing to be ashamed of. I have none of the thought in the pic going out, although I do get annoyed when they don\u2019t have fries tho. Everyone (except Sushi and Thai places) have bread.",
