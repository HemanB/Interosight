  "selftext": "I hate being this picky about food! It fucking blows! Why do people think we choose to be like this? Do you really think I enjoy having to just not eat every time I go out to dinner with anyone? Do you think it\u2019s fun that the only thing I can eat at most places is shit off the kids menu? It\u2019s fucking embarrassing. I feel sick all of the time because of my diet. It\u2019s a struggle to get enough calories to maintain wait half the time. I fucking hate being this way. Why would I choose this?",
