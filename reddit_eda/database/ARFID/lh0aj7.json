As are kidneys, liver, and everything else that the NHS tests when they do a full blood test.  Do I think I'm going to pop my clogs any second? No.  Do I think I'm going to go earlier than if I was a perfect weight with perfect eating habits? Yes., probably.  But, and the big but for me is, I'm old enough to have seen a fair few people around me over the years go for many, many different reasons, and way before their time.  Sure, I worry I might not live to see grandkids or even my own kids get married. But for at least around another 10 years I can't see that my diet is going to be the reason. Eventually it will play a part in my overall quality of life.  But death comes early and without warning for some and I believe worrying about that is pointless.

I mean, I'm not a medical professional, so I could be wrong, but she did make it clear to me that I'd really have to be shovelling down the sugar by the truckload. \n\nEveryone is different, so what applies to you may not apply to me, but the amount of sugar you have to consume to even become pre-diabetic is a lot. More than our ED addled brains think is 'a lot'. \n\nI mean, she didn't recommend doing this, but she said even if I had a full sugar can of coke for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and two snacks, I'd still not be consuming enough right now. (That's if we can even consume it, I'd feel sick after two from the sweetness.) \n\nWhen we don't give our bodies proper fuel to function - which being underweight, we don't, we force our bodies to burn everything - muscle, organs, *everything*. What happens is that when we do eat, our bodies jump on top of it immediately and put it to use. Sugar is just energy. It isn't proper nourishment, but it's energy. \n\nWe are effectively constantly running on empty. Once we hit a normal weight - a healthy weight for our body types, then we need to be more concerned about sugar intake.",

I'm not at my worst, but I still register as underweight. I stopped eating sugar, because I was (and still am) so afraid of diabetes. \n\nMy doctor said the amount of sugar that someone in my condition would have to consume; daily, to even become prediabetic is absurd. As in, I would have to make it my job to get it. When you're not eating much, you can feel sick pretty quickly when you start to up your caloric intake. So even forcing yourself to eat sugary things when you're already feeling sick from eating more than you usually do will mean a real feat of strength. Especially because what sugar you are eating, your body is using because we give it so little else to use.  \n\nBodies are incredibly resilient. It's truly amazing what kind of shit you can put them through only for them to bounce back and be like 'the fuck was that'. \n\nFor what it's worth, I completely relate. I truly do.",
