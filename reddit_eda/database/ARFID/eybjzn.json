  "selftext": "fruits have always been the worst fear foods for me and the only fruit i can kinda eat so far is apple, as long as it's not too juicy.     \n        \ntoday a friend, who i've recently sort of opened up to about my eating, suggested blueberries as a fruit i could possibly enjoy/that did not seem *too* unsafe. i was hesitant about this as i've tried raspberries before and had an awful experience with that but when i came home and my mom told me she'd bought fresh blueberries, it seemed a bit like fate.     \n       \ni took a tiny bite out of half a blueberry at first (the way one does lmao) and when that seemed okay, i ate the rest of the berry and then four more!!      \n while eating the last one i even decided that i *liked* the taste instead of just *being able to tolerate it*.      \n i'm so happy!!",
