  "selftext": "While going through treatment some years ago I was trying a lot of new foods. My co-workers as well as my wife always raved about how good the general tso's chicken was at a local Chinese foot place. My wife eats everything, not a super taster.\n\nAnyways, I excitedly got my nerves up to try this chicken. My wife and I went to the restaurant and placed and order for it along with my favorite beef teriyaki. I took one bite of the chicken and couldn't believe my wife failed to tell me that it was cooked in peanut oil. My earliest memory of rejecting food is of peanut butter. \n\nI asked my wife why she didn't tell me. She said I was crazy, there is no way I could taste the peanut oil. So we asked the cook and he confirmed that it was indeed cooked in peanut oil.\n\nAs a super taster, it's my curse with having arfid. On the other hand, my Dr said if I ever overcame my disorder I'd make on hell of a foodie reviewing foods.",

My mom and sister loved them, but I couldn't enjoy them, because they tasted like salad. It turns out that they kept them next to the salad bar, and somehow just being in that location that transferred enough smell/taste to the cookies that it ruined them for me. The problem wasn't even the salad itself (which I can eat, if drowned in dressing), it was the cookie+salad flavor clash.\n  \nPretty minor thing, but kind of funny, and pretty representative of the story of my life.",
