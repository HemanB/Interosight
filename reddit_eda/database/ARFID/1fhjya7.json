  "selftext": "I think I\u2019ll definitely keep drinking smoothies more as a way to get fruit or maybe even vegetables, because it gets rid of all the texture issues I may have with them. I had a smoothie with bananas and strawberries and it was pretty good, but VERY sweet so it was a bit hard to drink it all. Anyone have any idea how to cut the edge off of the sweetness a little?",
