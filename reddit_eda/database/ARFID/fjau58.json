  "selftext": "Everyone has to cope with a crisis in his or her own ways. But for those of us with ARFID, this global pandemic means we may not be able to live as comfortably as we've been able to in the past.\n\nOur favorite (that is to say, \"safe\") restaurants may close--or we may have to employ Social Distancing during this health crisis.\n\nOur grocery stores may be out of our preferred (again, \"safe\") foods, and we may have to opt for alternative brands; or recipes; or different, challenging foods altogether.\n\nI'm writing this post not because I have the answers, but because I want us all to weather this storm with strength and patience. I had a rough time at the grocery store yesterday, but I am fortunate to have a patient partner who trusts me to give it a second shot (at, hopefully, a better-stocked store) on my own.\n\nIf you want to share your stories and struggles, this is as good a thread as any. How are you managing?",
