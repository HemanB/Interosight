      "body": "I\u2019m always ordering off the menu. I\u2019ve been doing this since I was under 10 back in the 1970s. It\u2019s gotten so much easier now that allergies, eating disorders, vegan, vegetarian, fad diets, and religious restrictions have gotten more acceptable. It\u2019s also much easier now that menus are online so I can figure out what I\u2019m going to order, make notes in my phone, and am prepared for the rare freeze moments where I\u2019ll show the waitstaff my notes because I\u2019m tongue tied.\n\nI was a waitress for a few years. The only thing I cared about my customers orders was getting them right. No judgments on the food. \n\nTips from 50 years of ordering off menu\n* Look at online menus and pick 2-3 options in case they are out of your #1 \n* Look at children\u2019s and lunch menus as those are smaller portions and frequently have fewer ingredients - talk to a manager if waitstaff says no you can\u2019t order off those and explain your making this request due to food restrictions/smaller appetite for medical reasons. I\u2019ll offer to pay more for the kids menu if I sense this is the issue.\n* I find it can be easier to create something new based off of ingredients so instead of asking for menu item X but having them remove 10 things I\u2019ll ask can they make me a grilled chicken with garlic with a side of mashed potatoes with only butter. \n* Write down what you\u2019ve decided to order in a note on your phone so if you have a brain fart you can remember what you decided & can even show it to waitstaff if your having a hard time speaking due to anxiety \n* Don\u2019t be afraid to ask to talk to the chef if you\u2019re at a fancy/very expensive restaurant as they are frequently willing to work with you based on your safe food restrictions - calling ahead at a quieter hour (ex. 10-11:30am & 2-5pm on weekdays) as someone else mentioned may be easier \n* Order a drink and an appetizer or drink and dessert if that\u2019s the only thing on the menu you feel confident eating. I\u2019m including soda, lemonade, tea, and coffee as drinks no matter the time of day.\n* I joke with the waitstaff that \u201cI\u2019m going to be the complicated order in our party are you ready?\u201d it \u201cdisarms\u201d anyone I\u2019m eating with - kinda hard to give me a hard time when I\u2019m joking and laughing about my food restrictions \n* It\u2019s ok to request a complete list of all ingredients including all seasonings - just say you\u2019re sensitive to a lot of ingredients and it\u2019s easier to see a recipe list than carry around pages of ingredients that your unable to enjoy",

Like with Mexican food, there's literally nothing I could eat even modified. If it was a burger? I could with mods. It just takes time to get over the embarrassment. With practice and with age, you will feel better. I've realized that food service workers have dealt with everything. They're not judging you, they don't care. The ONLY thing they care about and you need to worry about is being kind and respectful. If someone was being rude as hell and demanding all these mods? Yeah, they'd be annoyed.. But if you're just friendly and kind? Its no issue. I'll be like \"sorry I have food restrictions, I know it sounds crazy lol\" like self depricating and letting them know you're self aware and know how weird your food request is. They'll laugh with ya. Also, maybe tip more if it's an extreme ask. \n\nEither way, you're fine and no one cares as much as you think they do. Everyone has their own lives and shit to think about so they're forgetting you as soon as you leave (in a good way). \n\nThe main takeaway here is CONFIDENCE and being \"in on the joke\" and self aware. Laugh at yourself before others can, and they'll be laughing with you. Think about it - if you saw someone trip and then get all embarrassed or cry, you feel embarrassed with them and feel bad for them. If you see them trip and they start laughing, it breaks the tension and you don't feel that secondhand embarrassment.",

I do have a few legitimate allergies, but none that would cause a visit to the hospital. I also only mention allergy as a last resort if they are being really insensitive about it. One of my allergies is to red meat, so cross contamination is a big one for me so I usually choose to only get food from vegetarian and vegan restaurants.",

          "body": "I rarely go to restaurants anymore, but when asking for menu item customization, I would always tell them it was an allergy if they gave me crap about it. It usually worked out okay and I was taken more seriously. Sometimes asking to speak directly to the cook (sometimes calling ahead of time to do so) has helped to be taken more seriously because they are actually making the food and tend to care a little more. I worked in restaurants for years as wait staff and sometimes there can be a lot of pressure and fear when asked to customize menu items because you are told you aren\u2019t allowed to do that unless it\u2019s allergy related. I hope this helps a little!",

I get it, it takes time and effort to prepare a meal but you made the decision to serve others. If you can't handle a modification to the order then maybe you should rethink your choices. Some modifications are medically necessary, some are religious and some are just because. Me wanting something a certain way is not disrespectful to the cook. It's actually respectful because it lessens the chances that I will send the order back or ordering something else. By modifying my meal it means that I am still enjoying the meal the cook spent time preparing. Meaning I save them time by not having to redo my order and they can use that time for other orders.",
