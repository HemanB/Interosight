  "selftext": "Just found this sub and thought you would all appreciate my workmate Mel as much as I do. Three days into a work conference and I'd been questioned by colleagues at every damn meal. Well meaning but embarrassing. \n\nLunch time of day three and Mel says quietly but firmly- \"Can we all please leave witchinmelbourne alone? She is fine, she is eating what she can from the buffet and I imagine the questions are making her uncomfortable\".\n\nI could have cried. I'd only met her a few times and she knew nothing about my ARFID, or (i think) ARFID in general. She just saw how uncomfortable I was and decided to be my ally. \n\nThe next two days were chill, no one said a word, and Mel remains one of my favorite people \u2764",
