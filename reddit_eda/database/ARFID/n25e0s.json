  "selftext": "I feel so guilty whenever I make a recipe and I hate the texture or taste and it literally makes me gag and I can barely stomach it. I was taught not to waste food growing up and I try really hard but some food I just physically and psychologically can not get it down no matter what.\n\nIt also doesn\u2019t help that I get nausea from anxiety before I even eat any food for the day which also lowers my appetite in addition to the ARFID.\n\nIdk maybe I should stop torturing myself by trying new recipes and just stick to my safe foods? I just hate my overactive gag reflex so much",

Maybe try incorporating small healthier ingredients into your safe foods, like one extra ingredient at a time and try it that way first instead of trying completely new recipes. That\u2019s what has been working for me. At first I started by ordering full meals at restaurants when I was out with my friends and I would barely eat a bite or two and I\u2019d end up paying so much. I thought by forcing myself to get something new off the menu each time would force me to get better but it didn\u2019t really work. Exposure to cooking and putting ingredients in myself and seeing what it is and how it comes together definitely works better. Maybe cook food for other people and then just save some for your own taste tests so you\u2019re not wasting the whole thing.",

          "body": "Yeah I can relate to this a lot, I go through leftovers so slowly which is why they probably spoil quickly, and I don\u2019t have that big of an appetite so I can\u2019t finish home made meals that quickly either.\n\nI definitely agree with the whole \u2018too much effort\u2019 to eat thing. Lately I\u2019ve just really hated all the effort it takes to just swallow something. My bf luckily has a huge appetite and eats the stuff I don\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s weird though cause it\u2019s almost like I have an aversion to eating food cooked by myself. If I\u2019m at a restaurant I order anything I want and usually have no issue with textures or anything but if I make it myself it always tastes disgusting. Maybe it\u2019s a psychological thing? Idk. I feel like my case of ARFID is a lot less bad than what other people have posted on this sub.",
