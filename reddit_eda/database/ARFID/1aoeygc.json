My other parent sometimes wouldn\u2019t even feed me when I was staying with them as they were usually passed out on the couch. As a result, I don\u2019t have proper hunger cues, I don\u2019t have a varied palette due to lack of exposure during childhood, I get full fast due to small portions, I can just turn my hunger off because I had to not feel it as a small child in order to cope. \n\nWhilst I have ADHD and sensory issues which affect my arfid, I don\u2019t think I would have arfid had my childhood been different. My ADHD makes it hard to go get food for myself, but this wouldn\u2019t be a problem if I didn\u2019t have the ability to just turn off my hunger and if I didn\u2019t view eating as optional. My sensory issues with food are due to being a \u201csuper taster\u201d which, again, can be attributed to only eating basic, bland food growing up, and honestly so could my texture sensitivity too as I honestly only ate chicken nuggets, chips and bread growing up so I never had to adapt to different textures. \n\nMy older sibling who endured all of this with me went the other way and deals with obesity. Neither of us have a healthy relationship with food because we weren\u2019t fed properly. I definitely do not think arfid is a disorder of privilege, but actually I\u2019d be more inclined to say those in privileged positions who have Arfid are probably in the minority. Most of us more than likely had something during childhood which led to disordered eating, and often that something is some form of abuse.",

I've discussed my issue with a friend who had a similar issue growing up, and he said that he didn't recover from ARFID until he started discovering better versions of certain foods.  He even said the type I have (which presents itself as looking like a vegetarian diet mostly) is probably due to the fact that \"bad vegetables are OK, but bad meat is REALLY bad.\"  \n\n\n\\--According to \"Nourishing Traditions Book of Baby and Childcare\", part of what causes picky eating is actually what the mother is eating during pregnancy and how foods are introduced during infancy/very early childhood.  A mother from a more prosperous background is more likely to be eating a wide variety of nutrient-dense foods during pregnancy and less likely to rely on the cheap, easy things that tend to cause ARFID like feeding the baby bottles of apple juice early in life.  To follow the advice in \"Nourishing Traditions\" you really do need to have a higher budget for food or at least a lot of time and access to a farm.  You simply won't find 95% of the foods they recommend in a food pantry.  \n\n\nHaving ARFID is not \"privileged\".

As a result, I don\u2019t have proper hunger cues, I don\u2019t have a varied palette due to lack of exposure during childhood, I get full fast due to small portions, I can just turn my hunger off because I had to not feel it as a small child in order to cope. \n\nWhilst I have ADHD and sensory issues which affect my arfid, I don\u2019t think I would have arfid had my childhood been different. My ADHD makes it hard to go get food for myself, but this wouldn\u2019t be a problem if I didn\u2019t have the ability to just turn off my hunger and if I didn\u2019t view eating as optional. My sensory issues with food are due to being a \u201csuper taster\u201d which, again, can be attributed to only eating basic, bland food growing up, and honestly so could my texture sensitivity too as I honestly only ate chicken nuggets, chips and bread growing up so I never had to adapt to different textures. \n\nMy older sibling who endured all of this with me went the other way and deals with obesity. Neither of us have a healthy relationship with food because we weren\u2019t fed properly. I definitely do not think arfid is a disorder of privilege, but actually I\u2019d be more inclined to say those in privileged positions who have Arfid are probably in the minority.

Just like AN serving the purpose of leading the tribe to food, despite starving, because they could ignore the reaction to their emaciated bodies, not expending energy on food unless it was truly worth the energy, in favor of moving and seeking out more food. People with ARFID would also be able to seek out more food without getting side-tracked, and were likely more perceptive to foods that would cause food poisoning.\n\nIt may come off as privileged now, if you constantly have access to your safe foods, but, no, it's not a disorder borne out of privilege, nor exclusive to the privileged.",

Just like AN serving the purpose of leading the tribe to food, despite starving, because they could ignore the reaction to their emaciated bodies, not expending energy on food unless it was truly worth the energy, in favor of moving and seeking out more food. People with ARFID would also be able to seek out more food without getting side-tracked, and were likely more perceptive to foods that would cause food poisoning.\n\nIt may come off as privileged now, if you constantly have access to your safe foods, but, no, it's not a disorder borne out of privilege, nor exclusive to the privileged.",
