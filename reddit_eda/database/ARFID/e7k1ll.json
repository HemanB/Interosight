  "selftext": "So, I was wondering if we could set up some form of weekly sticky thread or something, where in we all state what new food we are going to try this week and others can comment on good tips to help with that particular food, or just give some encouragement to those trying. \n\nThere are so many fantastic tips in this sub, but I think a weekly thread in which we actively pick a new food to try - perhaps seeing that there are three or four others trying the same new food as yourself at the same time can really help mentally. \n\nARFID is something I find particularly hard to deal with alone, and this sub has been so beneficial to me in it's discovery, but I think this might help us all a bit more. \n\nThoughts?",

      "body": "Technically it's a root/starch just like a potato and for people that are potato lovers is not a bad stretch. My ARFID BF went From Potato to sweet potato with good success. It was before he met me so I can't explain his process, but I do know texture can still make ways of preparing sweet potatoes complicated for him. But he's more likely to try different ways to cook sweet potatoes now because he knows he can like the base taste of sweet potatoes.  So I'd suggest when your trying it, bake it plain to start. That way you know what a neutral/natural sweet potato tastes like, as a control, and depending on that, if you feeling up for it, with each bite try it with different seasoning. Like plain bite, salted bite, and sugar bite. (if you can get that far) it's kinda a scientific breakdown way to try it but I feel like it would give you less variables when your trying something new. (if that helps to think that way). \n\nSomething to keep in mind, if you have the option, buy from a farmers market. As a foodie, grocery store foods make even my favorite produce taste bad. It's hard to find a ripe/good/nutritional vegetable easily in the market. Just as an example from my experience - blueberries in the store: it's around 80% more likely your options are sour, not ripe, and firm, but in a farmers market it's dramatically more (like 90%) more likely you find sweet, ripe, and juicy produce. Not to scare people away from the store if it's what you have, but it's just more likely you'll find a bad tasting fruit or vegetable by anyone's pallet. No one would want you to get a upsetting start to your produce journey because you got a bad sample.  (I'm also going to make this a separate post)\n\nGood luck! \ud83d\ude01",
