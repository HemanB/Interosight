  "selftext": "I've been wanting to add fruit to the granola I've been making and got the idea to try freeze dried fruit from other posts here, so since I already like frozen strawberries, figured freeze dried ones could be my gateway so I got some. Tried one and it was good! Have a lovely crunch and taste. Annnnd then my dad had to open his big stupid mouth and say \"just make sure you don't eat to many because they expand in your stomach\" and now everytime I looked at the bag of freeze dried strawberries my dumbass brain pickures my stomach expanding like a balloon and popping, so now I can't eat them. I got to enjoy exactly ONE PIECE BEFORE HE RUINED THEM \n\nDamn fucking damnit I hate it here",

For now I understand if it feels like to much, but I am so proud of you and I think you can try again later. For portioning I would look at the serving size on the box/bag.

Freeze dried strawberries don\u2019t expand and  they won\u2019t make your stomach explode. \n\nProve it to yourself. Take a freeze dried strawberry, put it on a plate, and pour a little vinegar on it. What does it do? Does it expand so much it would make your stomach explode? \n\nRemember, your stomach is full of stomach acid. Not water. It can\u2019t rehydrate something. And it\u2019s not vinegar either, it\u2019s way more potent and it\u2019s good at destroying food. Also! Strawberries are one of the fastest digestible foods, & freeze drying can shorten that process ([20 minutes](https://bonapeti.com/n-123216-How_Long_Does_It_Take_to_Digest_Food) or [less](https://www.barnalab.com/en/freeze-drying-of-nutraceuticals/)). So even if you over ate the strawberries, and even if your dad wasn\u2019t an idiot, your body would digest them faster than they could absorb and expand ([over an hour](https://www.backpackingchef.com/dehydrating-strawberries.html)). \n\nYour stomach is roughly 12 inches long, and 6 inches across when empty. [It can hold 75 times its empty volume!](https://open.oregonstate.education/aandp/chapter/23-4-the-stomach/)\n\nYour stomach can hold upwards of 4 liters of food at once (that\u2019s 16 cups), of course most people never eat that much food. The average meal is only 4 cups of food. And your body is constantly processing food! It\u2019s really hard to fill your stomach up to the point of pain unless you\u2019re actively competitive eating. And your body will make you stop eating before you could ever make yourself \u201cexplode\u201d.\n\nI promise, you could eat a whole bag of freeze dried strawberries.

If you put the freeze dried / dehydrated strawberries into a bowl of water you can see exactly how big they expand at optimal conditions. Your stomach is filled with acid. Even if you drink a ton of water when you ate freeze fried strawberries the acid in your stomach would start breaking down the strawberries immediately.\u00a0\n\n\nRealistically.

I reconstitute fruits & veggies all the time for recipes by soaking in water. I promise they don't absorb that much, and if you wanted to give it a try, you could take the size of portion you'd like to eat, drop it in some warm water, and walk away for an hour. Come back and see how much it has changed - which won't be much- so you can have a new visual! Grab a spoon, maybe squish it up or stir it, and notice how little the volume changes. Freeze-dried fruit is a great nutrient-dense snack to have on hand, maybe this will help!\u00a0",

I get noses wiped on me, have been pooped on, vomited on, the works.  Childcare is not for the weak!) \n\nBUT!  Soap and water?  Washes most of the big bad germs away.  Antibacterial soap and water?  Now you\u2019re golden.  So those kids going and washing up after using the bathroom, before and after they eat, etc?  They\u2019re getting rid of the germs on their hands (until they stick them in their mouths again, at which point it\u2019s just saliva germs and not poop germs though!)  And the silverware?  Washed and clean since they last touched them, right?  Any germs are gone.  Washed away in the sink, dishwasher, etc.  All clean!  \n\nIf the kids wash their hands then set the table?  Things are pretty solid.  Not much room for gross germs between the hand wash, picking up silverware, and placing it on the table.  If you\u2019re there when it\u2019s happening, you can even invite everyone to all wash their hands together with you first (we always did a big family hand wash before setting the table in my house!)",
