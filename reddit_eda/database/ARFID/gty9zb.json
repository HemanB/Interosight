And then when I say I say that's not what I ordered all they do is SCRAPE IT OFF. So there's still all the vomit inducing pockets of cheese all over the meat. Just no. \n\nIt's embarrassing to have to order a hamburger and say \"just meat and bun\" but I have to do it every time to not get cheese. \n\nDon't get me started on every single frozen breakfast item having cheese. It's everywhere. EVERYWHERE!!!!!",
