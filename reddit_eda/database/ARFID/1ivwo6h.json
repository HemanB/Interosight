  "selftext": "So my parents made ravioli for dinner and it had butternut squash in it. It tasted vaguely like cinnamon and I like cinnamon so it wasn't *too* bad, but looking at the inside of the ravioli and seeing the texture made it x1000 worse. I asked her why it tasted weirdly like cinnamon and she just started laughing and she bet my dad that I would be able to tell the difference right away. It wasn't even so much the taste as much as it was the fact that they bought it because my mom bet my dad I would be able to tell the difference. I'm so fucking glad it wasn't so bad to cause me to have a really bad reaction, but I ended up throwing the rest out anyway because it hurt my feelings. (Plus, seeing the texture of the cheese didn't help)",

I remember running to the bathroom as my gag reflex went into overdrive and my parents frustration at my \"over reaction.\" I hated lentils after that. Could not stand them. Even as I slowly started to accept beans as a safe food, lentils weren't edible. It wasn't until a little over 20 years later that I was able to consider lentils as food.\n\nYour parents messed up big time by tricking you. They should have taken it slow and openly.  Even if the food is ruined for you now, I hope one day you'll be able to consider trying it again in small doses. I also hope this hasn't ruined ravioli for you as a whole. A part of why I used to hate meal times was because I felt the need to inspect every bit of my food.",
