So the milk adds some calories as well. Overall I'm happy enough with it that I just repurchased, it actually helped me save around $300 since I don't buy fast food at lunch anymore. \n\nThe texture can be a bit of hit or miss though, adding ice and putting it in the fridge for at least 20min before leaving the house helps tremendously. And you need to shake it really well to get smooth consistency amd before you drink it but since it's made from oats, it's always going to be a bit grainy.",
