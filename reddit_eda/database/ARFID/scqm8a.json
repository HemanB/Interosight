The only \"picky eaters\" most people know are children. It's not much of a stretch for them to think that we, with outwardly-similar behavior but better rationalization for it, \"just need to grow up\". They're *wrong*, but I don't blame them.\n\nI mean... I go to work everyday. I pay taxes. I do all the adult stuff without any real impediment... yet I won't eat a burger if there's a speck of condiment on it? *Should* that make sense to people? It doesn't even make sense to *me*.\n\nI just see it as a reason to better my situation.",
