Don't delete it in case you need it as evidence, good job keeping a screenshot, obviously. Engaging in any way, no matter what a zinger you think you have, is validation for them first and foremost and I think we all know that. If anyone asks if you got a message, what I'd do is play dumb and ice that person out of my life. They want a reaction from you, because your discomfort is entertainment for them.",

Also take the number to your parents.\n\nAdditionally, google the number and put it into social media sites like Facebook or Discord, that can often tell you who the owner is.\n\nIf you can identify the owner and they're at work or school with you, report them for harassment and discrimination. If they're not and they're a family member or something, tell your parents and their parents that this twat has started to harass you.\n\nIf you can't identify the number, block it and move on. You might be tempted to send them something back - I wouldn't, even if you find out who they are. Just pretend you never saw it.\n\nBullies thrive on reactions. They enjoy knowing they got to cause pain. Give them nothing and if you're ever asked about it, pretend you didn't get anything... and then go to HR/admin/parents directly after they admit it.",
