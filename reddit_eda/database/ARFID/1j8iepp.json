  "title": "Feeling ashamed of how much money my food is",
  "selftext": "What the title says. Unfortunately, I have expensive tastes and often times the only thing I feel like I can eat is like, the most expensive option of all of my safe foods. I don\u2019t make a lot of money and I get stuck in a shame cycle. Tonight I\u2019ve just been sitting & staring at nothing trying to convince myself that it\u2019s not self-sabotage to spend $40+ on one delivery meal if it\u2019s the only thing I\u2019ll eat. I am trying so hard to save money but I always fail because there are so many nights that I won\u2019t eat if I can\u2019t have a really specific dish. I\u2019ve put a lot of effort into planning my meals and finding cheaper alternatives to some things but it always boils down to nights like this. If I don\u2019t order the food I feel ashamed for not taking care of myself but if I do order the food I feel ashamed for throwing my money away & not being able to eat like a \u201cnormal\u201d person. \nNot sure what I\u2019m looking for with this post exactly, but I figured if anyone could relate to what I\u2019m feeling it\u2019s y\u2019all. I don\u2019t actually have diagnosed arfid, but I have many of the characteristics and have found a lot of support in this group. Thanks everyone\n\nEdit: thanks for the support everyone, I love you all \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udc96 it\u2019s such a relief to have a space where I can talk to other people who have been there. ",
