  "selftext": "I ordered the Picky Eater's recovery book - Overcoming Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder. and it just arrived today!\n\nFirst off, I wanted to tell you that they definitely aren't trivializing ARFID in what I've read so far (for those concerned about the title). Like I saw another reddit user suggest, it seems that they have picky in the title simply because it will be a keyword that will help more people find the book. For those who may not have gone in knowing about ARFID.\n\nI'm a bit more than a quarter of a way through the book (so still plenty more to go). However, even just having read this much it definitely seems like it was the right thing to do. If anyone is wondering if they should buy the book I would definitely encourage it (especially if you are unable to go to therapy, like me).\n\nWish me luck y'all. I'm really hopeful that this book is going to make a big difference in helping me overcome my ARFID. <3",

I don't think I've ever come across another resource where I felt that the disorder was so thoroughly tackled and understood. I think I'll always recommend the book, but also if your child is young I think it will be helpful to look at resources that specifically targeted for children as well. Though I wouldn't be surprised if you have already done/are doing this. It is hard for me to speak on the comorbidity. I think certain principles would perhaps be helpful for both such as getting blood work done, food logs and and working to implement regular meals and snacks, at regular times. Also, though, if it really is anorexia/body image related as well, I don't know if something like a food log could be triggering? Although I think that could be something you help them with keeping track of, maybe? Ultimately I think it's something worth trying out. It can be so difficult to get actual help for this disorder, especially at a more accessable price. This I think can be somewhat helpful in helping someone help themselves. Or in helping someone help someone they care about. I don't think it will be something you regret. At the very least then it's there for your child in the future, when/if they they want to access this information.",
