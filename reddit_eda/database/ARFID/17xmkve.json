I often say that ARFID is the absolute worst part about being autistic for me personally. It makes me wonder if you\u2019re SURE you aren\u2019t autistic, do you have any other traits that may be considered a \u201cbroader autism phenotype\u201d? BAP is when you have some traits of autism but not full on autism (to be considered autistic you have to have a full profile of autistic traits, not just a few isolated traits like ARFID). I\u2019d be curious to see how many menu items you have with the autism factory list haha. Common traits are fidgeting, nerdy obsessions over particular topics, and I\u2019m curious specifically if you have any other sensory sensitivities. \n\nFor me, although socially you\u2019d hardly notice I\u2019m autistic, all my senses are a little more sensitive, meaning I want lights to be dim, sound especially is always too loud for me, I need to wear loose clothing and cut tags off clothes, and I hate the intense smell of cleaning chemicals. I assumed ARFID was just taste sensitivity dialed up too high or somehow gone wrong. I would figure if you have ARFID (even if you\u2019re not autistic) you\u2019d be more likely to have other sensory sensitivities. \n\nThanks again! \ud83d\ude4f",

      "body": "Cool, thanks!!!! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4c\n\nInteresting, I have a phobia of animals. Most most autistic people LOVE animals but it\u2019s known that some autistic people are born with phobias for animals. It isn\u2019t a strong phobia and it\u2019s gotten better, but it\u2019s clear that since I was very young I\u2019ve viewed animals as predators to be feared, even when it\u2019s clearly irrational because the animal is small. \n\nYour documentary now has me obsessing over this topic haha and I stumbled upon [this Ted talk](https://youtu.be/CfhkefF6yk4?si=KzkPl8kxrYSU9ATL) of a psychologist specialized in ARFID who emphasizes the phobia aspect of ARFID. He claims that a majority of the issues with food intake are due to essentially phobia of food, the idea that we\u2019d irrationally categorize foods into unsafe categories. He says some percentage has to do with sensory processing disorder (which is very common in autism) which is presumably not treatable/curable, but to the extent ARFID has to do with phobia it can be made better. \n\nPersonally, my ARFID got decently better in my 20\u2019s. I\u2019m a very non anxious person and have been meditating everyday for years. I wonder if phobia therapy and anxiety reduction is the key to improving coping with ARFID.",
