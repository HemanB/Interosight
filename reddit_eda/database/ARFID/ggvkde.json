  "selftext": "I used the trigger warning flair in case anyone is triggered by people being ignorant about ARFID, sorry if this causes anyone distress. \n\nI was just told that ARFID is bullshit and I don\u2019t have an eating disorder just because I \u201crefuse to eat healthy food like a stubborn little child\u201d \n\nOuch, way to make me feel invalidated. \n\nI\u2019ve dealt with so many ignorant people that act like they know everything about my mental illnesses when they\u2019ve never even experienced them themselves. I\u2019m not overweight or underweight and I\u2019ve been told so many times that my eating disorder isn\u2019t real and to grow the fuck up because they can\u2019t physically see how it affects me. I should be used to it by now and should have learned to not care what other people think but I\u2019m such a sensitive person that it really hurts every time.",

People are judgmental of literally the dumbest things, and no matter what they can\u2019t be educated because they\u2019re stuck in their old school way of thinking. \n\nIt always baffles me how people deduce *so* many things about a person if they find out they\u2019re a picky eater\u2014When really your eating habits 9/10 times doesn\u2019t negatively effect them in the slightest. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you had to deal with someone like that, and the sheer fact that they feel so strongly about what isn\u2019t their business indicates nosiness and someone who doesn\u2019t respect boundaries...
