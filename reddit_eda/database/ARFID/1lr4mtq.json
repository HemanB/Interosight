Not exactly working on but I occasionally eat a few bites of asparagus if it\u2019s grilled or prepared in a balsamic vinegar glaze but then the stringiness of it starts to gross me out so I never get beyond 3 bites.\n\nI love the flavor of mushrooms but not texture so I cook with them in sauces and dishes where I can do in large pieces easy to pick out & give to eating companions. I\u2019m not currently working on this beyond what might be considered exposure therapy as I cook with them so I buy and saut\u00e9 them. Sometimes I wash and cut them but other times that\u2019s too much and the people I\u2019m cooking for wash and cut to my instructions although that doesn\u2019t always work and I have to take over the cutting as they are making either too small or too big. I keep forgetting I can get the flavor by soaking dried mushrooms in water to use in cooking and those mushrooms are already cut up. SMH",

          "body": "I\u2019m sorry you are at this stage at 60. I\u2019m seeing more people believe in ARFID but it\u2019s slow going. I\u2019m a couple years younger than you, 58, but I\u2019ve had more support, understanding , and help so my safe food list is larger. I have a couple book suggestions which might help. \n\nTry not to judge the books by their titles/covers. They are aiming for a wide audience, one that may not have heard of ARFID, and some of them are for adults and kids so the covers have kids. The books on my TBR are for parents of kids with ARFID but I\u2019m hoping they might be helpful to me.\n\nI\u2019ve started Reading and am finding these 2 helpful \n* The Picky Eater\u2019s Recovery Book: Overcoming Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder by Jennifer J. Thomas, Kendra R. Becker, Kamryn T. Eddy (only book I know for adults with ARFID)\n* Color Taste Texture: Recipes for Picky Eaters, Those with Food Aversion, and Anyone Who\u2019s Ever Cringed at Food by Matthew Broberg-Moffitt (written by someone on this sub who talked with a number of adults with ARFID while writing this book)\n\n\nOn my TBR\n* Food Chaining: The Proven 6-Step Plan to Stop Picky Eating, Solve Feeding Problems, and Expand Your Child's Diet\n* Try New Food: How to Help Picky Eaters Taste, Eat & Like New Foods by Jill Castle\n* Helping Your Child with Extreme Picky Eating: A Step-by-Step Guide for Overcoming Selective Eating, Food Aversion, and Feeding by Katja Rowell",

I\u2019m hoping you\u2019re advice on five tries helps as I really want to add more veggies as it\u2019s the main area I\u2019m weak in. I know throughout my 50+ years it\u2019s impacted my health. I\u2019m hopeful it\u2019ll work best for foods I once could eat or drink but now can\u2019t like V8 juice I crave but every time I buy I just can\u2019t get myself to drink it.",
