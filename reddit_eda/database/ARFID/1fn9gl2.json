  "selftext": "I had to bring this up with my boyfriend today after he put me on the spot in front of his friend when we were trying to decide what to eat today. \n\nHe said I should be the one to decide what to eat because of my ARFID. \n\nIdk about you guys but I AM TIRED. It puts so much emotional weight on me to decide where we go to eat EVERY DAMN TIME. And when other people are around I don\u2019t know if they just think I\u2019m being a \u201cpicky eater.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s embarrassing. And it usually makes my ARFID worse to think about an overwhelming amount of places to look through to find food that is safe for me. \n\nI explained to him all of this, but he said that he doesn\u2019t really agree with me that he should be helping me look for places. \n\nI just like having someone help me narrow it down. \n\n*sigh*\n\n",

Eating out, or cooking at home, he wants me to enjoy the food everytime, and I just can't, and the pressure makes everything worse.\n\nI think I finally convinced him once when I made something that has always been a safe food, took one bite, gagged and spit it out. He was like, wtf? I shrugged and said today I dont like this. In a couple weeks it'll go back to being something I always eat, but today my mouth decoded this is no good.\n\nI think he finally realized it really isn't something I have any control over. I went through the effort to make it for myself, and then couldn't eat it even though I had expected that I would. I don't decide what I can tolerate or when, or for how long. He still is a little sad if I don't eat, but that's because to him being hungry is one of the worst feelings, and he doesn't wa t me to feel that way.",
