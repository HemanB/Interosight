      "body": "I have severe GERD, hiatal hernia, eosinophilic esophagitis, and history of strictures (scar tissue). My esophagus has been dilated 7 times since the age of 15. In addition to a jacked up stomach, I have OCD and from what I\u2019ve been reading, unofficially diagnosed ARFID. I\u2019ve been a picky eater since birth and it never got better, actually it got worse. Growing up I can remember horrible experiences with liquid medications. So pills were perfect! The only downside I had was swallowing large pills and them getting stuck. If I had the option of liquid, pill, or iv... I\u2019d pick iv. No taste, smell, or texture to deal with and I\u2019m not afraid of needles. It\u2019d be pretty bad if I had this fear since I work in healthcare.",

It either had pieces in it because it didn't desolve properly and wasn't shaked enough, or it was all foamy from being shaked too long. I guess that's when I got some control over my gag reflex. But pills? I can swallow several pills in one go, no problem.",
