Advocating for \"throwing people in the loony bin\" just because they are different, in a way that cause no damage, is quite dodgy. \n\nLaw \u2260 morality. Many ethical things are illegal and many unethical things are legal. \n\nCannibalism doesn't cause health issues if you do your research first (i.e. not eating the brain and ovaries). \n\nIt's not morally wrong if it's done consentually. Why assume all cannibalism is unethical? \n\nThe treatment of cannibalism in western society is mainly due to a natural biological repulsion to it. People should question that.",
