Some days I don\u2019t panic when it happens I just eat the food. I\u2019m funny about what can be mixed and what can\u2019t. It\u2019s great being around people who get our rules that look weird to people without ARFID because they aren\u2019t consistent under all circumstances for every single food. New foods can change everything sometimes. It\u2019s like woah wouldn\u2019t that be good with x & all of a sudden\u2026 yeah and that\u2019s how my salad went from iceberg lettuce to just about anything I\u2019m served as long as it\u2019s no dressing as I\u2019m still just one kind of dressing. \ud83d\ude02",
