  "selftext": "I\u2019m a 30 year old woman and I\u2019ve had ARFID almost my entire life due to a trauma that happened when I was a toddler (that I don\u2019t even remember).\n\nI know that there are tons of children who struggle with this disorder and I know firsthand how awful it is to be a kid who can\u2019t eat the same as other kids. I also understand it\u2019s probably difficult for the parents to deal with. \n\nIt just frustrates me that ARFID is considered a kids disorder by some, and that parents who have never experienced ARFID personally are coming onto the sub to ask how to deal with their kids who might have it. \n\nPersonally it\u2019s a massive pet peeve of mine to be considered childish, immature, or younger than I really am. I want to be treated my age, and a lot of the talk around ARFID feels so infantilizing. \u201cEating our chicken nuggies!\u201d Like we\u2019re toddlers. Yeah chicken nuggets are one of the few things I can eat, but I hate that we have to act like little kids about it. I just wish we could be treated with respect as adults and that this wasn\u2019t framed as a little kid disorder. \n\nI almost wish we had an AdultARFID sub of some kind, so that parents with ARFID kids can have a separate place to discuss their issues. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m in the minority with this one, I guess I\u2019m just hoping to find someone who sees where I\u2019m coming from.\n\nEDIT: y\u2019all are really putting words in my mouth. I never said that parents shouldn\u2019t be allowed on this sub. I even said I wish we just had our own sub for adults with ARFID. I am not gatekeeping or excluding anyone from the sub. I was expressing my personal frustration with being compared to children, and that it feels bad for this to be considered a child\u2019s disorder. Nowhere did I say that parents should be excluded from the sub, or that they shouldn\u2019t be aware of their kids disorder. In fact, I believe the opposite. I just wanted to share my feelings and now everyone thinks I\u2019m some bitch who\u2019s gatekeeping a disorder. ",

I'm a 34 year old women and struggled with ARFID all my life too and I also get what you said about people thinking we're immature.\nJust a few days ago I read an AITA post about a woman secretly putting vegetables in her boyfriends food. When he found out he was mad and said he couldn't trust her anymore (something I can totally relate to). Idk if her boyfriend had ARFID but it sounded like he might and almost all the comments were like \"such a man child\" and \"why are you with a child?\" and it boiled my piss. Like .. did you ever eben consider the possibility of him having an eating disorder? Ugh... \n\nBut on the other hand I'm glad parents are coming here and asking for advice. Back when I was a kid no one knew what's wrong with me. ARFID wasn't even really a thing back then, or actually just no one knew what it was, and no one knew what to do with me and that just made everything harder. \nMaybe if it would have been known back then and there would have been group's like that I would struggle with it less today. \nI'm glad that has changed and now there are parents who try to help their children with it. \nMaybe it will make it easier for them in the future and they won't have to be like us now, struggling with it all our life's",

A lot of times kids don\u2019t have the tools to express themselves. While we obviously can\u2019t speak for any other person with our disorder, we can lean on each other and help one another understand our disorder at all stages of life! \n\nIf you ever want to just talk to another 30 year old women with ARFID, my messages are open!",

It\u2019s not a well-known disorder and has only recently been updated to include adults in the diagnosis. We have no right to gatekeep this illness. We are here to support each other but also people who are afraid of what\u2019s happening with their child. It\u2019s not fair to exclude anyone just because you feel as though parents coming here for questions and support are somehow making you feel infantilized. We as adults with ARFID know that it\u2019s more common in children than adults, so we are technically the minority here. And as adults we are (or should be) mature enough to comprehend that these people need support. That said, you are more than welcome to create a new subreddit solely for adults with ARFID to weed out anyone who is under a certain age. \n\nPersonally, hearing stories from parents about their children gives me so much hope for these kids because when I was little there was no internet, the doctors told my parents to just give me vitamins and let me eat whatever I wouldn\u2019t refuse to eat, and that was the end of it. I absolutely love seeing how much time and effort these parents are putting into their kids\u2019 physical and mental health and providing guidance for them as an adult who has struggled with this disorder my whole life.",
