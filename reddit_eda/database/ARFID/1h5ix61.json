I am with my fianc\u00e9 who is a man and because I love him so much I do give him oral. I don\u2019t force myself, and he doesn\u2019t pressure me to at ALL, but I do want him to be satisfied as it makes me happy to know he is.  However, I never had the chance to actually have seggs with a girl and I\u2019m not sure I would\u2019ve been able to (in the way I would want to please them) as an owner of a vagina\u2026I know what goes on in there\ud83d\ude05 and i genuinely don\u2019t know if I could do it, I\u2019d be concerned with the taste, the moth feel\u2026al of it.

I\u2019m not the only one, and neither are you. So many people have issues with oral for alllll kinds of reasons, and like others have said, there are other creative ways to please your partner, don\u2019t ever force yourself to do it. I\u2019m also on the spectrum, and a lot of us have these hold ups as well. It\u2019s wild how literally everything ties into this eating disorder, just know you aren\u2019t alone\ud83e\udef6",

Like the other comments are saying, you absolutely don't have to do anything in the bedroom that you don't want to. If it doesn't bring you pleasure, don't worry about it. Sex is whatever you want it to be.\n\nIf you still want to give oral without triggering your ARFID, maybe try flavored lube or condoms? If it's more about texture, there are textured condoms (ribbed, studded, etc) that might help. Also, always ask your partner to wash his dick thoroughly beforehand, maybe with a soap you like the smell of. Even if he's generally a clean guy, we all get stinky down there, especially at the end of the day.\n\nThis is a crazy idea, but if you like grapefruit (or a fruit with a similar texture), the \"grapefruit trick\" might help you kinda ease into it maybe?",

It's just my body subconsciously protecting me from it and I just know I can't eat that/my mouth is too full/this texture is gonna make me gag/this taste means something is wrong.

I am with my fianc\u00e9 who is a man and because I love him so much I do give him oral. I don\u2019t force myself, and he doesn\u2019t pressure me to at ALL, but I do want him to be satisfied as it makes me happy to know he is.  However, I never had the chance to actually have seggs with a girl and I\u2019m not sure I would\u2019ve been able to (in the way I would want to please them) as an owner of a vagina\u2026I know what goes on in there\ud83d\ude05 and i genuinely don\u2019t know if I could do it, I\u2019d be concerned with the taste, the moth feel\u2026al of it. It makes me feel so badddd\ud83d\ude29 fortunately I probably won\u2019t ever end up having sex with a girl since I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m with my forever person, but it doesn\u2019t make it suck any less. \n\nThe amount of people that commented on my post about this though was SO validating though. I\u2019m not the only one, and neither are you. So many people have issues with oral for alllll kinds of reasons, and like others have said, there are other creative ways to please your partner, don\u2019t ever force yourself to do it. I\u2019m also on the spectrum, and a lot of us have these hold ups as well. It\u2019s wild how literally everything ties into this eating disorder, just know you aren\u2019t alone\ud83e\udef6",

I\u2019m the same way though, I don\u2019t won\u2019t go to funky town if I haven\u2019t showered in the last hour or so.

That\u2019s my favorite place to do it, the water and stuff really helps ;)",
