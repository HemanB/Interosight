Today I had a very pleasant morning at work until I walked in our kitchen space and smelled leftover seafood and I gagged on site immediately. I felt so dramatic but it was involuntary bc I get so repulsed and sick feeling :( It\u2019s so pungent and almost burns and hurts to inhale, didn\u2019t even try inhaling to hold my breath I just ran out of the kitchen quickly to gulp some fresh non-seafood-filled-air but the smell legit stuck to my nose hairs and I considered going outside in the cold but I just grabbed my shirt collar and put it over my nose and went back in to the war-zone. Why does it smell so bad. How do people enjoy seafood and not get absolutely nauseous over its aroma. Sigh.",
