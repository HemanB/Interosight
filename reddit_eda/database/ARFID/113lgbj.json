I don\u2019t have any nutrition specialists in my area that take my insurance, and it seems impossible as of now. But I feel increasingly alienated by vegans online. I saw many of them today mocking OCD as well, which is something I also struggle with.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips for dealing with these kind of people? Tips for reducing harm of animals with this disorder?\n\nAnd maybe does anyone have some support?

I eventually went fully vegan by making myself try loads of different alternative cheeses (most of which were horrid) until I found one that I actually liked. Since bread is a safe food I also tried varying the types of bread I have, like sourdough, focaccia, seeded, etc., so you could try finding variants of a safe food. I think there's very few excuses for eating animal products but ARFID is one of them, because I know exactly what it's like to have it. If a large amount of the foods you can eat have animal products in and you can't eat the alternatives made without it, then you shouldn't feel bad for buying them, because otherwise you might starve. Yes, animal products cause suffering and death, but being vegan is about existing whilst causing the least harm possible, not just cutting out animal products. Therefore I'd consider someone who wants to give up animal products but can't because of ARFID pretty much vegan anyway. It's good that you want to, and if you find any alternatives that's great, but not at the expense of your own wellbeing.",

I barely ate animal produce growing up due to a combo of ARFID symptoms (not being able to tolerate the texture) and also being low-key traumatised by the fact that cute little animals have to be brutally murdered in order for meat to exist. Chronic illness started to hit me at 16 and by the time I was 18, I properly started to reintroduce animal produce into my diet. It is one of the few things that has made a significant difference to my physical pain and energy levels. And personally, I think that any vegan who's gonna berate me for being an animal who needs to consume another animal to survive and live a happy, healthy life is incredibly ableist and quite frankly, a raging cunt. I have loads of vegan and veggie friends and none of them have an issue with my animal produce consumption because they're genuinely lovely people and more than anything, they wanna see me get better.\n\nHere's how I justify consuming meat to myself: animals all across the animal kingdom, eat other animals. It's sad and brutal but it's a necessary evil for so many beautiful creatures to survive. We don't look down on our beloved pet cats and dogs for eating meat. Humans can obviously tolerate a much wider variety of foods but imo, eating animal produce is vital for the well-being of most people - especially the sick and disabled. I love to cook and whenever I buy meat from the supermarket and bring it home, I try and honour the animal that died so I could be strong and healthy.  I do my best to make the most beautiful and delicious thing possible out of that animal and I do everything I can to avoid throwing out meat. I know if I was an animal and I needed to die for a greater societal good, I would want to be treated that way. I think that if you're a leftist and you care about the well-being of the sick and disabled, you have to accept the uncomfortable truth that most of these people have to eat animals to be functional. Throughout history, we've had to endure many extremely brutal systems before they develop into something a little more humane (e.g. feudalism before capitalism) and I see widespread animal consumption in the same way. Hopefully, as genuine ethical concerns about the well-being of animals raise along with a heightened awareness of nutrition (i.e. most of us unfortunately need to eat animals to be at our healthiest), the push for lab grown meat will grow and we'll be able to leave killing animals for food in the past.\n\nSorry for going on such a huge rant, this is just something that has been a giant part of my life and I've thought about it very thoroughly. I'm also really passionate about helping other spoonies and figuring out how to live our best lives whilst we wait for medical technology to catch up with our needs \u2764\ufe0f",

There are sources of animal products other than factory farms, and ways you can make sure the animals you\u2019re benefiting from have had the best life possible. \n\nSmall local businesses are often the best source, if you have access to them. The closer you can get to the people who actually raise and care for the animals they\u2019re profiting off of, the better. I was fortunate enough to grow up in an area where I could actually see the animals myself - chickens, cows, sheep, pigs - and I find there\u2019s a certain peace of mind that comes from knowing exactly where my meals were coming from. When I ate eggs or milk, I knew that their sources were spending their days in comfort, and when I ate meat, I knew with certainty that the creature it came from was treated with dignity and respect right up to their final moments. \n\nIf that isn\u2019t an option for you, then you have to research, research, research. What are the ingredients listed on the packet? Do they claim to be cruelty-free? Who certified them? What company produced the food, and how do they treat their livestock? Have there been any accusations of animal cruelty against them? Have there been any accusations of cruelty to *human* against them? If so, what was the outcome of those accusations?\n\nHonestly, my main issue with eating vegan is that many people seem to think it\u2019s the one-stop-shop for preventing harm to animals.

You can do so many other things that aren't related to food, while at the same time nourishing yourself in order to maintain your health - so you can continue to advocate for animals! \n\nJust remind yourself that this isn't forever, this is what you need to do right now for yourself.

I barely ate animal produce growing up due to a combo of ARFID symptoms (not being able to tolerate the texture) and also being low-key traumatised by the fact that cute little animals have to be brutally murdered in order for meat to exist. Chronic illness started to hit me at 16 and by the time I was 18, I properly started to reintroduce animal produce into my diet. It is one of the few things that has made a significant difference to my physical pain and energy levels. And personally, I think that any vegan who's gonna berate me for being an animal who needs to consume another animal to survive and live a happy, healthy life is incredibly ableist and quite frankly, a raging cunt. I have loads of vegan and veggie friends and none of them have an issue with my animal produce consumption because they're genuinely lovely people and more than anything, they wanna see me get better.\n\nHere's how I justify consuming meat to myself: animals all across the animal kingdom, eat other animals. It's sad and brutal but it's a necessary evil for so many beautiful creatures to survive. We don't look down on our beloved pet cats and dogs for eating meat. Humans can obviously tolerate a much wider variety of foods but imo, eating animal produce is vital for the well-being of most people - especially the sick and disabled. I love to cook and whenever I buy meat from the supermarket and bring it home, I try and honour the animal that died so I could be strong and healthy.  I do my best to make the most beautiful and delicious thing possible out of that animal and I do everything I can to avoid throwing out meat. I know if I was an animal and I needed to die for a greater societal good, I would want to be treated that way. I think that if you're a leftist and you care about the well-being of the sick and disabled, you have to accept the uncomfortable truth that most of these people have to eat animals to be functional. Throughout history, we've had to endure many extremely brutal systems before they develop into something a little more humane (e.g. feudalism before capitalism) and I see widespread animal consumption in the same way. Hopefully, as genuine ethical concerns about the well-being of animals raise along with a heightened awareness of nutrition (i.e. most of us unfortunately need to eat animals to be at our healthiest), the push for lab grown meat will grow and we'll be able to leave killing animals for food in the past.\n\nSorry for going on such a huge rant, this is just something that has been a giant part of my life and I've thought about it very thoroughly. I'm also really passionate about helping other spoonies and figuring out how to live our best lives whilst we wait for medical technology to catch up with our needs \u2764\ufe0f",

Since bread is a safe food I also tried varying the types of bread I have, like sourdough, focaccia, seeded, etc., so you could try finding variants of a safe food. I think there's very few excuses for eating animal products but ARFID is one of them, because I know exactly what it's like to have it. If a large amount of the foods you can eat have animal products in and you can't eat the alternatives made without it, then you shouldn't feel bad for buying them, because otherwise you might starve. Yes, animal products cause suffering and death, but being vegan is about existing whilst causing the least harm possible, not just cutting out animal products. Therefore I'd consider someone who wants to give up animal products but can't because of ARFID pretty much vegan anyway.

      "body": "\nThank you, all of those examples are really insightful and your position makes a lot of sense to me now.\n\nYou're right that the debate gets a lot more complicated when you dive into details about what it really means to suffer. We could be here all day debating what state of things is more ethical for the animals. A lot of the time what's more ethical is a matter of perspective; for example, cows may be happier when they are pregnant, but some would argue that it's wrong to forcibly impregnate them or to take away their calves before they are weaned (which isn't required but is standard in the larger productions from which most people get their dairy - part of why the discussions can be so long!).\n\nSimply asking if it's more ethical to farm cattle or not is basically asking if it's better for a being to be brought into the world or not, which in itself is not an easy question to answer. You first have to answer a multitude of questions: Do they live good lives? Are they being slaughtered before the end of their natural lifespan, or do they live full lives? Is it unethical to slaughter them young? etc.\n\nWhile I'm sure in some cases you can reasonably come to the conclusion that bringing cattle into the world is the better choice, or at least a neutral choice, I'm personally of the opinion that in general, bringing less of them into the world is better, since higher demand means more intensive (factory) farming, letting cattle live full lives usually isn't financially feasible (and I believe that if they are brought into the world they should be given the chance to live full lives, up until they reach an age when living is more suffering than dying), and since cattle and their feed use a lot of land, water, and other resources, and have a greater carbon impact than plant-based protein sources. This would be my answer for sheep as well - not to let the living ones languish but to simply bring less into the world. But I'm also under the impression that sheep tend to live better, longer lives, so I'm far from willing to die on that hill.\n\nEuthanasia kind of relates to the question of what a full life is and if letting an animal live one is necessary for treating it ethically. It also relates to the question of is a natural death better than an artificial death. But as you said about pregnancy, I think these are bigger questions than this thread is really for.\n\nI think your example with honey and bees demonstrates your point well. Bees make an excess amount of honey and having more bees in the world is a good thing. But just to make things more complicated (I know), I have heard people say that beekeeping isn't always the best thing for an ecosystem due to complicating factors like the displacement of local bee populations and the spread of disease and parasites. I don't know nearly enough about that to really speak on what actions are more or less ethical.\n\nAnyway, I think we are in agreement that animals deserve the best treatment we can feasibly give them, and that eating them is sometimes the lesser of two evils.\n\nSorry for making this so long, but I'm glad we had this discussion. Two people can have the same goals (like animal welfare) but come to different conclusions about how to achieve them because they each have perspectives the other hasn't heard or didn't think of. I think discussing nuances helps with understanding, and I feel like this discussion helped with mine, so thank you for having it with me :)\n\nEdit: clarity",

Of course, that\u2019s not always the case and that\u2019s why it\u2019s best to try and find specific dairy farms that you can get behind their ideals and management and support them.",

I was thinking more long term, as in a cow will suffer less if they are not impregnated to produce milk in the first place. Does that make sense? Or is that not quite what you mean, in which case do you maybe have a different* example?\n\nEdit: I said \"better\" example initially but it doesn't necessarily have to be better, just enough to clarify what you mean",

          "body": "I'm not going to go too much into the differing opinions on if getting a cow pregnant is suffering or not, because that requires a much heavier discussion than this thread is meant for. But generally, it's not considered bad or any degree of suffering, especially amongst those who actively take care of cows and see the way that cows treat their calves (spoiler: not well. cows aren't good parents. it's actually kind of funny to see them just casually walk over their calves as if they didn't just spend all that time giving birth), and the fact that cows are generally happier when pregnant than when they aren't. Bulls are also very aggressive when sexually active, and have to be kept separate from cows cause they will not stop going after cows, even if they are already pregnant. \n\ncows are weird and funny creatures. I love them so much lol\n\nBut for different examples of animal products that can actually help the animals: Bees and honey, Sheep and wool, Angora Rabbits and Yarn.\n\nIn these cases, it's actually worse for the animal if their products are not taken. Bees will run out of room to make honey if it's not continuously taken, and the queen will stop laying eggs. It actively causes them to suffer more than if you take their honey. If a sheep is not sheared, or an Angora rabbit is not combed/sheared, they can actually die of heatstroke, or get so overgrown they can't lift their own bodies, or they can't see or eat. Their fur/wool needs to be removed, for their own benefit. \n\nSide note, but in the same vein of ideas: There's also an argument that's often made about how euthanizing an animal before it dies is more humane, and how animal slaughter is more humane than leaving an animal to die through natural causes where its body breaks down and they suffer that way. and that we do that when our pets get sick enough, plus human euthanasia is legal and so like \"why do we get to do it when animals don't\"--so on, and so forth. I'm not sure where I stand on that but figured it was worth it to mention since this thread is about easing guilt about animal suffering when it comes to animal products. So, if thinking about it that way, helps someone feel better about eating to survive, then run with it.\n\nTL;DR: This is a huge complicated debate, and there are arguments to go either way. But if you are suffering from an eating disorder, and the things you need to survive are animal products, then survive. Self-preservation isn't a bad thing, and shouldn't be treated as such. If it comes down to death / severe illness or animal product, don't feel guilty for choosing the animal product.",

          "body": "\nThank you, all of those examples are really insightful and your position makes a lot of sense to me now.\n\nYou're right that the debate gets a lot more complicated when you dive into details about what it really means to suffer. We could be here all day debating what state of things is more ethical for the animals. A lot of the time what's more ethical is a matter of perspective; for example, cows may be happier when they are pregnant, but some would argue that it's wrong to forcibly impregnate them or to take away their calves before they are weaned (which isn't required but is standard in the larger productions from which most people get their dairy - part of why the discussions can be so long!).\n\nSimply asking if it's more ethical to farm cattle or not is basically asking if it's better for a being to be brought into the world or not, which in itself is not an easy question to answer. You first have to answer a multitude of questions: Do they live good lives? Are they being slaughtered before the end of their natural lifespan, or do they live full lives? Is it unethical to slaughter them young? etc.\n\nWhile I'm sure in some cases you can reasonably come to the conclusion that bringing cattle into the world is the better choice, or at least a neutral choice, I'm personally of the opinion that in general, bringing less of them into the world is better, since higher demand means more intensive (factory) farming, letting cattle live full lives usually isn't financially feasible (and I believe that if they are brought into the world they should be given the chance to live full lives, up until they reach an age when living is more suffering than dying), and since cattle and their feed use a lot of land, water, and other resources, and have a greater carbon impact than plant-based protein sources. This would be my answer for sheep as well - not to let the living ones languish but to simply bring less into the world. But I'm also under the impression that sheep tend to live better, longer lives, so I'm far from willing to die on that hill.\n\nEuthanasia kind of relates to the question of what a full life is and if letting an animal live one is necessary for treating it ethically. It also relates to the question of is a natural death better than an artificial death. But as you said about pregnancy, I think these are bigger questions than this thread is really for.\n\nI think your example with honey and bees demonstrates your point well. Bees make an excess amount of honey and having more bees in the world is a good thing. But just to make things more complicated (I know), I have heard people say that beekeeping isn't always the best thing for an ecosystem due to complicating factors like the displacement of local bee populations and the spread of disease and parasites. I don't know nearly enough about that to really speak on what actions are more or less ethical.\n\nAnyway, I think we are in agreement that animals deserve the best treatment we can feasibly give them, and that eating them is sometimes the lesser of two evils.\n\nSorry for making this so long, but I'm glad we had this discussion. Two people can have the same goals (like animal welfare) but come to different conclusions about how to achieve them because they each have perspectives the other hasn't heard or didn't think of. I think discussing nuances helps with understanding, and I feel like this discussion helped with mine, so thank you for having it with me :)\n\nEdit: clarity",
