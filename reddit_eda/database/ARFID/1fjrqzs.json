  "selftext": "I have been picked on for having ARFID more than anything else. Even my parents, who are aware of my situation, would get frustrated and yell at me for ordering plain meals at restaurants, making myself something to eat that they didn\u2019t think was appetizing, and just for my general food choices. My ex boyfriend used to give me the silent treatment when I didn\u2019t want to eat something, and told me that he hated my ARFID so much because he loved food and he didn\u2019t understand why I didn\u2019t. It turned into him actually considering breaking up with me over it- not because it ever caused him any inconvenience- just because it personally offended him. I was talking to a friend yesterday about foods I wished I could like and she gave me some advice, but ended it with \u201cif you ever get the courage to try that, as pathetic as it sounds.\u201d ?? \ud83d\ude2d. I have never seen people get so upset in my life, ever. Like they take my pickiness SO PERSONALLY, even in situations where it doesn\u2019t effect them in the slightest. Has anybody else experienced this, or am I just particularly unlucky?",

They see it as something you can ultimately choose to deal with if you just 'push a little bit more' without realizing the insane effort it can take. Typically when I focus on expanding my food list it's like a month or two time period of me learning and practicing with cooking (actually making it can it feel safer we found) and giving myself a ton of exposure therapy\u2014typically during this I dont have the mental energy or capacity to improve or work on anything else.\n\nIt's kinda like the way mental health is looked at as a whole, a lot of people look at disabilities and disorders and go only by what they see. (Like when a karen gets mad at someone in disabled parking because they don't have a wheelchair without taking into consideration that the person could have a disablity that's just not visible.)\nTypically when someone sees ARFID, it genuinely just looks like picky eating.\n\nHowever, on a good note, it doesn't mean that no one will understand. My gf and bestfriend understand as we've talked to them about what it actually feels like, we've vented about not being able to eat, and celebrated the fact i finally enjoyed strawberries after months of trying to adjust to them\u2014she saw me go from gagging and spitting it out to enjoying it over the course of months, so it's safe to say she gets that this is a genuine disorder.",

It was ridiculously difficult growing up with a parent who would not eat many many things and would only eat them prepared in one way. It felt very juvenile and we all ended up having to cow tow to her \u201c issues\u201d just to keep the peace at home.  It was a never ending battle with her and as such it was super annoying to everyone else because we ALL had to deal with whatever her weird arfid issues were on never ending basis. People just grow tired of the situation where one person can not or will not eat what everyone else just typically eats naturally. It affected our everyday life. We all became very unempathic over time . Between that and the OCD nuttiness it was like we all wanted to just fucking escape and live normal lives with people who are normally and do not have all these rituals and eccentric behaviors and beliefs .",

Some people truly don\u2019t comprehend that eating disorders can be more varied and complex than the \u201cskinny teenage girl with anorexia/bulimia\u201d stereotype, and I\u2019m too tired to fight them about it \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab",

Usually Mono-textured and simple flavors. Whenever I do try to eat more complex foods with lots of textures and tastes, I literally can\u2019t discern the individual flavors, and I just end up tasting a taste that I can only describe as \u201coverwhelmed\u201d. This also makes it so a lot of foods taste the same to me! Like I can\u2019t really taste the difference between say a burger and a salad- they both just have that disgusting \u201cget it out of my mouth\u201d taste I mentioned before. It\u2019s very interesting to me as well and I would love to actually have answers to why my brain does this :P",
