  "title": "Never eaten a vegetable; just ate a Brussels sprout and didn\u2019t hate it!",
  "selftext": "I\u2019ve had a very limited set of safe foods for pretty much all of my life (white rice, pasta, potatoes, cheese, beef, chicken, pork... that\u2019s about it). I\u2019ve made some progress here and there. In my early 20s I ate fish for the first time and now I eat it regularly. This year I tried sushi which I did not enjoy and decided cold, raw fish was not for me (but I found a tempura-fried roll I like!). \n\nOne thing I\u2019ve always struggled with is vegetables. Literally never (consciously) eaten a vegetable in my life, except potatoes if those count. I get hung up on the idea that they\u2019ll taste bitter and have weird textures. For the past couple years though, I\u2019ve seen Brussels sprouts served several times where they look/smell really good and some part of me was curious to try them, but I could never work up the courage to try them since it was always in a social setting. \n\nToday at the grocery store, I decided I\u2019d actually try them. I bought a bag, figured  if I didn\u2019t like them then my boyfriend would eat them. I got home and took 1 (one) single sprout, cut it in half, drizzled the halves with olive oil, sprinkled them with salt, pepper, cayenne, and chili flakes and roasted them. Felt pretty goofy roasting a single sprout but I didn\u2019t want to waste. I took them out a few minutes early because I wanted to try them while I was alone and the bf would be home any minute. But I ate them and... I didn\u2019t hate them! Texture was definitely weird but I think I could see myself eating more if I continue masking them with other things. Definitely think this is a success. I told my mom and she was proud of me :)",

      "body": "LOL I\u2019m dying at roasting exactly one sprout !! I love it. Congratulations for trying something!! Brussels are so good! The smaller, the tastier (in my and my bfs opinion). We like them with bacon and Parmesan cheese! I\u2019ve also had them with - hear me out - pomegranate seeds. They go very well together but I\u2019m aware of my audience haha so I don\u2019t expect you to try it rn but maybe someday. \n\nThat being said, I ate a bad sprout like 6 months ago and haven\u2019t touched them since. I know I\u2019ll come back around because this is one of my creep cycles with food, but.. yeah. Maybe this post will inspire me to get back into them. \n\nROASTING OR CHAR GRILLING IS THE ONLY WAY TO PREPARE BRUSSELS HANDS DOWN",
