This even happens when the food tastes good to me; it\u2019s entirely texture-based, and my reaction is physical and extreme.

TW for speaking about vomiting  \n  \nI think it's funny they literally explained it perfectly themselves then somehow got turned around and forgot their own explanation.\n\nIt's literally just what they said. Kids who are \"picky eaters\" eventually snap out of it. If we could snap out of it, we 100% would. Not a single person who has ARFID has it on their own free will. If someone is genuinely just a \"picky eater\", they eventually get bored and move on JUST like this person said. So if it's still going on into adulthood, certainly there's a fucking issue, no?\n\nI feel like people have this idea that people with ARFID just sit around all day content with their diet and counting down the days until we get scurvy so we can throw a party or something. That's not how it works at all, and many of us actively work with doctors and therapists to fight these issues and try to adjust our diet in a way that ensures we get all of our dietary needs. Just because we're not comfortable going out of our comfort zone at any given moment on your whim doesn't mean we aren't going out of our comfort zone regularly on our own time. Not recognizing that is the equivalent of shoving somebody who can't swim into a pool and saying \"eh, they have to learn somehow\". Instead of helping them step out of that comfort zone, you violently shoved them out and broke their trust and then get mad when it somehow didn't work.\n\nPeople act like I haven't actively tried new foods and haven't actively gagged and vomited on the texture/taste, they act like it's some childish tantrum instead of a real physical response to a food the mind deems unacceptable. I've almost choked on my own vomit trying to force down new foods. And the whole time my brain is screaming \"It's good! It's fine!! It's good food stop being like this!!\" but I can't stop my body's response.\n\nI went years not knowing what the hell was wrong with me, breaking down and crying over my body's stupid inability to just eat certain foods that everybody knows are good and safe. It broke me before I even had the word to describe what was happening and how to fix it. (I had been TRYING to fix it for years, but nothing I did allowed me to \"snap out of it\")\n\nSurprise surprise, being diagnosed with ARFID and doing therapy specific to ARFID ACTUALLY HELPED ME OPEN UP MY PALETTE MORE THAN JUST \"TRYING TO GET OVER IT\" MYSELF. I swear, these people don't actually want anyone to heal. They just want to make people feel bad so they can make fun of them while they watch us fail. It's a cruel sick joke.

I never liked the idea of living my life in fear so I got myself a snake and forced repeated exposures on myself to get over my fear. \n\nI think ultimately it does come down to how much you would rather control your life vs how much you're willing to allow something to control you. \n\n\nAlso I just want to point out the irony in commentary of disgusting, slimy, sticky etc surely reinforces your beliefs about food and doesn't help anyone. Meanwhile many of you here with ARFID are happily calling other people's food disgusting while lamenting that you don't eat in front of others because you're scared people will do the exact same to you.",

I think it *may* be slightly more serious than just a case of being picky.\n\nI don't know if anyone reading this reads manga or watches anime, I don't do so that much but the first few chapters of Tokyo Ghoul the protagonist had to struggle with the fact that, due to him becoming a ghoul, all food had become disgusting except for raw meat, there was a scene when he just scrambled around his kitchen eating everything and puking everytime something entered his mouth, the fact that I related so much with that scene and later when he cried once he discovered he could also drink coffee taught me a bit about myself.",

      "body": "Exactly. There is also a hatred toward those of us who don\u2019t want therapy for it. I grew up in a family in which my family tied a lot of their self-worth to how much someone liked their food and also a family in which a lot of people didn\u2019t eat well as toddlers but developed a voracious appetite as school-aged children and ate everything in sight.\n\nThe fact that a lot of slimy foods and inconsistent textures are staples in my culture made eating a nightmare for me. I feared every meal and was forced to eat something that nearly made me gag at every meal. A few times, I vomited in my mouth and was forced to swallow it. There were times when my mother was in a good mood and she would let me have my safe foods, but other times, she was intent on making me eat what she wanted until I was sick. She would even sabotage my safe foods by covering it in something that she knew I didn\u2019t like or lie to me and tell me that she cooked a safe food (if it had a similar smell) and them suddenly push a plate of revolting food in front of me and say \u201csee, X is almost like Y (safe food)\u201d and immediately yell and threaten to spank me if I couldn\u2019t eat it.\n\nEven as an adult, I was subjected to her games with foods and she kept sabotaging any chance that I had to move out. She also took it personally and said \u201cyou act like I can\u2019t cook because you won\u2019t eat anything\u201d while still ignoring that she mostly cooked slimy foods or foods with inconsistent textures.\n\nAfter years, I was able to move out and found that I do like more foods that I thought, but she was constantly covering everything with sauces and making it unreasonably slimy. If she didn\u2019t have a sauce, she would put ketchup and water on something just to make it slimy. I still have to avoid quite a few foods, but there are enough that I can eat to remain healthy.\n\nI feel like my whole life was constantly introducing foods and being forced in the same way that therapy would be and it didn\u2019t help. I would now rather be left alone and not judged for not wanting to gag in therapy for the rest of my life.",

TW for speaking about vomiting  \n  \nI think it's funny they literally explained it perfectly themselves then somehow got turned around and forgot their own explanation.\n\nIt's literally just what they said. Kids who are \"picky eaters\" eventually snap out of it. If we could snap out of it, we 100% would. Not a single person who has ARFID has it on their own free will. If someone is genuinely just a \"picky eater\", they eventually get bored and move on JUST like this person said. So if it's still going on into adulthood, certainly there's a fucking issue, no?\n\nI feel like people have this idea that people with ARFID just sit around all day content with their diet and counting down the days until we get scurvy so we can throw a party or something. That's not how it works at all, and many of us actively work with doctors and therapists to fight these issues and try to adjust our diet in a way that ensures we get all of our dietary needs. Just because we're not comfortable going out of our comfort zone at any given moment on your whim doesn't mean we aren't going out of our comfort zone regularly on our own time. Not recognizing that is the equivalent of shoving somebody who can't swim into a pool and saying \"eh, they have to learn somehow\". Instead of helping them step out of that comfort zone, you violently shoved them out and broke their trust and then get mad when it somehow didn't work.\n\nPeople act like I haven't actively tried new foods and haven't actively gagged and vomited on the texture/taste, they act like it's some childish tantrum instead of a real physical response to a food the mind deems unacceptable. I've almost choked on my own vomit trying to force down new foods. And the whole time my brain is screaming \"It's good! It's fine!! It's good food stop being like this!!\" but I can't stop my body's response.\n\nI went years not knowing what the hell was wrong with me, breaking down and crying over my body's stupid inability to just eat certain foods that everybody knows are good and safe. It broke me before I even had the word to describe what was happening and how to fix it. (I had been TRYING to fix it for years, but nothing I did allowed me to \"snap out of it\")\n\nSurprise surprise, being diagnosed with ARFID and doing therapy specific to ARFID ACTUALLY HELPED ME OPEN UP MY PALETTE MORE THAN JUST \"TRYING TO GET OVER IT\" MYSELF. I swear, these people don't actually want anyone to heal. They just want to make people feel bad so they can make fun of them while they watch us fail. It's a cruel sick joke. They take away our support so we get worse then get confused why we aren't getting any better.",

I can put it in my mouth I might be able to even chew it but my throat says nope and I'll either gag or sit there with it in my mouth trying desperately to get it down until I spit it out. This leads to not liking to eat and in turn not eating for most of the day or at all until I'm so hungry even my autistic ass can tell. Then there is a high calorie eating binge of tasty safe food then I feel disgusting and the cycle starts again. Somehow afraid and binge eating disorder blur together.
