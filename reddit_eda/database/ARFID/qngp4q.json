I self diagnosed years ago but I\u2019m ready for professional help because I am so sick of living this way and yet no one knows what the hell im even talking about and it\u2019s so embarrassing trying to explain it and trying to emphasize that I am not a calorie counter that aims to lose weight I just can\u2019t fucking eat a balanced meal to save my life. What do I even do. Fuck. The psych offered me to join their outpatient eating disorder program but couldn\u2019t give me an answer on if they were just gonna treat me like an anorexic. I\u2019m so tired. I just want to like vegetables",
