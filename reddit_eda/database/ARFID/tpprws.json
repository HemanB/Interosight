  "title": "I Survived ARFID",
  "selftext": "I wanted to share this here in hopes of giving somebody encouragement and hope that it DOES get better.\n\nMAJOR trigger warning: I go into detail about my relapse into a very severe case of ARFID.\n\nLast year, I experienced perhaps one of if not the worst experiences of my entire life. I\u2019ve had ARFID for as long as I can remember, but it spiked due to an anxiety disorder, and not only was I sensitive to textures, but the sensitivity turned into an irrational fear of swallowing.\n\nI slowly lost the ability to eat solid food, and even soups with seasoning due to constantly choking from my body having literally forgotten how to swallow. The state of my body slowly began to deteriorate. I dropped to about 85 pounds at my worst.\n\nI was only consuming maybe 200 calories a day. My fear of choking was so debilitating that I refused to eat alone. I would wait for my mother to come home for lunch and try to consume anything I could within a 30 minute window, I was starving but my body couldn\u2019t eat, and just drinking wasn\u2019t nearly enough.\n\nI had shrunken to such a small size that I couldn\u2019t work on my art anymore. My hands were so thin that my fingers made me sick just looking at them, and the sight of my hip bones in the mirror felt disgusting, and I was still so hungry.\n\nWe were begging my doctor for help, but nothing seemed to be working. I finally began to see a therapist, a woman who had recently cured another young woman of a similar eating disorder, almost identical to mine.\n\nMy exposure therapy began and I learned to feel my throat when I swallowed, not to avoid it, but it took awhile. I slowly worked my way up a literal food pyramid, from soft to progressively more and more solid foods. It took months. \n\nBy the time I started exposure therapy, my stomach had shrunken down so much that I could only eat about half of the breading of a single chicken nugget (which at this point would take me around 30 minutes to swallow) before feeling completely full. It sounds pathetically hilarious, I can laugh at it now, but it really sucked then.\n\nMy exposure therapy began with having me eat one of the lower tier foods on call with my therapist, and my mother to keep watch in the room. It took me the full hour of our session to eat one quarter of my meal. The positive reinforcement felt relieving and I felt safe, but I also was so glad to eat. I was scared but I was so desperate to eat that it almost didn\u2019t matter, even if I could only eat a quarter of it I was so thankful to have something that wasn\u2019t soup in my stomach.\n\nI was still in therapy when thanksgiving rolled around, and Christmas as well. It was torture but for once I was glad that the pandemic had prevented me from being around so many family members. Of course I couldn\u2019t eat much, and my body was still so thin and exhausted, I could only stand for 5 minutes to decorate the Christmas tree before feeling too weak to stand.\n\nBy the time the new year rolled around, I was eating more solid foods, and my stomach finally began to grow again. It was a slog eating enough calories in one day. You don\u2019t realize how much you eat in one day until it becomes a chore to do. Eating three times a day when your stomach isn\u2019t big enough to carry that much is painful, and stressful, especially considering how long it would take me to eat anything. But my hunger was finally subsiding and that\u2019s all I cared about.\n\nMy therapist had me establish a goal to reach by the end of my therapy.\nMy goal was to be able to eat a sandwich all alone in the house, on call with my therapist. I finally reached that goal after almost 7 months in therapy, at 85 pounds. It took me 2-3 more months of therapy to learn how to eat by myself again, and another 2-3 months of no therapy the become self sufficient. So about a full year from start to finish.\n\nA year after my last day of exposure therapy, I\u2019ve gained ten pounds and can take care of myself again. My stomach size is back to normal, and I can finally eat full solid meals like I used to, except now I\u2019m more comfortable eating than I\u2019ve ever been in my whole life.\n\nIt gets better, and it\u2019s okay to ask for help. Hoping everyone here succeeds in all that they wish to accomplish \ud83d\udc4d\n\nAlso I did not check for spelling so I apologize if anything is wonky lol.",

And mashed potatoes and soft foods cannot choke you either, it\u2019s impossible. Chewing your food makes it impossible to choke on it, you will never choke and it\u2019s so rare for someone to choke to a dangerous extent, you will not die from it. We also spoke about how many people I knew who suffered from a terrible choking episode, and if so how many? It\u2019s very very rare, you are unlikely to be hurt at all especially if you chew solid foods properly. And your safe foods your eating now cannot hurt you, it feels scary but it\u2019s impossible for the food you\u2019re eating now to hurt you.\n\nThe fear and choked up feeling you get is what\u2019s causing your body to feel like it\u2019s choking, sometimes it\u2019s the mucus in your throat that makes it difficult to swallow, but that\u2019s completely normal and it is also impossible for it to be able to hurt you.\n\nYou\u2019re doing great and I\u2019m telling you now that what you\u2019re eating is not going to harm you in any way because it is physically impossible for it to hurt you at all.",

It\u2019s very very rare, you are unlikely to be hurt at all especially if you chew solid foods properly. And your safe foods your eating now cannot hurt you, it feels scary but it\u2019s impossible for the food you\u2019re eating now to hurt you.\n\nThe fear and choked up feeling you get is what\u2019s causing your body to feel like it\u2019s choking, sometimes it\u2019s the mucus in your throat that makes it difficult to swallow, but that\u2019s completely normal and it is also impossible for it to be able to hurt you.\n\nYou\u2019re doing great and I\u2019m telling you now that what you\u2019re eating is not going to harm you in any way because it is physically impossible for it to hurt you at all.",

      "body": "I\u2019m sorry to hear that, if you can find a good therapist or phycologist for your daughter then that should help her tremendously. I wouldn\u2019t suggest seeing any medical doctors for treatment, since ARFID is mostly a phycological and fear based disorder, medical doctors will be of very little help.\n\nHere are some foods I ate while I was recovering that may help your daughter (if you want)\n\nSmoothie\u2019s (blended frozen fruits and vegetables are good), I really liked peanut butter and banana smoothie\u2019s, easy to swallow since it\u2019s not solid. A large portion that she can take her time with should be fine, make sure it\u2019s in a container she feels safe drinking from.\n\nEnsure\u2019s or protein drinks are great ways of getting in a lot of calories. They\u2019re generally sold in pharmacy\u2019s off the shelf or near the dairy section.\n\nSoups (soup at hands are good), potato soup is a good filling food as well, if she doesn\u2019t mind potato chunks.\n\nYogurt, my parents would get me those yogurts that came with m&m\u2019s since they would dissolve into the yogurt, so I\u2019d feel more inclined to eat it.\n\nSoft scrambled eggs. If you put your stove on low heat and beat at the eggs in the pan then they\u2019ll be mushy enough that they\u2019re barely solid anymore. Put a lot of butter in the pan before hand to help with the mushy consistency.\n\nMake sure to look for lots of different foods she can eat and cycle through new ones regularly. At least for me, eating the same things for months on end made me feel worse about my condition, and it will make her body feel better to have lots of different options. There\u2019s tons of other foods on the subreddit that people have posted but those were just some of my safe foods. I hope things get better soon.\n\nI know for my parents it was difficult to see me go through what happened, so I feel great sympathy for you guys, just know that she\u2019s going to be okay, ARFID seems impossible to fix when it\u2019s at its worst but once she starts recovering it will happen fast, just make sure that ultimately she feels safe. If she has anxiety or is home alone often because of the pandemic then quality time with her might help to ease any of the anxiety she might have. Anxiety is what makes ARFID so harmful, and anything she\u2019s anxious about can trigger it, making her feel relaxed will be the most helpful thing for her.\n\nKeeping you guys in my thoughts, I hope everything goes well. If you need anything don\u2019t hesitate to message me either!",
