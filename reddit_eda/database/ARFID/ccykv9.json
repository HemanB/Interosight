At the time I didn't know what I was doing, today I'd say it was a simple version of gradual exposure.\n\nEvery time my mother would cook rice, I ate a pinch if it, just the amount of rice I could pinch between my fingers. It was difficult, but the whole point of exposure is to get yourself so used to a stimulus that it doesn't cause any negative affects anymore. So when I could somewhat stomach that pinch of rice (btw, it was just rice and nothing else, the spices came later, and actually helped!), I would go on to the next big thing: eating a full spoon of rice. Every time I got used to the amout of rice I set as my goal, I tried to eat more. Eventually I could stomach a little side of rice to my meals. Wasn't my favourite food, but it went from \"hell no\" to \"bearable\". It's also important not to pressure yourself, if you can't do it that day, don't force yourself, but try to analyse why it didn't work, and see if you can apply it for the next time. This took quite a while (probably because I didn't know what I was doing, had no therapist then and was just trying), but now I can eat rice as a main course. Using spices helped a lot. I love fried rice now, though I'm still not too fond of cooked rice with sauce. Mixing it with other safe foods, in my case chicken and egg, helped too. That's something I do a lot too - mixing safe foods and \"bearable\" foods together to be able to stomach the meal and get slowly used to the other food.\n\nIn general, patience is key. Forcing yourself to eat a whole rice dish isn't likely to work and may make your aversion just worse. Giving yourself time with little amounts of rice will also give your brain time to \"recode\" rice from \"hell no\" to \"this is edible\".",
