  "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI am a software engineer and the father of a seven-year-old girl who has been diagnosed with ARFID. Like many families, we struggled for several years until we understood and accepted the condition.\n\nSince last year my daughter and I have kept a paper food diary, giving star ratings to new foods to make it a bit of a game.\n\nI\u2019m now building an online version so families can track foods, share progress with relatives, teachers, or clinicians, and keep everything in one place. A live demo is available (details in the first comment).\n\nI know similar apps exist, but I wanted to create something tailored to our experience. I\u2019d love your feedback. If it sounds useful, I\u2019ll keep refining it.\n\nThank you! \ud83e\udd1e",
