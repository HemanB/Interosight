  "selftext": "Growing up my family would always ask me what I\u2019m gonna do when I get into a relationship and the person wants to take me out to dinner. I was always like, \u201cif they can\u2019t accept me for who I am I shouldn\u2019t be with them.\u201d Which is still true. But in the same breath\u2026it\u2019s so embarrassing the older I get. Ordering off the kids menu or not ordering anything. I got asked on a date to get spaghetti and, I love spaghetti. But with no sauce, just butter and cheese. I feel ridiculous and have anxiety about it and don\u2019t know what to say to him. I briefly explained my picky eating before but haven\u2019t really gotten into it. I realize this is a turn off or even deal breaker for a lot of people, so I\u2019m nervous about rejection I guess.",

      "body": "Very real!! It is so hard to figure out how to broach this topic. I find being upfront is the best even though it\u2019s not easy. It is not easy to be so vulnerable so early on. \n\nUnlike other traumas/disorders/etc that some people can take time to divulge, food is not one you can hide for long. I\u2019m married now, but when I was dating it was such a challenge to figure out how to explain it in a way anyone could understand. \n\n\nBut ultimately I have found using the language of \u2018eating disorder\u2019 seems to make people actually listen and take it seriously. As soon as you say \u2018picky eater\u2019 they tune out everything else and bring in their assumptions and judgements. I mostly stick to the phrase \u2018I have an eating disorder that makes eating a variety of foods a challenge. I\u2019m happy to meet you for food, but I\u2019d be most comfortable going to [x restaurant] as I know their menu well. Thank you for being flexible!\u2019 \n\nNo apologies. No justifications. Just a statement and moving forward.",

With my first serious relationship, years later when we met up he completely forgot how picky of an eater I was. It simply was never an issue.\n\nThe person I ended up marrying - his dad is a vegetarian, several people in his extended family are vegan, they're all pretty health conscious, but he personally never cared about food. He grew up in a home with a socially acceptable version of \"picky eater\" (meaning his dad). They still need to make sure the restaurants will have something he'll eat, etc. We honestly cater more around him and the other family members than we ever have with me and ARFID.\n\nBeing a little picky whether it's a health issue (celiacs, arfid, allergies, whatever) or because it's a choice (vegan, vegetarian, pescetarian, etc) *really* isn't a big issue once you branch out into the world more. It's only as big of a deal as *you* make it, and if someone else has a problem with it, that's *their* problem. \n\nIf I were you and you're not comfortable laughing it off as just being picky, I'd say open up that you have a health condition that limits your diet. Because.... you do. You're not lying by saying that. You can be clear communicating that you're fine health-wise, but you just have to be careful with what you eat. You can compare it to celiacs (imply you get sick easily from certain foods [I know I personally get nauseated and sick feeling if I have to eat something I can't]).\n\nIt still might be a deal breaker for them... but like.... I also dated a guy who said one of his deal breakers was a girl who didn't like roller coasters. They were a passion that he wanted to share with someone. Everyone has stuff like that, you're never going to avoid it. I definitely think there are things you can compromise on and bottom-lines that you just can't - for some people that's food... for others it's roller coasters. My personal experience has taught me that most people really DGAF.",

I used to get asked that same question and it always embarrassed me to no end. \n\nMy deal is, the older I got rhe less I cared what other people thought about everything. I basically just started to responding to comments about my food with \"would you prefer I don't eat at all?\" which actually shut it down. Now that I found my circle of people they never question it or judge me for it.\n\nThat being said, food is still an incrediblly anxiety inducing topic. Feeling judged and being scared of rejection for it is completely vaild. This is so much easier said than done but it helps to get into the habit of outright telling people that you're \"really picky\" (define this based on your relationship with that person obviously) right off the bat when restaurants and whatnot are mentioned. It alleviateds some of that anxiety by getting it out of the way before it has the potential to become a problem.",

They would constantly invite me to restaurants I couldn\u2019t eat anything at, due to both my ARFID and allergies, just to bully me, gang up on me, laugh at me and be generally nasty. It wasn\u2019t a money issue either, because they went to restaurants they perfectly knew I could eat at and they didn\u2019t call me, they only did it when they knew I couldn\u2019t eat anything. Like why is your great aunt so offended she feels the need to insult me because I can\u2019t eat onions? lmfao\n\nJust letting you know, the right person will love you no matter what conditions or disorders you have, they\u2019ll love you because you\u2019re you. Don\u2019t settle for less and don\u2019t tolerate any bullshit from anybody who refuses to understand it\u2019s something you can\u2019t really control. You\u2019re not ridiculous. If somebody rejects you over your eating habits, maybe they\u2019re the problem. If you like someone you won\u2019t care whether they eat certain foods or not.",

Maybe it would be nicer to set dates at home, but gagging from not liking something on the first date (I would not choose a restaurant for your first date) than in your own house, where there is just you and your date will test if this is also someone who can deal with your ARFID.

Being rejected sucks.   \n\n\nBut I will say, you have the right idea that if someone can't accept you they aren't the person for you. My wife LOVES food. Trying new things, eating a lot of places that I can't, and just in general sees food entirely different than I do.   \n\n\nWe've found a balance and compromise that most nights we eat something that is approachable to both of us, but if she's craving something I won't like we both go get our own thing and just eat together on the couch watching TV. We both get to eat food we can eat and still get to spend time together.   \n\n\nFor us the meal is more about being together than it is the food.   \n\n\nOutside of that I even have friends who are kind enough to either make something that will include me or just understand I will likely eat something before I come to the party then just have a few small snacks if they're available.   \n\n\nI'm 30 years old, I'm married, and a lot of my friends have been friends for years so I'm sure all of those factors contribute a lot to me being less embarrassed at this point. All of these people choose to be in my life still even though this is something I struggle with, the same way I choose to be in their lives even though they have their own struggles. We all have our own differences, struggles, and hurdles. For us on this sub, it just happens to be food.   \n\n\nI won't lie, it may suck for awhile but you'll find the right person/people for your life. I promise.",

Plenty of potential partners judged me for it, which hurt of course, but my husband is the sweetest and I've been able to make a lot of progress since I met him. It goes the same for romantic partners and friends, if someone is going to judge me for an eating disorder I've struggled all my life with, they probably wouldn't be a good friend for many reasons. Just because it isn't as widely recognized doesn't mean it isn't just as legitimate and devastating as anorexia or any other eating disorder. \n\nStraight up, no one should judge you for it and if they do they're an asshole. There are kind understanding people out there who will listen. Hope this helps, I previously felt very ashamed and afraid of telling anyone, so I can empathize.",
