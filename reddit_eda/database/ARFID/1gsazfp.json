  "selftext": "I\u2019m at a Friendsgiving and thought it was mainly friends. Turns out it\u2019s mainly his family, which is fine, but his dad really pressured me to eat some of the spring roll, and I did grab it to try because, you know, peer pressure works ig. \n\nAnyway I\u2019m now hiding in the bathroom for a few. The good news is that it fried, and i pretended to chew and swallowed with water, but like if I say no let me say no, god damn.",

Why do people care so much if I don't want to eat mushy, disgusting, soggy bread (turkey stuffing)??? \n\nMaybe I'm biased due to me seeing food as a chore, a nuisance that I have to deal with on a regular basis. If not a chore, a source of pure stress. Potato chips are about as exciting as plain carrots in my mind. Less, actually. Carrots are at least bland enough for me to not even register them as food. Exercise is more enjoyable to me than eating, but I can't even do that without eating more to compensate for it. I fucking hate that food even exists at this point, I want to photosynthesize instead. If I had one wish, it would be to get rid of the need for me to eat. Maybe that's extreme, but come on, why does it feel like the world revolves around the stuff..? \n\nAnd some people won't even be friends with you for being a \"picky eater\" because they don't like seeing someone order something \"weird\" (chicken tenders are weird apparently) when going out to dinner. Like it has to be an obsession. It can't be healthy for a person to pick their friends based on what they eat, or to feel the need to force us to eat stuff that we have made clear makes us feel physically ill, otherwise they get offended. It's getting to a point where I'm wondering if that's some kind of a disorder of its own lol.",
