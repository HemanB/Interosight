  "selftext": "I know it\u2019s silly, it\u2019s actually the complete opposite. If I make a meal at home, than I know what goes in it. And yet I can\u2019t bring myself to do it.\n\nFor example, I could make a salad at home, very cheap and healthy. But I won\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t feel \u201csafe\u201d. I will, however, go out to a restaurant and happily eat a $9 salad made by a stranger. Restaurant salad is \u201csafe\u201d.\n\nAlso, I can eat out and then take home leftovers. But once the food is brought into the home it feels\u2026 contaminated. Old. Rotten? Dirty. \n\nI don\u2019t know if anyone else experiences this. But it\u2019s been a problem I\u2019ve had my whole life. And I feel guilty for wasting money because I\u2019m actually irrational. \ud83d\ude14",

      "body": "I cannot \u201cmake\u201d food in my house bc of similar feelings. I only use a microwave and a fridge. I do not put meals together - the most I can do is a sandwich. Everything else is pre-made and cannot require anything but heating up. I also really really hate my cabinets and cannot eat food thats been in them. I buy food every 2-3 days and hope that I do not get grossed out by it. I just buy everything in small quantities so I do not feel wasteful but I also give myself grace in understanding that I am doing my best. I try to challenge myself occasionally using the oven or the stovetop but its not something I can do everyday. I do not eat leftovers easily as well.\n\nI initially tried to clean everything multiple times but it still did not ease my anxieties so now I just do what makes my life easiest and what gets food into my body.",

      "body": "Maybe you try heading over to kitchen confidential and reading some of the dirtiness of restaurant kitchens.\n\nThe sounds like a cognitive therapy program you need. You should definitely talk to someone professional regarding this issue.\n\nSomething that helps me a lot is I have a glass spray bottle with a silicone boot. It's filled with 70% isopropyl alcohol and a bit of Myers soap and water. And I spray that on everything in my kitchen and wipe it down.\n\nAlso, a steam cleaner is like $30 and chemical free sanitization is a great option.\n\nFinally, it might help you to learn some basic food safety and become more confident in yourself and your abilities to prepare food safely for yourself. The food handler is safety card. Is a mandatory thing in the United States to be obtained by anyone who works in the food industry. It's the questionnaire that should be easy to answer without studying. You should be able to find a practice test online. Go check it out and if you can't answer some questions you might want to do some reading for yourself. The best thing you can do is make yourself confident about you, your capabilities to take care of yourself and your surroundings.",
