  "selftext": "I don't know if I have ARFID, but I am extremely selective about foods tastes and textures. I also have other sensory issues such as misophonia. I came across an AITAH post about breaking up with someone because they were picky, and it was justified cause the guy was also being a massive jerk. However all of the comments were proclaiming how much they hated picky eaters and how they should \"grow up\" etc. I commented how hurtful these thing were and just got hurled downvotes and rude comments. I'm feeling really shit right now and just don't understand why people can't accept others differences without being so hateful and snide about it? Honestly its the same with misophonia. It's not like we choose this!!! There are so many things I love the look and smell of and wish I could eat but I just physically cannot!!",

      "body": "Hey, sorry people are jerks. Hugs\n\nI think a lot of it is how we're socialized. From a biological viewpoint, we need food to survive. So getting food is a biological imperative and impetus. Anthropologically speaking, food is a resource, and by offering to share a resource with someone else, that person will have less, which will affect their survival. Acceptance of the resource (ie, eating the food) is honoring the sacrifice (both the food itself as well as the time it took to prepare the food and the fact that the person giving you the food now has less for themself.)\n\n All over the world, food is tied to cultural, social, and religious traditions. Some people view not eating certain foods (regardless of the reason) as a rejection of these practices, and thereby the people themselves. This is especially true in countries and cultures where food preparation involves things like hunting harvesting and preparing the basic ingredients for recipes.\n\nIn a lot of developed nations, I think people view so-called \"picky eating\" as a privilege. Having enough to eat has always been a sign of success (both in an anthropological sense and a capitalistic sense), whereas not having enough food to eat has always been an indicator of not having enough money or status (so that people would feel inclined to share their food with you). The prevailing thought in many societies has typically been, if you're hungry enough, you'll eat whatever is available, and you can only turn your nose up at food if you're wealthy enough to afford something else. This kind of thinking looks at eating from a purely biological necessity without any of the psychological or even physiological elements (like allergies) that are associated with food. It's also classist: wealthy people get to choose food, beggars can't be choosers. It could be thought of as ableist, depending on the context: if someone else is preparing the food for you and doing the work, you get no say.\n\nAnd I mean, those are just some of the basic, global ideas about food. That doesn't even take into account people's individual family histories and experiences with eating and meals, which are all highly subjective. If one grew up in a household where the family was food insecure, the parents might not have had a lot of choices about what foods they could afford. Or perhaps someone had parents who were very mindful about wasting food, or it was tied to culture or religion and alternatives weren't an option. \n\nI say all this because in my experience food is such a subjective issue that people really, really take personally. I find it fascinating that even in this day and age when so much of the world is becoming more tolerant and educated, deviation from food normative behavior is still one thing that people have a hard time accepting. And maybe it's because it goes back to it being a biological need, and something that uses up resources, I don't know. It's weird that we'll accept that people from other cultures eat differently, but not people from our own, even if they're friends or family.",

That's where some of the negative stereotypes come from.\n\nCooking, eating together, dining out at restaurants etc can often be a big part of being in a relationship with someone. If one half of the relationship has no interest in this or has restrictions that make this difficult then it can be frustrating for the other half. Many people see going to restaurants and cafes as a bonding experience. And it can be awkward if someone won't eat anything, can't choose a single thing from the menu or had to spend 10 minutes altering everything on a simple dish.\n\nSame with travelling. For many people food is one of the highlights of travelling. Especially when going overseas, experiencing a new culture, new cities and often new food. But if someone in your party doesn't want to try anything new, go out of their comfort zone or experience the more unique restaurants then it can really affect the whole trip. And can definitely kill the experience for those who do want to experience all they can while travelling.\n\nI think it's definitely unfair to judge someone on their eating but those are just a few situations where eating habits can affect people's relationships with others. And probably how the negative stereotypes come up for \"picky eaters\". Having a very limited palate is also usually associated with young children. Obviously ARFID is more than just \"limited palate\" as it's a genuine physiological condition. But to people who have no clue about ARFID if they see an adult being \"picky\" often people associate that adult with bring child-like which also doesn't help the negative associations.",

On the other side, I think that folks with ARFID don't fully understand or relate to, the extent that positive emotions are involved with food for those without ARFID, so out the gate, most people are not on common ground. In general, many people love food and all the rituals surrounding it. So because of the lack of understanding about ARFID, people often say dumb stuff. I have also noticed that because of this, it creates a bit of a reverse hyperarousal about food when around other people. I've seen this with my loved one. They are so ready for people to pick on them about what they are eating that the smallest comment can send them spinning. Often I've noticed that people were not trying to be a jerk they just end up in a bit of a minefield due to being unaware of the situation. Outside of family dynamics, it's pretty rare to have someone say \"grow up\" etc. I will say though that most people who say ignorant things or push the issue about someone eating in a way that is unusual to them, often can be redirected pretty easily once you realize that and learn to just be nonchalant about it, own your choices and shut them down. It's not easy but once you master it, it can reduce a ton of anxiety about eating around others.",

However, there are picky eaters who inconvenience others by forcing friends and family to (often unexpectedly) accommodate their food preferences at the expense of others' enjoyment.

Those people should not lie to them and tell them that their food is good when it\u2019s not.  It\u2019s sooo common I can\u2019t leave it out. \n\n\nAnd Some people enjoy eating really low quality food.  One of my pets is a golden and the other is a blue heeler. The blue heeler would be one of those people who greatly enjoyed eating terrible food.  Any food-all food.  just shovel it down. Gimme gimme gimme.  And the picky eater exposes their gluttony. And that embarrasses them. \n\nSo you see most emotionally, mature people are unbothered by how other people eat.  You run into questions like \u201cwhy would I care?\u201d  And when someone shows that they have a real negative reaction to picky eaters the question is really what\u2019s their dysfunction",

      "body": "I think it's because feeding people is expensive, in terms of time and money and mental energy. It's one of the most exhausting parts of caring for others, and people who feed others are prone to burnout. One of the symptoms of burnout is a decrease in empathy. \n\nAnd also, feeding others can be rewarding, and many people build their ability to feed others well into their identity. When someone like that makes food and someone with a medical need rejects it, they can feel like they, the person who made the food, is being rejected. Or they may feel frustrated that their work, performed with the expectation of being able to feed someone, is now wasted or not valued. That they aren't getting their expected \"reward\".\n\nA mature adult who isn't tired and who feels psychologically safe will recognize that this is their problem, and won't project their feelings onto the person managing a health issue. But people aren't always mature and are often tired and often feel defensive. \n\nBasically, it's the adult equivalent of a toddler throwing a tantrum because they need a nap. Psychologically, it's just easier for them to blame a sick person than to deal with reality at the moment. It's targeted _at_ you, but it doesn't really have anything to do _with_ you. Sometimes the emotional stress of grieving for a person with a health issue can even, ironically, manifest this way - in which case, they will probably improve with time. \n\nFor some folks, over-identifying with their role as someone who feeds others or defensiveness or burnout are chronic conditions and they may take a very long time to come around (if ever).",

      "body": "Hello, I am a Certified Normal Peopleologist. I say this without malice and with so much sympathy, because I am and have been where you are. \n\nIt\u2019s because people love food. Food is important to them - it\u2019s their hobby, their love language, their culture, their passion, etc etc etc etc etc. When someone wants to share their life with someone or show love, they share their hobbies, culture, passion, etc with them. If someone is dismissive and shitty about your hobbies, culture, or passions, it\u2019s confusing and miserable.\n\nI read the same story you did. I don\u2019t think the guy\u2019s flaw was being picky, it was the way he did it. If he said, \u201cI am very picky and have a restricted palate that makes it difficult to find food I like and share foods others like,\u201d it would be different. Maybe they still wouldn\u2019t end up together, but at least they wouldn\u2019t be frustrated with one another. As a side note, the guy made other mistakes with how he handled the situation, but the initial mistake was his approach to the problem.\n\nIf you approach the problem openly and honestly, you might get hurt. If you hide the problem, you will probably get hurt and also hurt the other person\u2019s feelings and confuse them. If you press the issue, like that guy did (\u201cyou threw away something that could have been beautiful just because you\u2019re shallow\u201d), it\u2019s offputting at best and pushy/dickish at medium.\n\nFinding a happy medium IS POSSIBLE. Finding someone who is willing to work with you to find things you can both enjoy, or workarounds (i.e. cooking different things to eat together) IS POSSIBLE and, in my experience, quite easy if you break it off early with people you\u2019re incompatible with. \n\nFor example, if I had a restrictive diet because of allergens, and they only wanted food with those allergens in them, then we would be incompatible. Thank you, I had a lovely time, but I just don\u2019t see this working out. If I was vegan and my date was shitty about it or tried to sneak meat into my food or pressured me into eating it, they would be an asshole. No thanks, I had a shit time, don\u2019t fucking date vegans.\n\nHowever, most people don\u2019t have the information they need to be considerate towards everyone\u2019s limitations all the time, especially if they\u2019re not stated outright. A boundary cannot be respected if it is not stated. A rule cannot be followed if it is known only to you.\n\nOpen, honest communication may have saved that man a world of hurt. It may not have saved that relationship, but at least they could discuss it like adults and see if it\u2019s something they can work around. At the very least, if she was truly dead set on being a shithead about it, then he could see the bullet he dodged. Instead, he didn\u2019t tell her, insulted her coworkers\u2019 cooking (whether he meant it that way or not, it was insulting), and made her feel weird and shitty for reasons she couldn\u2019t know.  He could have said, \u201chey, this food is challenging for me, I don\u2019t think I can eat it so I\u2019m going to go for food I can eat. Can you please cover for me for a second?\u201d Anything other than just acting grossed out about it for no reason. If someone did that to me, I would feel bad.\n\nMy brother (no ARFID that I know of) fucking hates beans and onions. His wife knows he hates beans and onions, so she doesn\u2019t make dishes with them. I have a much wibblier set of Food Laws, mostly concerning texture. My beautiful wonderful partner works with me to accommodate my tastes and makes sure I\u2019m fed even on a bad day, because I told him what\u2019s going on early in the relationship. He\u2019s a chef, he loves to cook, he loves other cultures\u2019 cuisines, and he loves a lot of shit I fucking hate.\n\nAgain, if someone is dismissive or shitty about your food preferences, that\u2019s one thing. If you don\u2019t tell them and instead just shit all over every little thing they try to feed you for (seemingly) no reason, that\u2019s another. If my beautiful wonderful partner who can do no wrong made me feel shitty about what I can and cannot eat, we\u2019d be done just as surely as if he tried to feed me things I\u2019m allergic to because he didn\u2019t believe me. But he can\u2019t know I have food allergies if I don\u2019t tell him, and he can\u2019t know why I won\u2019t eat a dish if I don\u2019t tell him why.\n\nI understand. I really, really do. It\u2019s frustrating and shitty and weird and hard and bad. It sucks so fucking bad. But this guy was not blameless, and he wasn\u2019t you. Do better than that guy. Stand upright, be honest, and be stalwart on your course. Cut em out if they\u2019re an asshole. But give em the chance to accommodate you.",

And *I* was shocked to find out that when most people heard \"I don't like that food\" they thought I was making a fuss over *that* level of mild dislike, rather than the reality.\n\nSo people view picky eaters as people who will only eat things that are absolutely perfect and align exactly to their personal preference. Like a diva who throws a tantrum if her clothes aren't designer brand. But in reality, they just have *no idea* what's going on in our heads. \n\nRealizing that has really changed the wording I use to talk about picky eating with people.",

Particularly because this meal had tomatoes and my body can't stand them when they are the main flavor.\u00a0\nMy family had convinced me that the world hated me for not eating anything and everything. One of the teachers who brought us asked why i wasn't eating and was about to berate me for wasting food, but the chef stopped everything and cooked an alternative version of the dish without tomatoes for me.\u00a0\nObviously I remember this to this day, and it's something that warms my heart whenever I remember it.\u00a0\nI wish that everyone was as kind and understanding about eating disorders as that person was.\u00a0",

I will always start with a polite \"no thank you, it looks delicious but it wont agree with my stomach\" and that almost always does fine. Some people push it, especially like family who I know, they know I will not be eating, to where I will occasionally lash out with \"AM I NOT SPEAKING ENGLISH? NO. THANK. YOU.

          "body": "I don't have ARFID but I'm close to someone who does. From my observations I would say that most people do not know about or understand the condition so they react badly sometimes. On the other side, I think that folks with ARFID don't fully understand or relate to, the extent that positive emotions are involved with food for those without ARFID, so out the gate, most people are not on common ground. In general, many people love food and all the rituals surrounding it. So because of the lack of understanding about ARFID, people often say dumb stuff. I have also noticed that because of this, it creates a bit of a reverse hyperarousal about food when around other people. I've seen this with my loved one. They are so ready for people to pick on them about what they are eating that the smallest comment can send them spinning. Often I've noticed that people were not trying to be a jerk they just end up in a bit of a minefield due to being unaware of the situation. Outside of family dynamics, it's pretty rare to have someone say \"grow up\" etc. I will say though that most people who say ignorant things or push the issue about someone eating in a way that is unusual to them, often can be redirected pretty easily once you realize that and learn to just be nonchalant about it, own your choices and shut them down. It's not easy but once you master it, it can reduce a ton of anxiety about eating around others.",

Some people view not eating certain foods (regardless of the reason) as a rejection of these practices, and thereby the people themselves. This is especially true in countries and cultures where food preparation involves things like hunting harvesting and preparing the basic ingredients for recipes.\n\nIn a lot of developed nations, I think people view so-called \"picky eating\" as a privilege. Having enough to eat has always been a sign of success (both in an anthropological sense and a capitalistic sense), whereas not having enough food to eat has always been an indicator of not having enough money or status (so that people would feel inclined to share their food with you). The prevailing thought in many societies has typically been, if you're hungry enough, you'll eat whatever is available, and you can only turn your nose up at food if you're wealthy enough to afford something else. This kind of thinking looks at eating from a purely biological necessity without any of the psychological or even physiological elements (like allergies) that are associated with food.

          "body": "Hey, sorry people are jerks. Hugs\n\nI think a lot of it is how we're socialized. From a biological viewpoint, we need food to survive. So getting food is a biological imperative and impetus. Anthropologically speaking, food is a resource, and by offering to share a resource with someone else, that person will have less, which will affect their survival. Acceptance of the resource (ie, eating the food) is honoring the sacrifice (both the food itself as well as the time it took to prepare the food and the fact that the person giving you the food now has less for themself.)\n\n All over the world, food is tied to cultural, social, and religious traditions. Some people view not eating certain foods (regardless of the reason) as a rejection of these practices, and thereby the people themselves. This is especially true in countries and cultures where food preparation involves things like hunting harvesting and preparing the basic ingredients for recipes.\n\nIn a lot of developed nations, I think people view so-called \"picky eating\" as a privilege. Having enough to eat has always been a sign of success (both in an anthropological sense and a capitalistic sense), whereas not having enough food to eat has always been an indicator of not having enough money or status (so that people would feel inclined to share their food with you). The prevailing thought in many societies has typically been, if you're hungry enough, you'll eat whatever is available, and you can only turn your nose up at food if you're wealthy enough to afford something else. This kind of thinking looks at eating from a purely biological necessity without any of the psychological or even physiological elements (like allergies) that are associated with food. It's also classist: wealthy people get to choose food, beggars can't be choosers. It could be thought of as ableist, depending on the context: if someone else is preparing the food for you and doing the work, you get no say.\n\nAnd I mean, those are just some of the basic, global ideas about food. That doesn't even take into account people's individual family histories and experiences with eating and meals, which are all highly subjective. If one grew up in a household where the family was food insecure, the parents might not have had a lot of choices about what foods they could afford. Or perhaps someone had parents who were very mindful about wasting food, or it was tied to culture or religion and alternatives weren't an option. \n\nI say all this because in my experience food is such a subjective issue that people really, really take personally. I find it fascinating that even in this day and age when so much of the world is becoming more tolerant and educated, deviation from food normative behavior is still one thing that people have a hard time accepting. And maybe it's because it goes back to it being a biological need, and something that uses up resources, I don't know. It's weird that we'll accept that people from other cultures eat differently, but not people from our own, even if they're friends or family.",

In general, many people love food and all the rituals surrounding it. So because of the lack of understanding about ARFID, people often say dumb stuff. I have also noticed that because of this, it creates a bit of a reverse hyperarousal about food when around other people. I've seen this with my loved one. They are so ready for people to pick on them about what they are eating that the smallest comment can send them spinning. Often I've noticed that people were not trying to be a jerk they just end up in a bit of a minefield due to being unaware of the situation. Outside of family dynamics, it's pretty rare to have someone say \"grow up\" etc. I will say though that most people who say ignorant things or push the issue about someone eating in a way that is unusual to them, often can be redirected pretty easily once you realize that and learn to just be nonchalant about it, own your choices and shut them down. It's not easy but once you master it, it can reduce a ton of anxiety about eating around others.",
