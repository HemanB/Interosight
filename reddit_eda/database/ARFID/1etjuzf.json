  "selftext": "I don\u2019t know if anyone else has this experience, but it still frustrates me a lot\n\nBack in high school we had a required health class. I almost failed it because I refused to do this specific assignment. For an entire week they wanted us to write down EVERYTHING we ate and add up the calories and turn it in. \n\nI understand why we were doing the assignment, but there\u2019s so many issues with it. First of all, I know so many people in my high school who had different eating disorders to the point that this is just a terrible idea. \n\nBut for me, I literally could not complete it. I couldn\u2019t get myself to write down a single thing on that page because of the shame I felt for still eating like a child. I knew I was going to to be judged for it since the teacher already went through the entire chipotle menu and looked at all the calories and told us that if we are eating chipotle but got the chips then we\u2019re eating super unhealthy since the chips are the worst thing on the menu. \n\nSomehow managed to pass with a D, but I never turned in that worksheet.

I'm sure if we had a teacher who was actually passionate about teaching instead of a coach who didn't even get up to teach us the lessons, something probably could've been done about it. I remember not actually counting shit and just writing down random meals and googling the average calories.

The most they should be doing is telling kids to eat their fruits and veggies and not drink more soda than water. One thing that I liked (or found educational) was a visual aid that showed how much sugar was in a can of soda, with several tablespoons of sugar inside a ziplock bag. That\u2019s as far as they went though, otherwise they just said \u201ceat healthy, drink water, and exercise\u201d which is a responsible way to go about teaching kids about nutrition. \n\nI\u2019m really sorry you had to go through something so uncomfortable and triggering. That sounds like it would be really hard for any of us in this sub, as well as all the other students struggling with EDs.",

Doing this is literally just teaching them science and understanding the thermodynamics of the body.\n\nI wish I would have known about counting calories 10 years before I did... also for the record have ARFID. After recording what I was eating for a while allowed me to fit my odd dietary restrictions into a diet that was sustainable for me. (IE finally understanding how many of my calories I was using with sugary foods etc...)\n\nI don't think they should just ignore teaching how the body processes calories just because it will \"trigger\" a few people. OP should have done the assignment and learned something about their diet. Good or bad.",

If we\u2019re talking health and nutrition, they should know they can teach about calories without making kids count their own calories because it can be shameful and trigger unhealthy perceptions about foods. Not that they shouldn\u2019t teach about calorie counts, but they should also note heavily that calorie counting can cause or exasperate EDs and should focus on other ways of interpreting nutrition as well. If we want to teach about health, we also need to teach that obsession with health is not healthy, shaming people is not the way to teach them how to eat more balanced, and that mental health is just as important as physical health and sometimes they overlap.\n\nIt\u2019s not bad to look at calories if you don\u2019t have/aren\u2019t prone to EDs, but they should be emphasizing that calories aren\u2019t the only important thing, that not everyone needs the same amount of calories, that counting calories only goes so far, and that calorie counting is linked to EDs and should be avoided if someone has or thinks it may initiate an ED. Plus, there\u2019s no true way to know 100% exactly how many calories are in something anyways (it\u2019s only an estimate), and they should know and be teaching that too.",
