      "body": "It's incredibly satisfying, isn't it?\n\nI was bullied like hell at primary, and his stance when it came to me being pelted with stones was \"if there aren't visible marks, we can't do anything\" (said in front of the bully so he could learn to work around it), and in regard to vandalism (destroying my stuff) \"if his teacher doesn't witness it, we can't prove it so we can't do anything\" (it literally had to be *my* teacher - not parents, not other school staff, not even another teacher).\n\nI actually left primary school hating him more than the bully. The bully had a *horrific* home life (the \"mum literally put him and his baby sister in a car, got a cashiers cheque for as much as she could from the bank, drove halfway across the country and changed their name to escape a violent, borderline psychotic father\" kind of bad - when we were 15, he found them and they had to run again, found out a few years ago that it actually ended up with not only him, his mother and sister, but a good chunk of the mother's family having to emigrate from the UK to Australia to escape him), so I could kind of understand him lashing out, even as I hated him. But the teacher was literally paid to stop that kind of thing, and he did nothing, same goes for my class teacher.\n\nThere's a saying near where I live - \"I wouldn't spit on him if he was on fire\". That's how I felt about the bully. But when I was 11, I actually said to my teacher on the last day \"I wouldn't spit on you or the head if you were on fire, but I might find some petrol to be sure\" - those were the last words she ever heard from me. Honestly, I think they're the only two people I ever really *hated*.\n\nThe teacher tried to kick up stink with my new school when I started, but they'd already heard about the bullying and the schools lack of action (and not just from me, apparently it was a thing they'd heard a couple of times in the years before I started), so they ignored it.",
