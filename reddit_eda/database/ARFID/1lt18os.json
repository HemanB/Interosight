I would often have just one thing on its own and snack on chocolate cookies throughout the day to keep me going. I was constantly tired and sick. I could not have anything if it wasn't plain \u2014 that means no seasoning or inconsistent textures. I was diagnosed with ARFID by its former name as a toddler so had an extremely limited diet until I was 19.\n \nEverything on the now photo, other than the rice and beef (assuming it was completely plain), I could never have eaten two years ago or have even comprehended trying. I'm still opposed to many foods, but I'm extremely proud of how far I've come.\n",

      "body": "TL;DR: The numbered/highlighted key points are the things that helped me most. Ignore all the detail :) For reference, my ARFID is completely sensory based. I am put off by flavor, smell, texture and the look of food.\n\nHi and thank you! I'm sorry for the lateish reply, there's so much I can say about it because my progress has been very slow and gradual and my relationship with food is something I've been trying to improve every day of my whole life. I initially wrote paragraphs and paragraphs so it's been a challenge to try to keep this as short as possible. \ud83d\ude05 I've highlighted the key points before I go into each one, so it's easier to look at if you don't want to read the details. Though, if anyone wants even more detail or has any questions, let me know.\n\nFor reference, my ARFID is completely sensory based. I am put off by flavor, smell, texture and the look of food.\n\nAnyway, It *was* mostly exposure therapy, but all of these things helped a lot, too:\n\n1. **Learning to cook.** \n\nCooking gave me a new perspective on food. I can appreciate where food comes from; the processes and time involved; and the science and skill behind getting food to the perfect texture.\nI believe having ARFID has made me a skilled cook as I have had to research everything to a T to perfect the texture and taste of what I eat.\n\nI found myself cooking a lot more often whether for myself or others, which gave me many more chances to try something and I was always intrigued to know what the food I made tasted like.\n\n2. **Being in the right environment and mental space.**\n\nSome days I was completely repulsed by everything and it would have been impossible to try something, but on good days it felt much easier and enjoyable to try something. My boyfriend's place felt a lot safer than my family home.\n\n3. **Trying extremely tiny amounts of a new food, again and again in multiple forms.**\n\nFor example, it took me 3 months to go from fried eggs to omelettes. From there, I started hiding things in the omelette in *extremely* tiny amounts and just sit there (in a calm and safe enviornment) until I ate it.\n\nThe first time I experimented with this, I hid spinach in an omelette. It took me an hour to take a few bites and I was unable to eat all of it.\nAfter 3 months of repeating this meal from time-to-time, I was able to finish the entire omelette, plus another 3 months to feel 100% comfortable with spinach mixed in with my food.\n\nIt then took another year to become comfortable with eating spinach on its own and in larger quantities.\n\n4. **Reassuring myself**. \n\nSimple but weirdly effective; when trying a new food, telling myself it's normal even for those without ARFID, to have strong food preferences and that I don't have to like everything I try. It took pressure off of me when trying something.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nIt takes a lot of time and discipline. There were a lot of tears in the beginning \u2014 and still are when trying the 'scarier' foods. I had to come back to foods that I initially refused to try but tried them successfully later on and enjoyed them! In the beginning it probably took 3-6 months to introduce a new food, and I only focused on getting used to salmon and spinach for the first 6 months. It got much easier to add new foods after that 6 month timeframe. My diet is much less limited and I love all the foods I have added. My experience trying new foods has always gone much better than expected, so it gets less scary the more foods I get used to. However, there are a lot of foods I still cannot and refuse to try at this moment.",
