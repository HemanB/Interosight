      "body": "# From the article:\n\n**Warning: This article contains content about eating disorders that may be distressing for some readers.**\n\nAvoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder, or ARFID, is an eating disorder almost as common as anorexia nervosa in Australia.\n\nBut it's much less understood.\n\nARFID is a newly recognised eating disorder, which became an official diagnosis for adults and children in 2013.\n\nFor 12-year-old Alex\\*, the diagnosis came as a relief after years bouncing around the medical system.\n\nHis mother Jess said Alex was extremely restrictive about what he would eat from a young age. He measured very low on the growth chart and was often unwell.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vrbq8its0abe1.jpeg?width=862&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8f189d1cb878cb69f941991240a914cf7a386c1\n\n  \n*^(Jess says her son Alex was always a restrictive eater.\u00a0(ABC News: Patrick Stone))*\n\n\"I got really worried about it when he was about 12 months \\[old\\] and I started talking to the maternal child health nurse and the GP,\" Jess said.\n\nWhen Alex was four years old, he ate just two foods for a whole year \u2014 two-minute noodles and peanut butter on toast.\n\n\"Everyone kept reassuring me that it was just a phase, and he would grow out of it. I had to push really hard to get any sort of blood tests done,\" Jess said.\n\nTests showed nutritional deficiencies, and Alex has been on medically required supplements ever since.\n\nAfter a lifetime of struggling with food avoidance, Alex is relieved his condition has a name.\n\n\"It was a rollercoaster of emotions trying to figure out what was happening,\" he said.\n\n\"It's definitely made it a lot easier for everyone to understand.\"\n\n# What exactly is ARFID?\n\nBefore being officially recognised in 2013, ARFID symptoms were included in infant and early childhood feeding disorders.\n\nIt's estimated to affect between 1 and 3 per cent of the population.\n\nProfessor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, Jennifer Thomas, is one of the world's leading experts in ARFID.\n\nShe said people with ARFID tended to restrict food for sensory reasons such as texture, smell or taste.\n\n\"Or they're very afraid of something bad happening after they eat \u2026 like vomiting or choking, or that they have a low interest in eating,\" she said.\n\nBy contrast, anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa usually involve a fixation on weight and body image.\n\n\u00a0\"It has to be causing pretty severe problems for the individual to rise to the level of ARFID, as opposed to just normative, picky eating,\" Professor Thomas said.\n\nSymptoms can include being underweight, lack of growth and nutrient deficiencies.\n\nThe diagnostic criteria also includes psycho-social impacts, such as if a person can't play, study, work, or spend time away from home \u2014 meaning it's not limited to those who are underweight.",

It did a really nice job of portraying ARFID in an manner that was non-judgemental and compassionate and I think introduced it quite well for those that are unaware of the condition.\n\nI think there's definitely an opportunity to expand on this- while children with ARFID are starting to achieve some form of recognition from medical professionals and educators (and this is a truly amazing and wonderful thing), it's been a different experience for those of us in adulthood who have grown up knowing we have a genuine condition but never being able to explain what it is (and so often being dismissed as just a 'picky eater').\n\nIf there are ever any plans for the ABC to do a follow up or expansion on this I would be more than willing to help contribute (as someone with ARFID who has had the condition since I was a toddler (now 30), and who lives and has grown up in regional Australia, where support systems are if anything even harder to come across with few, if any, specialists easily accessible).",

Also I\u2019ve had binge eating disorder which was taken care of as well as it could be with vyvanse. So two eating disorders and two neurodiversities. It\u2019s changed over the years from picky eating for most of it, to complete lack of interest in eating and down right hating cooking and food. \n\nI know why, I\u2019m a mom of two (with varying degrees of the same diagnoses as me) and cooking is slowly killing me. I was actually sitting  in my kitchen minutes ago googling \u201ccooking for my family is killing me\u201d \u201carfid adult getting worse with motherhood\u201d etc etc. \n\nI cook 3 dinners a night and don\u2019t eat any of them. By the time i would be able to eat I am so disgusted or exhausted by food I just don\u2019t eat. Being a mother and feeling a biological need to feed my kids but also having no support system, two eating disorders and being physically incapable of being \u201cgood\u201d at all that is necessary to feed people, planning, buying, cooking etc\u2026\n\nI am suffocating. But I don\u2019t get a day off even if we eat out for dinner because I\u2019m still cooking something everyday. I can cook and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m horrible at it, but it is fighting my brain and my body every single day and if I didn\u2019t say it enough times\u2026it is killing me.\n\n\nI rambled and don\u2019t have a point aside to say, if you know a mom like me please help her. Because some days it\u2019s not as hard, but on a night like tonight. I feel like I\u2019m going to have a heart attack thinking about all the food I\u2019m going to cook, then go to bed hungry. \n\nMore research needs to be done on people like me. Late diagnosed, doing her absolute fucking best, but crumbling under the pressure of having these issues, and feeding her children who also have these issues. \n\nAlso yes I\u2019ve done therapy, but the biggest thing someone like me needs is someone to love them enough to be their hype man. I don\u2019t have any family and very few friends who have their own lives and things going on. But feed them, don\u2019t ask them what they want, they don\u2019t know. Go shopping with them, make it silly. Play with their kids while they cook. Cook with them. Cook for them. \n\nI don\u2019t know sorry. It\u2019s a rough time and while I know why I am this way, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that the sun will rise and I will need to feed people.",

It could have saved us a lot of stress.\n\nI\u2019m pursuing a diagnosis for my son, who I think developed fear type ARFID because of his food allergies and fear developed from accidental exposure.(And it\u2019s not even life threatening FAs.)\n\nI knew his behaviour wasn\u2019t normal, and it was affecting his growth and development, but I didn\u2019t know how to articulate it or what to do other than \u201ckeeping trying.\u201d\n\nIt was only by chance around 2019, when I was on a Qantas flight that I found out about it. I was browsing the documentary section and came upon one from NZ, \u201cThe Truth About Fussy Eaters.\u201d \n\nI watched Jake Thompson\u2019s story with ARFID and saw many parallels. It scared the crap out of me, but at least we had an explanation and a name.\n\nWhen it finished, I made my husband stop what he was doing and watch it too.\n\nWhen we returned to Sydney, we asked our GP for advice. She and her colleagues weren\u2019t sure how to proceed. But we received a referral for a paediatric dietitian operating out of the same practice as his immunologist. \n\nShe saw him once in early Jan 2020\u2026 and then COVID hit and everything \u201cnon essential\u201d went into lockdown. There was no Telehealth available to us at that time to continue.\n\nShortly afterwards, my mum died of cancer when my sister and I weren\u2019t able to be there for her.\n\nWe moved back home to Perth a while later, and other more pressing health and financial issues took place. \n\nSo he\u2019s finally having an assessment next week!\ud83e\udd1e \n\nI hope more people are able to get help earlier as a result.",
