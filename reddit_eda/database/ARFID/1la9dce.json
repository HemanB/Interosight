I find trying new foods is best when it\u2019s something you have no idea about. I have autism as well so I can tell the difference between the smallest changes and that can really set me off sometimes so I find going completely different from my normal diet can help get rid of the ick from things I already know I like. \nBut my advice would definitely be to have a support persona with you when you do it, so they can either try it as well, or help get the evil food away if it\u2019s really bad. On the same note, I find it really helps if you know that you like the.. genre? Of food that you\u2019re trying, like if it\u2019s sweet, or spicy, or a kind of chocolate or something, so you know you have a level of comfort to fall back on, like, i really like *insert food of choice* and this is in the same category as that so it might be worth trying it.\n\nIf you\u2019re collection of untried food gets to bad, it\u2019s not worth tormenting yourself over it, you\u2019re allowed to get rid of it, there are countless food banks you can donate to if you can\u2019t handle seeing the stuff in your house anymore. \nI hope any of this helps xx",

I find trying new foods is best when it\u2019s something you have no idea about. I have autism as well so I can tell the difference between the smallest changes and that can really set me off sometimes so I find going completely different from my normal diet can help get rid of the ick from things I already know I like. \nBut my advice would definitely be to have a support persona with you when you do it, so they can either try it as well, or help get the evil food away if it\u2019s really bad. On the same note, I find it really helps if you know that you like the.. genre? Of food that you\u2019re trying, like if it\u2019s sweet, or spicy, or a kind of chocolate or something, so you know you have a level of comfort to fall back on, like, i really like *insert food of choice* and this is in the same category as that so it might be worth trying it.\n\nIf you\u2019re collection of untried food gets to bad, it\u2019s not worth tormenting yourself over it, you\u2019re allowed to get rid of it, there are countless food banks you can donate to if you can\u2019t handle seeing the stuff in your house anymore. \nI hope any of this helps xx",
