  "selftext": "I just joined this sub 5 seconds ago, hopefully this is okay. I\u2019ve struggled my whole life with being \u2018a picky eater\u2019 and thought I\u2019d never find anyone who would accept that. It was always the first thing I\u2019d tell someone before a date so they could decide whether or not they could handle it. I had a lot of people turn me down because they were foodies, and that\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t expect most people to understand. But last year I met a foodie who actually supports me. He\u2019s helped me try all sorts of new foods (slowly as I\u2019ve had issues with people forcing me to in the past). He doesn\u2019t think less of me on the days where all I order is a side of fries. He\u2019s proud of me when I try something new. I never thought I\u2019d find someone like this. I just wanted everyone to know that it may feel like no one without ARFID understands, but some people really surprise you. Don\u2019t assume you don\u2019t deserve all the love and support in the world.",

If you are going out, check the menu beforehand - things like that, will help her anxiety and she will so appreciate your support. Often those with ARFiD need to choose something from the kids menu, make nothing of it, even be the one to suggest she checks that menu out as the food is plainer. Be the one to order it and request an adult sized portion/or 2 kids portions, so she hasn\u2019t got to face being embarrassed. Little things like this are SO helpful.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn\u2019t suggest you try to get her to try different/new things, as she needs to make that decision for herself, and only she will know when she\u2019s reached the point of wanting to change her diet. IF she ever gets to that stage, I thoroughly recommend her having a session with Felix Economakis, he has some amazing results with ARFID in one session. Do msg me if you have more questions!",

If you are going out, check the menu beforehand - things like that, will help her anxiety and she will so appreciate your support. Often those with ARFiD need to choose something from the kids menu, make nothing of it, even be the one to suggest she checks that menu out as the food is plainer. Be the one to order it and request an adult sized portion/or 2 kids portions, so she hasn\u2019t got to face being embarrassed. Little things like this are SO helpful.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn\u2019t suggest you try to get her to try different/new things, as she needs to make that decision for herself, and only she will know when she\u2019s reached the point of wanting to change her diet. IF she ever gets to that stage, I thoroughly recommend her having a session with Felix Economakis, he has some amazing results with ARFID in one session. Do msg me if you have more questions!",

It helps making it an interesting aspect of yourself without being too negative. \nThere will always be people that does not understand and think they know better than you, but talking about it helps to understand how much the person you\u2019re talking with is capable of listening and not judging. It gives more chances of surrounding yourself with good people at the end and leave the bad ones out.  (Sry for errors, not english)",
