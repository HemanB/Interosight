I'm usually pressured into taking some turkey but this year I was vocal about not liking it all the previous years because of how dry it always is. So I straight up told them, \"as long as there's yeast rolls and corn, then I'm solid\", and sure enough they're making a shit ton of yeast rolls and bought corn. \n\nGranted, every Thanksgiving typically goes sour in some way, and I usually end up leaving pretty quickly since there's not much on my plate and because I can't stand listening to politics. At this point I only participate because I'm pressured into attending an \"important\" event, but if it was my way I'd never even pay attention to it. Just Halloween then Christmas.",

Whereas his family is having a traditional meal where  he will only be eating the rolls while I have a full plate and someone will comment on it. It is very frustrating to me, I can't imagine how he or any of you must feel.",
