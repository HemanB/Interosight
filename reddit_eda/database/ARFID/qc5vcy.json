      "body": "Speaking from experience, beating ARFID looks like a mix of both columns that doesn't interfere (as much) with your life. \n\n1. I could definitely still point you to 20+ food items that I wouldn't eat (where did the number 20 come from in this list anyway? Surely that's not in the DSM). But the number of food items I can and do enthusiastically eat has skyrocketed. The aversions don't go away; they are simply fewer, rarer, and frankly they don't bother me anymore. I can confidently say in any setting that I'm not a fan of sausage (for example) and just have something else. Therapy doesn't just help with the actual expanding of dietary palates, but also and more importantly with the confidence to own your choices and preferences without shame in the real world.\n\n2. I'm happy to try new food if it's in a category I've become comfortable with. So I can be excited about trying a new chicken dish, but dread trying any pork dish. It really is amazing how once you've gotten \"exposed\" to different kinds of a food group, the whole category becomes pretty safe. \n\n3. I definitely still gag sometimes when I try a tricky food. That's reaction doesn't go anywhere. It really is just a matter of accepting your gags with grace, handling it delicately, and not beating yourself up over it. Gagging is good because it means I'm still continuing to broaden my palate even now. It's just that some of those experiments don't pay off. \n\n4. You don't owe anybody an explanation for your food aversions. State your preferences and own them. The fourth point about explaining aversions isn't meaningful regardless. \n\n5. On the fifth point, I land squarely in the middle of both descriptions. Now that I've recovered from ARFID, I relish in eating a wide variety of different foods. That said, my wife and many others have noted with good humor that I do have a tendency to eat the same meals for days in a row. Like there was a month I made the exact same cauliflower dish a dozen times. Coming from ARFID, I think that counts as variety! But my poor non-ARFID wife was totally sick of cauliflower by the end of it. I kind of also got sick of cauliflower too -- it just took me much much longer.\n\n6. I still have extreme aversions. They are just rarer and fewer. They also don't bother me or make me feel ashamed anymore. \n\nI hope that gives some of you a sense of what to expect in ARFID recovery. The goal is not to land squarely in the left column, but to find a mix that works for you and lets you go about your life with minjmal food-related disruptions and just be at peace with yourself and how things are for you.",

I don't think it's good to make generalizations like this, my ARFID is the result of dealing with an undiagnosed health issue that caused nausea for many years. I guess I do kind of cut out certain foods (like pasta and bread) that make the health issue worse but I still eat many different foods. when I grocery shop for myself I tend to buy the same things as snacks everytime and I have a favorite meal at every restaurant around me but for the most part I do eat a variety of foods. I struggle with avoiding food altogether (and food related tasks like shopping or fridge cleaning), so I think this still means what I am dealing with is ARFID",

And before that the last time i had eaten eggs (not in a baked good, those seem to be fine) i was an actual toddler. My aversion is so strong and intense people sometimes assume i have a life threatening allergy oops. My partner is not even allowed to cook eggs (hard boiled are okay tho) if i am home because the smell alone is enough to make me uncontrollably gag. Egg is definitely my biggest one, along side black licorice/anise/fennel but luckily that is much less common and i dont run into it very often. \n\nI also have a hard time with sea food, except like the absolute best cuts of fish meat and sometimes shrimp but its so dependent on how it is cooked/prepared\n\nI also struggle so so so much with meat. I can only eat white meat (chicken, turkey, exc) or SOME beef like ground beef if fine but if i eat meat it mostly has to be processed because i swear to god if any part of it is even of 0.01% different texture than the rest i will not be able to eat any of the rest of the meal, even the non meat parts.

That takes a ton of work so congratulations \ud83d\ude01 im slowly getting there too, im absolutely better than i used to be.

I don't recall ever having my feelings hurt by it or feeling insecure about it. I was a pretty confident/arrogant kid so it just didn't bother me (and still doesn't). \n\nBringing food to different social situations hasn't ever been a production where I stand out like, \"The weirdo is here! Everyone watching this? Here I go!\" I mean, I'll eat in the car quick before an event or later on have a snack to hold me over. No one notices. They'll ask why I'm not eating if there's a meal - \"Oh, I'm not hungry. I ate before I came.\" But we all move on with our lives and no one cares.\n\nHidden nutrient deficiencies would be my only motivation at this point to get diagnosed, but I've had lots of blood work throughout the years and there haven't been any abnormalities so far. I will keep that in mind to discuss with my doctor, though.\n\nI guess my question comes down to whether it's worth getting a diagnosis if I don't feel like I'm motivated enough to treat it?\n\nEdit:\nI just wanted to add that I recognize that I'm lucky in that I have enough of a variety of food to at least somewhat sustain myself (pending potential nutritional deficiencies notwithstanding). I understand how debilitating this can be and I'm very grateful that it's never become a medical or mental health issue.",

And before that the last time i had eaten eggs (not in a baked good, those seem to be fine) i was an actual toddler. My aversion is so strong and intense people sometimes assume i have a life threatening allergy oops. My partner is not even allowed to cook eggs (hard boiled are okay tho) if i am home because the smell alone is enough to make me uncontrollably gag. Egg is definitely my biggest one, along side black licorice/anise/fennel but luckily that is much less common and i dont run into it very often. \n\nI also have a hard time with sea food, except like the absolute best cuts of fish meat and sometimes shrimp but its so dependent on how it is cooked/prepared\n\nI also struggle so so so much with meat. I can only eat white meat (chicken, turkey, exc) or SOME beef like ground beef if fine but if i eat meat it mostly has to be processed because i swear to god if any part of it is even of 0.01% different texture than the rest i will not be able to eat any of the rest of the meal, even the non meat parts.

I guess I do kind of cut out certain foods (like pasta and bread) that make the health issue worse but I still eat many different foods.\n\nThat was what you said. How did I misunderstand that? Eating **many different foods** doesn't sound contradictory to **avoidant**/**restrictive food intake** to you?  Am I misunderstanding what you mean by *many* or *different* or *food*? \n\n>for the most part I do eat a variety of foods.\n\nThat was what you said. That is counterintuitive to the most basic meaning of 'restricted food intake.' This isn't one of those ambiguous disorders, it's pretty much what it says on the tin. \n\nPart of being diagnosed with ARFID is a diet that's *so* restrictive, a person persistently fails to meet their nutritional/energy needs. We're talking failure to thrive, anemia, weight loss, feeding tubes... Actual suffering. How are you persistently malnourished eating many different foods? A variety of foods as you said. \n\n \n\n>it's definitely an eating disorder, and it definitely doesn't fit with anorexia.\n\nIt's not an either/or thing. ARFID is not a catch-all for people who don't fit with anorexia, bulimia, pica, etc. You can have an eating disorder without having a specific one. If you don't meet a specific criteria, it's just supposed to be an \"unspecified feeding disorder.\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>also ARFID is common with OCD so maybe my reaction to the chronic nausea has to do with me having OCD too.\n\nOCD's a common comorbidity but it's still two separate conditions. My fridge is disgusting af right now, but that's not ARFID, that's a low disgust threshold. \n\nHaving a low disgust threshold is common with OCD but being generally disgusted with food isn't ARFID. People with autism have restricted food selection, but it isn't ARFID in and of itself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>sorry I don't fit into your understanding of what ARFID is. my psychiatrist is familiar with ARFID I was referred to her specifically because of that.\n\nThis isn't a \"my truth, your truth, my understanding, your understanding\" thing. Do you understand that psychiatric diseases have certain criteria? Much like biological diseases?\n\nObviously, I don't know your business and I'm not telling you not to trust your psychiatrist. You've been worked up and maybe you are persistently malnourished despite eating many different foods. \n\nThey have your details, maybe the undiagnosed health condition causing your chronic nausea for many years was insignificant so it made sense to your psychiatrist to disregard it. Who knows? \n\nI only replied because you seemed genuinely confused by the OP's graphic. My understanding of ARFID is pretty spot on. \n\nYou can be defensive, you can stay confused, but why join an ARFID group and then be like, \"You shouldn't make generalisations about Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder causing avoidant/restrictive food intake because I eat a variety of foods and my restricted diet is due to a condition I had that caused chronic nausea and maybe OCD. Forget the international diagnostic standard, trust my understanding instead even though I'm a bit confused as to why you all think ARFID involves having a restricted diet.\"",

One of my psych profs ran me through a working draft of it some time in 2011 or 2012 because we'd had a retreat/lunch/seminar type thing and he'd noticed my peculiar eating habits. \n\nI can't fully paint a picture for you of what it's like being very ND studying medicine or to have your private life be turned into a teachable moment in a classroom setting, but it's unforgettable and I don't have to look it up.\n\nWhat is this even in response to? These days I'm actively trying to not even think very much about med. Why are we talking about the dsm? Isn't it publicly available? They revised it recently iirc. You can get a copy and check it out. The only specific thing I remember them changing is that the onset didn't have to be before 5 or 6.\n\nWith most conditions in the DSM, you have to rule out that it's attributable to other bio, psycho or social situations. For example, you don't diagnose people who are grieving the death of a loved one with depression, you don't diagnose someone with anxiety if they have an ongoing cocaine addiction problem. If there does happen to be another condition in play, then it needs to be in excess of what you'd typically expect from the condition.\n\nHow it works is that a GI issue is a GI issue. Someone with stomach cancer for example would meet much of the criteria for Arfid. People on chemo in general. The kind of chemo that causes nausea. Many patients have a severely restricted intake, but you don't diagnose every chemo patient with Arfid as a comorbidity because it's not in excess of what you'd expect from someone on chemotherapy even though they have the weight loss, nutritional deficits, etc. \n\nAnd in this situation, it is always very difficult for a psychiatrist to measure what is in excess of a typical medical condition. They don't usually tell people, \"hey, I know you have a ulcer and eating is painful so you're restricting yourself to a bland diet, but I feel like your diet is excessively restrictive so I'm going to diagnose you with an eating disorder and you're going to have psychotherapy twice a week to work on that.\" \n\nOf course, some will because money, and it's a judgement call, and this leads to all the articles you see about psychiatric over-diagnosis and over-medication but it's very difficult to have a reliable measure of what is or is not \"excessive.\" Which is why I've personally come to believe that psych is at the ass end of science. I won't go full \"It's a pseudoscience\" but it's definitely the least scientific of the medical fields. \n\nSomeone with a diagnosable GI condition rarely goes to a psychiatrist first up, but if they do, the psychiatrist is supposed to refer them out to a gastrointerologist or other relevant party and only after ruling out medical/surgical causes are they supposed to attribute disordered eating to a psychiatric condition.\n\nThink of it as a hierarchical structure, surgical>=medical>>>>psychiatric.\n\nFor a better comparison, think of someone who has blackouts. You're supposed to rule out seizure disorders, tumours, etc before you make a diagnosis of a panic disorder. This does not mean you can't have a panic disorder and epilepsy at the same time, but the blackouts would have to be in excess of the seizure disorder. You can measure a seizure, you can know a patient's triggers, so in this case you can get an idea of what is in excess of this thing you can measure, but a person's pain or discomfort from a GI condition cannot be objectively put to a scale. You can't tell someone with stomach cancer that they should eat more regardless. But if you remove the stipulation of excess, then it becomes a meaningless catch-all term that will be removed by DSM VI because everyone with a bad flu and a sore throat has Arfid. Or they'll add a scale and variants like severe Arfid, mild Arfid, developmental vs transient Arfid...\n\nThere are situations where it might be applicable. People with diabetes perhaps who go full carnivore/caveman out of fear, but this person isn't going to psychiatrist for their diabetes, and the endocrinologist isn't likely to refer their diabetic patient to a psychiatrist so the psychiatrist can convince them to eat more carbs and sugary snacks...\n\nWhat context are you even talking about??? Who are these patients getting medical and psychiatric diagnoses for the same condition? Honestly, I've only actually seen this with doctor-shoppers who essentially *want* to be diagnosed with an eating disorder and go seek out a psychiatrist on their own while leaving out mention of the GI condition.",

      "body": "All I'm saying is that it's part of the diagnostic process that you need to rule out other medical, surgical or psychiatric conditions causing the food avoidance or restriction before you say a person has ARFID.\n\nPOTS has a lot of gastrointestinal symptoms that would cause you to restrict your diet. It isn't cured by beta blockers, it's just managing your symptoms, so you still have an ongoing concurrent medical condition that explains your food issues.\n\nPeople with diverticulitis, Crohn's, stomach ulcerations, alcoholics with liver failure, gall bladder problems, people who've been on chemo... They all have restrictions to their diet or reasons to avoid food based on their experience with their conditions, and even after they are treated for the condition might continue with the food restriction because after a long enough time a person gets conditioned to associate food with the negative symptoms they experienced. \n\nI just don't get why they'd attribute your food issues to ARFID when there's a clear cut condition that covers it already. I don't see how they'd say you are overreacting to POTS. How do you look past a treated but still ongoing condition?  How can someone decide that your feelings about food is excessive after it went untreated for so long? Seven years of daily vomiting... POTS is pretty easy to diagnose. It's been around since when, the 1930s?\n\nI'm actually confused now. Did they misdiagnose you with panic attacks and anxiety due to the OCD diagnosis instead of carrying out any kind of investigations? It's the POTS diagnosis and beta blocker treatment recent?\n\nIt's entirely your business and your psychiatrist's if they think that your eating behaviour is excessively avoidant, even in the context of having POTS.  They probably have a reason to think so but it's just weird to me, but I don't know so it doesn't matter. I'm just saying. \n\nIt's like hearing someone say they just got off years of chemo or had nine months of the worst morning sickness but their doctor thinks they should have already bounced back to normal eating behaviours because the chronic nausea is in the past and they should be over it, so now they have ARFID. \n\n>I usually appreciate this subreddit because I am able to focus on the common experiences I have with others that have ARFID. but the tone of a lot of posts lately sounds a lot like gatekeeping\n\nThe point of the group I would think is for people to talk about common experiences, but if the tone sounds exclusionary, it's not because people have some agenda to make people feel like they don't belong, it's because there's an internationally recognised criteria that excludes a person from having ARFID. \n\nIt took 12 or 13 years for DSM 5 to come out. Before that, we were just lumped in with 'feeding disorders of infancy' and 'Eating disorders not otherwise specified.' But now that it *has* been specified, people who experience the common symptomology have a place to just share their experiences with others who've been through the same thing.\n\nI mean, if I post about the abuse I had to go through being force-fed repeatedly because paediatricians told my parents they needed to go tough on me or I'd die, can you relate to that? In early school, a nun made me eat under a cross because she thought my not wanting to eat was a clear sign of evil at work. Do you know how awkward catholic school gets when you throw up in the presence of a cross and you have sunken eyes and look like a zombie? \n\nI was in my fifth year in college before ARFID became a diagnosis. And maybe I do sound like an asshole, and I'm not trying to say that everyone's experience with ARFID is some dark tale of horror, but my experience, and the experience many people have with ARFID is a very different experience to having PoTS or a stomach ulcer or being on chemo or anything else.\n\nPeople here can't take a beta blocker to manage the cause of their nausea. We've never been able to point to any condition or lab results and say \"This is why I vomit.\"\n\nSay, if I was looking for data on safe foods for people with ARFID and trying to find the pattern. IDK, maybe someone is building an app for safe food recommendations, and some ARFID people tick off French fries, white bread, pasta, baked meats, whatever... and then people with POTS and peptic ulcers and post-cholecystectomies etc, add in their very different variety of foods, do you see how it becomes meaningless to the people with the standard version of ARFID?\n\nDo you see the point I'm making? I'm not saying you don't have disordered eating, I don't know you, but if I tell you that I can relate to your experience with POTS because I have 30+ years of nausea to the point where I no longer have a sleep-wake cycle because I've been on anti-emetics for decades, and I also have anxiety and OCD and low blood pressure and autonomic dysregulation across the board, that doesn't mean I have PoTS, does it. Because there's a criteria for having PoTs. \n\nIf I go in for a tilt test, etc and don't meet the criteria for PoTS, then I don't have PoTS. But we spend 13 years on a manual for psychiatric conditions and yet everything turns into a subjective \"well, my version of X is this.\"\n\nJust last week, we had dyspraxia awareness week, and the whole thing was flooded about how dyspraxia gives you extra empathy as if we become X-men or something. \"Fantastic dyspraxics.\" \n\nHell, maybe I'm just a frustrated asshole because psychiatry is at the ass end of medicine and anything goes because there's no empirical evidence of anything. But it's supposed to mean something. ARFID is not supposed to be an adjunct, is what I'm saying.\n\nIt's not you, it's just you reminding me of the pseudo-science of it all. Gatekeeping, lol. I'm not the ARFID police. I'm not the DSM police. We live in an age of anxiety songs on tiktok...  The gate has always been wide open for psychiatric conditions. My vet thinks my cat has PTSD. It's whatever at this point.",

Am I misunderstanding what you mean by *many* or *different* or *food*? \n\n>for the most part I do eat a variety of foods.\n\nThat was what you said. That is counterintuitive to the most basic meaning of 'restricted food intake.' This isn't one of those ambiguous disorders, it's pretty much what it says on the tin. \n\nPart of being diagnosed with ARFID is a diet that's *so* restrictive, a person persistently fails to meet their nutritional/energy needs. We're talking failure to thrive, anemia, weight loss, feeding tubes... Actual suffering. How are you persistently malnourished eating many different foods? A variety of foods as you said. \n\n \n\n>it's definitely an eating disorder, and it definitely doesn't fit with anorexia.\n\nIt's not an either/or thing. ARFID is not a catch-all for people who don't fit with anorexia, bulimia, pica, etc. You can have an eating disorder without having a specific one. If you don't meet a specific criteria, it's just supposed to be an \"unspecified feeding disorder.\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>also ARFID is common with OCD so maybe my reaction to the chronic nausea has to do with me having OCD too.\n\nOCD's a common comorbidity but it's still two separate conditions. My fridge is disgusting af right now, but that's not ARFID, that's a low disgust threshold. \n\nHaving a low disgust threshold is common with OCD but being generally disgusted with food isn't ARFID. People with autism have restricted food selection, but it isn't ARFID in and of itself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>sorry I don't fit into your understanding of what ARFID is. my psychiatrist is familiar with ARFID I was referred to her specifically because of that.\n\nThis isn't a \"my truth, your truth, my understanding, your understanding\" thing. Do you understand that psychiatric diseases have certain criteria? Much like biological diseases?\n\nObviously, I don't know your business and I'm not telling you not to trust your psychiatrist. You've been worked up and maybe you are persistently malnourished despite eating many different foods. \n\nThey have your details, maybe the undiagnosed health condition causing your chronic nausea for many years was insignificant so it made sense to your psychiatrist to disregard it. Who knows? \n\nI only replied because you seemed genuinely confused by the OP's graphic. My understanding of ARFID is pretty spot on. \n\nYou can be defensive, you can stay confused, but why join an ARFID group and then be like, \"You shouldn't make generalisations about Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder causing avoidant/restrictive food intake because I eat a variety of foods and my restricted diet is due to a condition I had that caused chronic nausea and maybe OCD. Forget the international diagnostic standard, trust my understanding instead even though I'm a bit confused as to why you all think ARFID involves having a restricted diet.\"",

I usually appreciate this subreddit because I am able to focus on the common experiences I have with others that have ARFID. but the tone of a lot of posts lately sounds a lot like gatekeeping, I think many people would see this post and interpret it as telling them they don't really have ARFID, and I think that could be very harmful. but you're right that my comment was kind of unnecessary I could have just quietly left the sub, which I will now.  \ud83d\udc4b",

Am I misunderstanding what you mean by *many* or *different* or *food*? \n\n>for the most part I do eat a variety of foods.\n\nThat was what you said. That is counterintuitive to the most basic meaning of 'restricted food intake.' This isn't one of those ambiguous disorders, it's pretty much what it says on the tin. \n\nPart of being diagnosed with ARFID is a diet that's *so* restrictive, a person persistently fails to meet their nutritional/energy needs. We're talking failure to thrive, anemia, weight loss, feeding tubes... Actual suffering. How are you persistently malnourished eating many different foods? A variety of foods as you said. \n\n \n\n>it's definitely an eating disorder, and it definitely doesn't fit with anorexia.\n\nIt's not an either/or thing. ARFID is not a catch-all for people who don't fit with anorexia, bulimia, pica, etc. You can have an eating disorder without having a specific one. If you don't meet a specific criteria, it's just supposed to be an \"unspecified feeding disorder.\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>also ARFID is common with OCD so maybe my reaction to the chronic nausea has to do with me having OCD too.\n\nOCD's a common comorbidity but it's still two separate conditions. My fridge is disgusting af right now, but that's not ARFID, that's a low disgust threshold. \n\nHaving a low disgust threshold is common with OCD but being generally disgusted with food isn't ARFID. People with autism have restricted food selection, but it isn't ARFID in and of itself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>sorry I don't fit into your understanding of what ARFID is. my psychiatrist is familiar with ARFID I was referred to her specifically because of that.\n\nThis isn't a \"my truth, your truth, my understanding, your understanding\" thing. Do you understand that psychiatric diseases have certain criteria? Much like biological diseases?\n\nObviously, I don't know your business and I'm not telling you not to trust your psychiatrist. You've been worked up and maybe you are persistently malnourished despite eating many different foods. \n\nThey have your details, maybe the undiagnosed health condition causing your chronic nausea for many years was insignificant so it made sense to your psychiatrist to disregard it. Who knows? \n\nI only replied because you seemed genuinely confused by the OP's graphic. My understanding of ARFID is pretty spot on. \n\nYou can be defensive, you can stay confused, but why join an ARFID group and then be like, \"You shouldn't make generalisations about Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder causing avoidant/restrictive food intake because I eat a variety of foods and my restricted diet is due to a condition I had that caused chronic nausea and maybe OCD. Forget the international diagnostic standard, trust my understanding instead even though I'm a bit confused as to why you all think ARFID involves having a restricted diet.\"",

I usually appreciate this subreddit because I am able to focus on the common experiences I have with others that have ARFID. but the tone of a lot of posts lately sounds a lot like gatekeeping, I think many people would see this post and interpret it as telling them they don't really have ARFID, and I think that could be very harmful. but you're right that my comment was kind of unnecessary I could have just quietly left the sub, which I will now.  \ud83d\udc4b",

          "body": "All I'm saying is that it's part of the diagnostic process that you need to rule out other medical, surgical or psychiatric conditions causing the food avoidance or restriction before you say a person has ARFID.\n\nPOTS has a lot of gastrointestinal symptoms that would cause you to restrict your diet. It isn't cured by beta blockers, it's just managing your symptoms, so you still have an ongoing concurrent medical condition that explains your food issues.\n\nPeople with diverticulitis, Crohn's, stomach ulcerations, alcoholics with liver failure, gall bladder problems, people who've been on chemo... They all have restrictions to their diet or reasons to avoid food based on their experience with their conditions, and even after they are treated for the condition might continue with the food restriction because after a long enough time a person gets conditioned to associate food with the negative symptoms they experienced. \n\nI just don't get why they'd attribute your food issues to ARFID when there's a clear cut condition that covers it already. I don't see how they'd say you are overreacting to POTS. How do you look past a treated but still ongoing condition?  How can someone decide that your feelings about food is excessive after it went untreated for so long? Seven years of daily vomiting... POTS is pretty easy to diagnose. It's been around since when, the 1930s?\n\nI'm actually confused now. Did they misdiagnose you with panic attacks and anxiety due to the OCD diagnosis instead of carrying out any kind of investigations? It's the POTS diagnosis and beta blocker treatment recent?\n\nIt's entirely your business and your psychiatrist's if they think that your eating behaviour is excessively avoidant, even in the context of having POTS.  They probably have a reason to think so but it's just weird to me, but I don't know so it doesn't matter. I'm just saying. \n\nIt's like hearing someone say they just got off years of chemo or had nine months of the worst morning sickness but their doctor thinks they should have already bounced back to normal eating behaviours because the chronic nausea is in the past and they should be over it, so now they have ARFID. \n\n>I usually appreciate this subreddit because I am able to focus on the common experiences I have with others that have ARFID. but the tone of a lot of posts lately sounds a lot like gatekeeping\n\nThe point of the group I would think is for people to talk about common experiences, but if the tone sounds exclusionary, it's not because people have some agenda to make people feel like they don't belong, it's because there's an internationally recognised criteria that excludes a person from having ARFID. \n\nIt took 12 or 13 years for DSM 5 to come out. Before that, we were just lumped in with 'feeding disorders of infancy' and 'Eating disorders not otherwise specified.' But now that it *has* been specified, people who experience the common symptomology have a place to just share their experiences with others who've been through the same thing.\n\nI mean, if I post about the abuse I had to go through being force-fed repeatedly because paediatricians told my parents they needed to go tough on me or I'd die, can you relate to that? In early school, a nun made me eat under a cross because she thought my not wanting to eat was a clear sign of evil at work. Do you know how awkward catholic school gets when you throw up in the presence of a cross and you have sunken eyes and look like a zombie? \n\nI was in my fifth year in college before ARFID became a diagnosis. And maybe I do sound like an asshole, and I'm not trying to say that everyone's experience with ARFID is some dark tale of horror, but my experience, and the experience many people have with ARFID is a very different experience to having PoTS or a stomach ulcer or being on chemo or anything else.\n\nPeople here can't take a beta blocker to manage the cause of their nausea. We've never been able to point to any condition or lab results and say \"This is why I vomit.\"\n\nSay, if I was looking for data on safe foods for people with ARFID and trying to find the pattern. IDK, maybe someone is building an app for safe food recommendations, and some ARFID people tick off French fries, white bread, pasta, baked meats, whatever... and then people with POTS and peptic ulcers and post-cholecystectomies etc, add in their very different variety of foods, do you see how it becomes meaningless to the people with the standard version of ARFID?\n\nDo you see the point I'm making? I'm not saying you don't have disordered eating, I don't know you, but if I tell you that I can relate to your experience with POTS because I have 30+ years of nausea to the point where I no longer have a sleep-wake cycle because I've been on anti-emetics for decades, and I also have anxiety and OCD and low blood pressure and autonomic dysregulation across the board, that doesn't mean I have PoTS, does it. Because there's a criteria for having PoTs. \n\nIf I go in for a tilt test, etc and don't meet the criteria for PoTS, then I don't have PoTS. But we spend 13 years on a manual for psychiatric conditions and yet everything turns into a subjective \"well, my version of X is this.\"\n\nJust last week, we had dyspraxia awareness week, and the whole thing was flooded about how dyspraxia gives you extra empathy as if we become X-men or something. \"Fantastic dyspraxics.\" \n\nHell, maybe I'm just a frustrated asshole because psychiatry is at the ass end of medicine and anything goes because there's no empirical evidence of anything. But it's supposed to mean something. ARFID is not supposed to be an adjunct, is what I'm saying.\n\nIt's not you, it's just you reminding me of the pseudo-science of it all. Gatekeeping, lol. I'm not the ARFID police. I'm not the DSM police. We live in an age of anxiety songs on tiktok...  The gate has always been wide open for psychiatric conditions. My vet thinks my cat has PTSD.

Lots of them don't.  Why was that so hard to say? \n\nWhy all the quibbling and accusations about gatekeeping and attacking the OP and other people in the sub for being exclusionary when you damn well know that your psychiatrist didn't take POTS into consideration when he diagnosed you with ARFID because **you weren't diagnosed with POTS as yet**? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>maybe I'm just a frustrated asshole\n\nI take that back. Frustrated, yes. Asshole, no. You deliberately made it seem as though your psychiatrist knew you had POTS at the point in time when he diagnosed you with ARFID. \n\nYou join a group and complain to people with ARFID that their posts about ARFID don't include your experience with PoTS, and I tell you that if POTS is causing your symptoms, then that excludes ARFID by the definition of ARFID, and you say that your psychiatrist thinks you have ARFID *in spite of* POTS, and then the story changes so now your ARFID was diagnosed *without* the knowledge of your POTS...  \n\nGatekeeping. Lol. It's literally in the group rules that any form of disordered eating is allowed, but it's also in the rules that it's supposed to be a safe place so maybe don't go on about fixing your nausea with beta blockers in a group for people who don't have that option because their symptoms aren't caused by a medical condition that they can be treated for? Maybe don't just throw out your uncanny ability to eat a bunch of foods in a group where people have a handful of foods they rotate. \n\nAnd then, worse, accusing people with ARFID of being gatekeepers because they're not including the Caused-By-POTS variant of the disease in their posts? \n\nOf course, you're not going to be able to relate, and you very well know why you can't relate but you're going to pretend to be confused and then get defensive and accuse people of not understanding a condition they've had all their lives because they have some kind of mean agenda to exclude you... \n\nThanks for finally telling me the truth though, (I'm just assuming there's no more to this). The bizarreness of your earlier story had me genuinely confused for so long, I was actually starting to wonder if your therapist was working with some kind of DSM 6 Pro Plus Ultra edition where they dropped the part about excluding medical conditions.\n\nAll you had to say was that they didn't know. That was it. Riddle solved.",

I think you'll find I'm not the only one with an ARFID diagnosis that struggles with eating enough but does not struggle with always eating the same foods. that is not a requirement for having ARFID and I thought that posting this image with the flair do I have ARFID was very misleading. I wasn't attacking anyone or complaining that my POTS experience was not included in the sub, I was pointing out that the way this was presented could be very unhelpful for people still wondering if they have ARFID. you were the one to come at me pretending you know more than medical professionals and making assumptions about my experience. and now for some reason you're yelling at me because those assumptions turned out wrong? leave me alone lol, I already left the sub",

Much as how it shouldn't be diagnosed if the food intake restriction is primarily due to any other reason like poverty, food availability, food allergies, anorexia, bullimia, autism,  culture/tradition...\n\nIt's only been in the DSM as of the last version and your psychiatrist might not be thoroughly familiar with the condition. Many aren't in my experience. ARFID awareness isn't very high even among medical professionals and for many people, it's synonymous to \"picky eating.\"",

I guess I do kind of cut out certain foods (like pasta and bread) that make the health issue worse but I still eat many different foods.\n\nThat was what you said. How did I misunderstand that? Eating **many different foods** doesn't sound contradictory to **avoidant**/**restrictive food intake** to you?  Am I misunderstanding what you mean by *many* or *different* or *food*? \n\n>for the most part I do eat a variety of foods.\n\nThat was what you said. That is counterintuitive to the most basic meaning of 'restricted food intake.' This isn't one of those ambiguous disorders, it's pretty much what it says on the tin. \n\nPart of being diagnosed with ARFID is a diet that's *so* restrictive, a person persistently fails to meet their nutritional/energy needs. We're talking failure to thrive, anemia, weight loss, feeding tubes... Actual suffering. How are you persistently malnourished eating many different foods? A variety of foods as you said. \n\n \n\n>it's definitely an eating disorder, and it definitely doesn't fit with anorexia.\n\nIt's not an either/or thing. ARFID is not a catch-all for people who don't fit with anorexia, bulimia, pica, etc. You can have an eating disorder without having a specific one. If you don't meet a specific criteria, it's just supposed to be an \"unspecified feeding disorder.\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>also ARFID is common with OCD so maybe my reaction to the chronic nausea has to do with me having OCD too.\n\nOCD's a common comorbidity but it's still two separate conditions. My fridge is disgusting af right now, but that's not ARFID, that's a low disgust threshold. \n\nHaving a low disgust threshold is common with OCD but being generally disgusted with food isn't ARFID. People with autism have restricted food selection, but it isn't ARFID in and of itself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>sorry I don't fit into your understanding of what ARFID is. my psychiatrist is familiar with ARFID I was referred to her specifically because of that.\n\nThis isn't a \"my truth, your truth, my understanding, your understanding\" thing. Do you understand that psychiatric diseases have certain criteria? Much like biological diseases?\n\nObviously, I don't know your business and I'm not telling you not to trust your psychiatrist. You've been worked up and maybe you are persistently malnourished despite eating many different foods. \n\nThey have your details, maybe the undiagnosed health condition causing your chronic nausea for many years was insignificant so it made sense to your psychiatrist to disregard it. Who knows? \n\nI only replied because you seemed genuinely confused by the OP's graphic. My understanding of ARFID is pretty spot on. \n\nYou can be defensive, you can stay confused, but why join an ARFID group and then be like, \"You shouldn't make generalisations about Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder causing avoidant/restrictive food intake because I eat a variety of foods and my restricted diet is due to a condition I had that caused chronic nausea and maybe OCD. Forget the international diagnostic standard, trust my understanding instead even though I'm a bit confused as to why you all think ARFID involves having a restricted diet.\"",

          "body": ">Actual suffering. How are you persistently malnourished eating many different foods?\n\ndo you hear yourself? screw you lol, it's very rude to tell someone that their diagnosis doesn't fit and that if they *actually* had their diagnosis then they would know *actual suffering*. not that I need to prove to you that I am *actually* suffering, but I assure you, my eating disorder has impacted my physical health and my ability to keep up with my daily life. it has shaped my life choices and the relationships I am able to maintain.\n\nif I am avoiding food altogether that sounds like ARFID. this week I am struggling to eat more than once a day, just to give you an idea of where I am in my recovery. usually what I eat is a variety of foods, but making myself eat anything at all is my problem, my brain will do just about anything to avoid eating but it's less about what i'm eating and more about having to put food in my body at all.\n\n>maybe the undiagnosed health condition causing your chronic nausea for many years was insignificant\n\nThe undiagnosed health condition was POTS btw. the major symptoms I experienced were nausea due to tachycardia and an inability to feel hunger unless I was lying down (because of an improvement in circulation when I lie down). it was not insignificant to me as I was throwing up daily for 7 or so years and only experienced hunger when lying down to go to sleep. as a result, now that I am on a beta blocker that controls these symptoms, I still have a fear of eating, despite the foods that I do manage to eat being a wide variety.\n\nI am defensive that's my bad. I usually appreciate this subreddit because I am able to focus on the common experiences I have with others that have ARFID. but the tone of a lot of posts lately sounds a lot like gatekeeping, I think many people would see this post and interpret it as telling them they don't really have ARFID, and I think that could be very harmful. but you're right that my comment was kind of unnecessary I could have just quietly left the sub, which I will now.  \ud83d\udc4b",

          "body": "All I'm saying is that it's part of the diagnostic process that you need to rule out other medical, surgical or psychiatric conditions causing the food avoidance or restriction before you say a person has ARFID.\n\nPOTS has a lot of gastrointestinal symptoms that would cause you to restrict your diet. It isn't cured by beta blockers, it's just managing your symptoms, so you still have an ongoing concurrent medical condition that explains your food issues.\n\nPeople with diverticulitis, Crohn's, stomach ulcerations, alcoholics with liver failure, gall bladder problems, people who've been on chemo... They all have restrictions to their diet or reasons to avoid food based on their experience with their conditions, and even after they are treated for the condition might continue with the food restriction because after a long enough time a person gets conditioned to associate food with the negative symptoms they experienced. \n\nI just don't get why they'd attribute your food issues to ARFID when there's a clear cut condition that covers it already. I don't see how they'd say you are overreacting to POTS. How do you look past a treated but still ongoing condition?  How can someone decide that your feelings about food is excessive after it went untreated for so long? Seven years of daily vomiting... POTS is pretty easy to diagnose. It's been around since when, the 1930s?\n\nI'm actually confused now. Did they misdiagnose you with panic attacks and anxiety due to the OCD diagnosis instead of carrying out any kind of investigations? It's the POTS diagnosis and beta blocker treatment recent?\n\nIt's entirely your business and your psychiatrist's if they think that your eating behaviour is excessively avoidant, even in the context of having POTS.  They probably have a reason to think so but it's just weird to me, but I don't know so it doesn't matter. I'm just saying. \n\nIt's like hearing someone say they just got off years of chemo or had nine months of the worst morning sickness but their doctor thinks they should have already bounced back to normal eating behaviours because the chronic nausea is in the past and they should be over it, so now they have ARFID. \n\n>I usually appreciate this subreddit because I am able to focus on the common experiences I have with others that have ARFID. but the tone of a lot of posts lately sounds a lot like gatekeeping\n\nThe point of the group I would think is for people to talk about common experiences, but if the tone sounds exclusionary, it's not because people have some agenda to make people feel like they don't belong, it's because there's an internationally recognised criteria that excludes a person from having ARFID. \n\nIt took 12 or 13 years for DSM 5 to come out. Before that, we were just lumped in with 'feeding disorders of infancy' and 'Eating disorders not otherwise specified.' But now that it *has* been specified, people who experience the common symptomology have a place to just share their experiences with others who've been through the same thing.\n\nI mean, if I post about the abuse I had to go through being force-fed repeatedly because paediatricians told my parents they needed to go tough on me or I'd die, can you relate to that? In early school, a nun made me eat under a cross because she thought my not wanting to eat was a clear sign of evil at work. Do you know how awkward catholic school gets when you throw up in the presence of a cross and you have sunken eyes and look like a zombie? \n\nI was in my fifth year in college before ARFID became a diagnosis. And maybe I do sound like an asshole, and I'm not trying to say that everyone's experience with ARFID is some dark tale of horror, but my experience, and the experience many people have with ARFID is a very different experience to having PoTS or a stomach ulcer or being on chemo or anything else.\n\nPeople here can't take a beta blocker to manage the cause of their nausea. We've never been able to point to any condition or lab results and say \"This is why I vomit.\"\n\nSay, if I was looking for data on safe foods for people with ARFID and trying to find the pattern. IDK, maybe someone is building an app for safe food recommendations, and some ARFID people tick off French fries, white bread, pasta, baked meats, whatever... and then people with POTS and peptic ulcers and post-cholecystectomies etc, add in their very different variety of foods, do you see how it becomes meaningless to the people with the standard version of ARFID?\n\nDo you see the point I'm making? I'm not saying you don't have disordered eating, I don't know you, but if I tell you that I can relate to your experience with POTS because I have 30+ years of nausea to the point where I no longer have a sleep-wake cycle because I've been on anti-emetics for decades, and I also have anxiety and OCD and low blood pressure and autonomic dysregulation across the board, that doesn't mean I have PoTS, does it. Because there's a criteria for having PoTs. \n\nIf I go in for a tilt test, etc and don't meet the criteria for PoTS, then I don't have PoTS. But we spend 13 years on a manual for psychiatric conditions and yet everything turns into a subjective \"well, my version of X is this.\"\n\nJust last week, we had dyspraxia awareness week, and the whole thing was flooded about how dyspraxia gives you extra empathy as if we become X-men or something. \"Fantastic dyspraxics.\" \n\nHell, maybe I'm just a frustrated asshole because psychiatry is at the ass end of medicine and anything goes because there's no empirical evidence of anything. But it's supposed to mean something. ARFID is not supposed to be an adjunct, is what I'm saying.\n\nIt's not you, it's just you reminding me of the pseudo-science of it all. Gatekeeping, lol. I'm not the ARFID police. I'm not the DSM police. We live in an age of anxiety songs on tiktok...  The gate has always been wide open for psychiatric conditions. My vet thinks my cat has PTSD.

Lots of them don't.  Why was that so hard to say? \n\nWhy all the quibbling and accusations about gatekeeping and attacking the OP and other people in the sub for being exclusionary when you damn well know that your psychiatrist didn't take POTS into consideration when he diagnosed you with ARFID because **you weren't diagnosed with POTS as yet**? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>maybe I'm just a frustrated asshole\n\nI take that back. Frustrated, yes. Asshole, no. You deliberately made it seem as though your psychiatrist knew you had POTS at the point in time when he diagnosed you with ARFID. \n\nYou join a group and complain to people with ARFID that their posts about ARFID don't include your experience with PoTS, and I tell you that if POTS is causing your symptoms, then that excludes ARFID by the definition of ARFID, and you say that your psychiatrist thinks you have ARFID *in spite of* POTS, and then the story changes so now your ARFID was diagnosed *without* the knowledge of your POTS...  \n\nGatekeeping. Lol. It's literally in the group rules that any form of disordered eating is allowed, but it's also in the rules that it's supposed to be a safe place so maybe don't go on about fixing your nausea with beta blockers in a group for people who don't have that option because their symptoms aren't caused by a medical condition that they can be treated for? Maybe don't just throw out your uncanny ability to eat a bunch of foods in a group where people have a handful of foods they rotate. \n\nAnd then, worse, accusing people with ARFID of being gatekeepers because they're not including the Caused-By-POTS variant of the disease in their posts? \n\nOf course, you're not going to be able to relate, and you very well know why you can't relate but you're going to pretend to be confused and then get defensive and accuse people of not understanding a condition they've had all their lives because they have some kind of mean agenda to exclude you... \n\nThanks for finally telling me the truth though, (I'm just assuming there's no more to this). The bizarreness of your earlier story had me genuinely confused for so long, I was actually starting to wonder if your therapist was working with some kind of DSM 6 Pro Plus Ultra edition where they dropped the part about excluding medical conditions.\n\nAll you had to say was that they didn't know. That was it. Riddle solved.",
