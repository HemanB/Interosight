I'm glad to see that other people can relate.\n\nAs I've grown up, I've learnt to accept myself. I think its only rational that we explain to people, if we must, of our condition, to the end that they may understand. Though, if they are unaware, how they might think of us doesn't matter. Anyway, we likely feel like people are judging us but that is hardly the case. We cannot read people's minds - which is a good thing. So long as we don't have proof of judgment, we can say that there is none (even if they are in their mind)",
