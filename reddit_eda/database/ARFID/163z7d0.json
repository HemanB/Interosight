  "selftext": "Sorry if this isn\u2019t allowed, feel free to delete. But I realized I probably am not the only one and wonder if it could ARFID related. I am a f dating a m, I\u2019m bi but haven\u2019t been with any women sexually, only dates. I\u2019m with my life partner and I love him, I could list many many reasons why I love him but l save you the mush. Something I\u2019ve always struggled with though is oral. I do it, mostly because he does it for me, and I want his needs to be met and for him to be satisfied. I\u2019ve NEVER liked it though, and even though I\u2019m bi, the thought of doing it for a woman scares me. I find beauty in sex, BUT people be tasting weird. Sweaty, musty, Metallicy, etc, as a vagina owner myself I\u2019m not sure I could get down with the many flavors. My guy is very clean, hygienic, it\u2019s not like he tastes terrible, it\u2019s just \u2026gross. And when there is pre-c or c it\u2019s worse. I CANNOT WITH THE SALTY. It\u2019s just\u2026.it\u2019s a flavor thing? I know it\u2019s not supposed to taste like cake but I don\u2019t like the taste of skin, especially skin that\u2019s trapped in undies and pants all day. To be fair I\u2019m also a germaphobe, and a bit of an obsessive bather but I can\u2019t be alone in this right?  Also, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m with my forever partner, I know I won\u2019t have yo worry about this, but I don\u2019t like the fact that if I were with a woman I\u2019d have troubles pleasing her and I would hate that. Is this also a problem for you? Or do we just be loving oral. Like my guy and so many other people say they love the natural taste of whatever your body is that day but like\u2026ew?  Tell me I\u2019m not alone in this boat please",

My husband doesn\u2019t care either way and would never force me, which I think has to do with why I like it sometimes (my arfid was caused by a combination of being born with my umbilical cord around my throat and a father that force fed me), I feel comfortable and know he\u2019s not going to judge me if I randomly need to stop. He also handled being thrown up on super gracefully lmao. \n\nAll that said, he would be perfectly happy and satisfied if I never did oral again. If you really can\u2019t handle it or even just don\u2019t want to, your partner should respect that. Relationships realistically aren\u2019t 50-50 all the time and that\u2019s okay. If you DO want to do it, have him shower directly before and see if that makes it easier for you and remember you don\u2019t need to finish him that way, we mainly use it as foreplay and hardly ever end sex that way.",

I am fond of a brand called Aloe Cadabra in peppermint. But there are loads of flavors out there. \n\nUltimately it comes down to communication with your partner. There are so many ways to enjoy each other\u2019s bodies, and if your partner truly loves you, he wouldn\u2019t want you to suffer just so he can orgasm a particular way. If you knew he hated going down on you, would you still want him to do it? If oral isn\u2019t an option for you- try mutual masturbation or using toys together for different sensations. \n\nConsensual hugs to you!",

I felt so bad, but after explaining to him that it wasn't about him or the taste or anything, it was the texture and that while some days i might be able to handle it, that day was not one of those days, it's all good. He didn't understand when we first started dating, but after one fateful day when we tried some new dumplings together he gets it and is very understanding when things like that happen now.\n\nI second the showering together. Often makes for some very steamy moments, which gets everyone going even more than they already were. And bonus - no skin or sweat from today's undies.",
