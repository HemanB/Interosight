  "selftext": "I've been dealing with chronic nausea and vomiting for almost a year now and lately my counselor has suggested I may have arfid on top of it. I was seeing some improvement in my eating habits and had an almost three week streak vomit free (the longest I've had) but it's all gone back downhill again. I'm just tired. Food grosses me out. No appeal. No pleasure. Just worried it'll inevitably make me sick like it always does. Even my safe foods are a struggle to get myself to eat. I'm only eating like 2 meals a day when my dietician wants me to be eating 5. I'm just so tired of being told I need to eat more and drink more of my gross ensure shakes I'm really trying but struggling. It was so nice to see progress and see myself gain some weight back, but it was just too much to relapse and lose it all again. \nI don't know what I want, maybe to just rant, maybe tips, maybe just solidarity. I'm just so tired of being uninterested in food and grossed out by it and worried it'll make me sick. It's exhausting.",

For a long time I was only eating mashed potatoes and tomato soup and I was eating less and less of them because it\u2019s so hard. Now I eat baby food. Which sounds really weird but it\u2019s what I can get down. And it\u2019s embarrassing. So at work I have to hide my food so people don\u2019t see im eating baby food and i hate it. Also people will constantly offer me food and it\u2019s horrible because I have to make up excuses of why I don\u2019t want to take it. I cry so much because I miss real food. I just want a greasy nasty fast food burger or the fattiest slice of pizza. I want chicken nuggets and Mac n cheese. I miss the food I used to eat.",

I\u2019ve also been struggling with nearly constant nausea and have vomited on 6 or 7 occasions in the past 2 years with seemingly no reason, although doctors do think I have something physical going on beyond just GERD. Due to having emetophobia, I\u2019ve lost any love I\u2019ve had for eating. Even when I do get hungry, I\u2019m often too scared to actually eat anything or can\u2019t get far into a meal without panicking. Thoughts of food and eating have completely taken over my life.
