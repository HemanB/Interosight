Like for example, I see so many videos on tiktok of people posting about their kids eating habits that are *unmistakably* ARFID and then go on to just say \u201cthey\u2019re the pickiest eater\u201d. It\u2019s just so trivializing and makes me so upset. ARFID is so much more than just \u201cpicky eating\u201d and it drives me crazy when people fail to acknowledge it",

You\u2019re just ungrateful.\u201d Usually said whenever I was made a different simple meal like spaghetti as opposed to what they were eating for dinner. I don\u2019t blame them bc they didn\u2019t know any better and from the outside it did look like special treatment especially bc they were never offered the same thing but it was really frustrating. Because I grew up telling myself \u201cwhy do you need to be so picky?? You are a burden. You cause unnecessary inconvenience to mom and dad by FORCING them to make you a different meal. Just get over it and stop being so picky and ungrateful.\u201d But then when I tried to eat what they were eating I would feel a pit in my stomach until my anxiety started bubbling up and I could do nothing but cry because I was so frightened. Ppl telling me I could change and that I was being irrational when it felt like something I couldn\u2019t control put so much guilt and shame on my shoulders and I shouldn\u2019t have felt like such an inconvenience at such a young age.\n\nWhich is why, while I do understand that they don\u2019t always mean harm by just chalking it up to \u201cbeing picky\u201d and that a lot of people don\u2019t even know what arfid is, I also am sometimes annoyed by it because it\u2019s caused so much confusion and self hatred for me personally.",
