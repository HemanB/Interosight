  "selftext": "I absolutely ADORE cooking/baking shows. I love watching videos and documentaries about foreign cuisine, or watching people make food. I love learning how to prepare meals. I don't cook much but when I do, I get super into it. I just find it funny considering I hate eating most foods and am almost always terrified of trying new food. I feel like my fascination with food actually stems from ARFID, like I'm exploring a forbidden world or something lol. Which is why I wonder if anyone feels this way as well?",

Of those, the only one I have *any* experience of as an adult (never mind talent) is pottery. \n\nAnd food ones are the most common ones for me to watch - masterchef, celeb masterchef, bake off, bake off the professionals, great British menu, random \"so and so goes somewhere\" type shows. \n\nThe greatest irony is that when I was at school, in my last 2 years, we had a thing called \"free option\" - a class that wasn't part of our A-Levels. You could do stuff like reading to primary school kids, music, dragonboat racing, but I did a thing that was nominally an environment class, but which was really just a load of fun - most of our classes involved games of blackjack, cheat, texas holdem etc. \n\nBut every so often, we'd actually do something. The school had six beehives, so we made candles or wood polish from the wax, that kind of thing. The only one that ever caused controversy was the time we made black pudding (blood sausage). Out of twelve of us in the class, ten refused to do it. The two who would? The vegetarian girl, and me, the guy with the undiagnosed eating disorder. The other ten wouldn't come within ten feet of where me and the girl were mixing the blood, suet and oatmeal. \n\nThat's the weirdest thing about ARFID for me - if you were to say to me \"would you eat black pudding\", I'd roll around laughing on the floor for about an hour at the thought of how ridiculous that thought was. But if you need someone to help make it, it doesn't trigger the same response unless I think about trying to eat it.",

Then when I started dating my girlfriend, she helped get more comfortable trying new things by lessening the guilt I associate with trying something new, not liking it and then being the odd one out / disappointing others / wasting food. She would just eat what I don't like and just be happy that I tried. We tried a few times those meal kits delivered by mail, and that's what really helped me get into cooking. We would try things together, I would eat whatever I could and she would eat the rest, and it also helped me getting a bit more confortable with smells and textures I'm adverse to. Still can't eat them, but it's a small step. I've gotten really into cooking as it also satisfies my inner Latina mom within me that needs to feed everyone. Now that write this though, I'll admit my mind has been less into trying to work on expanding my safe foods and more on just feeding my girlfriend. But in any case, cooking has been really helpful.",

It was worded so much better when I read it, but it\u2019s been a while since I saw that article.
