  "selftext": "I just finished eating an entire apple.\n\nI know, pretty ordinary. But it was the very first time I did it without feeling any fear.\n\nI kept repeating in my head: \"It's just fear. There's nothing to be afraid of. Nothing. It's just like any other food\".\n\nI chewed it and ate it. Just like any other food. I didn't feel fear. I didn't feel the urge to vomit I always feel.\n\nI'm on the verge of tears just by writing this. These victories are what make me have faith in, one day, being completely free from ARFID. This day will come. I know it will.",
