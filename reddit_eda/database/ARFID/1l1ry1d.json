  "title": "My bf is helping me realize that flavor and texture isn\u2019t always the enemy",
  "selftext": "For context, growing up I had a VERY challenging relationship with food. I\u2019ve always eaten very bland, processed, textureless foods and rarely deviated from my short list of safe foods. When I was a kid I would sit at the table for hours when my parents cooked something new for me to try, so meals were always very socially challenging and extremely anxiety inducing for me. To avoid the texture of meat I would drench it in ketchup, and I\u2019d take blueberries like pills to avoid the fruit inside. I\u2019ve been attempting to take this disorder and turn it into something more positive now that I\u2019m an adult and have started living on my own, and have encouraged my boyfriend to cook things that will push me out of my comfort zone. \n\nSlide 1 (the most challenging one): seasoned chicken taco with fresh tomatoes, onions, and avocado \n\nThe combination of flavorful chicken, crunchy onions, acidic tomatoes, and cold soft avocado was a sensory overload at first. I definitely know now that I don\u2019t like raw tomatoes lol, but once I took some of those off I actually finished both tacos! I\u2019m really impressed that I managed to get through it all, since foods with more texture and flavor usually make me shut down and lose my appetite from spending so much mental energy on processing what was going on in my mouth. \n\nSlide 2: salmon teriyaki street tacos with coleslaw and green onion\n\nThis was my first meal from him that I had tried, and I was so shocked that I liked it that I almost cried lmao. I only made it through one taco since I was overwhelmed, but it\u2019s the first meal I\u2019ve tried that has made me want to try it again which is huge. I think if I tried it again I would totally finish it all. \n\nApologies for the long post, but I\u2019ve been so emotional and proud of myself for these huge steps I\u2019ve taken. If I told myself even just a year ago that I\u2019d be eating this, I would\u2019ve laughed in my own face. ",

Especially because it's also incredibly customisable in every way. Fajitas were and are one of my biggest breakthrough foods, the combination of textures and flavours took me literally weeks to break into, until I finally have it fairly \"normally\", (I don't have salsa and guac as I just... can't) but I have learned it's a preference and it's ok! \n\nKeep up with it! I hope more food becomes easier for you!",
