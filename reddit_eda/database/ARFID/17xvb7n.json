And he ended up eating the crunchy edges of the chicken tender carefully making sure he only got crumbs and not chicken lol (I think a lil chicken got in there) I didn\u2019t make a big deal about it even though I was FAREAKING out wanting to celebrate right away lol \ud83d\ude02 than when we were done he ate the crumbs out the bottom of the box too. It\u2019s been YEARS since I seen him eat anything but goldfish, glazed donuts and cheezits and pizza crust!",

I struggle to even eat that thing again for a long time. Taking away any of the foods I can eat is really hard on me. It took me making myself be a jerk and going on and on about how disgusting something he likes is to get him to understand a little about how I feel. It didn't make him stop eating or liking the food, but it made him really defensive and unhappy. He doesn't want me to feel that way, so he stopped saying it. He just asked me not to eat one thing around him because even the smell makes him not want to eat all day. That's fair. I don't want him to feel that way, either.",
