  "title": "That Subway lady didn't even realize how shitty it made me feel when she said that.",
  "selftext": "I saw the post today about the person with extreme anxiety asking how to order at Subways, and it made me think of a similar story I experienced.\n\nBackstory : I'm 30, been suffering from ARFID/SED my whole life. It never got better. I usually eat alone. There's only like 6-7 things in TOTAL that I actually eat. I avoid social gathering where food is involved. I have also some anxiety/depression problems.\n\nWhenever I go to a restaurant, I always order the same thing. At Subways, it's always a chicken sandwich with cheese and bacon, no veggy. Most of the time, they don't even bat an eye when I say \"No veggy\". They don't care. \n\nThere is a Subway near my job that I go almost every week. One day I go in and it's a new employee that I don't recognize. I order my sandwich like usual.  When it was time to add vegetables, I tell the girl \"Only south west sauce\" and she goes \"Really ? No vegetables ? Wow that's weird, alright sure no vegetable\". Just this made me feel very anxious. Then, I sit down to eat my sub, and a customer walks in and ask if he can add X item to his sub, and the girl goes \"Sure, you can do anything you want with your sub, look at this guy, he didn't put any vegetable in his !\" while pointing at me. At that moment, I wanted to disappear. I was mortified.\n\nI never returned to that Subway. When I told this story to a friend of mine, he thought I was overreacting. I kinda felt embarassed, and I haven't told that story since.",

Especially as I don't think it's that uncommon to have a sandwich without vegetables? \n\nI understand how you feel though, one time my boyfriend (who also suffers from ARFID which is why I'm in this sub) went to a restaurant. Because it was so busy, service was very poor. We ordered the food and asked for his pasta to come with no sauce as he's actually intolerant to tomatoes. The waiter made a big deal like how could you not want sauce. The food came and there were onions on the garlic bread which we both hate. Because it was so busy we couldn't send it back and had to waste the food :(. When the waiter came back to clear dishes he said \"you need to eat more!\".... Ouch. \n\nI don't understand why these people need to impose their opinions on food onto you. Every time someone says they don't like something, someone just has to act shocked like \"whatttt? You DONT like it? How?\" Everyone is unique and beautiful and you should never be shamed for what you eat  \ud83d\udc95",

I went to the one that doesn't to buy chocolate.  That was basically all I bought. 3 bags of the 3.99 chocolate. The cashier made a comment that made me feel self conscious. I no longer go to that one for my chocolate fix. What we have is judged and misunderstood.  It sucks.  What I do is remind myself that I'm struggling with someone people in my life (and rando cashiers) could never understand. I do what's best for me. Some days, all I eat is chocolate until 10 at night. That's better than nothing,  especially when I have to get through work",

I would try to contact their regional manager if you can to tell them what happened.

They just don\u2019t understand because that\u2019s pretty rare, they can\u2019t immediately guess \u201coh yeah, that person has an eating disorder and saying something about it might make them feel bad\u201d. Maybe the employee you faced was indeed an asshole making fun of you, but maybe they just thought that was a normal reaction, maybe they thought you wouldn\u2019t care. The thing is, it\u2019s pretty brave to ask for uncommon food if you have an eating disorder, therefore it\u2019s actually more likely that you just didn\u2019t care and that you were anxiety free.\n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m complaining about the replies here, not about your post. I don\u2019t think you overreacted, not at all. You can\u2019t control that kind of reactions and frankly, I would have wanted to disappear from the surface of the earth too. \nAnd also, it would be great if people stopped being judgmental but no need to get angry at them either.

Telling them nicely is a better alternative, explaining why they should be careful, why it hurt you etc. Sending letters to their managers or downright becoming agressive won\u2019t make them understand our disorder (or any other one), that will just picture us as bad people you don\u2019t want to respect anyway, that avoid discussions.",

Especially when I was younger and had to go to restaurants with my parents and I just ordered a plates of fries. \n\nBut despite that, I never felt like it was their fault (nor mine, obviously). They just don\u2019t understand because that\u2019s pretty rare, they can\u2019t immediately guess \u201coh yeah, that person has an eating disorder and saying something about it might make them feel bad\u201d. Maybe the employee you faced was indeed an asshole making fun of you, but maybe they just thought that was a normal reaction, maybe they thought you wouldn\u2019t care. The thing is, it\u2019s pretty brave to ask for uncommon food if you have an eating disorder, therefore it\u2019s actually more likely that you just didn\u2019t care and that you were anxiety free.\n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m complaining about the replies here, not about your post. I don\u2019t think you overreacted, not at all. You can\u2019t control that kind of reactions and frankly, I would have wanted to disappear from the surface of the earth too. \nAnd also, it would be great if people stopped being judgmental but no need to get angry at them either. They grew up in an overall judgmental society. Telling them nicely is a better alternative, explaining why they should be careful, why it hurt you etc. Sending letters to their managers or downright becoming agressive won\u2019t make them understand our disorder (or any other one), that will just picture us as bad people you don\u2019t want to respect anyway, that avoid discussions.",
