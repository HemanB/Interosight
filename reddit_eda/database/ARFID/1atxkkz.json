  "selftext": "I'm fat because my safe foods are mostly fast food and packaged foods. They're the same every time and they taste good. Also things like white bread, buttered noodles, stuff like that. I have binge eating disorder (diagnosed in high school) on top of everything because my mom was very controlling about what I eat so I used to hoard my safe snacks and eat them all at night when she was sleeping.\n\nI'm trying to get my weight under control but my doctor says \"the ARFID criteria says it comes with extreme weight loss so that isn't what you have\". I gag uncontrollably when I try to eat unsafe foods. I can branch out a tiny bit (I've been able to eat more kinds of meat recently) but I have so many memories as a kid of being forced to try something and throwing up and my mom getting mad at me and telling me I'm faking it. Finding out about ARFID was such a relief because it explained everything but my doctor won't believe me. \n\nIs she right? Do you have to lose a lot of weight to have ARFID? I never lost weight as a kid because my parents mostly just gave me the pasta and McDonald's and peanut butter sandwiches I asked for when they were done yelling at me for gagging when I tried eating a grape.",

It wasn't until I actively addressed the BE that anyone took he arfid seriously because it couldn't be hidden anymore.\n\nI recommend keeping a food journal. Not to track calories or anything like that, but to track your aversions, etc. Having it written down, consistently, can help. Doctors love data. When I gave my primary a spiral notebook listing everything I'd eaten over the 2 months between our appointments, he took my statements about arfid a lot more seriously. The information was right there.\n\nHe could SEE what I was eating, what I wasn't, and that by that point, I should have been starving to death. I could have been classed as anorexia because I started shedding weight like a winter coat in summer basically the MOMENT I addressed the BE. You shouldn't have to do that to get the medical attention you need.\n\nI'm sorry this has been so difficult.",

Unfortunately, our healthcare system has a lot of issues and having a chronic illness means advocating for yourself every single day.

I lived with BED for 32 years without even knowing I had it, and it hid my arfid symptoms for ages. I had suspected the arfid due to my sensory/texture issues, food phobias and more but my weight (and some early doctors) told me it was JUST a willpower issue.\n\nI literally had no idea I was binge eating! The portions I was eating seemed normal to me based on my lived experience growing up with other binge eaters and it hid my arfid. I was getting enough calories in to maintain/gain weight because I was filling up on junk because it was all I could tolerate and I was always feeling so hungry (or depressed, a big trigger) all the time. It wasn't until I actively addressed the BE that anyone took he arfid seriously because it couldn't be hidden anymore.\n\nI recommend keeping a food journal. Not to track calories or anything like that, but to track your aversions, etc. Having it written down, consistently, can help. Doctors love data. When I gave my primary a spiral notebook listing everything I'd eaten over the 2 months between our appointments, he took my statements about arfid a lot more seriously. The information was right there.\n\nHe could SEE what I was eating, what I wasn't, and that by that point, I should have been starving to death. I could have been classed as anorexia because I started shedding weight like a winter coat in summer basically the MOMENT I addressed the BE.
