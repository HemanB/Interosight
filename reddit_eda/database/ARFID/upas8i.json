I think OT will be helpful, my nephew is in OT now & it makes it much more of a fun game rather than a battle. What kids will eat will fluctuate with time, but when I was more rigid as a kid it\u2019s because of texture issues & because it gave me a sense of control. And a lot of time as a kid what you eat is the only thing you have any sense of control over. As a kid, I always felt really good when an adult would make a positive very big deal over me trying anything new. Sounds silly, but it\u2019s a positive reinforcement that sometimes helped(especially as I got older. There are some foods I know I\u2019ll always be rigid with (ironically years later, many of these foods showed up on my food sensitivity list). Feel free to DM me if you want more things that helped (even if only a little) or if you want to share more details about specifics with your sons food lists. I might be able to help more than what I was able to just write. I\u2019m interested to hear about how OT has gone for him if it\u2019s already started!",
