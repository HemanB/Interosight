It's helping me figure out things to try.\n\nWhat I don't like is that when I mark something as \"try\", I can't see it on the main page anymore! Would we potentially be able to get that showing up there too?\n\nAlso - the messaging around restrict vs dislike is confusing to me. I'm allergic to banana but cannot eat, say, burgers. Do they both go in restrict? So far I've been putting stuff I don't like but could theoretically eat in Dislike, and stuff I can't eat in Restrict, but I'd love to differentiate the \"I will experience awful negative reactions if I try this\" from the \"I just cannot eat this under any circumstance\".",
