So this summer we took advantage of some tools that weren't readily available for me growing up in the 80's and we got her in with a feeding psychologist at Nationwide Children's Hospital. Once we got home after the first visit my wife and daughter made this sheet together so we as parents didnt have to harass her during a meal and add stress. She could read this sheet as needed during a meal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome tools she was given...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGrowth mindset stuff, never say I can't... Always say i can't YET..\n\nWith a new food, get excited about trying it instead of building up the terror.\n\nFollow these steps with a new food...\n\n1. Smell it.\n2. Touch your tongue to it.\n3. Take a bite as big as a pea.\n4. Take a regular bite.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe also had some worksheets. She was gonna try one new food every week of the summer. She had to eat that food every day for the week, and use the worksheet to time herself eating it. So like, an orange. On Sunday it would take her 15 min. By Saturday she'd be down to like 4 minutes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know these steps arent as easy for a lot of us. But i thought i would share her worksheet and some of her story, as now after one summer with a positive growth mindset ... She's a pretty respectable eater with a very diverse diet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck everybody.",

We don't have to remind her to get the food out of her cheeks, we don't have to tell her to be mindful while chewing. She has empowered herself. No more stressful parents drawing attention to her issues, it's stressful enough without that. \n\nAlso, she can trust us to never lie to her about something she has extreme anxiety over.
