  "selftext": "I\u2019m staying home with my two roommates this Thanksgiving and y\u2019all...it might be the best one ever in terms of actually being able to eat. \n\nMy safe foods are generally carby and cheesy- pasta, pizza, bread and I can do chicken provided it\u2019s breast. I can get through turkey but I don\u2019t really like it, and my family loves to throw bacon on it and things like that. I don\u2019t like generally any of the side dishes- stuffing, veggies, etc. \n\nBut this year because none of us are crazy about turkey and our oven is small one roommate is making simple lemon and rosemary grilled chicken breasts, I\u2019m making mac n cheese and dessert, and my other roommate is making potatoes (I can do mashed!) and a vegetable I can skip. I can actually eat dinner! No eating only a thin piece of turkey and dinner rolls! I\u2019m over the moon.",
