I now have very specific coffee drinks I like because they aren't bitter at all. You might think all coffee is bitter at the moment because you've never had the super sweet nonbitter ones, and that's totally ok! You don't need to find a coffee you like!\n\nThe egregious thing is when folk won't accept that you don't want to try it. That's fucking annoying! ARFID is so hard to try new stuff with, I'm not going to fight it just because some twat in a caf\u00e9 wants me to do so. Let us stick to the hot chocolate, jeez.\n\n(I actually learnt to like some coffee because after much discussion, a twink in a specialist coffee place carefully went through a tonne of coffee shots until he found one I didn't immediately hate and then we sweetened it until it worked. Very voluntary process. Wouldn't recommend it unless you're having a really good day.)",
