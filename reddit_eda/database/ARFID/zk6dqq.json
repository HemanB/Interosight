Lecturing me about \u201cwell what you\u2019re doing is bad for you\u201d. Yea no shit doc I am aware eating four foods is bad for me. You think I like doing this? That this is fun for me and at any moment I can just choose to eat a larger variety of foods?? \n\nI wish professionals understood. And people in general. I got told my parents should have beat me more growing up and then I wouldn\u2019t develop arfid. The fuck?",

And I definitely think you're right that the pressure and the anxiety it creates makes the disorder so much worse. My parents never forced me to eat anything I couldn't and I've noticed I don't have the same anxiety (specifically socially) that most people with ARFID seem to have. \n\nI basically turned it into a party game and never thought anything of it (\"Name any food! I've probably never tried it!\" - *everyone starts listing foods* - \"Nope! Never had that basic food the majority of the planet seems to eat!\") If someone says, \"So, you basically eat like a toddler?\" I genuinely laugh because they're totally right. I never realized how many people are bothered by those comments and I really think it's because my parents never pressured me.\n\nI do have two specific memories at sleepovers where I was forced to eat something. The first one I cried and cried and ended up throwing it back up in less than 10 minutes (it was my first time throwing up ever). And the second one I managed to swallow back down but only had two bites before I stopped. To this day I can't try anything related to those two foods because it's an immediate flashback.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n**I really hope that with whatever programs they're working on for kids with ARFID they realize the just how badly pressure, anxiety, and lack of control can have on ARFID.**",

I don't think anyone has said this is the worst problem in the world, however, the existence of other problems doesn't minimize the struggles we have with this. It *is* severely debilitating for some people, enough to need gastrostomy tubes inserted in order to get the proper nutrients and maintain enough calories to stay alive. Because, yes, death is one of the results of this disorder when you're unable to eat food.\n\nYour argument could be the same for someone with depression - they just need to get over it and be happy and stop moping around all the time, right? ARFID has a psychological component that people clearly don't understand, like you are demonstrating. People are here to talk to other people who DO understand. So again, why the fuck are you here?",
