  "title": "Pregnancy opened my eyes to what a \u201cnormal\u201d appetite was. And now I\u2019m so depressed that my taste is back to normal that I\u2019m going insane.",
  "selftext": "I thought my ARFID (clinically diagnosed by my psychiatrist around 3 years ago) was bad enough. Every guy I dated HATED it. I tried every food they offered me, but near nothing tasted good. They thought I was just being picky, they didn\u2019t understand why I was so afraid of choking/suffocating. I\u2019m diagnosed autistic (back in the 6th grade my therapist diagnosed me) and back then Autistic kids were just normally seen as picky. My parents just fed me what I would eat.\n\nMy husband and I have been through quite a bit with my eating habits. He thought it was pickiness but after therapy and a lot of communication, he\u2019s learned that I hate my tastes more than anyone. Thankfully I don\u2019t care what others think, I\u2019ll order chicken strips anywhere and bite back at anyone who is judgey about it. That was just how it was. Then my husband and I tried for our beautiful daughter.\n\nAs soon as I got pregnant, maybe like 2 weeks in, I could EAT. It didn\u2019t matter if it was salad, or different ranch dressings. I loved all meats, not just the fast food garbage. I could stomach different pastas, even WATER tasted divine. Fancy dinners with my parents I could try new meals and LIKE them. I didn\u2019t have to order a burger or Mac and cheese! I could eat veil picatta or fancy lasagna and complex soups without going home hungry.\n\nI could eat all I wanted, all day every day it felt. Obviously I wasn\u2019t going to drink alcohol, eat fish (which I\u2019ve always hated), and kept my diet clear of the bad things like caffeine that could harm my little one. But all the other foods I could have were AMAZING. I felt like such a glutton but it was AWESOME. I didn\u2019t have to have the same meal all the time. New things I tried ACTUALLY had a chance of me liking them. Coffee tasted sweeter. I never went to bed hungry. My thirst was always quenched. IT WAS HEAVEN.\n\nNow, three weeks having my healthy, beautiful baby girl\u2026 I\u2019m back to hating nearly everything I put in my mouth.\n\nI\u2019m so fucking destroyed. I\u2019m so depressed. I was so happy to taste normally. To love everything on my plate. To lick the plate clean after nearly every meal. To relish to taste of ANY soda, not just Dr. Pepper.\n\nIt\u2019s 2am. I\u2019m sitting up crying, wondering how to get it back. I want it back, that appetite. But I obviously can\u2019t just stay pregnant forever. And there were HORRIBLE things that came with my pregnancy that I can\u2019t just jump back into. \n\nI\u2019m mourning the ability to taste. The ability to eat and feel full. The ability to like what I eat. The ability to ignore textures.\n\nEating brought me so much fucking joy and now that I know what I can\u2019t have, I\u2019m ready to rip my hair out.\n\nTomorrow I meet with my therapist. I\u2019ve met with a dietician before, too to try and fix the ARFID. But they\u2019ve done NOTHING like pregnancy has for my tastes.\n\nHOW CAN I GET THAT LOVE FOR FOOD BACK?",

      "body": "Wow that's wildly fascinating. Do you feel like this implies your ARFID is hormonal in some way? Were there other things that were different during your pregnancy that could contribute to explaining this difference in your felt experience (did you take off work? was your stress lower? was your partner more helpful and supportive?)? \n\nIn my self-work to try to slowly alchemize my ARFID feelings into something else, I've mostly approached it as a nervous system problem. Thinking like, if I'm in chronic fight/flight I'm not in rest/digest, perhaps thats why I keep perceiving new foods as threatening and hard to accept. So I've focused on trying to down shift my nervous system, increase my felt sense of safety, and slowly try new things with as much support as possible and no sense of forcing or having to. And I'm very slowly stretching and expanding what's okay. \n\nBut if I had your experience I think I'd be thinking my ARFID was hormonal somehow. That something about having a different balance of hormones made things suddenly able to just actually taste better. I think I'd think maybe there's something off about my normal hormone levels, maybe if I supplemented some hormone levels (not necessarily to pregnancy levels, but seeing if there is some minimum effective dose between here and there) maybe I could feel that way again. I think I'd probably try a functional medicine doctor and I'd walk in and explain my experience and say help me see if we can figure out what it was about pregnancy that made this possible and if we can recreate it outside of pregnancy. \n\nSorry if that got rambly, but yeah that's wildly fascinating and if I were in your shoes I'd also be feeling a little crazy and desperate to figure out wtf made that possible and if it could happen again. \ud83e\udec2 That sounds like such a magical time. And I bet it is possible to bring that experience into your non-pregnant life, you just have some experimenting to do to find what exactly it is that made that possible \ud83d\udc97",

But, neither are medical doctors. Your pregnancy was a medical event that caused a change in your ARFID! So make you meet with someone who understands hormones and the physical effects pregnancy. Someone who can prescribe something. Your gyno might be a good place to start!",

      "body": "I feel for you. To have the experience of being able to eat anything and then back to full restrictions is my worst nightmare. \n\nMy experience isn\u2019t as extreme. After being in a bad accident years ago I\u2019ve been able to eat more foods including a number that were gag foods just thinking about. Something in my brain changed. Not to the extreme where everything taste amazing but I can eat them and over time I get more and more enjoyment doing so. But during times of crisis or high stress my restrictions come back.\n\nI hope this will be encouraging for you. I\u2019ve found when the high stress/crisis lessens it takes very little for my to add the newer safe foods back in. Like simply only having frozen omelette makings for the rest of the family which normally I can\u2019t eat but just before my most recent stress time I was able to eat it so I gave it a try the other day and I could eat half my normal portion. Sometimes I don\u2019t even notice I\u2019ve done it. I know that sounds weird like how can you not notice? So I like my eggs a particular way and any bits that aren\u2019t cooked perfect I slide onto my partner\u2019s plate. As the situation gets less stressful I just eat what\u2019s on my plate and only notice when my partner passes his plate to me and I don\u2019t have anything to put on it. \n\nYou\u2019ve just had a baby and your hormones are all over the place. You\u2019re stress levels are through the roof. It\u2019s possible in 18 months when things settle down you\u2019ll find it easier to add a number of the new foods you enjoyed back in. It may take a bit of effort - I\u2019ve sometimes had to do it a few bites at a time over weeks or longer and work my way up to a full portions but I hold in my mind what it tasted like and how I felt eating it before the current crisis and it does come back. But during the stressful time not being able to enjoy those new foods adds to my stress and if I were in your situation I\u2019d be completely destroyed too.",

A study like this for picky eaters (both neurodivergent and neurotypical) should be done as well, maybe the study could include them too.\n\n\nSeperate studies could also be done about specifically just hormonal affects with ARFID and picky eating for women and AFABs, like for women or AFABs on birth control for example.\n\n\nI do wonder, on the topic of hormones changing ARFID eating habits, I wonder if any trans people with ARFID have had changes to their eating habits after taking HRT. Like have any trans women had their eating habits changed after going on estrogen, or have any trans men had their eating habits changed after taking testosterone? Have any non-binary people that are on either had any changes to their eating habits?\n\n(Also, for those who don't know what AFAB means, [here](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/afab) is a definition for it.)",

It\u2019s so clear how deeply food, taste, and joy were tied together for you during pregnancy, and I just want to say how valid your grief is. What you\u2019re describing isn\u2019t just \u201cmissing a craving\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s mourning the experience of finally being able to eat freely, enjoyably, and without fear, after a lifetime of ARFID. That\u2019s a huge emotional loss, and it makes sense that it\u2019s hitting so hard.\n\nThe shift that happened during pregnancy \u2014 where taste, texture, and even fear loosened their grip \u2014 isn\u2019t uncommon, and it\u2019s something we hear about from other people with ARFID or sensory issues. Hormonal changes during pregnancy can alter sensory processing, appetite regulation, and even how the brain interprets reward from food. That version of you who was finally able to explore and enjoy meals \u2014 she\u2019s still there. Your body and brain just aren\u2019t in the same state right now, and that\u2019s not your fault.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing that you\u2019ve already done so much work with therapy, and it\u2019s good that you\u2019re seeing someone again soon. It\u2019s also completely okay that you\u2019re still hurting \u2014 ARFID is complex, especially when it intersects with neurodivergence and postnatal changes. There isn\u2019t one switch that fixes it. But the fact that your brain did allow you to enjoy food at one point is also meaningful \u2014 it means your relationship with food isn\u2019t broken, just in hiding.\n\nIf it ever feels helpful to talk to someone who really gets the nutrition and the emotional side of things, I help run a team of registered dietitians and clinical psychologists who specialise in women\u2019s health, sensory-based eating, and postnatal recovery. We offer free initial consultations \u2014 no pressure at all, just a space to talk if you ever want help figuring out what\u2019s next.\n\nYou\u2019re not broken. What you experienced was real, and there are ways to gently move toward that joy again \u2014 even if it looks different now. You\u2019re doing the best you can in a hard moment. Be kind to yourself.",
