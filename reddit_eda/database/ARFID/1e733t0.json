I just haven\u2019t been able to ask anyone about Arfid cause I haven\u2019t met anyone that overlaps with it. So this is really helpful - thank you! Also, I hope you\u2019re doing okay in general. I can\u2019t even imagine how the stress would affect anxiety overall, let alone Arfid. Take care of yourself. \n\nIf you have some time, I\u2019m really curious about some of the things you mentioned. How do Jerusalem and Tel Aviv differ when it comes to Arfid? In my head canon, I\u2019m guessing Tel Aviv is a bit more accommodating? I guess in my head, the more western and more English speaking the restaurant, the more likely they are to make changes to dishes and accommodate Arfid? Is that just in my head bias or is it true?\n\nAny suggestions for navigating Arfid in Israel? In grocery stores or in restaurants? Is there a good way to communicate \u201cthis isn\u2019t an allergy but it\u2019s a restriction that needs to be respected\u201d? \n\nThank you so so much for your thoughts.
