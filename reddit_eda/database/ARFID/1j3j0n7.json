  "selftext": "I grew up with this guilt trip, big time, and it wasn\u2019t until very recently that I discovered ARFID exists across different populations. Because healthcare isn\u2019t as accessible in developing nations, there isn\u2019t good data on how often it occurs. \n\nBut we do know it exacerbates existing malnutrition, and in young children is considered \u201cfailure to thrive\u201d in other cultures. So next time someone tries this with you, remember that it\u2019s not some purely \u201cfirst world problem\u201d. It exists across many cultures, and often impacts them more severely than food-secure countries.  ",
