  "selftext": "F 5'3 and 74 pound) I'm at the point were I'm begining to feel my body fail me. Im struggling now to think at all, I have severe insomnia and I also struggle at night to move or lift my blanket. I'm struggling to carry everyday things suddenly that anyone can handle and my muscles seem to struggle reacting when I want to move them like my joints are paralyzed to obey with the rest of my body. The last time I visited my doctor they told me my pulse was pretty low.\n\n My visions blurry often and I swear constantly or freeze up constantly. I feel so horrible all the time now. I feel too weak to go downstairs even. I don't do my hobbies anymore, I can't do my college assignments, and I can't feel my own feelings or process anything around me from how decade my mind is at this point and my kidneys and chest hurt often now especially at night. \n\nI asked my parents if I could get a feeding tube and insulted me saying they won't give some random person a feeding tube without a good reason. My experience with a lot of doctors make me feel like I'm being ignored too which proves their point. I can't move forward. \n\n(I have an appointment for a nutritionist and also a swallow study but everything is taking so long... I don't get to see a nutritionist for another 5 weeks.)",

Or if you don\u2019t want to do that and you\u2019re in college, go to whatever sort of urgent care center is available through your college health services. \n\nGiven your weight/height and the symptoms you\u2019re describing, there is a decent chance that you\u2019re not eating enough to keep your heart functioning properly. Depending on what food you\u2019re eating and how much, you could be at risk of a sudden cardiovascular event (a common cause of death in people who pass away from eating disorders) or your organs could start shutting down due to malnutrition. I don\u2019t want to scare you, but you genuinely could die if you don\u2019t get help soon. It\u2019s possible that your body/heart will hold out until you have your appointment with a nutritionist, but it\u2019s also possible that your body will not make it until then. It\u2019s better to be safe than sorry, so given the risks you should go to the ER now to get your heart checked rather than taking the chance of waiting. \n\nWhen you get to the ER, you can explain that you\u2019ve been struggling to eat or to maintain your weight, and that you\u2019re very weak and your heart feels weird. They\u2019ll be able to take it from there. Make sure you describe your symptoms fully and give honest answers to any questions they ask. You can also explain that you truly want to eat and gain weight, but you haven\u2019t been able to. \n\nIf your situation is severe enough, the doctors may very well give you a feeding tube at least until you\u2019re stabilized. Or they might be able to give you nutritional shakes or some other meal replacement that you\u2019re able to tolerate enough to subsist on for now. If your situation isn\u2019t as bad as I\u2019m fearing, then they can explain that and tell you that you\u2019re safe to wait until your nutritionist appointment.
