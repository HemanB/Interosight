  "title": "A safe food that always gave me a big warm meal is ruined",
  "selftext": "Those Digiorno microwave mini pizzas used to come with a crisping tray to help the bottom cook properly. Imagine my surprise when the tray is suddenly gone...and the pizzas now come out horrible. Grease everywhere, melted cheese everywhere, and the bottom soaking wet. It's absolutely disgusting to look at, disgusting to hold, disgusting to eat. \n\nI'm shattered. This was the NUMBER ONE safe food for me when I wanted a full meal and didn't have the energy to cook. My sensitivity can fluctuate, and in my worst moments where pancakes feel too sticky and chicken nuggets feel too greasy, this was my only option. \n\nOn the bright side I guess this means I can partake in the Nestle boycotts now...? /hj\n\nEdit: For everyone suggesting buying an air fryer - my workplace doesn't have one of those nor do I have control over whether or not it does. Even if I solve the problem at home, that's still a problem if I want lunch.",
