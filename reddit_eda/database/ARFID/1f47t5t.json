  "selftext": "I just recently found this thread. I\u2019ve struggled with ARFID my whole life and most foods/textures make me puke. I also have a double whammy in the sense that I\u2019m type one diabetic as well, which I feel may have also impacted my issues with eating. Anyways, I\u2019ve been really trying to get more varieties of food into my diet. However, one thing that will always be a no-go for me is soup. Something about it just makes me nauseas. Even just looking at it. Something about the way everything is mushy in one big pot, while all tasting the same, it just completely shuts off my hunger. Where I work there is a soup bar and I despise customers who come through my line with soup dripping all over the containers. Anyone else like this with soup? And stew !! I just hate it. Even thinking about it now I\u2019m getting all icky feeling ",
