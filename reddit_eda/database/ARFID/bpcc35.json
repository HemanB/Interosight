  "selftext": "Seriously, it has never made sense to me. Whether it's when I go out to eat making a million adjustments to a safe food, or if I bring my white bread sandwich of just peanut butter into work, people are always making comments. They feel the need to crack a joke about how I eat like a child or \"omg how can you not like X???\" I stopped eating lunch in the bistro area for months after someone commented on my sandwich because I was way too anxious to face that again.\n\nI dont even bat an eye at what others are eating, it has no bearing on me at all! They should feel free to eat what they want or how they want. Why do people feel the need to comment on my food choices?",
