Experiment and find one food she likes from every type of restaurant. Something Chinese, Mexican, American and Seafood. This way, no matter where uncle shit for brains made reservations for the wedding reception, your child will be able to eat something. A few things to try: Chinese, cream cheese wanton, Mexican, beef burrito, Seafood, deep fried shrimp. Let her try a little taste and eventually her eyes will light up with glee. She will discover new foods that she loves. I'm still finding them. \n\nRemember brown and crispy is usually okay. You'll both get through this just fine.",
