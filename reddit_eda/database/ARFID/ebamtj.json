I was offered some kind of kumquat honey candy by a wonderful lady that volunteered at the place I was working. I took it, told her thank you, and intended to trash it later. However, she asked me to eat it right then, so I did. 5 minutes later I\u2019m covered in hives and have shortness of breath. I popped two antihistamines while my friend drove me to the emergency room and they gave me something stronger. I was in the ER for the rest of the night because they wanted to monitor me as I\u2019ve never had any kind of allergy to food before. It cost me over 4000 dollars bc no insurance and the candy was disgusting. Never again.",

I\u2019ve never understood why people get offended when someone doesn\u2019t want to eat their food. Everyone has different tastes in food. Would you rather them agree to try your food but suffer the whole time? Why not just let people do what they\u2019re comfortable with? Especially with something like food.

I feel so rude and ungrateful but honestly I don\u2019t want to have a panic attack in front of you while trying to try a bite of whatever you\u2019re offering.
