I\u2019ve been ridiculed my entire life for the way I eat that I have no control over. No one who isn\u2019t attracted to blondes has ridiculed me. it\u2019s not the same.\n\nedit: also what i\u2019m trying to say is that this is a popular viewpoint clearly with 83k likes. it\u2019s the popular opinion to think you\u2019re a weirdo for what you choose to eat. it has ZERO effect on their life they just want to be better than us.",

Those people can be called \"picky,\" though that's still not nice, they may be addicted to sugar. \n\nWe need to stop agreeing with those who call us picky eaters/calling ourselves picky eaters. I sure as hell would eat every food if I could. ARFID makes it so I cannot handle that yet. I hope that someday I can eat most foods without any physical/mental effects. \n\nMy point is, I feel like \"picky\" implies a choice, when we do not choose to have ARFID. \n\nPicky in my mind would be you want your steak medium well, and absolutely turn your nose at it because your friend cooks it well done, even if it still would taste fine, even if you can still tolerate it and go about your day like normal after eating it. \n\nNot to say some of us don't need our foods cooked a certain way either.
