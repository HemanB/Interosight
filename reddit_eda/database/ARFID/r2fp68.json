  "selftext": "I went to try out a new doctor today and it did NOT go well. Explained to her that i have ARFID and told her what it was (since ya know, most people don\u2019t know), and she told me \u201cwell sometimes you just have to be brave like NORMAL people and just try the food. you cant keep complaining about it if you don\u2019t do anything to fix it\u201d. Like WHY DO YOU THINK IM HERE?? But also- i\u2019ve done lots of work on it and am even starting a program in a month or so (brain mapping), which i told her. Then, as i was leaving she said \u201cwell youre still skinny so whatever youre doing, it\u2019s working!\u201d who says that to someone with an ED?! Safe to say i won\u2019t be seeing her again.\n\nanyways, just needed to rant. spent the whole car ride home crying in frustration and anger. i just wish people, especially medical professionals, would understand :/\n\nsorry for bad grammar and punctuation i am angry typing",

Luckily my daughter's adult MD happens to have done some extra training in ED management which I hope proves to be helpful. \n\nIf you have worked with an RD or nutritionist ask them which doctors have a lot of ED patients. Those providers could be more experienced. \n\nAlso your health insurance company may have some insight of better suited providers",

It's absurd how many horror stories there are like this; infuriates me. I'm sorry this happened, it can be so degrading and discouraging, but please keep trying if you think this is something you need. I have only similar experiences so unfortunately I can't say it will get better, but some of the other comments seem to have better ideas :)",
