  "selftext": "Why do some people feel the need to comment on what I order? It always happens especially when I order sandwiches from places like Subway. This is the encounter I had today:\n\nWorker: what would you like\n\nMe: A sub on Italian with turkey and cheddar cheese and that's it.\n\nW: That's it? No sauce?\n\nM: No\n\nW: No veggies or anything?\n\nM: No\n\nW: Are you sure?\n\nM: Yes\n\nW: This just feels wrong...\n\nM: Okay\n\nLike it's just annoying. I know no harm no foul is intended but seriously. If I wanted other stuff I would've said so! I love the workers who don't question it, I always tip them if it's allowed.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/vwkfvylmvba81.gif",

A couple regulars that stand out in my mind... a dude who got a meatball sub with an excessive amount of mayo on it, and a lady who wanted a turkey sub on white with only tomatoes on it, but she wanted the maters toasted on the sub (usually we put veggies on after toasting) and she wanted the sucker practically burnt! I never ever shamed anyone for their food choices and I made sure to do whatever it was they wanted done to their sub to make it their own special experience.
