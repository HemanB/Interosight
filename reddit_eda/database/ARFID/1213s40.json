My safe foods definitely aren't the healthiest but what I've done is I've put half of it away. For example, if you eat four slices of pizza, eat two. Focus on chewing and having water (or whatever safe drink) and it should keep you fuller longer. \nCombo foods is also helpful, like getting a cheese pizza but putting an unsafe food on a quarter of the pizza. You only have to try it once and if you don't like it it's fine. Same thing with buying a side salad or vegetables or fruits. Try it once, if you don't like it, it's understandable. \nTalking about it with my therapist helped me understand why I have arfid as well as what caused it and it made me feel less ashamed. And if you trust your therapist you could ask to bring in unsafe foods and try them with your therapist. They're the least judgemental people I know lol.",

So if potatoes are your safe food, that\u2019s a great safe food to have. Even just plain or salted potatoes have a lot of nutrients!",

You can even switch the cheeses to some healthier ones and try to reduce cheese and oil overall. Having a protein with this could be great - look into what you would like. ( if u are like me and hate any protein options you can go for protein shakes!). \nI remember some cake recipes for picky eaters (I\u2019m sorry for saying this but the video was taking about this) showed how one could add vegetable and protein like chickpeas while baking cakes and bread it wouldn\u2019t be noticeable see if u can do that\n\nI think including some vegetable/salad/protein would be helpful- even if it\u2019s one bite. (For example I hated cucumbers all my life until I dipped it in hummus and I can eat a vegetable now yay even though I can eat it with only hummus hehe) \n\nAnyways good luck u can do it!",
