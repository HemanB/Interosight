  "selftext": "So my best friend and mom just tried to make me try a tomato sauce on cheese pasta. I like the pasta,  I thought it tasted great by itself with just the cheese. But for them that wasn't enough. I had to try something new today. \n\nI mean they did ask me and I just said \"yeah alright i can TRY to try it\". It didn't work out, and we ended up standing there for an hour with me crying while holding the pasta with sauce on it in my hand and them staring in disbelief. It triggered an anxiety attack and I couldn't breathe, and I completely lost the little appetite I had. I'm still not hungry even now cause I keep thinking about it. \n\nThey are extremely disappointed in me. And to be honest, im pretty disappointed in myself too. My friend asked me WHY I couldn't try it, and I couldn't give her a straight answer. Cause it's an irrational fear. It doesn't make sense to even me but this still happens every time I try to get outside my comfort zone. I hate living like this. I just don't know what to do anymore\n\nEdit: thank you to everyone for the advice and sharing your personal experiences!! It's helped me a lot and it's nice to know I'm not alone\u2665\ufe0f",

We know how to use forks. \n\nIf there was a completely rational for why some foods\u2014particularly new foods\u2014are just a struggle, ARFID wouldn\u2019t be a disorder. It would just be a mood we would recover from the next day. A fad. \n\nI wish! Please don\u2019t feel bad about this situation. ARFID isn\u2019t a team sport beyond you and your therapist. You can bring in whomever you want went you want \u2014 when you\u2019re ready and on your terms.",

(I mean, even people who *do* suffer from anxiety struggle to understand people who have *different* anxieties!)\n\nI will say, that as someone who has struggled with many anxieties throughout my life, the answer for me has been really pushing myself to do the thing my anxiety is screaming at me not to do. It's so scary at first! For me, the worst things are making phone calls and driving. My anxiety gets so intense and uncontrollable. But I've found that the more I force myself to make those phone calls and drive -- to try new things, and eat things that are out of my comfort zone -- the easier and more tolerable it becomes. My therapist put it this great way that has stuck with me: \"tolerating negative emotions is like working out a muscle. If you never do it, it's going to be incredibly hard. But if you start small, and go slow, it will get easier the more you practice.\" I have found this to be true. The more I push myself to drive, the more confident I feel driving, and the less anxiety I feel the *next* time I have to drive. It's honestly *very* counter-intuitive!\n\nWhat if you made a list of new foods that you'd be willing to try? Doesn't have to be all at once, and *you* should be the one deciding what's on the list--not your family or friends. That way, you're in control of the process. Then, maybe once a week, you could try one of the things you've decided you want to get better at tolerating? It's not about making the phobia go away immediately (wish that were possible), but it is about pushing back and making the phobia a little weaker. Or, if once a week seems overwhelming, what about every 2-3 weeks? We're all different, and you know yourself best. Small, manageable goals is key!",
