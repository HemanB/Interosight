  "selftext": "I\u2019ve struggled with this disorder my whole life but I didn\u2019t start getting fat until junior high/high school. I was only chubby at that time but then when I hit 22 years I gained massive amounts of weight all over my body and now I\u2019m almost borderline obese according to BMI. The only foods I can tolerate are very unhealthy such as fried chicken, steak or any kind of red meat, seafood, pasta, bread and the occasional fruit like apples. I can\u2019t stomach any kind of vegetable and I can barely tolerate most fruit. I also don\u2019t like water so I mainly just drink sugar free soda, grape juice or chocolate milk. I\u2019ve tried changing for years but it didn\u2019t work so I\u2019m basically stuck in this body. Does anyone else struggle with being overweight with ARFID or it just me?",

I'll have a year or so of being \"overweight\" (just barely) and then a year where I'm at a healthy weight. It's super weird and I struggle a lot with the insecurity that comes with it.\n\nI'm so used to people saying they're *underweight* because of it, so I always felt like an outsider even in the ARFID community. I don't eat any seafood, no meats besides fried chicken or bacon, no fruits or veggies unless they're blended/juiced... I used to hate water so I would compromise by drinking flavoured water using stuff like crystal light or Mio or Propel. Now I can only drink water if it's basically ice cold.\n\nI also replaced my soda addiction for fruit juice in the hopes of getting a little more nutrients in me. I also started going for walks a while back just to get a bit of movement - it's not \"working out\" or vigorous exercise but at least I get a little cardio in, so to speak. I also try to prevent myself from snacking too much, which can help a little.",

Suddenly I\u2019m snacking all the time, thinking about food constantly. And yeah, I\u2019ve gained 25 pounds since then and I can\u2019t seem to stop gaining weight. I\u2019m getting pretty freaked out and trying to lose weight by doing calories in/calories out. Even thinking about stopping the meds but idk what that would do to my anxiety and food anxiety especially. So you\u2019re not alone",

I started working in an office and living on the second floor of an apartment compared to walking around college campus and living on a third floor walk up with high ceilings on each floor (historic building). My lifestyle changed but my eating did not. Actually it may have gotten worse because I would get a muffin and a big smoothie (mint cream, not fruit) on many mornings. I hit the heaviest I\u2019ve ever been back last summer and then through December. In January of this year I started using an app to count my calories and I\u2019ve lost 46 pounds! No exercise or weird diet foods just portion control.\n\nMy comfort food is pasta with butter and cheese. I love fried chicken (no bones tho so basically chicken tenders) and French fries. I hate salad and sandwiches and veggies. My diet is mostly junk food. I know I will not get to my ultimate goal weight without exercise (ugh but it\u2019s so hot in the summer). It\u2019s a big struggle to diet with ARFID so I applaud you!\n\nInstead of chocolate milk maybe look into Ensure (located near pharmacy). They have a protein option that\u2019s less than 200 calories and tastes good! It\u2019s expensive but it helps me get my vitamins in. Instead of soda and juice have you tried vitamin water? Or Gatorade even? Both have zero calorie options and can be very sweet. \n\nBest of luck with everything!!!",

I hit the heaviest I\u2019ve ever been back last summer and then through December. In January of this year I started using an app to count my calories and I\u2019ve lost 46 pounds! No exercise or weird diet foods just portion control.\n\nMy comfort food is pasta with butter and cheese. I love fried chicken (no bones tho so basically chicken tenders) and French fries. I hate salad and sandwiches and veggies. My diet is mostly junk food. I know I will not get to my ultimate goal weight without exercise (ugh but it\u2019s so hot in the summer). It\u2019s a big struggle to diet with ARFID so I applaud you!\n\nInstead of chocolate milk maybe look into Ensure (located near pharmacy). They have a protein option that\u2019s less than 200 calories and tastes good! It\u2019s expensive but it helps me get my vitamins in. Instead of soda and juice have you tried vitamin water? Or Gatorade even? Both have zero calorie options and can be very sweet. \n\nBest of luck with everything!!!",

          "body": "YES!! I also struggle with emotional eating, so it's like a double whammy. But it was the same story for me, I started gaining weight my senior year of high school and now I fluctuate. I'll have a year or so of being \"overweight\" (just barely) and then a year where I'm at a healthy weight. It's super weird and I struggle a lot with the insecurity that comes with it.\n\nI'm so used to people saying they're *underweight* because of it, so I always felt like an outsider even in the ARFID community. I don't eat any seafood, no meats besides fried chicken or bacon, no fruits or veggies unless they're blended/juiced... I used to hate water so I would compromise by drinking flavoured water using stuff like crystal light or Mio or Propel. Now I can only drink water if it's basically ice cold.\n\nI also replaced my soda addiction for fruit juice in the hopes of getting a little more nutrients in me. I also started going for walks a while back just to get a bit of movement - it's not \"working out\" or vigorous exercise but at least I get a little cardio in, so to speak. I also try to prevent myself from snacking too much, which can help a little.",

I only do it for about 20 minutes every other day and the difference in the last few months has been insane. Also, liking seafood can really work in your favour. Do you like sushi at all? Tinned sardines? Smoked fish fillets? Mackerel is my fave, I eat fish every day. Let me know if you want any help getting started with weights.",
