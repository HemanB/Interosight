It came out with giant jalape\u00f1o slices all over. Lowkey ready to just try eating the one or two chips that didn\u2019t have jalape\u00f1os until my dad grabbed the plate and went to get the order fixed. I know that the staff don\u2019t really judge and aren\u2019t paid enough to care but as the customer I feel so high maintenance and childish for asking for all these accommodations. Totally get choosing to stick to the restaurants I know instead of risking stuff like that again.",

Imo, you probably would have been fine as long as you didn\u2019t eat the jalape\u00f1os ((instant panic attack))",
