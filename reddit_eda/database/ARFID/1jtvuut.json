The texture and sounds of eating them engage my gag reflex, even just the smell can be enough to make me gag. Makes you feel like a toddler having to spit into a napkin so you don't projectile while you're out at dinner with a group of people. \n\nIt's also a cultural staple, and I wouldn't want to be rude in asking someone to remove it when they make food for me from their culture. So it crosses out some interesting dishes from other cultures and makes me feel like I am being ungrateful and uncultured for not being able to eat it. Not eating dishes with them from my own culture is one thing and thankfully half of my family has a similar hatred of onions. I really wish that I could at least tolerate them.",
