  "selftext": "I need to vent. I\u2019ve yet to share the word ARFID with my family but they know my eating habits. At Thanksgiving dinner my plate had 2 items. It isn\u2019t anything new or shocking.\n\nSo I was very surprised to overhear my brother in law mention a friend\u2019s \u2018weird eating\u2019 and how they went to a restaurant where she couldn\u2019t find anything to eat on the menu so she made the chef make fried chicken. Then another time where she only ordered rice. He made a big stink about how \u2018inconvenient\u2019 she was for the chef & how \u2018ridiculous\u2019 it was. My own sisters even joined in starting to call the woman weird.\n\nI get my bro in law being crass as he doesn\u2019t know me well, but my sisters that did really shocked me by joining in. I didn\u2019t cry but wanted to, because if I wasn\u2019t related to them I know they would talk about me this way.\n\nI just hate how socially acceptable it is to belittle an ARFID person, even to the point of doing it right in front of another ARFID person. I just had to vent.",
