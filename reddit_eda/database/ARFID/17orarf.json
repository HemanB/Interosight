I eat once a day, yet I'm still fat because the only things I can tolerate consuming are junk from dieticians' nightmares. So of course I'm just picky and entitled.\n\n(The DSM-V criteria for ARFID doesn't even require you to be underweight either, but that part's ignored on most websites.)",

I can do... 3 or 4 vegetables comfortably now, but fresh food is so inconsistent on texture and flavour, they often make me feel sick or like I have lead in my stomach, even if I ate that food yesterday and the day before. \n\nProcessed food is bad for us, but always looks and tastes the same (pretty much). In terms of diet I'm probably the healthiest I've ever been but I'm also not far off the heaviest. \n\nAdd in the ADHD, and I am very bad for snacking and seeking sugar.

      "body": "I've been dealing with the same issue for years. Nobody takes my ARFID seriously because I'm not skinny even though I have a history of literally passing out due to not eating. Something that has really helped me advocate for myself is getting consistent bloodwork done and having a way to see the results (a lot of healthcare systems have apps you can use for this). Even if you aren't underweight, severe malnutrition is really common in people with ARFID, so next time you go to the doctors request to get bloodwork to test for malnutrition (your psychiatrist can request bloodwork for it too). I've been doing this for about a year, so now every time I go to the doctors and they don't believe I have ARFID, I make them pull up all my test results that show that I've been chronically malnourished for the past year. In my experience, if you challenge your doctor and show that you're knowledgeable about your health (aka you googled your results and say that they prove you're malnourished), doctors tend to change their attitudes realllll quick and start taking you seriously. Hope this helps!!",

I am used to telling people that atypical anorexia exists and that bulimia doesn't mean you're skinny. But most people I met (even professionals) look at me like I'm crazy when I mention ARFID. I know there are three types of ARFID:\n\u2022 one being lacking in nutrition but being able to eat, which often has those people are overweight BMIs\n\u2022one being unable to eat because of senory issues, leading to normal or underweight BMIs\n\u2022one being lacking interest/desire to eat or lacking  hunger leading most often to underweight BMIs \n\nBUT, that doesn't mean it doesn't fucking suck when people (especially doctors) mention how I'm morbidly obese so \"I can't possibly struggle to eat.\" It honestly makes me want to scream.",

My weight comes from a lack of exercise and eating high sugar safe foods when I'm anxious or upset....which is often now that I'm doing my Master's.\n\nI remember the first time I actually told someone about my issues with food. It was a group of coworkers I had years ago. They kept commenting on how all I ever ate was salad. At the time, salads were my only safe food. I told them I literally only ever eat salads, and someone laughed and commented about my weight. That time, it was just my lack of exercise/depression that was affecting my weight.  I gave up on trying to get people to understand the issue I have with food after that. \n\nThere was actually a time when I got compliments about my weight because I'd lost some weight that was noticeable. Whenever people asked, I acted as if I didn't notice or had any idea what they were talking about. That's because at the time, I was having a lot of anxiety around my first relationship, and my only safe food was McDonald's. I lost weight from just eating a cheeseburger and chips every day. I knew people wouldn't believe me, so I kept quiet. My ex was the only one who noticed that I straight up refused to eat anything that wasn't a cheeseburger or chips, and he spent most of our dinner dates eating by himself. ARFID is wild.",
