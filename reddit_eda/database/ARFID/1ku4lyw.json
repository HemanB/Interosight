  "selftext": "Hi, I just joined this sub tonight. I\u2019m 18, and I\u2019ve been suffering from ARFID since I was around 2 or 3. I don\u2019t eat any fruits or vegetables, and the only meat I eat is pepperoni on pizza. I am severely malnutritioned, and I only eat around 5 foods. (not including some snack foods) I am  extremely underweight for a girl my age, and I can never seem to get past 120lbs. I have bruises all over my body from the lack of vitamins, I\u2019m constantly lightheaded and dizzy, and my hands shake like crazy 24/7 to the point where people make fun of me for it. I also typically only eat once or twice a day, and my meals are usually just cereal and french fries.\n\nLately, I have been very afraid. I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about my future, and if I really even have one. How long will I live? How long can my body go on like this? If I do live a long life, what health issues will I face in the long run? So I\u2019ve come here to ask\u2026 What\u2019s the average life expectancy for someone with ARFID as severe as mine? Will I die young? ",

      "body": "I (soon to be 33f) ARFID pretty much my whole life and went vegetarian when I was 13. Don\u2019t really have an appetite so have to force myself to eat even like one meal like item a day and some days I don\u2019t even do that. Mostly live off pasta, cheese, bread, potato, occasional egg, occasional mock meat, other random junk food.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely not the healthiest and I feel like just in the past year I\u2019ve been dealing with more health problems because of it. Still have to go to the doctor but having issues with my feet/ankles which could very well be diabetes related.\n\nHave you been checked out by a doctor get your vitamin levels checked and such? I know I\u2019m also anemic. Do you take any vitamins? I know growing up I hated taking any type of pills and it still can be hard. I personally take gummy multivitamins in the morning and then when I have my main meal at night I take an iron, a d3, and a 8 essentials vitamin (as they are smaller than a true multivitamin). I also use a protein powder in any powder mixture that gets baked (biscuits/pizza crust/pancakes etc) Finding and buying any type of fortified foods you may like is also a good idea.\n\nI\u2019m over 5\u20197\u201d and pretty sure at your age I was sitting at like 118lbs for years. Then was probably in the mid 120s for some of my 20s. Now in my 30s last I knew/checked was in the mid 130s. So still skinny but steadily putting on weight which is easier as you get older. \n\nI would consider seeing a doctor for blood work seeing what vitamins you specifically need a boost on or to address any other health concerns. Not in much of a place to help myself but just little baby steps in the right direction can make a big difference. As most anything is likely going to be healthier than your current food intake. If that is vitamins, fortified foods, slight variations  of the foods you currently eat to start adding more variation to your diet. Like one of the simpler moves I\u2019ve been making is from plain/white bread/pasta products to ones with more whole grain (hidden vegetable pasta is a thing too).",

      "body": "I\u2019m in my 50s and still alive. I had ARFID as soon as I came out of the womb - problems with breast milk, the only soy formula on the market only kinda worked so had to be modified, and the minute I was given solid food I was like \u201cnope I don\u2019t like this not at all\u201d. If possible try snacking more as I found that helped. Dry cereal works if you can\u2019t manage anything else. I always kept snacks on me and had a few bites between classes and at my desk at work. Add supplements to help with the vitamin deficiencies. My mom started me on them as a toddler I think. Ask a doctor to do a full blood work up to figure out what supplements you need/where your deficiencies are. If you\u2019re like many of us and find taking pills difficult try using a straw. \n\nTry to find a protein drink or meal supplement drink you can tolerate and have 1-2 a day to make up for missed meals. Many people like Fairlife as well as various Ensure options. It\u2019s not easy finding one that works but it\u2019ll help you feel better. I went through some 5-10 protein drinks and powders before I found one that worked for me. Use a straw as it helps with the taste. Don\u2019t throw out what you can\u2019t finish. Put it in the fridge and drink more an hour later. It\u2019s fine if it takes 3 hours to drink a single bottle. Add extra sugar or a packet of carnation essential chocolate or strawberry to help with the taste and getting more calories. If it\u2019s too thick dilute it with a little milk. \n\nI spent up until my 30s underweight, dizzy spells, lightheaded, and bruised. I did have more variety in what I ate than you did but I had most of the same symptoms. Most of those symptoms are gone now as long as I maintain a weight over 150 lb. No idea why the weight requirement but I\u2019m mostly able to maintain that now.\n\nIt\u2019s entirely possible to increase your safe foods once you get your body used to eating more and at regular times.\n\nARFID is really hard on our mind and spirit not just our body.

It\u2019s like trying to drive a car with no gas - eventually it\u2019s going to sputter and struggle. Everyone here is familiar with the sensation. \n\nI know this sounds impossible right now, but people can recover from ARFID. It\u2019s hard, very hard.  But it can be done with self love and a lot of patience with yourself. \n\nThe thing is, you will need medical help too. Your body needs some serious TLC to get stabilized before you can even think about the food stuff.

That being said, my only source of protein is dairy. I have pretty much only eaten Mac and cheese my whole life. I found yogurt to be safe and with that I was eventually able to introduce myself to smoothies with strawberry and banana because I liked the sweet taste. When I was around 18 is when I started adding protein powder to the smoothies. At that time we also found protein drinks I could eat. That didn\u2019t hurt my stomach. I pretty much only like fair life nutrition plan shakes. Do you like chocolate milk? Most of the other protein drinks are gritty and gross but this one is okay. From my personal opinion, you need help. It is very difficult to introduce new foods to yourself on your own. And once you start doing that, keeping up with exposures is a battle because those fear foods do not feel safe. I can barely look at my fear foods as food. If it is possible, I would start looking for a dietician/nutritionist that can see you in person. Also, inpatient/residential may be the best idea. Nevertheless, you have to hold onto that part of you that wants to feed your body, the scared part that wants to live and doesn\u2019t want to die.

They are Seroquel (mood stabilizer for bipolar disorder, that I also use for its side effects of increased appetite and sedation to help me sleep) and in the past I had taken Mirtazapine (same side effects but didn't work for me in the long run).\n\n2. Forcing down protein shakes. I have only ever been able to tolerate chocolate Boost. Tastes like a normal shake, although makes my tummy hurt and doesn't fill me up long. Still, can be a huge help on days that are VERY hard to eat actual food.\n\n3. Bear with me as this may sound ridiculous, but meditation. Seriously. I meditate twice daily for 20 minutes each session. If you commit to it long term, I SWEAR it helps shift your mindset, which has helped me feel less anxiety surrounding eating.\n\nUnfortunately I only have discovered ARFID within the last year or two at a time when I cannot afford therapy for it, but if you can do that, I bet it will help tremendously. Like in-person therapist visits. I have years upon years of experience with therapy for other stuff and that has made me come a long way mentally which, again, still helps now a little bit for ARFID.\n\nBest of luck, please stay safe.",

      "body": "Hey, it sounds like you have a lot of depression to go along with your symptoms. I'm not expert, but given how much you've said you lack motivation for things, I think it might be helpful to look into. Sometimes motivation isn't a matter of willpower, it's a chemical issue, and it might be worth looking into that if it's a very big barrier to your eating. \n\nI think its also worth looking into the book \"colour, taste, texture\" it's a book written by someone who frequents this subreddit and I think itd be a useful tool for you and possibly your family to help you identify what *your* arfid looks like for *you* and how to work with it instead of struggling against it. \n\nOther than this, I would suggest getting some kind of reminder bracelets, ones with the little tags you can write on, to remind you of when you've eaten. Whiteboard slap bracelets could also be helpful for you.\n\nI'd suggest also trying to remove barriers to your eating. Make eating easier for yourself, have food somewhere accessible, and somewhere that makes you feel safe. Put food in your room, make your shakes easy to prepare, maybe premeasure them. \n\nThis is hard. Its going to be hard. But there's still hope. You can do this. It won't be easy, and over anything else I've said, I encourage you to talk to your doctor. Even in the worst case scenarios, there are options for you. There's a ton of different feeding tubes out there, and not all of them are as uncomfortable looking as nasal tubes. \n\nYou'll be okay. You can do this. I hope this helps, I tried not to mention things too much that others have already said. If you need someone to talk to, my dms are open. I wish you the best of luck.",

I got B12 with C injections. I ate once a day, usually white rice with butter or ramen noodles.\u00a0\n\n\nThe answer is yes, if you stay how you are you'll die young, but you've got an advantage I didn't, ARFID is a recognized disorder now. Doctors had no idea how I got to that point, now they do, you just need to find the right help.\u00a0\n\n\nUntil you do, try supplements if you can swallow pills. I'm talking all the supplements. C, D, super B with folate, I took a Prenatal daily vitamin, coq-10, magnesium...\nTry to find a nutrition shake you like. Carnation instant breakfast shakes were pretty good for me, or chocolate slim fast. Ensure isn't bad. Add water enhancers to your drinks that have vitamins.\u00a0\nThese are short term measures that will help keep you alive.\n\n\nI never got help from a doctor beyond finding out my levels. I figured out more nutritional safe foods through trial and error (a lot still aren't \"healthy\", like potatoes with cheese, bacon, and green onions, but that's potassium, vitamin D, fats, protein, and a bit of veg). Take it slow, i threw out so much food over the years, and that's OK.\u00a0\n\n\nI've finally found a balance for my body. I'm 5'2 129lbs and I'll be 40 in 2 months, so you can come back from the brink.\u00a0\n\n\nMy organs are working (kidneys are still a little iffy sometimes, and i lost my gallbladder and part of my liver, but the liver grew back). My bones have started healing from the stress fractures. My hair is back. I got eye surgery and my vision is back. Still have no teeth lol, but I've got great dentures and no one can tell.\u00a0\n\n\nThat being said, my mom's diet is similar to yours and she never changed anything and is still here at 69. She lost her teeth in her 20s too, and her heart just stopped working 2 years ago, but luckily it's back to normal after months in the hospital. We sneak zucchini in her paprikash after she ate it once with it and didn't realize or have issues. Can't get her to eat fruit, but she'll eat corn or peas.\u00a0\n\n\nThe human body is an amazing machine that can bounce back if the right combo is figured out. I'd try searching for therapist who specialize in EDS. MOST, not all, get extra certifications in it. I'm working on it right now. It's hard to give advice for this disorder because it's so complex, but what I said is what worked for me. A variation might work for you.\u00a0",

Mostly live off pasta, cheese, bread, potato, occasional egg, occasional mock meat, other random junk food.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely not the healthiest and I feel like just in the past year I\u2019ve been dealing with more health problems because of it. Still have to go to the doctor but having issues with my feet/ankles which could very well be diabetes related.\n\nHave you been checked out by a doctor get your vitamin levels checked and such? I know I\u2019m also anemic. Do you take any vitamins? I know growing up I hated taking any type of pills and it still can be hard. I personally take gummy multivitamins in the morning and then when I have my main meal at night I take an iron, a d3, and a 8 essentials vitamin (as they are smaller than a true multivitamin). I also use a protein powder in any powder mixture that gets baked (biscuits/pizza crust/pancakes etc) Finding and buying any type of fortified foods you may like is also a good idea.\n\nI\u2019m over 5\u20197\u201d and pretty sure at your age I was sitting at like 118lbs for years. Then was probably in the mid 120s for some of my 20s. Now in my 30s last I knew/checked was in the mid 130s. So still skinny but steadily putting on weight which is easier as you get older. \n\nI would consider seeing a doctor for blood work seeing what vitamins you specifically need a boost on or to address any other health concerns. Not in much of a place to help myself but just little baby steps in the right direction can make a big difference. As most anything is likely going to be healthier than your current food intake. If that is vitamins, fortified foods, slight variations  of the foods you currently eat to start adding more variation to your diet. Like one of the simpler moves I\u2019ve been making is from plain/white bread/pasta products to ones with more whole grain (hidden vegetable pasta is a thing too).",

If possible try snacking more as I found that helped. Dry cereal works if you can\u2019t manage anything else. I always kept snacks on me and had a few bites between classes and at my desk at work.

Ask a doctor to do a full blood work up to figure out what supplements you need/where your deficiencies are. If you\u2019re like many of us and find taking pills difficult try using a straw. \n\nTry to find a protein drink or meal supplement drink you can tolerate and have 1-2 a day to make up for missed meals. Many people like Fairlife as well as various Ensure options. It\u2019s not easy finding one that works but it\u2019ll help you feel better.

Put it in the fridge and drink more an hour later. It\u2019s fine if it takes 3 hours to drink a single bottle.

Do you feel judged by people around you? Pressured to eat different things? Do you feel like you shouldn't eat too much of the things you like? All of those things can contribute negatively to your eating just as much as the ARFID itself, so maybe there's things that can help on that side!\n\n  \nI'll tell you right now: The things you can eat, please eat as much of it as you can, as often as you wish.

I'm not expert, but given how much you've said you lack motivation for things, I think it might be helpful to look into. Sometimes motivation isn't a matter of willpower, it's a chemical issue, and it might be worth looking into that if it's a very big barrier to your eating. \n\nI think its also worth looking into the book \"colour, taste, texture\" it's a book written by someone who frequents this subreddit and I think itd be a useful tool for you and possibly your family to help you identify what *your* arfid looks like for *you* and how to work with it instead of struggling against it. \n\nOther than this, I would suggest getting some kind of reminder bracelets, ones with the little tags you can write on, to remind you of when you've eaten. Whiteboard slap bracelets could also be helpful for you.\n\nI'd suggest also trying to remove barriers to your eating. Make eating easier for yourself, have food somewhere accessible, and somewhere that makes you feel safe. Put food in your room, make your shakes easy to prepare, maybe premeasure them. \n\nThis is hard. Its going to be hard. But there's still hope. You can do this. It won't be easy, and over anything else I've said, I encourage you to talk to your doctor. Even in the worst case scenarios, there are options for you. There's a ton of different feeding tubes out there, and not all of them are as uncomfortable looking as nasal tubes. \n\nYou'll be okay. You can do this. I hope this helps, I tried not to mention things too much that others have already said. If you need someone to talk to, my dms are open. I wish you the best of luck.",

I went to a partial hospitalization program in 2020 and mostly through exposure therapy, I am now able to comfortably eat hundreds if not thousands of foods and I try new things all the time.

If possible try snacking more as I found that helped. Dry cereal works if you can\u2019t manage anything else. I always kept snacks on me and had a few bites between classes and at my desk at work. Add supplements to help with the vitamin deficiencies. My mom started me on them as a toddler I think. Ask a doctor to do a full blood work up to figure out what supplements you need/where your deficiencies are. If you\u2019re like many of us and find taking pills difficult try using a straw. \n\nTry to find a protein drink or meal supplement drink you can tolerate and have 1-2 a day to make up for missed meals. Many people like Fairlife as well as various Ensure options. It\u2019s not easy finding one that works but it\u2019ll help you feel better. I went through some 5-10 protein drinks and powders before I found one that worked for me. Use a straw as it helps with the taste. Don\u2019t throw out what you can\u2019t finish. Put it in the fridge and drink more an hour later. It\u2019s fine if it takes 3 hours to drink a single bottle. Add extra sugar or a packet of carnation essential chocolate or strawberry to help with the taste and getting more calories. If it\u2019s too thick dilute it with a little milk. \n\nI spent up until my 30s underweight, dizzy spells, lightheaded, and bruised. I did have more variety in what I ate than you did but I had most of the same symptoms. Most of those symptoms are gone now as long as I maintain a weight over 150 lb. No idea why the weight requirement but I\u2019m mostly able to maintain that now.\n\nIt\u2019s entirely possible to increase your safe foods once you get your body used to eating more and at regular times.\n\nARFID is really hard on our mind and spirit not just our body.

There are also virtual partial hospitalization programs for people that live too far away from a hospital. Basically you're on a video call with everyone else in your cohort and various health professionals for those 6-10 hours. It's not ARFID specific (at least Ive never heard of an ARFID specific one) so you need to make sure wherever you go has experience with ARFID. Honestly, I'd consider other options before PHP because of that, I was just saying what helped me. If you're motivated, especially if you have a good support system around you, I think a much less intensive treatment could be fine.",

          "body": "I (soon to be 33f) ARFID pretty much my whole life and went vegetarian when I was 13. Don\u2019t really have an appetite so have to force myself to eat even like one meal like item a day and some days I don\u2019t even do that. Mostly live off pasta, cheese, bread, potato, occasional egg, occasional mock meat, other random junk food.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely not the healthiest and I feel like just in the past year I\u2019ve been dealing with more health problems because of it. Still have to go to the doctor but having issues with my feet/ankles which could very well be diabetes related.\n\nHave you been checked out by a doctor get your vitamin levels checked and such? I know I\u2019m also anemic. Do you take any vitamins? I know growing up I hated taking any type of pills and it still can be hard. I personally take gummy multivitamins in the morning and then when I have my main meal at night I take an iron, a d3, and a 8 essentials vitamin (as they are smaller than a true multivitamin). I also use a protein powder in any powder mixture that gets baked (biscuits/pizza crust/pancakes etc) Finding and buying any type of fortified foods you may like is also a good idea.\n\nI\u2019m over 5\u20197\u201d and pretty sure at your age I was sitting at like 118lbs for years. Then was probably in the mid 120s for some of my 20s. Now in my 30s last I knew/checked was in the mid 130s. So still skinny but steadily putting on weight which is easier as you get older. \n\nI would consider seeing a doctor for blood work seeing what vitamins you specifically need a boost on or to address any other health concerns. Not in much of a place to help myself but just little baby steps in the right direction can make a big difference. As most anything is likely going to be healthier than your current food intake. If that is vitamins, fortified foods, slight variations  of the foods you currently eat to start adding more variation to your diet. Like one of the simpler moves I\u2019ve been making is from plain/white bread/pasta products to ones with more whole grain (hidden vegetable pasta is a thing too).",

I will go see a doctor about which vitamins i need, I know I definitely need more vitamin K and iron",

That way every morning when she started begging for food, I'd have a physical reminder to take them. It really helped me get in the habit. \n\nOtherwise there's lots of other suggestions out there for how to remember daily meds. \n\nAs for your original question, all I can give you is a bit of hope that treatment can work. I was never as severe as you, I probably had at least 30 foods I could eat comfortably (tho they were often different versions of the same food i.e. fries, potato wedges, baked potatoes, etc). I went to a partial hospitalization program in 2020 and mostly through exposure therapy, I am now able to comfortably eat hundreds if not thousands of foods and I try new things all the time. I still struggle with tastes and textures and it's a constant fight to not go back to my old habits, but it's literally a life-changing difference.",
