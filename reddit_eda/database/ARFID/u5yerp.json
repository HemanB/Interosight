  "selftext": "Sitting at Easter dinner right now. Multiple comments on my lack of eating, even though these people know I\u2019ve been doing this every holiday for years. Y\u2019all know the comments I don\u2019t even have to quote them :/ I love Easter- I love the colors, the candy, I love bunnies- but every years it\u2019s the same. I cry at this same table every year after having the spotlight stuck on me and have to compose myself in the bathroom each time. Happy Easter, hope all you guys are having nicer dinner experiences today <3",
