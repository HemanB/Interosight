  "selftext": "tonight by bf cooked a ham pizza that was a different brand than the one I eat at home. I said ok it's still ham and cheese it's gonna be ok but when I got it out of the oven I saw it had onion slices on it. It grossed me out a lot but I managed to just take it off and still eat it:) normally I wouldn't eat anything that touched something I don't like but I did eat this pizza!! wasn't a big fan of it but I did it",
