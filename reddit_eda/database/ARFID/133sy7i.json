  "selftext": "i wish i had a better way of getting this message around online, but as im just a teen with no online presence, r/arfid is my best bet\n\n**tw anorexia, bulimia, unhealthy restrictions**\n\nThe Mt. Sinai Eating Disorder Clinic of new york is supposed to be one of the best ed clinics in new york. it might be good for anorexia and bulimia, but its bad for arfid\n\nthey will impose strict eating rules (sleeves rolled up, hands always in staff\u2019s sight, must eat everything given to you within 30 minutes, you must talk to staff while using bathroom to prevent bulimic behavior, no washing hands after meal, etc) on you that may be helpful for anorexics etc but are harmful for arfid patients. the staff have an extremely lacking understanding of ARFID and my impression from them is that they dont even know what it is.\n\nthe group therapy they do is extremely weight-oriented and body image oriented. not for arfid patients.\n\nif you are nauseous after a meal and/or having a panic attack, they are not helpful. they had no respect for my triggers either. the staff were rude and cold and unforgiving. i left the clinic for good after 2 days wrought with trauma that i still have today.\n\nTL;DR: not trying to trauma dump but to trauma *prevent*. if you have arfid do not go to the mt sinai ed clinic, you will leave more broken than when you entered",

      "body": "I went to McCallum Place in St. Louis, MO for most of my treatment (I went to treatment multiple times). It was good for me gaining weight and trying some foods, but not for much else. I developed body image issues in the center because I was forced to go to that group each week. They have a three week rotation of meals. I don\u2019t know what to call it, they have a meal schedule that are scheduled for three week then repeats. Very unhelpful for me since I needed to try different foods. Everybody there was there for more than three weeks. Eating the same foods got boring for everyone. I was in the adolescent unit all four times I was there. I was residential for the first time I was there. It was hard being the only residential person from St. Louis while everyone who was also residential were out of state. PHP (where people got to go home each night) was also with us and it was hard seeing everyone else (a majority) leave each night while I had to stay. There were also kids (11-12 year olds) that were put in the adolescent unit because there was no where else to put them. So we couldn\u2019t talk to about teen stuff and couldn\u2019t watch movies rated above PG. I\u2019ve also heard of an eight year old with the adolescents. I didn\u2019t like that place. Also, they made us sit all the time. Except when they made us stand for 5-10 minutes while waiting for the staff to check the meals (while the other units just got to sit down because their food was already checked). I basically learned that \u201cstanding is exercise and exercise is bad\u201d. For a short while after treatment I felt bad doing yoga because it\u2019s exercise (even though we did yoga in treatment).",

I had a similar experience.\n\nThere was a lot of pressure to finish your plate otherwise you\u2019d get a supplement. I would literally gag as I tried to force down foods I knew I couldn\u2019t eat. There were foods I managed to tolerate enough just to finish the plate that I\u2019ve never eaten again. It was so humiliating to know that every week there were certain meals where I couldn\u2019t eat anything and would have to just sit at the table staring at it and wait until it was time to go. \n\nThey encouraged exposure therapy, but it was at my discretion and pace. They accused me of being resistant to treatment because my bigger issue was a mood disorder, NOT my ED, and therefore didn\u2019t relate to most of the treatment methods. I did end up in recovery from atypical anorexia, but I will probably be relapsing again soon because it never really helped my extremely unhealthy relationship with food.",

      "body": "Same exact thing with Alsana!!! DO NOT GO TO ALSANA IF YOU HAVE ARFID!!! I BEG YOU!!!\n\nHad the worst experience with Alsana Residential St. Louis. After WEEKS of talking with their clinicians and doctors about if they treat ARFID at their programs and lots of reassurance, I starved at this treatment center.\n\nWhen I first got there, they threw me directly into meal times without meeting any members of my team (dietitian, therapist, etc.) and refused to cater to any of my safe foods/ARFID resurrections. It took me bawling my eyes out and begging for help for a staff member to finally go get me a therapist to talk to. I was gaslighted about my ARFID and told that if I didn\u2019t eat the food available, I would have to drink Boost and no other exceptions would be made. Prior to going and filling out the paperwork, I let the clinicians know that I only had about 10 safe foods I\u2019ve been eating for my entire life and they promised this would not be a problem and that they would offer these to me at the beginning and slowly introduce food exposures and food chaining. At meal times I begged the workers for food (I had only eaten one banana since I arrived at the beginning of the week) and even with meeting with a series of dietitians and therapists, I was told that I had to either \u201cchallenge the eating disorder\u201d or drink Boost (which is not one of my safe foods). I have never felt so dehumanized in my life at this place.\n\nIf you are thinking about going, feel free to message me any questions. I was so eager to get better and was considered a \u201cperfect candidate\u201d by their staff before I got there. I want to let anyone with ARFID know my story so that they don\u2019t make the same mistake that I did.\n\nI rearranged my entire life to go get treatment (ending my lease, moving away from my partner I\u2019ve lived with, going on leave for my job, spending money on plane tickets, etc.) and now I find myself having to move back into my parents house and having to rebuild my life after they promised I\u2019d be gone for months, getting better.\n\nOnce again, the sick has to become their own doctor. That\u2019s the reality of this disorder.\n\nOpen to any suggestions for ARFID treatment options out there!!",
