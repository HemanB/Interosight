It doesn\u2019t list ages but there are plenty of places that state 13 and under, even on the drive thru menu. However, a 13 and under kids meal refers to a meal option at a restaurant specifically **designed** for children aged 13 and younger because it typically includes smaller portions of popular kid-friendly foods like chicken nuggets, burgers, or macaroni and cheese. So it\u2019s designed to have smaller portions and the ages listed are really to give a heads up that it\u2019s smaller portions and kid-friendly items being offered. Rarely does a place say that you can\u2019t have it as an adult or that adults are excluded. Although, I have seen places where you can\u2019t order a kids meal without ordering an adult meal first. Saying something is \u201ckid sized\u201d is like saying something is \u2018fun sized\u2019. It\u2019s to let you know those candy bars aren\u2019t full sized and I know plenty of people that aren\u2019t fun and they still eat them\u2026\n\nCulver\u2019s single butter burger kids meal comes with a small fry and small drink. If I get the single butter burger value basket with a small fry and drink, it\u2019s about 60\u00a2 more for the same food. Increasing the cost of the kids meal would only shine more light on the fact that they are identical in terms of food provided and they would have to increase the cost of the value basket too, so the kids meal would still cost less; and let\u2019s not forget that not only does the kids meal cost less, you also get a coupon for a free frozen custard. So, there may be some truth to what the screenshot says but there\u2019s better ways of going about it than to just stop offering kids meals.",

I left that restaurant very satisfied, I was full but not to bursting. Satiated and not regretting that last bite. It was perfect, a perfectly sized portion and I never forgot that experience.\n\n  Good food experiences are rare for us.

I also mostly only eat out when traveling for work and hotels don't always have mini fridges or microwaves for leftovers. I'd love it if we had \"normal\" sized portions instead of forcing those of us who aren't big eaters to order off the kids' menu (which is a normal adult portion, anyway). I don't need a bucket of pasta that can feed a family of 4 for $20. I just need a normal-sized plate, which ideally would cost less than $20.",

So I would page through a cookbook and look for something that uses ingredients that I know I can eat. I discovered Cuq Au Vin, has many things I enjoy alone in it and when I made it myself it was amazing! So I went to this restaurant when they had it as a special.\n\n  The restaurant gives a little plate it really wasn't much food, of course it's a very rich dish aswell. I left that restaurant very satisfied, I was full but not to bursting. Satiated and not regretting that last bite. It was perfect, a perfectly sized portion and I never forgot that experience.\n\n  Good food experiences are rare for us. Also don't forget arfid is on a spectrum if my story makes it seem like I don't have it. I will dig my own grave over a carrot with a single drop of cool ranch on it. Lol",

Do you not know that a half sandwich can be made as a half sandwich without needing to make a full sandwich and cut it in half? The half portion can be made by itself, that's a fairly normal thing in kitchens. And if for some weird reason it must be made as a full portion every single time those two halves can still be split between two customers fairly easily. Your comment reads like someone who has no clue how commercial kitchens function, which is fine, but when speaking from a place of profound ignorance it's generally more functional to be curious rather than judgemental. Maybe try learning how things actually work before you tell people off in a way that is completely removed from reality. All you've done here is reveal your own foolishness.",
