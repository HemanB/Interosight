  "selftext": "My ARFID is pretty hard. My safe foods don't exist in any kind of restaurant, bar, or anything else, and it's making socialization sometimes impossible. Dating? No food can be involved. Making friends? Same. Workplace events? Can't eat anything. Family gatherings? Please kill me already, as they know and they'll be like \"Oh, you still only eat that while you're 27?\" Well yeah, indeed, and fuck you. I wish I wasn't blamed and I wish it were easier.\n\nRight now I'm fighting myself to go out, to jump out of my comfort zone. I'm a lesbian and wanted to go to the only lesbian bar in my city, because usually drinking is fine (except for most cocktails). They only serve food and cocktails. Like... really? I had gathered the courage, fought my inner fears, to go alone because I don't have friends at the moment, to meet people, to have fun, but I can't. I can't because I can't eat anything, and I can't be sure I'll like the cocktails beforehand. Fuck, fuck, fuck.",

Shameless lie but it gets them off your back \ud83d\ude05\nIn all seriousness, I keep trying to remind myself (with varying success) that you will usually think you're weird way more than other people do. My whole family is used to it by now and it's not even something to point out anymore. I've told coworkers etc \"Oh I'm just really picky, nothing here appeals to me much, I'll have a snack when I get home\" and they pretty much just shrug it off. It's scarier with dating because so much of it revolves around food. I'm a lesbian too, it's hard enough to meet women in the first place. I've only ever dated people I was friends with so they already knew the situation. I've downloaded dating apps but I dread explaining myself over and over. But another thing I remind myself is, someone who would be judgmental about this is not a person I want to date anyway.",
