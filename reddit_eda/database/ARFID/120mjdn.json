I think they are way better for me than many of my other safe foods, so it feels really good to make that choice. I still find myself low on energy but I truly believe that it's because I've been struggling so hard to eat lately. So 3 of these in a day isn't enough to feel good if I can't eat anything else AND haven't been meeting my caloric needs lately. \n\nI will say, I have some of the vanilla powder and found that it mixes pretty damn well with orange juice, kind of like a creamsicle type flavor I guess? That's another way I add to the calories as I do love orange juice.",
