  "title": "I Found an App That is Specific to ARFID",
  "selftext": "It's called Fudo. I found it when I searched for ARFID on the play store. I don't like calorie counting apps, and my ED is not like other EDs, so it's hard to use the apps tailored to them. It's actually pretty clean and quality, despite being a small app. \n\nIt starts with a lil chat bot and then you go into a bunch of food categories and tell it if you eat it regularly, or wether you're willing to try it if you don't. I found it kinda hard to even look at some foods, and rushed through the fish section, but afterwards the app only has options for you if you were willing to try a food (you get to choose). It has two options at this point. You've tried it, or incorporated it. If/when you conquer a food item it leaves the list. That's all I know, I waited a bit before posting to see what the app was about. \n\n[Fudo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.novosi.Fudo)",
