  "selftext": "Why do people think this is okay to say. Whether you know about ARFID or not, what is the goal in saying that. Of all the things people say about me, this is the only one that really gets to me. I struggle so much with food, and not just because of ARFID. Emotional binge eating, addictive eating, food and I are not on good terms. Why can't people just learn to keep their mouths shut, it's not funny, it isn't helping anyone, amd it's frankly obnoxious",
