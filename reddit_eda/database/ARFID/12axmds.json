Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s AFRID, autism, sensory issues - the majority seem to always shit on people who have a limited palate.\n\nHow do you go upon discussions like this?",

The access to an official diagnosis really helps as every time someone attempts to make a comment on the way I eat I just make the situation uncomfortable by saying \"well I have an eating disorder\".\n\nI think that throughout the years I also realised that most people have a really messed up relationship with food. Diet culture is so huge, clean eating and the wellness industry have such a strong grip on people's mind. Or just people who have trauma linked to poverty. My grand parents weren't always able to put food on the table (literally) for example. \n\nSo when I encounter these types comments I also try to have some empathy first.
