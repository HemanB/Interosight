  "selftext": "I have sensory sensitivity and when I try a new food I pretty much never like it. I can tell if I really hate something but I simply can't enjoy any food the first time I eat it and if I don't like it the first time I eat it I will probably not eat it again. I really only like ultra processed foods and some fruits the first time I eat them. I ate watermelon for the second time in my life and I didn't hate it but it's very different from anything I regularly eat and just the unusualness of it makes it impossible to enjoy still it's like I would have to eat it 8 more times to be able to like it. It's very hard for me to put into words hope this makes sense",
