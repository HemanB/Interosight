They'd had an inpatient with ARFID and the hospital had been educated on ARFID due to them, so when he found out I had it, we had a really good conversation. Apparently most folk hadn't heard of it in the medical community until the past few years, but knowledge has been rapidly spreading in the last 2 years in Australia. We're also seeing more mainstream news articles.\n\nI'm really hopeful that with more activism and more prevalent knowledge, our struggles become more well known and we start to see progress in treatment!",

Not this guy, he knew \ud83d\ude4c\n\nI cried in my car after the appointment because it was just such a relief to be seen (pun intended). I didn\u2019t even know my eyesight was being affected by my ARFID. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m rambling. Just wanted to share a positive story and some info!\n\nEdit: fixing typos.
