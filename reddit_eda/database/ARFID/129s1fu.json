  "selftext": "So dog and cat kibble actually often has a lot of research during development that goes into palatability, getting the right texture and taste. I\u2019m thinking, if there was a single food item that contained all the nutrients you needed at least on a base level, and had a variety of flavors/textures to choose from so you could find one that was safe for you, would you eat it? Ideally this food would be shelf-stable and require no additional prep, just open the bag and eat X amount to get all your nutrients in. I don\u2019t know how this would work but I feel like it could actually have a decent market in the \u201ceating is a struggle\u201d community like here and for those with executive dysfunction who may not have the same food issues we do. If this is already a thing definitely let me know or if I\u2019m just being crazy let me know but this would be really interesting to me.\n\nEdit to add: I am not here to talk about whether pet food is good or bad, and any comments discussing that instead of the human component will not be comments I engage with in any way, and I encourage you all to do the same.",
