  "selftext": "Many children around the world probably have ARFID, but the adults put it off as \"picky\". When I was younger, I would not eat a lot of things. I was often called picky . I even had to take those Flintstones vitamins to survive. Some textures made/make me sick to the core (not to the point of vomiting). I wish children with ARFID stop getting labels such as \"picky\" and get the help they need. I FORGOT TO ADD TEENS AND ADULTS TOO",

I feel terrible that there are undiagnosed kids but im honestly not sure if its worth it to get diagnosed young until there are better methods of treating ARFID than just force feeding.",

He said there wasn't.  \n\nMonths later I was able to get a referral for a feeding clinic, and I made a point to let them know that there was not a lot of knowledge  of their clinic amongst doctors. Our family Dr did not know, the ER doctor did not know, and the GI Dr did not know. \n\nTherapy sooner would have helped a LOT.",
