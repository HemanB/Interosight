I\u2019ve also gotten to the point where I can tolerate some common sides (ie broccoli and carrots, plain mashed potatoes), so will eat those as well. \n\nIf it\u2019s a restaurant situation, I look at the menu ahead of time, try to find pics, etc and then eat what I can slowly and then sort of just try to make it seem like I\u2019ve eaten more than I have if I wasn\u2019t able to make a decent dent in the meal. \n\nAt a formal meal (for a fundraiser/auction) that had set menus, i just try my best. I did once also swap soup with a friend who was beside me when she was halfway through her bowl so it looked like I ate least had some of it \ud83d\ude05\n\nThat being said, as I\u2019ve gotten older, I\u2019ve also gotten a little better at trying things and/or forcing myself to eat something I don\u2019t like. I find it\u2019s a little easier in situations like work dinners, because most people don\u2019t know how picky I am going in, and it therefore feels like there\u2019s less pressure. \n\nAlso, I find people tend not to pay too much attention to what you eat. They may ask if you\u2019re sure, but usually a polite \u201cno thank you\u201d and they\u2019ve already moved on and forgotten about it.",

I\u2019ve survived, my safe food list has expanded over the years, it hasn\u2019t seriously impacted my ability to socialize, eat out, or attend events in years. It can get better. I consider myself fairly recovered during good times but during crisis and times of great stress various of my food restrictions reappear but not as severe as they were. \n\nMy mom started me on cooking with her at 3 - somewhat age appropriate as I grew up. This helped in many ways.\n* I got over much of my gag reflex from touching or being around unsafe/gross foods. I wash my hands a lot when cooking and go through many paper towels so I can throw them away as soon as I\u2019ve used them. \n* It increased my ability to eat around most foods I found gross, not all, fish/seafood still had a \u201ccannot eat anything for up to 6 hours if I smell it at eating times\u201d. \n* Having control over cooking and learning to modify recipes expanded my safe foods. More so when I got older than as a minor living at home but even as a kid. I\u2019d sometimes be distracted and lick my fingers which led to finding recipes I wanted to modify because what we were making was interesting but not to my taste.  Learned doubling and tripling seasonings I liked could increase the chances I\u2019d eat something which made a huge difference in the number of chicken, pasta, beef, and pork dishes I can eat - instead of having a single dish or brand I could eat 10-20 dishes by my teen years\n* My knowledge of recipes made it easier to order off menu in restaurants as I knew what ingredients they had on hand based on the menu and I knew what quick easy dishes they could make with those ingredients \n\nImportant dinners: Check menu beforehand to see if there is anything you can eat. If not eat beforehand hand. If possible have bread, something to drink, if you eat salad or some of the salad vegetables eat those (ask for no dressing). At events I\u2019ve always said the smell of food is making me nauseous and kicking off a headache due to one of my various chronic illnesses but otherwise I\u2019m fine and no I don\u2019t have something anyone needs to worry is catching.\n\nYou may find cooking in school helps with your ARFID but see about wearing gloves and a mask (keep in mind these may help with ARFID but cause social issues), maybe getting an anti-anxiety med just for that class, sitting down with your parents and the teacher to explain ARFID, your particular issues, and why you may need to walk out of class sometimes. You may want to start trying this at home to see what works for you (gloves, mask) and what doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s not going to be easy but it likely will help you in the long run. You can start out at home just sitting in the room close to foods/ingredients you expect will be part of the class. \n\nHow do we not die? Thankfully we live in a modern world and for many of us we have access to our safe foods, meal replacement drinks and bars, and feeding tubes if things get really bad. That said it\u2019s important to take supplements, expand our safe food list, get regular checkups and blood test, as lack of good nutrition can cause a number health issues some which may not show up until later in life.",

I recommend this however, thats a daunting thing and I only know about how America works and I dont know what options u have in Scandinavia.\nRegardless, I have some tips from my times struggling as a teen and as an adult.\n\nWhat to remember: eat what you can, something is better than nothing (even if its sweets/ \u201cbad\u201d), its ok if u cant finish the whole meal. U did good.\n\n1. Dopamine/relaxation. Watching my favorite youtubers/movies/anything that is comforting like reading while I eat has gotten me thru my formative years and even now when my symptoms return. Focusing on something really relaxing, getting my comfort foods, then tiny bite by tiny bite. (My personal favorite is Bluey haha)\n\n2. Sometimes a change in environment can help. Maximizing feeling safe and comfortable will make it more likely my appetite will return. I cant speak for you, but my ARFID is mainly stress/anxiety based. I am most relaxed in the afternoon, and sitting outside watching the birds and rabbits makes me feel better. Otherwise I eat in my room.\n\n3. Start with an appetizer. Usually a small sip from some sort of drink that isnt water (because of sugar) will actually stabilize your blood sugar and your appetite should return in around 10-15 minutes, specifically if you\u2019re too nauseous to eat because you\u2019re so hungry! Trick I learned in the hospital. Then, just have something small (I like sweets, so fruit gummies) like one or two tiny pieces, and see how your appetite is. 9/10, you\u2019re just /really/ hungry and it\u2019s ruining your appetite (ironic, I hate it here!)\n\n4. A whiff of isopropyl alcohol or anti nausea pills usually return my appetite. My anxiety makes my stomach clench and makes me feel sick, so I dont know if this applies to you.\n\n5. Meal plan, if planning the meal is your struggle. Even if i can only eat snacks I try to get a little bit if everything (protein, fruit, veggie etc). Would putting your favorite snacks and cutting them into small portions help? Place them in a lunch bag or something discreet if that helps.",

Now I can use my fear of gluten contamination as an excuse.\u00a0\n\n\nMy friends and family know I have ARFID. My family knew I wouldn't eat things like ground meat even as a young child (before ARFID was an official diagnosis), and luckily never tried to force me.

Now at almost 40 I've learned that for me what works is supplements and safe food. My fridge basically has hummus and carrots, cheese, salad, and microwave cheesy potatoes in it. I also have white rice and eggs, which is my go to comfort food.

They allowed me to wear disposable gloves while cooking and rubber gloves when washing dishes. \n\nThe last day of the class would involve cooking a meal with a group and inviting a teacher to eat with us. We were required to eat the food, and my group was not willing to work with in my safe foods which I understood. I\u2019ve gotten pretty good and moving food around on a plate to make it seem like I\u2019ve taken a few bites. No one pushed the issue forward. \n\nMy advice is that it is okay to let people know if you need reasonable accommodations. Sometimes you can just say that you\u2019re not feeling well or that you already ate and people will accept that.",

At restaurants, parties, weddings, etc.) are still extremely difficult for me, but after letting my support system know what was going on helped. My partner is able to see that I\u2019m uncomfortable and give me a way out, and when I eat with my family I am usually allowed to eat when I\u2019m ready. This fully depends on your support system though, unfortunately. If you don\u2019t feel like you have the social means necessary, it may be worth looking to seeing a nutritionist. \nSee your doctor often, get nutritional panels as often as you can. Take multivitamins and supplements as needed. \n\nIt does get easier, I doubt I\u2019ll ever be fully \u201ccured\u201d but I\u2019m a lot better than I was as a teen. Good luck!",

Similarly if you see items on the menu you could make a meal out of such as asking for plain pasta instead of a pasta and sauce dish, or asking for the fries that come on the side with another dish and some bread - you will find hospitality staff can be very accommodating if you ask kindly. \n\nAs for the food prep\u2026 If you\u2019d find it easier touching the food with gloves on I\u2019ve found it to act as a little barrier and it is beneficial to the sensory overwhelming experience I can get from touching certain textures of food. \n\nIf you\u2019re struggling with your intake, try to keep your body full of nutrients by taking multivitamins, drinking protein shakes, milkshakes, or having yogurt drinks / soup. - obviously I\u2019m not familiar with your safe foods but where physically eating is a struggle you should try to get any liquid your body allows you to which is still somewhat healthy for you. \n\nAll the best! Any questions just ask! \n\nPs. Don\u2019t be afraid to seek medical help / contact any helplines available in your area. \ud83d\ude0a",

However, for your class would it be possible to contact the school for disability aid or something like that? In the states we have Individualized Education Plans, which are personalized plans for students with disabilities or mental health issues (including eating disorders). For example, students with ADHD are allowed extra time on exams and such. Maybe in your case they could either excuse the class or modify it to make it less painful. If that doesn\u2019t work then I\u2019d suggest to start some exposure therapy. I\u2019ve found it helpful to control as many of the 5 senses as possible during it. For example, I wear thick gloves (touch), a face mask with menthol rub (smell), and headphones (sound) when I\u2019m forced to touch stuff I find repulsive. It gives me back some control during these situations which stops me from panicking. Maybe you can do something similar?",

It grew from knowing how to prepare my safe foods and my parents teaching me the more complicated recipes I liked. \nHonestly cooking shows are so fun to watch and maybe a little thrilling, people just eating whatever! What kind of life that would be! \n\nWhen you get to the cooking class ask if you can were gloves! Gloves are soooooo nice when touching new foods. \n\nImportant dinners. I assume you mean like family means, holidays and parties maybe eating out. \nHonestly try and get a feel for the food ahead of time, of you know what to expect you can mentally prepare. \nI still will maybe eat a heavier/later lunch so maybe I won't be as hungry for a dinner I know won't have much safe food for me to eat.\n I keep shelf stable high calorie/protein/vitamin things in my car/worlbag/purse for times when I need food and nothing is available \nI find my arfid is much better controlled when I'm eating steadily, and more balanced. \n\nI take supplements based on blood work I got to monitor my levels. Im still trying to find a dietitian to work with but US healthcare system \n\nIt gets better, I posted some food I made in a group chat and someone asked if I'd be their in home cook just the other day. \n\nYou got this. I really hope your cooking class maybe helps you take hold of your own food.",

There are a handful of foods that smell so awful to me that I have to really focus on not letting it show, sometimes with those I\u2019ll find a reason to step outside or excuse myself.\n\nIf you\u2019re like me and the social awkwardness ramps up your anxiety then having something to fidget with helps, same with focusing on the feel or temperature of something nearby. Sometimes I\u2019ll discreetly grab an ice cube and focus on the cold and feeling of it melting, usually lasts long enough that whatever the gross food was has either been consumed or the smell has dissipated.\n\nNot sure what the Scandinavian mental health system looks like but in the US I was able to find an eating disorder therapy practice that had excellent experience with ARFID.

My entire diet had to change and I don't eat at restaurants anymore unless it's absolutely necessary (such as traveling), because the risk of cross contamination is too high. Before that my friends and I were always going places to eat (I was usually eating some type of potato, but i went).\n\n\nYou can say something you were eating started making you sick a couple years ago, but you're not sure what exactly, so you stick to a strict diet of food you make at home and that's seemed to help.\u00a0\n\n\nYou can even mention you're working on trying to figure out what food makes you sick if you feel like you need to add more. They don't need to know it's ARFID.\u00a0\n\n\nWe knew something I was eating was having a bad effect on my body. It's part of why I ended up with ARFID, we just didn't know what. I even tried cutting gluten out at one point, but I didn't realize how sensitive I was to it, so I didn't cut it out enough (I can't even touch something with gluten, say a piece of bread, then touch a food I'm going to eat). After I cut it out totally we realized it had been making me sick since I was 2. So it's not unheard of for people to realize something they eat was making them sick as they get older. I have a few friends with histamine issues and sometimes they can eat like normal, and other times they're even more strict than I am.\u00a0",
