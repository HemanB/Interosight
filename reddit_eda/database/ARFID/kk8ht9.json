The way I\u2019ve thought about it personally, is if I\u2019m uncomfortable? Good. It means I\u2019m trying. Push through it, and be proud of yourself for it. Even if you gag, even if you cry, even if you have to spit it out, even if you can\u2019t get it into your mouth in the first place. No step is too small, and you always deserve a pat on the back regardless of how it went. What matters is you tried, and maybe next time trying again will be marginally easier. If not, try again when you can. But honestly, I don\u2019t think I could have done any of this without encouragement from my mum and my boyfriend. Maybe I\u2019m underestimating myself though. I want to reiterate that I still love my early safe foods and would honestly choose the first photo over the second on most days! But I feel so much better within myself for having at least tried.",
