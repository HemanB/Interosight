  "selftext": "So yesterday was my birthday and my boyfriend and I were going shopping and he told me that today I\u2019m going to try a Boost Juice (especially because it\u2019s free on your birthday!). I was really nervous but my boyfriend said it\u2019ll just be a fruit one and if I don\u2019t like it he\u2019ll have the rest. \n\nI ordered a berry smoothie with raspberries, blueberries and strawberries with yoghurt. I had a sip and actually liked it. \n\nApart from me actually being able to have fruit in some form, the best part of the whole experience was seeing my boyfriend\u2019s reaction. He is the kindest and most supportive person in my life and have never judged me for my ARFID. He legitimately cried when I tried and enjoyed my drink and had to walk off for a bit so he didn\u2019t cry in public!\n\nSo, big love to my beautiful man, you know how to encourage me in just the right ways and have never pushed me too far. Thanks for supporting me \u2764\ufe0f",
