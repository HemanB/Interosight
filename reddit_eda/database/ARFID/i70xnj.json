  "selftext": "For example, one time I worked at a pizza place, and a customer told me \u201cOh and can I get 1000 Island with that?\u201d And I\u2019m just sitting there like \u201c.....um......1000 islands? Hawaii?\u201d \n\nOr like my family will ask me to get some things from the store, and I\u2019m just staring at the vegetables like what is this........wall of......leaf. \n\nEven if I did want to eat like a normal person, I don\u2019t know where I would begin. What if a hot girl comes to my apartment and is like \u201cI like a man that cooks ;)\u201d and I\u2019m just sitting here like \u201cYo we havin\u2019 pizza rolls tho\u201d\n\nI want to overcome this ARFID, but it\u2019s a struggle not even really comprehending what people put in their bodies on a day to day basic. Like, do I just put this chicken breast in a pan and then just eat it plain like the savage that I am? Do I use some random seasoning that I found in my moms kitchen?",

My saving grace was ironically getting a job at a restaurant and grocery store and I can now say i\u2019ve learned soooo much about food that i didn\u2019t know before. However, before learning I did have quite a few embarrassing moments with this. One time while taking an order a lady asked me for \u201cchicken wings, all flats\u201d. I was so perplexed, like all flats? What does that even mean? I told her we only had the wings and then she was like \u201dyeaaah?? I don\u2019t want the drums, I just want the flats.\u201d Well that confused me even more! I had no idea what she meant. It was only until I asked a coworker and everyone laughed at me that I finally knew what they were talking about lol",

But the best thing to do is educate yourself! I actually just downloaded Pinterest last night and spent hours browsing thru recipes. Normally I find Pinterest annoying but tbh it was super helpful to have everything in one place and not have to do a bunch of googling and searching thru different websites. Last night I wanted a simple hummus recipe and it gave me like a million options - from reading instructions to pictures and videos. \n\nDon\u2019t get overwhelmed. You don\u2019t have to become a chef overnight! Next time someone mentions a food you\u2019re not sure about, google it. Familiarize yourself with the picture, sometimes I even like to look on Wiki and see where it naturally grows and what foods it\u2019s related to.",

When I'm in the grocery store, and I feel like I'm barely buying anything, I still think \"but, like, what the heck are other people even buying?\".\n\nI also worked at a pizza place for a short time and it was horrifying not knowing what any of the foods *were* that weren't pizza. I thought a pizza place would be safe but they sell a lot of other stuff too.\n\nThe only comfort I can offer is that for cooking - people are pretty much always clueless if they don't have experience cooking it. We are actually not alone in that. My roommate is terrified about cooking meat because  he just feels so clueless on the subject, and he has no issues with food at all. Actually I should say: he used to be; because since he's been doing it and has some more experience I think he's more comfortable. We just do a lot of recipe/cooking googling. It can be a little overwhelming, you google one thing and you get so many recipes that are basically the same but a little different and I don't really understand what's going on with them. In those times, if you have that issue as well, and you can get someone to help you sift through things who does understand what they're looking at a little better, its very valuable.",
