  "selftext": "I\u2019m sorry if this has been asked before. I\u2019m a college student and have had many sustainability-related classes. In most of them, we discuss food waste, packaging, harmful ingredients like palm oil, etc etc. I consider myself very passionate about the environment and try hard to be aware of my actions. I so badly want to reduce the amount of trash I generate and strive to be zero waste. However, most of my safe foods require excessive packaging and can easily create a lot of trash, such as Kraft mac and cheese or frozen pizza. I feel like no matter how hard I try in other areas, I will always end up producing so much trash because of the food packaging. Does anyone else struggle with this type of guilt? Thanks so much in advance",
