  "title": "Supporting loved ones with ARFID: Tips from a spouse after a decade of learning.",
  "selftext": "Hi there, \n\nI wrote this as a comment to a post from a month ago about ARFID and relationships but thought I might just post it anyway as it could be helpful. \n\nI periodically check this sub as my partner was officially diagnosed a few years ago. \n\nWe've been together about a decade, I'm a foodie and ex-Chef, she has ARFID. \n\nWhen we met she ate 5 things, that was it. White pasta (well over boiled and the water couldn't even be salted without a full anxiety attack meltdown), white rice, carrots (boiled again), apple juice and milk chocolate. That was it. \n\nShe now basically eats whatever I do. It's been a very long process of working together and therapy. But thought I would share some things that we did and it helped. \n\nThere were some rules I had for me, that I try really hard to remember: \n\n1. Never ever any negatives about eating. At all no matter what, there are no judgments about food/eating. Only positives and love.\n2. Never comment if she skips a meal or only eats half or something, eating is ONLY ever encouraged. Instead of my concern being \"You've only had half the sandwich\" it is \"Wow, great job on the sandwich at lunch today, you're kicking ARFIDs ass!!\"\n\nSo to help with the anxiety we did a couple of things. \n\n* Talked openly that it might need to be diagnosed. The disorder had landed her in hospital a few times (fainting, infertility, organ function etc). We noted that while it is scary to open up, once someone knows we can make sure we avoid the hospital. \n* Every time she didn't feel she could eat a meal, she would just let me know and we could do something else or change the topic so the anxiety about food was redirected. \n* If there was ever anything that she didn't like, let me know and I'll remove it/eat it. One time we were at an Italian place and she ordered her plain pasta and it came with a few strips of shaved Parmesan. I just put the cheese on my plate and we overcame what otherwise would have been a get up and leave situation. \n\nOnce we focused on the anxiety and fear we talked about how a few new foods could be cool. Entirely the foods she wanted to try. Not the ones I wanted her to. \n\nSo, knowing that when we would go out we had a system (we still use it). \n\nShe will order something that is a safe food. \n\nThe other order is something she would like to try. \n\nThat way if she hates it (and its happened a bit!) then I eat it as I am adventurous and eat anything. But most often, she would love it and then there was a new food she liked in an environment of no judgment and no pressure. \n\nThe other thing I did, as I worked with food, love it and know a bit about it is that if she tried something she liked then I would talk about another food that she might like and relate it to how its like something she already likes and is ok with. \n\nFor example, a few months ago we reached the point of liking burritos. Which was awesome!!! When she was talking about things to try next I mentioned a kebab might be a good idea to try. I love them and their basically a middle-eastern version of a burrito. Meat and whatever toppings you want in a bread. She thought about it, looked them up, looked up restaurants and about a month later we went to try one. She said what toppings she wanted, I ordered it and she liked some of it! She ended up changing some topics and adding others, but, it was a nice bridge to trying other things in a nice safe way. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other thing that we talk about a lot is this thing her therapist talks to her about. When she was talking about how its nice to just eat the safe foods, she is in control etc. \n\n*The therapist has said: You're in control the same way an animal is in control in the zoo.* \n\nShe has found that helpful to talk about it all, she knows sometimes she is the animal is the zoo and sometimes she needs to be. Other times, she realises how much she likes open spaces and wants to run free. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor family, friends and others who have a love one with ARFID I think its important to remember that you're doing an awesome job and yeah this lasts a while, but you're stronger together on the road to recovery than alone. We can help and be there everyday for the victories and difficulties of our loved one. Even if that means fries and chicken for their dinner for a few months etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're all doing awesome.",

An important thing my SO's therapist told her is that hiccups and periods of rest are a vital part of recovery. It's not a set back, its a pause to build up strength again. We've both found that useful to remember in those periods of keeping to the safe foods.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn saying all this, anyone who struggles with ARFID and EDs is insanely strong willed, like this something that impacts every waking minute and they're strong enough to function and get through their day.",
