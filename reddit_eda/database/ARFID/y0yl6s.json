I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal because I felt like I knew the pizza would taste good, but I realized small victories are still victories.",

It is a victory. \n\nEven going into restaurants that serve food I like is difficult for me, because they might cook it different, or serve it different, it might taste or look different. \n\nTo be able to do what you just did would be huge for me. So pleased for you.",
