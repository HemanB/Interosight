  "selftext": "The Philly based comedy series Abott Elementary features a character named Gregory. Gregory is a very picky eater and is often made fun of for his food choices. In the latest episode Gregory is talking to his now girlfriend Janine about dinner, she recommended a restaurant and he responds with \u201cas long as they have buttered noodles.\u201d She says \u201cI would never take you anywhere without buttered noodles.\u201d This really was the moment that really convinced me to make this post. There\u2019s an episode based on his \u201cweird\u201d food preferences and fears of foods. I really wish they addressed this as arfid or hope that they have an arfid episode in the future. Maybe a kid is diagnosed with it and the school is made aware of this and Ava is being ignorant while the teachers try to accommodate the child. After everyone failing to help this kid, Janine starts doing more research to help this student and realizes that Gregory also has arfid and might be able to help the kid. Then start to close it out with something sweet like them eating together in his classroom so it\u2019s not as stressful as being in the cafeteria and because it\u2019s always easier to eat when ur not alone. And then mr. Johnson or Ava can walk by and say something out of pocket but funny to end it off. It would be a great way to educate people on how to go about helping someone who struggles with arfid. No one knows about it and I feel like so many people have arfid tendencies and the awareness could really help people. Idk that\u2019s my opinion what do you think? ",

I really like that they wrote this into his character. What a small percentage of the population we are, but then given a voice there. Pretty cool.",

He did disclose his ARFID to his friends in the past year and so far they have all been super supportive. He does have a lot of \u201cweird\u201d friends - most of them have their own \u201cissues\u201d and don\u2019t judge (I mean this in the best way, I\u2019m a weird person and don\u2019t fit in either). I know we\u2019re not past it - as I read some of the 20 somethings on here with their dating struggles. The thing I always tell him is that if someone is your friend and loves you, they will not care what you eat.",
