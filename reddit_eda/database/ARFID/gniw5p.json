The whole randomly hating them to craving them is interesting, and i never would\u2019ve thought that the process isn\u2019t linear.\n\nJust a follow up question, when you say the have to be cooked in a specific way, is that because its the only way you can stomach it to get to like it? It\u2019s confusing to me how despite you not liking the food, it still has to be cooked in a specific way (??). I\u2019m in a similar position to your boyfriend, and i\u2019m just curious as to what he did to, let\u2019s say, get you to like fried green tomatoes. did he start with the regular version first and until you were sure you didn\u2019t like that, he fried it?

Things like brussel sprouts *can* be good when you roast them or something but like most foods if you make it poorly or just flat out wrong (like boiling them) shit's nasty. As for the cantelope being salty that's strange may be worth another go at it. I'm curious what made you \"wtf???\" About jalepenos",

These are the foods that are left, and mainly my issues with them are things like smells, colors, and textures (so that's why how they're cooked is so important). One time I ate a soft brussel sprout and threw up and cried at the texture so I was scared of them for so long after that \n\nJalape\u00f1os had a weird texture and such a weird taste. They tasted like how bell peppers smell but then the spiciness hit. It was just gross and weird and I didn't enjoy it at all lol",
