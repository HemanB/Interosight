Many simply wanted to reduce it down to \u201cpicky eating\u201d and call it a day, while others were more receptive to understanding how eating disorders can largely be a neurological problem. At the end, they all seemed to get it (in some way) and seemed more understanding in terms of *all* eating disorders, not just the ones designed to make you \u201c\u201dlook pretty.\u201d\u201d\n\nI think it also helped that, to demonstrate, I tried eating part of a cantelope in front of the class and was gagging involuntarily.",

Do you see food? No. It doesnt even require thought, its instantaneous and subconscious. Same happens to me with \"food\" that I won't eat, its the same as a pink eraser brick. It's instant an automatic. No amount of \"conscious willpower\" active thought effort can overcome and change that categorization. \n\nI eat what qualifies to my brain as edible food.
