  "selftext": "Went to Costco with my mom today and apparently they no longer sell the Detroit City cheesy bread. (at my Costco location? At all Costco? Who knows! Their app is so shitty you can't tell!) So I'm freaking out trying to find them, AT COSTCO, and someone has set off an alarm and there's like a thousand people in the store, and I'm stressed as hell because that's one of THREE things I can eat from Costco and now I've inconvenienced everyone thoroughly by asking my mom to go get cheesy bread with me. Why does everything I love get discontinued or changed or removed. Ugh.",
