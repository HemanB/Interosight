  "selftext": "I went to the doctor today to get prescribed some antibiotics for my uti, we didnt talk for very long but she asked me what vitamins i take, I said what type of multivitamins I take, and she laughed at me. Ive been taking the same multivitamin liquid since I was a kid because its the only one that tastes good enough for me to not puke it up and I guess its more associated with being for kids than adults since she laughed and asked me when I'll start acting like an adult while still laughing. I just feel undermined and embarassed, I really like my multivitamin liquid but now I'm embarassed to even have them, I feel like no one takes me seriously and like I'm just a big joke to everyone when they find out I dont/cant eat normally :(",

She said that if the label show the same numbers, they\u2019ll do the same thing. You\u2019re honestly such a boss for taking care of yourself and taking vitamins daily! I\u2019m not there yet, but I feel like it would be so helpful to have that extra reassurance. \n\nWhen I was 9, I went to my doctor and told her I had pneumonia. She said \u201cno, you don\u2019t have pneumonia\u201d and that\u2019s the story of how I had pneumonia for a month and a half. Doctors can be idiots medically AND also because they don\u2019t understand social cues.\n\nEven when you see someone professional for their help, you still get to give input, and be involved in the conversation about what\u2019s happening. If your doctor was concerned, they should have asked about the FORM of your vitamins and why it was necessary, and ask if you wanted to change what you were taking. \n\nGood luck, I hope you feel better soon!
