If it is a family member or friend who mentions it I will politely explain it to them (have not had any reoccuring incidents after clarification). But my favourite, a stranger... Very. Very. VERY. Passive aggressive \"explaination\" and I just get to watch them squirm with being uncomfortable. They go out of their way to put me down for my food? Ill humiliate them without a second thought.",
