  "selftext": "I always hated vegetables. A little piece of onion would make me want to throw up. Not eating vegetables made me eat lot's of rice potatoes and meat, so my belly wouldn't go away even though I work out a lot.\n\nSo I decided that it was time for a change. Took a lot of courage but I prepared some steamed broccoli to try it out. I can't say I loved ot but it wasn't so bad. \n\nBaby steps from now on but always moving forward looking for better health. Next stop is spinach I think.",

      "body": "Hi! I love broccoli so I hope you don't mind me cutting in.\n\nFirst of all, with broccoli you may find it easier to separate the stems from the buds. While most greens have a bit of a grassy flavor, broccoli stems are pretty mild even when raw. Raw stems have a nice crunch to them as well, so that may be a good place to start. Some stems do have leaves on them, but they are easy to peel off. It's also possible to peel off the tougher outside of the stalks and just eat the milder inner flesh.\n\nBuds are fairly gritty when raw, so I recommend they be steamed first. That will also help remove the grassy flavor and make them almost sweet. If the taste is a bit too strong, I recommend adding some melted butter and salt, or cheese if that is a safe option for you. Parmesan is a personal favorite of mine.\n\nGood luck!",
