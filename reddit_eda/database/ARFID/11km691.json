          "body": "Cinnamon rolls are a Swedish pastry, most people posting \u201ccinnamon rolls\u201d on reddit post those big fluffy Americanised things with frosting, Swedes like to joke about it (usually by calling them \u201ckum bullar\u201d meaning cum buns), it\u2019s pretty stupid but it\u2019s important to us. Nothing wrong with liking the American version btw, problem is when they try to claim them as the \u201cusual ones\u201d or worse \u201cthe original cinnamon rolls,\u201d cuz it\u2019s just not true (also, the rest of the world is pretty tired of Americans taking our stuff changing it slightly and claiming it as their own)",

Lmao.\n\nIf you wish to make your own, [this](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/swedish-cinnamon-buns-kanelbullar/) recipe seems pretty good but they use a bit too much cinnamon imo, I also found [this](https://www.delscookingtwist.com/swedish-cinnamon-rolls-or-kanelbullar/) one that has the way to make them that most people use at home, again, it looks to be a bit much cinnamon imo but that\u2019s just my personal preference. Both of these will likely be a bit different than the ones at this restaurant but if you\u2019re interested in something similar, these recipes are probably pretty close",
