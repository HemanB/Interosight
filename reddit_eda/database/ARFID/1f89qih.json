  "selftext": "I'm currently sick and my husband ran to the store with a list of ingredients to make a big pot of soup. He isn't vegan so he made his own soup. Since I have something wrong with my dominant hand, he graciously chops all of the vegetables I put into it. I told him to let me know when he was done so that I could get out of bed to assemble it because I knew from past experience that he wouldn't make it exactly how I do it, which will completely throw off the taste and texture. He looked at me oddly like, \"go get some rest, obviously I can make your soup for you!\" He was just wanting to help and I so appreciate him for it. So I just said, \"just come get me, I would really like to assemble it myself and then you can stir it until it's done.\" \n\nDoes anyone else have to make their own safe meals or else it's not really \"safe\"?",

I would fill up on bread and say \"oh whoops, not enough room, can you give me a box please.\"\n\nThank god my husband started telling them \"she just wants pasta\" and so now they give me the same exact pasta dish every time. It's not on the menu because it's basically too bland to sell LOL. One time I asked my husband if they were annoyed that I just wanted a simple pasta, and he said, \"no, they think it's nice because you're easy to please and it doesn't get in the way of feeding the paying guests.\" I like that I can actually enjoy myself and relax while I'm there to visit because I can always expect the same meal.",
