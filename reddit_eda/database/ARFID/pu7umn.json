  "title": "College cafeterias fucking suck for ARFID",
  "selftext": "I'm a freshman in college, and I've been on campus about a week. I'm so fucking done with the  college cafeteria. Most of the food is terrible quality. Crunchy beans, burnt pizza, watered down juice, etc. And it's so stressful planning meals there. The food offerings change every meal, so sometimes there will be stuff I can eat and sometimes all I can have is breadsticks again, which they thankfully always have, but it's not a full meal and I'm already getting sick of them because I've had to have them with almost every meal so far to get enough food. It's a total gamble. And when they do have something I like and can eat, it won't be there the next time I go in. I am so frustrated to be paying almost $6,000 for bad food and breadsticks so often. It doesn't help that freshman are required to buy the meal plan with the most meals a week in the dining hall and the least amount to spend at the very few other places on campus (there's only coffee, bagels and convenience shops, but better than the cafeteria at least!). I'm stressed out knowing it's going to be like this the whole year. I have no access to any kitchen facilities other than a microwave/fridge, so making anything for myself beyond microwave meals is out of the question. It's also a small fridge and tiny freezer. I've started making friends and it sucks to either have to miss going with them to dinner or end up with nothing but breadsticks again even when I'm actually hungry. I don't want to explain everything but I think they might be judging me for always picking \"unhealthy\" food, even when it's my only actual option. I don't want to be eating nothing but pizza and breadsticks! I would love to eat healthy things and have variety! There's just nothing else here I can eat! I wish they'd even just have one or two more of my staples every time, like chicken soup or plain pasta. This is mostly just a vent post but please let me know any advice you have about anything I can do to make things better.",

      "body": "I hear you on this. When I lived in the dorms I had only one safe food option in the dining hall: pasta. Luckily they had a pasta bar every day, but they would rotate the type of noodle that they offered. So on the days where they had more \u201ctextured\u201d noodles like tortellini or rotini, I would go hungry. \n\nDo you go to a big school? Typically the dining hall staff is very accommodating to different diets. At my school you could talk to them about your preferences/special diets and they would do their best to accommodate you. They would even prepare takeout containers for students by request. That helped me a lot because a lot of my anxiety around food stemmed from eating around so many people. It was nice to take a meal back home and be able to modify it so I was comfortable eating it. Perhaps if you reach out to them they\u2019ll be able to offer you your safe foods every day. Or even send you with some that you can take home and reheat in your microwave. Hope this helps :)",

      "body": "If a college can't accomodate dietary needs/the meal plan causes 'undue hardship', etc, they almost certainly have a policy for exempting you from the requirement to buy it. Idk how that will work now that the semester has started, but it may be worth getting a dr's note and trying. Or look into the options for transferring (selling) your plan to value to other students. Right now you're paying the same cost as everyone else to get just a little of the cheapest options, it really is a rip off.\n\nMy school didn't have anyway to transferr untill I was almost done, so I spent the whole plan every year on large non fat iced chai lattes,  or got cash from someone who I bought from in person, pain in my ass...\n\nI went into the cafeteria once, even the plain rice wasn't right because it was dry and crusty from sitting out so long ):<",

I think it\u2019s kinda unfair of them to make a whole vegan/vegetarian bar, but not have an arfid bar or at least like a bar with just basic stuff for when you don\u2019t like anything else. I wish this was a well known disorder and not called picky eating as if we control it. I almost want to bring it up to some people that control what food is out there, because I\u2019m paying a lot of money for food I don\u2019t like",

Legit when I was a kid, the one reason that kept me from going to a better school than the shitty local one, was that I needed to come home for lunch every day because I couldn't tolerate school food. In middle school, in the rare times my mom couldn't come pick me up for lunch, I fully knew my meal was going to be one yoghurt, two if I was lucky. In high school, we'd switched to preparing sandwiches in the morning when going back home was unavailable. And at uni, I just hit up the closest sandwich shop. Better that than trying to learn whatever the fuck asshole king of the week we're being taught about while passed out from hunger.",
