I've been wracked with guilt from eating places by friends and I felt embarrassed but it was the only thing I was able to keep down for a while. It was especially present when people were boycotting companies that donated to Trump campaigns. \n\nDo not feel bad. \nEat your food.",

It's great to be aware and spend your money wisely *but* with our circumstances, sometimes that's not an option. \n\nA few years back I went both vegan and vegetarian (for the animals and environment) but because of ARFID and food allergies I made my already extrememly limited diet, even **more** limited, I dropped tons of weight and my anxiety spiraled out of control, I was a mess. I eventually went back to having meat and felt much better. So yes, please eat whatever you can.",
