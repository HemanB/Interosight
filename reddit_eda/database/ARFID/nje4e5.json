  "title": "Smoothies have probably saved my life over the past 3 years",
  "selftext": "I wanted to put this out there for anyone else who may benefit from this. I can hardcore relate to so many of the struggles posted about on this sub. Trying to eat in the morning, or when my stomach is upset has always been really difficult to straight up impossible. But since I have started making smoothies, I can actually get nutrients into my body after waking up. It may take me an hour to get through it slowly sipping, but I can get it down, and almost as important I truly enjoy them. I say smoothies have probably saved my life over the past 3 years because it has become a daily (sometimes 2 or 3 in a day) meal that is probably the most nutritious and enjoyable thing I eat. I really hope this reaches at least one person who may not have even considered smoothies as a possible meal. I am happy to go into explicit detail of exactly how i make my smoothie and what goes in it for anyone who asks (comment below or message me whichever works). I know my specifics may not work for someone else, but it is super easy to swap out any of the various ingredients with whatever you may want, and to experiment with different ratios depending on what sort of taste/texture/consistency is enjoyable (or just doable). I recently got my mom (who also has food issues) into making them and now she has something she can take to work and eat in the morning. I really hope this helps someone, don't hesitate to reach out with any questions",
