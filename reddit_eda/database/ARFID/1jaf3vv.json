  "selftext": "This is a semi rant/pity party as well as seeking advice. \n\nMy doctor and I were talking about some health issues that I have and she said that I need to cut out inflammatory foods and gave me the choice to cut out gluten or dairy. That alone set me off because I eat mostly chicken, fruit, dairy items, cereal, and pretzels. I chose gluten thinking that would be easier than dairy.\n\nI went to the grocery story yesterday and ended up crying, nearly everything that I eat contains gluten\u2014all of the cereals that I like do, uncrustables, pretzels, and other small snacks. I figured I would get some gluten free bread and make some PPJs instead of the uncrustables but every gf bread loaf felt hard and the texture just seemed wrong. If im running late in the morning and don\u2019t have time to make my normal breakfast (eggs, grits, and toast), I put a toaster scrambler in the toaster, that\u2019s not an option anymore. \n\nAny suggestions for gluten free substitutes for like bread and stuff? I\u2019m losing my mind here. \n\nEdit: I appreciate the advice and recommendations that I\u2019ve received in here. Yesterday was my full day of not eating gluten and for the first time in a long time I woke up this morning without severe stomach cramping. I know that I don\u2019t *have* to cut gluten if I\u2019m not allergic, but since I woke up feeling better than I usually do and my doctor said if I don\u2019t feel better in 30 days then I can go back to eating it, I\u2019m feeling a little more comfortable. \n\nAlso, I tried gluten free macaroni and cheese last night, the texture is awful and I gagged so many times, never again.

I have chronic illnesses and have seen anti-inflammatory diets regularly suggested but there's just no way I could do it since so many of my safe foods contain gluten, dairy or the other things I'm meant to avoid. The stress of dealing with it is likely to make the health issues worse and overrule any benefits that avoiding those foods would have anyway.",

      "body": "I don\u2019t have any advice on what to get unfortunately, but I think a big part of going to a substitution is accepting that it won\u2019t be the same.\n\nI went through this because I am lactose intolerant and love dairy. A LOT of my safe foods were dairy. I haaaated dairy substitutes because they weren\u2019t the same. Oat milk, vegan cheese, bleh eugh yuck. Same with meat substitutes - if you are trying to imitate meat with vegetables, you\u2019ll get something disappointing.\n\nInstead, you have to approach it as a new thing. I said I didn\u2019t like oat milk, because it wasn\u2019t milk and I wanted milk. My partner got some and I tried it, and eventually started buying and drinking my own. It\u2019s delicious, but I had to approach it as a new food that was *similar* to my old food that I loved, rather than a replacement. Similarly, I like black bean patties even though I\u2019m not vegetarian, because I like the texture and the flavor. If I bit into it expecting something meatlike, I would hate it.\n\nUnfortunately, that turns it into the age-old problem of trying new foods and trying to find new safe foods. For me it was easier because I was trying stuff that had some of the same qualities as my existing safe foods, so it wasn\u2019t as scary. It was also harder in some ways, because I resented the substitutes for not being what I actually wanted.\n\nI hear you, I see you, and you are not alone.",

      "body": "I have celiac disease so I can definitely help with this! My favorite bread substitute is actually a gluten free waffle lol. The brand is Brazi Bites, they make original ones and cheesy ones - PB&J is really good on the original, as is Nutella, and they\u2019re also great as just regular waffles with butter and syrup! And then anything savory is good on the cheesy, like a sandwich of any kind! They do not have any taste or texture difference to regular waffles like Eggo (I actually genuinely like the Brazi Bites ones better than any other frozen waffle I\u2019ve had, including gluten ones lol). Glutino is a brand that makes incredible English muffins that are great to pop in the toaster and have with butter, cream cheese, or any kind of breakfast sandwich filling. Glutino also makes sandwich cookies that are just as good as Oreos. Snyder\u2019s makes gluten free pretzels that are amazing and come in sticks, twists, and rods! For cereals, there are tons that are gluten free - any rice or corn Chex, lucky charms, cocoa and fruity pebbles, etc. Katz is a gluten free brand that makes amazing donuts, donut holes, and other bread-y sweet treats. Let me know if you\u2019re looking for anything else specific and I\u2019d be glad to help!",

Maybe transition away from gluten quickly, but not immediately, trying to find replacements.\n\n\nI now baked bread and make pizza from scratch, using a bread maker.\u00a0\n\n\nGluten free flour is available and with enough practice can really dial in the flavor and texture. For us, most pizzas that can be purchased have a thick crust with a bad texture, so instead we are able to make it from scratch really thin crust.\u00a0\n\n\nFor uncrustables, we make our own bread and then use a heart shaped cookie cutter and then store away for later use. For bread, we sometimes add flavorless vitamin powder to get more vitamins.\n\n\nIf you start bread making, preztels should be easy to learn as well.\n\n\nLosing cereal will be hard. Hope you can get through it all. Take it easy on yourself and believe and be hopeful. \ud83d\udc9e",

I\u2019d recommend cutting dairy over gluten. Lactose intolerance has become super common so there\u2019s just more of a market for those products. I haven\u2019t fully cut out dairy but I have cut back to basically only eating cheese and no other dairy due to my own lactose intolerance. And even cheese I use less of. Gluten is truly in like everything though. You\u2019d be shocked how many random things have gluten. And the alternatives are either expensive as hell, gross, or both. \n\nHopefully you\u2019re able to find something that works for you though.

For bread, udis and schar are good, and I know Amy's is a popular brand for gf frozen meals and while they don't have anything in my safe food range, my mom always gets the pad thai and the enchiladas. [Katz Gluten Free ](http://katzglutenfree.com/) is an amazing brand, and everything they make is both dairy + gluten free - they have bread, pie, and a whole wide range of baked goods from muffins to cake to pop tarts (called toaster pastries), I love this brand so much!  For a toaster scrambler, Sweet Loren's makes a gf/df puff pastry that you could use to make the scrambler with and freeze for when you just need something quick.

      "body": "So I had to cut out gluten two years ago. Most of my safe foods were gluten containing foods. I\u2019m located in the US, I\u2019m not sure where you are but I\u2019ll share my favorite gluten free substitutes that I\u2019ve found in the US. Apologies for any weird formatting, I\u2019m on mobile but I\u2019ll try to make it look alright.\n\nBread:\n\n-Canyon Bakehouse Country White bread\n\n-BFree Homestyle Sandwich White Sourdough Loaf (my current favorite)\n\n-Trader Joe\u2019s gluten free bread. I\u2019ve tried a few and liked them. Their english muffins are also good.\n\n- I did visit the UK recently and I liked the ASDA brand gluten free sandwich bread.\n\n*you can buy a tool that cuts bread and sandwiches like uncrustables. I\u2019m not sure where you can buy them but my parents bought one when I was little because I refused to eat sandwiches unless they were cut like uncrustables. So they do exist.\n\nCrackers:\n\n- Simple Mills brand. I personally love the tomato basil crackers but they have a variety.\n\nChicken nuggets:\n\n- Bell & Evans gluten free chicken nuggets\n\nCereal:\n\n- general mills cereals in the US are gluten free but they do have risk if cross contact with gluten. I personally do not have a reaction from eating cheerios.\n\n- granola is also an option that is usually gluten free but Idk how you feel about granola\n\n- oatmeal. So it is recommended to buy gluten free oats specifically. Oats are naturally gluten free but there can be cross contact during processing. I buy the nature\u2019s path plain rolled oats.\n\nYou didn\u2019t mention it but for veggie burgers, I like impossible burgers. I loved morningstar grillers but they contain gluten. Impossible burgers are a bit different than morningstar grillers but they\u2019re still good.\n\n\nDairy substitutes:\n\nFor milk I absolutely love Oatly brand oatmilk. I mix the full fat with the regular and to me it has the same mouthfeel as 2% dairy milk. I also like their ice cream but I learned it doesn\u2019t make great root beer floats.\n\nBeyond milk I haven\u2019t found any dairy substitutes I like. I still eat a bit of cheese and butter. But as long as I don\u2019t have too much cheese or butter I\u2019m fine.\n\n\nI still haven\u2019t found pretzels that I like or goldfish crackers. I\u2019m not a fan of cheesy crackers that have a powdery cheese coating and most cheesy crackers I\u2019ve tried just taste bad to me. But I love goldfish.\n\nEdit: kinnikinnick brand animal crackers and vanilla wafers are really good too. And Goodie Girl cinnamon breakfast bars.\n\nIf you\u2019re into baking, King Arthur Baking has some great gluten free recipes. Gluten free baking is more challenging than regular baking and I ended up buying a food scale because the ratios are much more important with gluten free and measuring cups and spoons aren\u2019t precise enough for gluten free.",

A LOT of my safe foods were dairy. I haaaated dairy substitutes because they weren\u2019t the same. Oat milk, vegan cheese, bleh eugh yuck. Same with meat substitutes - if you are trying to imitate meat with vegetables, you\u2019ll get something disappointing.\n\nInstead, you have to approach it as a new thing. I said I didn\u2019t like oat milk, because it wasn\u2019t milk and I wanted milk. My partner got some and I tried it, and eventually started buying and drinking my own. It\u2019s delicious, but I had to approach it as a new food that was *similar* to my old food that I loved, rather than a replacement. Similarly, I like black bean patties even though I\u2019m not vegetarian, because I like the texture and the flavor. If I bit into it expecting something meatlike, I would hate it.\n\nUnfortunately, that turns it into the age-old problem of trying new foods and trying to find new safe foods. For me it was easier because I was trying stuff that had some of the same qualities as my existing safe foods, so it wasn\u2019t as scary. It was also harder in some ways, because I resented the substitutes for not being what I actually wanted.\n\nI hear you, I see you, and you are not alone.",

      "body": "Just to add that ARFID is not just a restricted diet. Nor is it as simple as that. It stands for Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder and has three main types.  \n**Sensory**, where you restrict your diet due to the sensory properties of food causing over stimulation or sensitivity. This can be because of smells, textures, appearance, colour, etc. It can also include interoception (how you feel things in your body).  \n**Lack of interest**, where you have little to no interest in food. This could be exhibited by having no appetite, being extremely picky with what you eat, forgetting to eat, and getting distracted during mealtimes.  \n**Fear of averse consequences**, where you have fear reactions to food because you are scared of choking, nausea, vomiting, or pain that occurs after eating. This can often be caused by a specific traumatic event in the past (eg, choking on something, so never eating it again in case of reoccurrence of that incident).  \nA person with ARFID can have any one (or more) of these types to varying degrees of severity.  \n\nFor example, at the moment, I can only eat a few things due to sensory reasons (mainly texture for me, for example smoothies and drinks with bits in make me want to be sick and have done for my whole life), and things just feeling wrong in my mouth or just feel like too much and overwhelm me. There are a lot of foods that I will never and have never tried, and I can say for sure that I will not like them based on how they look. I also don't feel hunger in the same way as other people appear to, because I struggle with interoception due to Autism (another example is not knowing I need the toilet until I'm desperate), and get into states of hyperfocus where I totally lose track of anything else I'm doing for hours and totally forget to eat or drink or do anything apart from the one thing I am focuaing on. I also had an incident last year when I got sick just after eating one of my safe foods and now can't eat it due to being scared of being sick again because I can't stand the texture or taste of sick.  \n\nA restricted diet is not a treatment for ARFID. It is a consequence of having ARFID.",

          "body": "Just to add that ARFID is not just a restricted diet. Nor is it as simple as that. It stands for Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder and has three main types.  \n**Sensory**, where you restrict your diet due to the sensory properties of food causing over stimulation or sensitivity. This can be because of smells, textures, appearance, colour, etc. It can also include interoception (how you feel things in your body).  \n**Lack of interest**, where you have little to no interest in food. This could be exhibited by having no appetite, being extremely picky with what you eat, forgetting to eat, and getting distracted during mealtimes.  \n**Fear of averse consequences**, where you have fear reactions to food because you are scared of choking, nausea, vomiting, or pain that occurs after eating. This can often be caused by a specific traumatic event in the past (eg, choking on something, so never eating it again in case of reoccurrence of that incident).  \nA person with ARFID can have any one (or more) of these types to varying degrees of severity.  \n\nFor example, at the moment, I can only eat a few things due to sensory reasons (mainly texture for me, for example smoothies and drinks with bits in make me want to be sick and have done for my whole life), and things just feeling wrong in my mouth or just feel like too much and overwhelm me. There are a lot of foods that I will never and have never tried, and I can say for sure that I will not like them based on how they look. I also don't feel hunger in the same way as other people appear to, because I struggle with interoception due to Autism (another example is not knowing I need the toilet until I'm desperate), and get into states of hyperfocus where I totally lose track of anything else I'm doing for hours and totally forget to eat or drink or do anything apart from the one thing I am focuaing on. I also had an incident last year when I got sick just after eating one of my safe foods and now can't eat it due to being scared of being sick again because I can't stand the texture or taste of sick.  \n\nA restricted diet is not a treatment for ARFID. It is a consequence of having ARFID.",

It\u2019s actually pretty good although a thicker consistency oftentimes than gluteny and you can cut into it right away. Look up Loopy Whisk (or secondarily Gluten Free on a Shoestring). It wasn\u2019t hard to learn and kinda fun :)",

The brand is Brazi Bites, they make original ones and cheesy ones - PB&J is really good on the original, as is Nutella, and they\u2019re also great as just regular waffles with butter and syrup! And then anything savory is good on the cheesy, like a sandwich of any kind! They do not have any taste or texture difference to regular waffles like Eggo (I actually genuinely like the Brazi Bites ones better than any other frozen waffle I\u2019ve had, including gluten ones lol). Glutino is a brand that makes incredible English muffins that are great to pop in the toaster and have with butter, cream cheese, or any kind of breakfast sandwich filling. Glutino also makes sandwich cookies that are just as good as Oreos. Snyder\u2019s makes gluten free pretzels that are amazing and come in sticks, twists, and rods! For cereals, there are tons that are gluten free - any rice or corn Chex, lucky charms, cocoa and fruity pebbles, etc. Katz is a gluten free brand that makes amazing donuts, donut holes, and other bread-y sweet treats. Let me know if you\u2019re looking for anything else specific and I\u2019d be glad to help!",
