  "selftext": "I've always been a picky eater my whole life, despite really wanting to participate in something as simple as eating in a restaurant with my family. It's always been a deeply personal thing for me and I've always been ridiculed by people for it. When I found out that ARFID was a thing, it honestly changed my life because for the first time in my life, I wasn't alone. I've always been lucky enough to have a wider palette than some other people on here but it still affects me in my day to day life and even something where I've had to make up excuses to not go out with friends to eat. I've even been  laughed at by a lady behind a deli for wanting a plain chicken wrap. Even a few minutes ago, my best friends made fun of me for not eating much food despite telling them about ARFID. They just don't understand that I was in tears recently just for not being able to eat a plain burger with lettuce on it. As much as I'd love to eat like a normal person, I just at least wish people understood how serious of a thing this is to me and all other people affected by this and that people can be more widely educated without me feeling persecuted for having an eating disorder. Sorry for the rant but this is the only place I feel I can let out how I feel without being made to feel like I'm crazy.",

But to my surprise he ate 4 pieces of sushi (just rice, crumbed chicken breast, cucumber and cream cheese). I was so proud of him. He came home and filled up on sandwiches but I\u2019m so glad he tried something. He hasn\u2019t been to a restaurant in over 3 years.",

I can't just swallow stuff, I physically can't, when will people understand??",
