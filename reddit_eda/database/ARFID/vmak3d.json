  "selftext": "I told a trusted coworker that often (playfully) teases me about eating so few foods. I didn\u2019t tell him to stop doing it, I just gave an explanation behind my behavior. Was expecting him to be sympathetic but instead was hit with the \u201cthey have a name for everything nowadays\u201d card. When I tried going deeper into the topic he sarcastically agreed that I had an eating disorder- and I made it very clear ARFID IS an eating disorder- before the phone rang and I had to get back to work. It\u2019s so ironic to me that he complains about people not believing he has vertigo, but then turns around and doesn\u2019t believe I have an ED that\u2019s most likely actively shortening my lifespan. My mom also said the same thing but I was expecting that",

It's like he wants to make you feel the way other people make him feel or something. \n\nMy neighbor did the same thing to me. He made some comment about how I \"eat like a bird\". It pissed me off because I am SO much better than I was and it's not a matter of eating like a bird. It's a fucking disorder because I've been traumatized and feel out of control of my life.",
