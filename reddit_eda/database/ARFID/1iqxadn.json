I was cleaning out the fridge some long while later and found it at the back bottom of the crisper drawer\u2026 and it had grown a significant stalk and green leaf things. \n\nThat onion now lives planted in a jar of potting soil I had, and is living in my garage under an electric sun light (it\u2019s winter, and I have cats that will eat any plant I place inside my house.)\n\nIt\u2019s actually thriving.

      "body": "I solved this in a way that seems totally dumb, but it works. \n\nWe have a small locally owned market nearby that only feels produce, meat, and dairy. They have hand written chalkboard signs, the most aesthetically pleasing displays of fruit and veggies, and in season, locally grown stuff that's not spent weeks in shipping. *And* they're the same price as a chain grocery store or less! I love the vibe so much there, that I'm excited about the stuff I buy from them. I only buy a day or two of veggies at a time, so I eat them before the excitement fades. Then, I get to go back and be all excited again! \n\nI also bought a fridge that's super helpful. It has a middle drawer that pulls out separately from the doors that's for snacks. I clean and put veggies and fruits in there in pretty displays that make me want to actually eat them. Any time i feel snacky, I open that drawer first, and I almost always choose something from in there. I mean, radishes cut to look like roses? Yes! Carrots made into flowers with a bento punch? I can do that. \n\nIt turns out the more pretty or cute I find food, the more willing I am to eat it. This doesn't apply to foods I completely cannot stand, but it works for things I like and things I can tolerate.",
