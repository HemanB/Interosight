  "selftext": "Walking through Costco with my mom, we encountered a lady handing out samples of frozen blueberries (thawed). My mum grabbed a cup and offered me one. I\u2019m starting therapy in regards to my eating soon and decided to take an early start so to speak and just try it - and although I didn\u2019t like the texture, I liked the taste. I didn\u2019t feel nauseous, I didn\u2019t spit it up, I didn\u2019t puke and I swallowed the damn thing, I feel proud of myself, and thanks to a blueberry",
