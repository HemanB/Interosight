It took us two and half years of visiting pediatricians who kept insisting that he is a fussy eater before we finally met one doctor who was brave enough to tell us that our son has ARFID.

I am optimistic though, all I want is for him to have a wide enough repertoire of safe foods that will keep him healthy.",
