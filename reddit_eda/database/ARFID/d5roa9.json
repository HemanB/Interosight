I related to the child so i went to the comments and called her an asshole. I read another comment saying he might have ARFID and tagged this sub. After a quick google i realized i related to most of the symptoms. I always thought i was just a weird picky eater. But now i found people that relate to me. This is mindblowing. I thought i was alone.",

I had very severe anxiety as a child, and it seemed to get better once I started to take medication for the anxiety. I think it all depends on how severe it is. Mine wasn\u2019t terribly severe, but my boyfriend has it way worse than I ever did.\n\nBut the bottom line is, there is hope! ARFID was only recognized as a real disorder a few years ago, and it\u2019s gotten a ton more recognition since then. Talk to your doctor and/or therapist (if you have one) about it.\n\nWhat\u2019s important now is making sure you\u2019re able to maintain a healthy diet with your ARFID. Make sure you\u2019re taking a multivitamin (gummy or chewable if, like most others with ARFID, you cannot swallow pills)!\n\nYou can do this! Understanding ARFID is the first step in making things easier for yourself. Stay strong!",

If you're not looking at a piece and thinking 'I actively *want* to try that' then - freaking don't. Don't force yourself to because you think it'll be good for you. It honestly took me weeks to months of looking at each new food on other people's plates/in group situations before I felt ready to try a bite (and there have been plenty of things where I've tried one bite, decided I liked it, but that I couldn't handle any more than one bite right then).\n\n\nI find that when I actively want to try something new myself, out of interest, that I don't gag on the texture or taste. If it's super gross to me or feels really wrong I might still spit it out and need a drink, but I don't throw up or feel like I want to.  (I guess I'm more mentally prepared to handle the texture/flavour?)  On the flip side, if I feel even a little bit pressured into putting something I'm unsure about in my mouth I'll gag -- even if it's something I've maybe tried a few times before and been okay with, but just aren't comfortable with yet.",
