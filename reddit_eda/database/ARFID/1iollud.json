  "selftext": "Thought I'd let yall know just in case someone in this sub is in the military and has ARFID.\n\n  \nOne thing that SUCKS with military is that if you're a single solider you gotta eat at the DFAC which is basically a buffet but all the food is hard to eat for me. The army has a payment called BAS which is a food allowance BUT you will never see that money in your paychecks, it's auto deducted and goes towards the DFAC. \n\nIf you go to medical and get ARFID in your medical records you can actually start collecting BAS which is $465 per month + back pay.\n\n  \nOnce I started getting BAS my SGT said I'm the first person he has ever seen get BAS as a single solider lol \n\n\nedit: this is in the US Active Duty army ",
