  "selftext": "So have any of you tried to help manage your condition with marijuana. When I had medical issues in my 20s I was prescribed Percocet like it was vitamins. A doctor suggested I try marijuana. Since then I've used marijuana just for the munchies. A lot of time when my ARFID makes even my safe foods repulsive I'll get stoned to get the motivation to eat. Has anyone else used this method? Am I making the right choice doing this? Will it cause more issues with my ARFID? My ARFID is mostly sensory triggered. \n\nUpdate: Thank you all for your kind and insightful comments and support. I have tried to respond and like every comment. I am putting my phone down because I have been typing for over an hour. So if your comment isn't liked or whatnot please know I will get to it \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f and again a big thanks to everyone. ",

Weed can help with a lot of things including an increase in appetite for those that need it. I know it's a bit annoying to hear, but if you are going to use weed as a benefit, please monitor your cognition/memory and mood overtime. \n\nThe community surrounding weed can be a little overzealous with it because of how much harm the criminalization of it has done, but it doesn't \\*not\\* have side effects, just like any medication/substance you put into your body. It's not black (dare program) or white (what lots of stoners like myself would've said), it's grey much like everything in life. If it works for you and it doesn't impact your daily life negatively, go for it!\n\nIf people notice changes in you and you don't believe so, I'd take into consideration what the people around you are saying because it IS a slow burn in terms of the negative side of things popping up. Kind of like losing weight, if you look in the mirror every day for a couple months (for those of us with body image issues anyways) you might not think you've made much progress, but when you look back to where you started you've actually made more progress than you thought. It's similar to the negative affects of weed. I personally didn't notice it or even listen to people around me until it got bad. But, I'm also mentally ill, I have bipolar disorder.\n\n  \nAt the end of the day: cost and benefit analysis. If the benefits outweigh the costs, go for it. If not, I'd stop while you're ahead. Physical weed withdrawals aren't very fun, didn't even know they were a thing until a month ago LOL.",
