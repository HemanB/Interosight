For a salad, just set aside a serving of lettuce before adding the dressing. People really be acting like we\u2019re expecting them to grow and harvest a whole ass plant just for us, not just take 5 seconds to set some aside. \n\nBut also, you\u2019re capable enough to be assembling these things yourself so their complaint is even less valid!! Literally _all_ they have to do is say \u2018Hey OP, come get your plate before we add the dressing please!\u2019 It\u2019s **not that hard** \ud83e\udd72 \n\nPersonally I can handle most condiments but I prefer to be able to put them on myself, so I can control the ratio and not have a soggy mess!!
