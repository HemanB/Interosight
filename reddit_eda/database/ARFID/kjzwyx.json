      "body": "One time when I was with my ex we went to my cousins new year's eve. I was eating grapes and dry bread the whole evening.\n\nA half year later they included me to a barbecue, well my ex just told me about it, except that I was sleeping at his house for some weeks so it felt more like a party in my temporary home. I thought the cousin had my eating habit still on her eye and didn't buy much food for me naturally, though she didn't ask at all. He told it so casually that I didn't think much about it, assumed he talked with her about me and food. Big mistake as his cousin seems to be _obsessed_ with food.\n\nWhen they finally arrived I was soon screamed at by a pregnant lady, her, because my ex didn't told me that I would be needed to pay for the food. \n\nMe, a poor one. Eating disorder. Grapes and bread on new years, sitting next to all kinds of sweets and stuff a woman could make in a whole day. And it wasn't fair at all as they expected _every_ member of the family/party (eight people) to pay the same amount (which was ridiculously high with 20\u20ac/~24$), what meant some would eat less like usual (10-15) but pay way more (still _20 fucking euros_). Plus, what she didn't know, I don't really eat meat. I would have eaten like 4\u20ac with all the coke I could drink and paid 20\u20ac.\n\nIt was so fucking toxic you don't believe. My ex, his father and my ex' grandma had a secret agreement that they would pay for her food as she didn't have that much money whenever the family threw an expensive party. Imagine being so busy with your own stuff that you don't even know your own grandma is too poor for this. What is wrong with the family that they tried so hard to keep this agreement from the cousin _and_ her mom instead of you know, just saying hey, let's try to keep this cheaper.\n\nSo, we in the kitchen, cousin demanding 20\u20ac. She asked _screaming_ why I was even there after I told her I just don't have that much money. I'm an honest person so I bluntly told her I'm currently living there, could have also told her that it was because of my abusive living situation where I was before. At one point I just couldn't take it no more, my eyes teared up and I didn't want to cry in front of a woman who didn't mind to scream at me for three constant minutes while I just stood there quiet answering her grilling, hey boyfriend just listening, and nobody in the family in the next room coming over and stopping her, helping me or anything. I just went into my ex' bedroom and cried there. I packed my handbag, realized I left my only lighter on the balcony and rushed through the living room. On the way back her mom told me running away wouldn't solve my problems. Yeah fuck off, it surely does when someone is cruel or abusive to you. I then left the apartment and cried in the bus, hurt and ashamed.\n\nI wouldn't even have minded to explain my eating problems to her _if she just had asked_. She knew I had only eaten grapes and bread on her new years party and still assumed I would eat so much meat. I didn't even know that it would cost so much, that it _can_ cost so much for a single person; the parties that I know are as cheap as possible without being bad, no one needs to pay when they can't, they shouldn't be excluded just because of money. And they weren't even rich or anything, my ex and his dad were also struggling (secretly of course) and just better at not eating when they didn't have the money. The cousin had it better bus wasn't rich either, her mom idk.\n\nTo this day one of my five worst memories and I've been traumatized by caretakers, raped, bullied in three different schools from 6-15, had a psychotic attack, been addicted more often than I can count and tried to kill myself three times, just to name the worst stuff. No way I'm ever going somewhere to eat again before telling the caterer that I have an eating disorder and won't eat much except for bread and maybe a little bit more. And yeah I fear the day I meet someone new and eat with their family the first time, will probably never happen.",

          "body": "One time when I was with my ex we went to my cousins new year's eve. I was eating grapes and dry bread the whole evening.\n\nA half year later they included me to a barbecue, well my ex just told me about it, except that I was sleeping at his house for some weeks so it felt more like a party in my temporary home. I thought the cousin had my eating habit still on her eye and didn't buy much food for me naturally, though she didn't ask at all. He told it so casually that I didn't think much about it, assumed he talked with her about me and food. Big mistake as his cousin seems to be _obsessed_ with food.\n\nWhen they finally arrived I was soon screamed at by a pregnant lady, her, because my ex didn't told me that I would be needed to pay for the food. \n\nMe, a poor one. Eating disorder. Grapes and bread on new years, sitting next to all kinds of sweets and stuff a woman could make in a whole day. And it wasn't fair at all as they expected _every_ member of the family/party (eight people) to pay the same amount (which was ridiculously high with 20\u20ac/~24$), what meant some would eat less like usual (10-15) but pay way more (still _20 fucking euros_). Plus, what she didn't know, I don't really eat meat. I would have eaten like 4\u20ac with all the coke I could drink and paid 20\u20ac.\n\nIt was so fucking toxic you don't believe. My ex, his father and my ex' grandma had a secret agreement that they would pay for her food as she didn't have that much money whenever the family threw an expensive party. Imagine being so busy with your own stuff that you don't even know your own grandma is too poor for this. What is wrong with the family that they tried so hard to keep this agreement from the cousin _and_ her mom instead of you know, just saying hey, let's try to keep this cheaper.\n\nSo, we in the kitchen, cousin demanding 20\u20ac. She asked _screaming_ why I was even there after I told her I just don't have that much money. I'm an honest person so I bluntly told her I'm currently living there, could have also told her that it was because of my abusive living situation where I was before. At one point I just couldn't take it no more, my eyes teared up and I didn't want to cry in front of a woman who didn't mind to scream at me for three constant minutes while I just stood there quiet answering her grilling, hey boyfriend just listening, and nobody in the family in the next room coming over and stopping her, helping me or anything. I just went into my ex' bedroom and cried there. I packed my handbag, realized I left my only lighter on the balcony and rushed through the living room. On the way back her mom told me running away wouldn't solve my problems. Yeah fuck off, it surely does when someone is cruel or abusive to you. I then left the apartment and cried in the bus, hurt and ashamed.\n\nI wouldn't even have minded to explain my eating problems to her _if she just had asked_. She knew I had only eaten grapes and bread on her new years party and still assumed I would eat so much meat. I didn't even know that it would cost so much, that it _can_ cost so much for a single person; the parties that I know are as cheap as possible without being bad, no one needs to pay when they can't, they shouldn't be excluded just because of money. And they weren't even rich or anything, my ex and his dad were also struggling (secretly of course) and just better at not eating when they didn't have the money. The cousin had it better bus wasn't rich either, her mom idk.\n\nTo this day one of my five worst memories and I've been traumatized by caretakers, raped, bullied in three different schools from 6-15, had a psychotic attack, been addicted more often than I can count and tried to kill myself three times, just to name the worst stuff. No way I'm ever going somewhere to eat again before telling the caterer that I have an eating disorder and won't eat much except for bread and maybe a little bit more. And yeah I fear the day I meet someone new and eat with their family the first time, will probably never happen.",
