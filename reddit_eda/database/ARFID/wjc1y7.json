So to have what little you have of something that's essential for your own survival but that you're also offering to someone else despite what bare essentials you barely have to get by, whether sharing it with \"kin\" or not, then to only have it rejected is almost seen as throwing someone a lifeline and them flipping you off and screaming in your face, lol.  Not to mention, it's in the heart of the Bible Belt too, so people around here also consider every scrap of food to be a direct blessing from God that they're lucky to have each meal they have it (which...  as a lifelong non-Christian I respectfully disagree lol), and so you're also seen as smacking God across the face, too, to top it off.  Honestly, you'd probably at least have an easier time calling whoever made the food a whore because at least then you might get a couple laughs.  But rejecting food is just outright despicable in most Southern homes from what I've heard of others in several different states in the South, too.\n\nAnd as someone with ARFID I. can. not. stand. it. \ud83e\udd22\ud83d\ude2d Especially with some of the reeeeally weird ways that foods are specifically tweaked with here, both with my family being multiracial/Affrilachian and with Eastern KY seemingly having their own spin on foods you wouldn't think to modify in really weird (or \"unique\", maybe I should say) and often gross (imo) ways...",

I had a professor who literally when at first offering to discuss some projects I was working on after graduating, she changed her mind about eating out with me and ultimately meeting up in person period (since meeting up almost always involves food), because I \"eat like a bird\" in her words (although it was mostly I couldn't eat from the smells of foods I hated the previous times we ate together).

The outside gets crispy and the inside is soft and stretchy and chewy. It is made with mozzarella, parmesan, and tapioca flour. \n\nI make big batches from scratch every once in a while, and if you portion all the dough out into little balls you can also freeze them and save the extra to cook at a later date. (they cook up from frozen perfectly, you can\u2019t even tell!) \n\nI first found out about it from an infographic about \u201cbread & cheese meals from all over the world\u201d that was posted to help picky eaters survive abroad, and i was feeling adventurous so i tried a few. I have been making pao de queijo regularly ever since, and it is probably one of my most reliable safe foods ever since.\n\n\nedit: disclaimer i am american and i\u2019ve never had authentic pao de queijo but this is just what i have learned over the past few years of making it as a main safe food",
