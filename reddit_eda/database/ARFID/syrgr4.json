There\u2019s no pressure to eat.\n2. They focus on behaviors and reframing your relationship with eating \n3. They\u2019ll coordinate with other doctors if needed (if you need a therapist, GP, medication, etc) \n\nI put it off for way too long. I have been stunned at how much it\u2019s helped me. I must pass it on\n\nEdit: 4. They don\u2019t care about weed, or at least mine couldn\u2019t care less",
