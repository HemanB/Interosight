      "body": "I\u2019m going to try to keep this productive, but where in the world are you coming from? Obviously there\u2019s a lot of variation to menus everywhere and I don\u2019t think anyone expects every restaurant to function exactly the same, but let\u2019s consider a hypothetical comparison. What you seem to be suggesting is that every person with an allergy needs to take the time to ask someone about ingredients every single time they eat anywhere other than at home, and if they aren\u2019t willing to do that then they should only ever eat at home (which is an unrealistic expectation because of a variety of factors: travel, children, jobs, special events, convenience, the list could go on). OR restaurants could take the time to list the ingredients in their dishes one time with an ingredient list that they already know, and people with allergies or preferences could skim the menu and be able to make the decision for themselves if they need to ask for an accommodation or not. No guess work, just streamline the \u201cExcuse me waiter, could you explain to me what\u2019s in this dish? Oh it has ____ in it? Shoot I can\u2019t eat that. What about this one? Oh I can\u2019t have it either. Can you list anything I can eat here? I can\u2019t eat this, this, this, this, or this. Please go through your own menu and eliminate options one by one until we find something.\u201d It\u2019s not just a hassle for the customer, but also the wait staff. And that hassle could all be avoided if restaurants just described dishes better on their menu. \n\nAlso in another comment you talked about people who have an allergy to some obscure thing that is found in a ton of other ingredients. I agree that knowing how that allergy affects what you can eat is on the person with the allergy and not the restaurant. That conversation with a server wouldn\u2019t go \u201cCan you tell me what dishes don\u2019t contain allium?\u201d It would probably go \u201cCan you tell me what dishes don\u2019t have onions, garlic, etc.\u201d and then it\u2019s a whole elimination process. Or alternatively the individual with the allergy could do the work themselves by reading the menu. \n\nYou make it sound as if people who have allergies (that they obviously don\u2019t want) should make those allergies almost part of their personality by how much they have to bring it up. It\u2019s kind of like the joke about vegans make being vegan their personality, but if they just identify the vegan options on the menu (which is becoming more common) then there\u2019s no \u201cI\u2019m vegan, what can I eat?\u201d The options in this hypothetical are restaurants could be inconvenienced one time to update their menus (something they already do from time to time) or the roughly 33 million people who have food allergies can be required to let servers know that they have an allergy and need to be accommodated if possible every time they go out. Or I guess the other option you presented was that those 33 million people could just eat at home every meal of their life. I don\u2019t know about you, but to me that sounds pretty miserable. \n\nAnd if you\u2019d rather a non-food comparison, just think of how many times you experience the infamous \u201cthis meeting could have been an email\u201d but the conversation with the server is the meeting and the menu is the email. \n\nHaving some compassion for people who have issues that you may not understand isn\u2019t a bad thing. If people chose compassion over apathy, I think the world be a lot easier to live in. For everyone.",
