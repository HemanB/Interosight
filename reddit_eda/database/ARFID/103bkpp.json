  "selftext": "wow. only around a dozen pages in I started crying. I've never felt understood like this, I've even been told that it's impossible for me to have ARFID by two different people and seeing that I'm not just convincing myself that I'm ill is so reassuring. Like there's a light at the end of the tunnel and it's actually feasible for me to reach it one day. I'm not making it up, my reasoning behind my food aversions is backed up by science and by other people who have the same experiences and have gotten better. part of the reason for my recent break up was that my ex was fed up with my food issues and thought that I was doing it on purpose, they even tried to convince me that I was and was just in denial. my problems are real. I don't have to be miserable anymore. I know it will be hard to break 24 years of disordered eating, but I'm going to work at it as hard as I can. Not just as a fuck you to the people who have hurt me because of it, but also as a form of self love. my future happiness is worth my effort. anyone who doesn't see that doesn't deserve me. that goes for you guys too- you are worthy of a life where food and eating is easy for you. you are worth the effort it takes to get there. I love you all.",

      "body": "I\u2019m older and was twice dumped because of my eating habits; this was before arfid was listed in the DSM5 and everyone in my life thought I was obstinate and picky. There wasn\u2019t the language to express that my brain was disordered when it came to food. Some of my family have since expressed regret about how I was treated as a child, and now I have supportive friends which is a light\u2026 \nAnyone who judges you based on their perception of you or your actions is not worthy of the amazing person you are.

I am excited for the book.  It should be here tomorrow!",
