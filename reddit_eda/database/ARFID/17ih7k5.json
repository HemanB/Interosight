  "title": "Why is mayo an assumed ingredient in EVERY sandwich??",
  "selftext": "I had a thing for work a few months ago where lunch was provided from a local cafe. We had the menu ahead of time and I had to give three options. So I chose the only three that didn\u2019t have mayo in the list of ingredients while everything else did. 2 out of the three options ended up including mayo anyway. Whyyyyy. Mayo doesn\u2019t belong anywhere near a caprese sandwich/wrap!\n\nMy most recent experience really pushed me over the edge though and I\u2019m still mad about it. Stopped into a sandwich place while out on a job that was really more of a deli/market. The menu just said stuff like \u201cturkey sandwich\u201d and \u201cham sandwich\u201d with no more information. I order the turkey sandwich and they ask me what I want on it. So I said lettuce and cheese. I had a feeling they might put other stuff on it but thought no, that\u2019s your anxiety, she asked what you wanted on it and you told her. Grabbed the sandwich and left. Sat down outside to eat somewhere else and it was a massive sandwich with massive globs of mayo in it. I was so frustrated I wanted to cry. Because I didn\u2019t have time to go anywhere else and I\u2019d spent $12 on this abomination. \n\nI have gotten past so many trigger foods as an adult, but it\u2019s like for every food I add to my list of safe things, it makes something else even more offensive to me. I can actually eat tomatoes now, sometimes even enjoy them, and don\u2019t have a fear of new foods if I know everything that\u2019s in it first. Lots of other stuff I was finally able to get past. But now mayo, mushrooms, olives and basically anything that comes out of the water are that much worse for me. \n\nBut maybe I\u2019m the one that wrong??? Like I didn\u2019t tell her I wanted bread for my sandwich because bread is implied so I got bread. Is mayo implied for everything too? \n\nWhy is everyone so adamant on having massive globs of this stuff on their sandwiches I can\u2019t",
