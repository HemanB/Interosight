I took 3 years of CBT therapy with a professional, and it changed my life, so I've been hoping to come across research that showed a potential benefit to applying CBT to ARFID; I've even brought this up with his team at Equip. Really excited about this sort of approach as a possibility. The one perspective I would offer is that I don't think that CBT-AR will be as effective without the guidance of a professional. I read through plenty of CBT texts while I was in therapy, but it really took some hand-holding and objectivity from my therapist to get it to take.\n\nEDIT: BTW, if you have access to Cambridge publications through your library, you may be able to download the text for free; that's how I accessed it.",
