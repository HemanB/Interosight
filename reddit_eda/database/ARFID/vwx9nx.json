Oniony like a sour cream and onion chip, minus the cream, in a delicious and salty pan-fried pancake. If you choose to make dumplings at home, you can flatten the extra wrappers, sandwich olive oil, green onion, and salt in between, and pan-fry them to make this dish.\n- Khao Piak Sen. Lao chicken noodle soup. Noodles are chewy and the soup is thick. So, so comforting, this is easily a favorite of mine.\n- Rice noodle rolls. Exactly what they sound like - thick sheets if rice noodle dough is rolled up, with or without meat, most commonly shrimp. Served with a soya sauce, with oyster and/or peanut sauce served on the side. Typically a dim sum food.\n- Omurice. Japanese egg ommlette served with rice and ketchup.\n- Karaage - Basically deep fried chicken pieces (Japanese). Like popcorn chicken.\n- Youtiao. Chinese fried dough stick. Often served with congee (dinner/lunch), or with the rice noodle rolled around it (dim sum).\n\n\nSee if your family will make some modifications to their meals to better align them with what you can eat, over better yet, make it with them! I'm 30 now, and it's only within the last few years that my family has started doing this. I recently tried Nem Kao (Lao crispy rice salad) minus the pork. Delicious!",

I love soup dumplings!\n\nMy family is Lao-Chinese and I feel similarly - there are so many things from my cultures I can't eat, and while working with an OT or Dietitian has helped, they just aren't familiar with the different foods. I'm able to eat many of the chicken + carb dishes, but struggle with the more complex ones. I grew up with Kaffir lime trees at every relatives' home, but the smell of the plant made me feel sick for years.\n\nSome things I would recommend include:\n- Udon noodles, either stir-fried or in soup. They are fairly plain on their own, simple carbs with a touch of sourness.\n- Japanese Curry - not as strong as other curries, and not spicy. You can get the Glico brand instant curry at the store and make your own at home, so you can control how strong it is. Works well with chicken and white potatoes, served over white rice.\n- Grilled skewers, common at Thai/Lao/Japanese restaurant\n- Congee. Literally boiled white rice with toppings.\n- Pho (rice noodles in soup). You can often get the soup and meat separately, especially if you order one with a \"grilled\" meat.",
