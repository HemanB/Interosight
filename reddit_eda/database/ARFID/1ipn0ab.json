If we are out and there\u2019s something on my plate I won\u2019t eat, I\u2019ll just put it on his plate and he gobbles it up. He tries new food all the time \u201cfor fun\u201d which to me is one of the weirdest things a person can do. But everyone is different!",

Then started the 'you aren't leaving until you've finished'. Then came the force feeding, which made me sick, therefore reaffirming my 'belief' that the food was making me sick. This cycle kept going and getting worse as my parents grew more frustrated.\n\nIt really pisses me off when I hear 'my kids would have eaten it' or ' I would make my kids eat it'. If they'd just left me alone I'd probably have just grown out of it.",
