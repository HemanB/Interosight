  "selftext": "So I'm a mom of twins, one with moderate-severe ARFID, one with a milder case. They're 4 years old and currently in OT to overcome it. They have made great strides, *however* I admit I never quite understood it, I was thinking along the lines of \"if you just make them eat it they will get over it\", luckily I stumbled over this sub. Now i understand that my kids don't want to be like this, they get no pleasure from ignoring fruit/veg, it isn't a personal battle with me, but a battle they've been born with.\n\nThanks to this sub I no longer feel personally attacked when they refuse food, and have learnt that even the smallest victories they claim over new foods, are in fact not small at all for them or me.\n\nWe all have a long way to go, but we are claiming wins every other day, and thanks to you guys I know I'm doing the right thing by getting them help early.\n\nBig love.",
