  "title": "After over a week of nothing but a couple protein shakes and 3 days in the hospital my daughter has finally started eating one of her safe foods again!",
  "selftext": "My daughter had 5 cinnamon buns today and I am so happy I could cry. It is the first safe food she has eaten besides a few meal replacement shakes that she has eaten since before her hospitalization. I will make her as many cinnamon buns as she wants!!\n\nEdit: Thank you so much for the award! My daughter has eaten MANY more cinnamon buns since I posted this and we have even done some late night runs just to buy more. She has also just started eating a couple other safe foods which is really exciting!",
