If you felt like you were going to die, then the way you were trying was obviously not right for your body. I feel like veganism has helped a lot with my ARFID - it's difficult, but after knowing the ethical, environmental and health implications of being non-vegan, I could no longer eat animal products. Vegan documentaries and videos had a profound impact on me - if you're interested, you can PM me, I'll try my best to help you. I thought I'd *never* be vegan either but I've managed for three weeks. Best of luck to you on your vegan journey. :)",
