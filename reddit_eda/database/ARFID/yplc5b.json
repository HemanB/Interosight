  "selftext": "The only exception to this is desserts: I'm perfectly fine with bits of solid fruit in yoghurt, or raisins in cakes etc etc. But in that case the hard part is expected so it doesn't take me by surprise.\n\n\nWhat I can't stand is eating meat and accidentally biting on cartilage, or eating lasagna and biting on tomato seeds, and so on. When it happens I literally start gagging and need to excuse myself to the bathroom because the urge to throw up is big. Feeling the crunch under my teeth puts me into panic, it's so gross and nobody gets it!!",

All my pasta sauces get blended, and pasta never contains veggies. When we get a rotisserie chicken I only eat the chicken breast and my partner eats the rest of it. With the breasts, I remove every bit of cartilage/weird texture, and they're cut up. Even meat fat like in a steak will make me spit out the bite, so I always trim the hell out of all meat I consume.\n\nTotally get what you mean about desserts though, can totally do cake/pie/ice cream with raspberry/strawberry sauce (with seeds) and crunchy nuts or fresh fruit or whatever.",
