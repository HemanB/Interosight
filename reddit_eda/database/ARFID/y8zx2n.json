I mostly just read, but when I saw you were crying, my heart went out to you. No one should be made to feel bad about how they eat, and why. I hope you can reach that point in your life. I have, but I think when you hit my age, you kind of say f\\*\\*\\* you to people who want to give you grief. Keep working on it, but at the end of the day, it's your body, and your condition. Don't take crap from anyone. I can usually shut people down with \"Why do you care what I eat?\".",

Have the most compassion for the phase of feelings you are likely going to endure very soon. Just because now you understand, do not have the highest anticipations that your circle will as well. Consider this a leap in self-discovery and understanding yourself that much more \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffd you are the same you that you have always been and have spent your entire life searching for. Replace the frustration and confusion for kindness and saftey. Just because you may not have known the name doesn\u2019t mean you haven\u2019t been battling it from birth. And by battling I mean providing by the only means you knew how. Relief and hope in discovery. Recharge, because this is only the beginning. One love \ud83c\udf31",
