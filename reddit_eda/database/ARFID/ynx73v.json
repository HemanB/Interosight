      "body": "\nI\u2019m meeting up with a friend from high school who I have not seen since high school. She sent me a few options for coffee or brunch places and for some reason I pressured myself into agreeing to the brunch place, even though my appetite issues are worst in the morning and I always struggle with big brunches, especially if I\u2019m nervous about being around people I don\u2019t know very well. \n\nI\u2019ve been in a better place lately where I\u2019ve been able to eat more, so that\u2019s probably why I agreed to brunch. In recent years whenever I\u2019ve met up with people outside my very tight circle for a meal, I\u2019ve gotten really stressed about whether I\u2019ll be able to eat something from the menu, and that anxiety compounds as I think about the anxiety, the nausea, and people judging me, and then more anxiety comes with those thoughts. Thanks Arfid. \n\nLast night I looked over the menu of the brunch place again and realized the stress I\u2019m about to put myself through just by agreeing to brunch. I realized my inability to eat brunch would be partially due to nausea, and mostly due to anxiety around whether I\u2019ll be able to eat, ironically. Long story short, ARFID and general anxiety are a vicious cycle. Then I reminded myself catching up with an old friend should be a fun happy occasion.\n\nSo I decided, for once in my life, to just advocate for myself. I\u2019m always so worried about being judged for the way arfid presents, that I put myself through stressful situations that will frankly exacerbate my symptoms. And of course, my friend didn\u2019t mind changing the plan and for us to meet at a coffee shop where I can get something light. We haven\u2019t kept in touch until now but this simple interaction makes me appreciate my friend so much. Advocate for yourself!!!",

      "body": "Yeah, I think a lot of the stress is just built up from so many meals where I\u2018ve eaten  two bites and had to come up with some excuse for why I couldn\u2019t finish the rest. Honestly it feels really embarrassing when that happens. Also, there have been times where someone really wants to go to a particular place so I\u2019ll agree so as not to let them down. Or, because I\u2019m so particular about the places and food I eat I\u2019m worried if someone is the same way that they\u2019d be disappointed. Like if I have a particular place/craving in mind and someone suggests something else, it\u2019s hard not to feel disappointed.\n\nLong story short I\u2019m a massive people pleaser and that is the source of a lot of anxiety for me (working through this every day), so arfid is tricky to navigate.",
