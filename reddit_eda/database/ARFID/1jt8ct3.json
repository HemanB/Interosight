  "title": "PSA, re: \"free\" ARFID Support Call This Week",
  "selftext": "Hi r/ARFID! \n\nWe just wanted to make a quick post giving people a heads up about a post you may have seen last week. The post was by a user, u/fairy-girly-222, who professes to be a dietician passionate about ARFID. She wanted to host a virtual support group for ARFID. The original post, which she took down, was located here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ARFID/comments/1joxim7/free\\_arfid\\_support\\_call\\_next\\_week\\_exclusive/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ARFID/comments/1joxim7/free_arfid_support_call_next_week_exclusive/)\n\nWe had several users reach out to us concerned that this was some sort of scam or marketing pitch. Mods have attempted to reach out to the user to verify her credentials and intentions from this group, but we have not received a response even though she did continue posting in the subreddit. \n\nBased on our research, we believe the community should be aware of the following before attending this support group, scheduled for this Wednesday night: \n\n1. This user has a past affiliation with a Multi-Level Marketing Company, Beachbody. After we called her on it, that mysteriously disappeared from her LinkedIn history. \n\n2. This user has not answered mod and user questions about credentials, nor did they specify whether this \"free\" support call might lead to a paid community advertisement. When users began to comment these questions on her original post, she deleted the post altogether. Mods have also reached out individually multiple times.  \n\n3. We were able to located this user's website: [https://www.sozoholisticnutrition.com/about](https://www.sozoholisticnutrition.com/about)   \nIt does appear that the advertised \"free\" call on Wednesday is a first step to a paid, monthly subscription service. Had this been disclosed in the original post, we may not have had a problem-- it's the fact that pretty valid questions have been dodged rather than answered that is concerning to us. It seems that this call for participants was intentionally hiding the potential for a paid subscription later on ($23/month for generalized support group call). \n\n  \nWe VERY MUCH hope this provider is legitimate and could really make a difference for members of our community, and we still invite the user to respond to mod questions about their credentials and intentions in commenting in this subreddit. But until we have that confirmation, we felt it would be irresponsible NOT to post this information given the attention the original post received last week.   \n  \nWe feel that a genuine professional would not have a problem answering the questions posed by the community and mods, and we really hope to get more information about this user soon. Obviously, we'd love to have people in the community who are genuinely willing and able to help, but we also can't ignore these red flags! Mods intend to post additional info and screenshots that gave us pause in the comments. \n\n**Long story short-- if you are intending to go to the virtual support group on Wednesday, proceed with caution!** It's entirely up to you what you decide. We as a mod team are not here to make any decisions for you....we want all of you to have the opportunity to make an informed decision about your care which is why we wanted to ensure this information was available to you all! \n\nEDIT TO ADD: I want to make it clear that mods are still trying to collect information about this, so please do comment or send us modmail if you have any details about this user, her practice, the call, etc. \n\nUPDATE, posted Saturday April 12th:\n\nSorry this took a few days!!\nWanted to give an  update on this week\u2019s previously advertised support group call. I attended to see what the call would really be like. I\u2019m going to try to be objective as possible and leave my opinion for the end\u2013 ultimately, EVERYONE is free to make whatever decision they want with this information. I\u2019m not here to drive anyone away from something that could potentially help them. Our job as mods is to make sure everyone is adequately informed!\u00a0\n\nBrief summary of the call:\u00a0\nExplained what ARFID was, how it impacts people, etc\u00a0\nBriefly discussed various ways ARFID is treated\u00a0\nExplained her vision for an ARFID support group led by a clinician\nIntroduced an app community she built via an app called \u201cCircle.\u201d The group requires a subscription of $23 a month and is essentially a Discord support group led by her. She said she is trying to get therapists and other professionals involved, but does not have anyone but herself at this time. The subscription also includes a monthly support call with her.\u00a0\n\nThe Zoom call did not leave enough time for questions (had a 40m limit) until I asked if she might be able to restart it so that we could ask some questions. Myself and another user asked about the price tag and her qualifications, trying to discern the reason for the monthly subscription. She explained that the subscription cost was because normally as a clinician, she charges upwards of $5500 for services, and she has a waitlist. From my understanding, the app is her way of trying to reach people who might be ON a treatment waitlist in a more casual Discord-like setting. I also let her know that I was a mod on the subreddit and that we were still awaiting responses from her.\u00a0\n\nSo here\u2019s a brief summary of my take, and I welcome other mods + users who attended to add their details/opinions as well so it\u2019s not JUST my opinion.\u00a0\n\nAs someone WITH ARFID who has had years of professional ongoing treatment, I do not feel confident that this individual is qualified to charge this much for the services she is offering\u2013 especially at the costs she is advertising.\u00a0\nHer original post advertised this call as a SUPPORT GROUP CALL. It was, quite simply, a sales pitch. There\u2019s really no other way to put it. It was not a support call. It was all about what she knew about ARFID leading into her proposal for users to join this monthly subscription support group. She even offered a 10% off code. Doesn\u2019t get more sales pitch than that.\u00a0\nShe \u201cdid not appreciate\u201d me asking about her Reddit activity on the call (her words). I tried to do so in the least disruptive way possible\u2014 it was the very end, and at that point, there were only 3 people left (two of which I knew were other Reddit members like y\u2019all). I asked if she had seen mod messages because we were concerned about some red flags with her posting. She still seemed resistant to answering questions and saw her Reddit post and comment history as irrelevant to the discussion. I encouraged her to respond to us. Instead, she deleted her account within 24 hours.\u00a0\n\nThe fact that this was advertised as a support group and ended up being a sales pitch does not sit right with me as a user OR a moderator. Probably should go without saying, but sales pitches are not welcome here in r/ARFID, and the fact that this one was disguised makes me feel even more uneasy.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThis user was banned from the subreddit for self-promotion (and if anyone sees her pop up on a new account, tell mods immediately). However, she may advertise this app elsewhere. I do hope that it\u2019ll be meaningful and helpful for anyone who uses it, but I encourage you to do some research, read through this thread, and make an informed decision that works for you and your loved ones.\u00a0\n\nThe only other thing that I\u2019d like to point out is that we have a Discord Support Group already set up. There are multiple out there, in fact\u2013 one is run by the same moderators of this subreddit and it is a multi-chat format with different areas to discuss anything\u2013 much like the app being advertised. Obviously, our Discord group is free, and will remain free. Though none of us profess to be any kind of medical professionals, the group is always a FREE option for anyone seeking this type of space\u2013 especially if the subscription does not feel realistic for you.\u00a0\n\nI leave this thread open for any other attendees, mods, etc to comment as needed\u2013 this is an open discussion, and again, I\u2019m not here to tell anyone what to do!! Please feel free to comment or message with any questions you have.\n\nTL;DR\u2014 \u201csupport\u201d group call was indeed a sales pitch. User in question was given MULTIPLE opportunities to prove legitimacy\u2014 including me asking her directly on the advertised call. She went out of her way to dodge doing so and deleted her account. That tells me all I need to know. I am really doubtful that her intentions are good, but even if they are, her qualifications and knowledge of ARFID seems lacking.\u00a0\n\nPersonally, if I choose to spend that much money on a treatment provider, I\u2019ll be choosing someone who acts more ethically, professionally, and qualified. \n\n",

For all I know, one of you is actually a patient of hers and we\u2019re entirely off base here\u2026..at least that\u2019s what I was hoping, that we were totally wrong here. I was also hoping we\u2019d get more information after this post so that I could say for CERTAIN what we\u2019ve found here rather than just guessing, but so far all we\u2019ve got is a confirmation she does have an active CNS license, which doesn\u2019t confirm her experience or intentions. \n\nWe\u2019ve been accused of being \u201canti treatment\u201d and stuff in the past, so I try to just state facts and keep my own potential bias out of it\u2014 especially cause we\u2019re not experts and thus COULD always be wrong\u2026\u2026that said, the longer we go without a response from her the more it confirms my original suspicions that this person is predatory. So at this point I don\u2019t think we ARE wrong, unfortunately. \n\n(I also have had a migraine for like 4 straight days. so I may have overcorrected when revising and trying to keep the post professional\u2026\u2026.so I apologize!)",
