      "body": "This is amazing! To also eat the thing you're terrified of because of contamination shows such strength of character, it proves you've got the control, not the ARFID. Pizza is a great food to have on the safe list because it's so so versatile, it's great in social settings and you can pretty much put anything on a pizza. Also! It's okay to not like something, it's okay to dislike the texture or flavour or anything else as long as you've at least tried it. That's what's important, because it proves that you are the one in control. \n\n\nI'm so proud of you ;-;",
