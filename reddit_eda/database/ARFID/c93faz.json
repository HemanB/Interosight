Sometimes people would grab the pepperoni only slices that I made clear were mine, and the head manager of the store this one time told me to pick off the toppings of what was leftover. It was either beef and/or jalape\u00f1os, which I tried telling him it doesn't matter the flavor had seeped into the slice at this point. The insensitive jerk just told me to get over it, it's in my head, and it wouldn't hurt me. Needless to say, I hated that manager (he also made weight comments toward me even though i am on the slimmer side)",
