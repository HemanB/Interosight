  "selftext": "What\u2019s it about? Are people stunted in terms of empathy? Do they really think this is a choice?\n\nI say this as someone who\u2019s gone out of my way my whole life to blend in. So many times I\u2019ve had to swallow while working actively against my gag reflex. People say food is  important in terms of relating to others - sharing a meal is supposed to be a moment of coming together and bonding with each other. Meanwhile they don\u2019t have to gag each time they get a bite with a different texture. Meanwhile they don\u2019t have to fight, it just comes easy for them\u2026 They act like it\u2019s my choice that I\u2019m picky, that I\u2019m purposely being difficult to what\u2026 annoy them? I\u2019m fighting here, all day everyday. \n\nI usually eat what I\u2019m served, but it\u2019s usually a fight especially if it contains meat. I always work on widening my palate, reintroducing foods that have gone out of rotation etc. I just don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s my fault at this point, and I\u2019m so sick of seeing all the hate we get when they don\u2019t have any idea how much we have to *work* for something that they don\u2019t even have to think about.

      "body": ">Are people stunted in terms of empathy?\n\nI don't think it's a question of empathy, but a question of compassion. I have very low/no empathy due to my autism, but with a certain level of understanding and educating myself on people's situations (both of which are a conscious choice I make), I have compassion for people's situations. These people refuse to understand that this isn't something we have control over. They refuse to understand it's a diagnosable eating disorder, it's not a choice. Ironic, considering they choose not to practice compassion, but they think we're choosing this disorder.\n\nIf it makes you feel any better, these same people choose to not practice compassion and understanding towards most, if not all mental health conditions/disorders that don't directly affect them.\n\nAt least this is my take on it. I'll be interested what others in the comments have to say about it.",

      "body": "Agreed, I just feel like some people totally misinterpret what our struggles are about. \n\nI think people are likely more familiar with pickiness in children, and see it as a trait of immaturity that most people overcome as they get older. They draw that false link between pickiness/immaturity and ARFID. They project the fact that many children outgrow pickiness onto ARFID - and they think the solution for that is the same - which is an extrapolation that doesn\u2019t really fit with ARFID struggles. \n\nIt seems like people then judge us unfairly, but they *think* they\u2019re being fair because after all they *feel* familiar with similar traits, which in turn makes it so that they think we\u2019re actively making a choice of being difficult; that it\u2019s a matter of simply choosing to eat more diverse foods. \n\nI don\u2019t know why this grinds people\u2019s gears so much though, like why do they care what you and I prefer to eat. What business do they think they have in that matter? \n\nI see a lot of name calling when this is discussed, particularly the post on AITA recently. This tells me that this is a subject matter that they have certain fixed and strong opinions about, as if they think that everybody either chooses to be \u201cadventurous\u201d or \u201ca toddler\u201d. There\u2019s no grey zone, there\u2019s no compromise, it seems like it\u2019s either one or the other.\n\nI just think they miss the part about how taxing this disorder actually is. They miss how isolating it can feel and how much shame we go through by going through the food on our plate. I don\u2019t think anyone wants to suffer from this. That\u2019s why it bothers me  that so much vitriol is being spewed, like how is that supposed to help? Do they really think this amounts to us just going \u201coh yeah they\u2019re right, I\u2019ll stop letting this bother me\u201d?\n\nUgh sometimes I just can\u2019t\u2026 It feels so isolating.",
