  "selftext": "I've always been sensitive to the smell of food, but I had the realization not too long ago that it's mostly unpleasant with food that's traditionally served warm/hot. For instance, I like hotdogs, but only when warmed up; I always put off preparing one though because of its smell when chilled. Food that's normally served cold, though, I have no issue with. It's weird, but I was wondering if anyone else here has a similar aversion lol.",

Most hot foods bother me, their scents are strong and hang in the air and then I get stressed out and lose the ability to eat entirely from the \"Eat it before it gets cold\" mentality. I get waves of nausea from the scent of warm peanut butter. There are maybe 3 soups I'll eat but only in specific circumstances, and I don't drink any got beverages at all. \n\n\nConsuming hot food/beverages (just talking temperature here, not spice... I'm extremely allergic to red spices) also makes me sweat profusely, and when I'm hot I cannot eat at all. My dad is the same way about hot liquids, and so was his dad, so that may be genetics at play too..",
