  "title": "Server got annoyed with me at a restaurant",
  "selftext": "So my partner and I were out of town this weekend to see a show. She wanted to try out this Mexican restaurant that was nearby to the venue, so we went in for a bite. We've been together a long time and she's well aware of my ARFID (and very understanding and supportive of it I might add), but she's also a foodie and my ARFID can often get in the way of that when we're out together. It was more of a problem at the beginning of our relationship, we've learned to find a balance on that these days. Anyway we planned ahead for this as is our usual plan when she wants to eat somewhere I can't, and we had stopped at a Pizza Hut beforehand so I could eat some breadsticks real quick. No problems there, we go to the Mexican restaurant and sit down to eat. That's when the fun starts.\n\nMy partner orders some empanadas, I just get a beer to prep for the show since I had already eaten. The server asks why I'm not eating and I say I ate before we came since we were just popping in quick before the show (which was true), she shakes her head a bit at that but is cool with it. At this point I should note the place wasn't full and we weren't preventing others from eating, so this wasn't a case of 'useless ARFID guy is wasting a space in my restaurant'. Anyways she comes back later to check in on our meal, my partner tells her she's loving it. The server says to me 'Have you at least tried it?', to which I say 'I actually can't, I have an eating disorder.'. She comes back with 'It's OK, it's halal!' which was hilarious on its own as something being halal has literally nothing to do with eating disorders, but when I tell her 'I still can't try it sorry' she shakes her head and loudly groans at me while giving me a look like I just took a shit on the table.\n\nIt wasn't a big deal at the end of the day and I didn't make a scene or anything, my partner finished her meal and we left with no further problems. I've definitely been treated a lot worse at restaurants before. And to be completely honest I'm very, very used to this happening to me. I've had probably over a hundred experiences just like this in my life at restaurants. But I figured I'd mention it to this subreddit as I'm sure so many of you have also had experiences like this, and it just goes to show how much further we still have to go on public education on this disorder. Just another day in the ARFID life!\n\nIf you've got any restaurant server horror stories (won't let you order off the kid's menu, offended that you're requesting the food made a particular way, that sort of stuff) feel free to share!",

Your server will assume that you also won't be tipping either, bc a tip is usually a percentage of the meal price. \n\nNot to say that she was justified in being rude, but you were also being rude by going to a restaurant and not eating. It's not your fault that restaurants don't pay their servers a living wage, but that's the deal with tipped workers. \n\nI also don't think you should have to buy food you won't eat, or try to force yourself to eat things either, but maybe next time let the server know you'll still be tipping.
