      "body": "Pizza was probably my biggest personal victory over the last 10 years. The first 2-4ish times i ordered it were awful, and at first i gravitated towards a very basic pie of just mozzarella, basil, garlic, and olive oil. But over time i came to really love margherita pies with buffalo mozzarella. The only thing I am really not a fan of now, funnily enough, is basic regular cheese pizza- but pizza has become one of my safe options now from being something I wouldnt touch at all, and gives me hope for pushing further.",
