  "selftext": "\"It's nobody's fault but yours.\" \n\nThat's what my dad loved telling me. \n\nPBJs & French fries. Anything else would get about halfway down my throat, then come right back up. Cue their yelling and my crying. Cue another night of feeling ashamed of my existence. \n\nI tried so hard. I wanted so badly to be normal, or at least to stop feeling like a freakshow. I wanted my parents to stop punishing me for something I couldn't control. \n\nI never saw a professional. To my knowledge, they never even contacted one. Just thought they could make me \"man up\" and get over it. \n\nNevertheless, it improved as I got older. I can eat enough to keep myself healthy, and I don't vomit anymore. Every now and then, my mouth makes weird movements when I try new food, but that's pretty much it physically. \n\nAs all of you know, the real struggle is mental. \n\nI have *abysmal* anxiety about food. I've spent so much of my life in irrational shame and guilt that I buried myself in it - it was my biggest secret. Throughout my life, there were incredibly few people outside of immediate family who knew about it. I didn't eat in front of people unless it was comfortable food. \n\nIt was my biggest secret.\n\n**Was.**\n\nA few weeks ago, while getting to know each other, a new friend asked if I was a picky eater. And I thought to myself, *what the hell, I guess I'll tell the truth this time.* \"It's complicated,\" I said. And I proceeded to tell her everything. \n\nAnd she was accepting. And caring. And understanding. Without a shred of judgment. \n\nSo I started telling more people. I told people I've known for years who never had a clue. And the responses have all been the same. \n\n\n\nI told my therapist (I'm in therapy for other issues), and she doesn't specialize in EDs so she couldn't say anything official, but she mentioned this thing called ARFID. So I looked it up. And I'm certain that's what it was. It all makes sense now. \n\nLast night, I called my mom (dad is dead). I confronted her. I demanded an answer for why they treated me the way they did. And she didn't have one, but she did admit it was very wrong, and that if she could go back, she'd do everything differently. Hearing that healed my soul, just a little bit. \n\nAnd now I'm not ashamed to talk about it. \n\n**\"It's nobody's fault.\"** ~~but yours.\"~~ **Period.**",

For example, I love pizza, but just 3 or 4 flavours and with no onions, olive, etc. And here in the country I live there are a bazillion different flavours, then in a group I get kinda ashamed to \"ruin\" the meeting (even though I don't know their reaction to that).",
