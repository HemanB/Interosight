I sometimes go with \"Thats a bold assumption\" XD How would they know Ive never tried it that way?\n\nIt is true that like, sometimes people grow up thinking they dont like something because their parents literally cant cook. A person I dated thought she HATED pork and turkey because shes only ever had her mothers dry, overcooked, under-seasoned meals. You need to approach using the \"I dont like it\" response with this mindset because thats what some people may assume. It *is* a response you have to defend sometimes. It can work, but it is often you have to defend it or explain it further.\n\nFor me, how I defend it depends on what the food is. Raw fish, for example, I tell them \"I dont like the idea of it. It makes me feel sick thinking about eating it raw.\" and I tell them thats something I cant mentally get past, despite how they prepare it.\n\nThere are other things that are a flavor issue for me. I cannot handle spicy stuff at all. \"I dont like it\" is a perfectly valid response when it comes to how things taste. Bitter, spicy, sour, sweet, etc. Stuff like certain desserts are too sweet for me, too.",

I told you, I don't fucking want to.\n\nI imagine it's similar to how alcoholics get treated. \"Oh, come on, you can have ONE drink, it's my birthday/wedding/whatever.\" Although I think alcoholics get more understanding than we do, when it comes to that kind of thing. More people tend to accept when an alcoholic says they can't have a drink. Most people will keep trying to cram whatever they made down your throat.\n\nI do my best to live my life being as honest as I possibly can. I've always been that way. But with this, I can't. The only way out of most of these interactions is to just lie and say \"I'm not hungry,\" or \"I'm not feeling well,\" or \"I'm allergic\" or whatever. And even \"I'm not hungry\" usually isn't good enough. I didn't start telling people about my issue until I was an adult. Outside my family and those closely associated with, no one knew. Others likely suspected there was something off about me, but they didn't \"know.\" I avoided telling my best friend until I was in my mid-20s, and we'd been friends for 20 years, because I truly felt he'd consider me a fucking weirdo and ditch me. At least after that, I didn't need to lie to avoid dinners or whatever at his or his family's place. Even now, I don't tell most people, because it's fucking exhausting to have to explain myself over and over again.\n\nI'll never understand the importance humans attach to \"We're all eating/drinking together, and if you don't join us, it means you're rejecting us, and it will insult us.\" If someone says no, just accept that and move on.",

Even now, most people give dirty looks to me if I refuse their food.
