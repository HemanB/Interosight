I\u2019ve emailed his teachers and support staff to leave him alone about food and now have permission to pick him up for lunch on a regular basis. (His safe foods are not easily packable and even if they were, the cafeteria is too overwhelming for him to eat there. I was exactly the same way when I was a kid and never ate lunch at school.)\n\nHis laminated \u201cdon\u2019t try to make my kid eat and if you have a problem with it call me at this number\u201d card is in his lunch box (just in case) for days I don\u2019t or can\u2019t pick him up.\n\nHe\u2019s so excited to escape the misery of the cafeteria. Feeling optimistic about this school year. \n\n(IEPs in the U.S. are Individualized Education Plans designed to ensure students with disabilities receive reasonable accommodations. We are implementing one this year to ensure he\u2019s not pressured by teachers and staff to eat and also to give him a chance to eat during the day whenever possible.)",

Not ten minutes later, I threw up all over the entire 24-foot long tables and more than half the kids had to go back through line for second lunches, and it held up the next group of kids I was also humiliated in front of when they loudly went off about what I had done to hold them up.  They called my mom saying I was sick and needed to go home, she was like, \"I'm sure she told someone she couldn't be around them serving that, right?\" They said, \"Well, yeah, but she has to be in here with everyone else.\" This was one of three times my mom ever took up for me, and she was like, \"It seems to me that if you didn't listen to her, it's your fault and you shouldn't subject kids to that kind of treatment.  She feels fine.  I'm not taking her home.  If she says she can't be around the food they're serving because it'll make her sick, maybe next time you'll fucking listen to her.\"  And honestly, after seeing so many IEPs violated left and right with no accountability in the school I worked for, I'm relieved that there's hope here for kids dealing with the same issues, too.

      "body": "Oh man, I am so sorry. The smells get to my son too. I could tolerate them but couldn\u2019t bear to eat or be around everyone eating in the cafeteria so, I often asked to go to the bathroom then hid in empty classrooms during lunch. When I was in the cafeteria I would just stare at the door to the playground waiting until they opened then I would bolt.\n\nLast year I ordered an essential oils sampler and my son and I went through one by one to find which scents he liked. I then put a cotton ball with a couple drops of oil in his lunch box so he had an emergency pleasant smell if needed. I\u2019ve also carried around lemons for the same purpose. Scratch the peel, hand it to him, instant fresh scent. Last year we finally worked out he could eat lunch (see: sit undisturbed) away from where other kids were eating but that led to teasing (which he said was better than being around kids eating, I can\u2019t argue that) but not every teacher / lunch monitor allowed him to do this. (Which is why he now has a laminated note from me in his lunch box.) Some lunch monitors decided he wasn\u2019t allowed to go to recess until he ate something so my poor kid was not even able to go outside. By the end of the year I convinced the school to let me sit at the playground picnic table with him during lunch and that mostly worked but was logistically awkward and the weather didn\u2019t always cooperate. \n\nANYWAY. He\u2019s 7. If he\u2019s gonna hate school I want it to be because of things like homework and group projects, not lunch. I want him to grow up feeling like he can go to a friend\u2019s house after school or do an extracurricular. I didn\u2019t do those things because I would get too tired and hungry. I want him to be able to focus on learning and not suffer the all too familiar combo of morning dread of the cafeteria followed by afternoon stomach grumbling. \n\nI don\u2019t know how many different ways I\u2019ll need to communicate this to his schools over time, or how much I\u2019m going to have to fight. I know some years will be better than others. But, we fought for therapy, we fought for a diagnosis, we\u2019ll keep going.\n\nSometimes though I want to scream (at the school, not him) \u201cIT\u2019S JUST LUNCH!\u201d He\u2019s present and attentive in class, he\u2019s friendly with his peers, he\u2019s not asking for anything (in fact he\u2019s literally asking for nothing). Give him a freaking break when he politely declines a fruit cup or whatever. Like, seriously.\n\nOH, and you did warn them about the fish smell. I have a severe fear of needles (was worse when I was a kid but, yeah). I once went to class only to learn we were going to be watching a video about blood donation. I told my teacher \u201cI absolutely cannot watch this\u201d and asked to go to the library. He refused. The video started and I asked to go to the bathroom. He refused. I threw up, passed out, and hit my head on a filing cabinet. When I woke up, dude was like \u201cI probably should have let you go to the library.\u201d I\u2019m sympathetic to teachers, I really am. They have a lot on their plate. Some of us just literally can\u2019t do what they\u2019re asking.",
