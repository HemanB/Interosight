  "selftext": "I got starved at camp because of my parents. My parents just put that I was picky on the paperwork for camp so I was starved because the counselor took it upon themselves to cure me of being \u201cpicky\u201d. Which I brought a ton of snacks and food because I knew I wouldn\u2019t like the food there and the counselors wouldn\u2019t let me eat MY fucking that I own because I have to eat their food so as a result all I eat there was a few crackers because the nurses gave me it because of my headache. I couldn\u2019t even enjoy camp cause I didn\u2019t have enough energy cause all I eat the whole time was crackers and only a few and I had a severe headache.",

They would make a big meal for everyone at the camp and the only thing they would offer me would be toast or something else I wouldn't eat due to ARFID. note this was also after they were notified of me being a picky eater.  \n\n\nHonestly in your case I would contact authorities of some sort as that is straight up abusive AF and could have led to a serious health issue. These type of stories just makes me wish there was more awareness around it",
