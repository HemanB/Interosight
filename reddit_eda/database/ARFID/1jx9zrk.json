  "selftext": "Idk why but for some reason, whenever I finally find a fruit or vegetable that I enjoy and want to eat, or find a way to eat them that I enjoy, people around me have always gotta find a way to crap on my excitement and gaslight me into thinking literal fruits and vegetables aren\u2019t healthy.\n\nMy two examples:\n\nSome years ago when I was in high school I discovered that i can not just tolerate but actually enjoy medium sized baby carrots by one particular brand (the organic store brand of a grocery store I don\u2019t normally go to, the closer store\u2019s brands/name brands are too soft). I was so excited by this discovery because my health teacher had been having nice side conversations with me (just for fun I enjoyed it) about healthy eating and saying (kindly). After making this discovery, and being so excited that I finally had a vegetable I could eat, I told the teacher this amazing news and that it was the only vegetable I could finally tolerate, and all she has to say is \u201cyou know there\u2019s a lot of sugar in carrots, they\u2019re the candy of vegetables\u201d.\n\nWow, thanks, what a way to kill my excitement. How about I go eat a bag of chips instead, would you prefer that? \n\nApples: similar thing happened to me recently with apples. I finally figured out a fruit I can handle: cosmic crisp apples, sliced, as long as I 1. Feel them when choosing them, and they HAVE to be SO hard that my finger won\u2019t push into them when I press hard. Now that I\u2019ve made this discovery, I feel so happy and great. Not only did I find a fruit I can tolerate, but I ACTUALLY ENJOY IT! I\u2019m eating one right now and I CHOSE to eat it instead of Oreos or popcorn! I\u2019ve been eating one to two a day! But ofcourse, when I told a friend who knows i have \u201csomething like ARFID\u201d (she knows I have autism/sensory issues with food but isn\u2019t aware of the scope of arfid), she says \u201cthat\u2019s a lot of sugar\u201d, and \u201cyou need to eat a variety of fruit so you get all your vitamins\u201d.\n\nOk so how about I just eat a scoop of sugar if they\u2019re both just sugar, am I right? \n\nLike geez people, these are the kind of people who whine about childhood/overall obesity, but when a kid (when I was telling the teacher) or an adult (when telling the friend) comes to you excited about finally finding a fruit they can tolerate after years of searching, they just say \u201cwell you\u2019re not healthy enough\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m still excited about my accomplishments, but these people are annoying. I have common sense so I know carrots aren\u2019t the equivalent to a sleeve of starburst, and I know the \u201climited vitamins\u201d of an apple are more than the even more limited vitamins of a scoop of pure sugar. I\u2019ll be enjoying my apple while they let the perfect be the enemy of the good lol. \n\nAlso did I mention this apple is really good and I\u2019m really excited about it lol. It feels so good finding a new food and not just tolerating it, but ENJOYING IT \ud83d\ude2d am I pathetic that I\u2019m this excited about eating an apple? It took me so long to find a fruit I could eat. I tried dehydrating, fruit leather, basically all varieties of fruit at the store, and finally found something.",

It\u2019s like people already have the notion that your eating habits are ridiculous and don\u2019t want to admit they\u2019re wrong, so even when presented with evidence that it\u2019s not the case, they find a way to try and make it fit their view. It\u2019s rough. \n\nAlso sugar is overly demonised imo. This is from a British perspective so other countries may be different. But even a lot of \u201cunhealthy\u201d foods that are sugary don\u2019t actually have anything \u201cbad\u201d in? Sugar free versions can actually have a lot more artificial ingredients that probably aren\u2019t as good for us. And we need sugar lol. Same as we need fat and salt and carbs and whatever else people have tried to demonise.",

People who just eat salad leaves all day, can talk this bullshit, but like you said: Its much better than just eating a scop of sugar. I recently incorporated apple-crumble into my breakfast routine and it is amazing (considering the alternative is white bread with nutella). Hey I finally found a way to eat fruits regularly, which is a huge step forward. \n\nAnd If people don't eat carros or apples because the consider them sweets, they are really stupid.

It\u2019s way better to snack on carrots than chips or candy when looking for that crunch. Even if you didn\u2019t have ARFID or food sensory issues/restrictions these would be better choices. Like duh. \n\nCarrots and apples are healthy and each new safe food can lead to more. I\u2019m excited with you finding an awesome apple to munch on for that crunch craving. Did you know you can sprinkle a little salt on apples to get that salty crunch? If you like nut butter or cheese both go well with apples. I like hard cheddar pre-cut snack pieces or cheese fondue. Nut butter can be done as a dip or spread on each slice. Any of my suggestions might be a sensory issue but I thought I\u2019d mention them.\n\nBaby carrots are great for dipping or just sprinkle a little salt for that salty crunch craving. If you like yogurt to get more protein you can make a number of dips - onion soup, dill, ranch, etc. If you are having problems getting enough calories daily I love sour cream dip especially Lipton onion soup. Lots of mixes and recipes for veggie dips out there to try. I love wishbone robusto Italian salad dressing so I\u2019ll pour a little in small dipping bowls and dip the carrots in that.\n\nGiven you like the hardness of cosmic crisp apples, if you haven\u2019t tried them yet, you might like red delicious apples - just make sure they feel hard and aren\u2019t on their final week. As apples age they get mushier so squeeze them when shopping to make sure they feel super hard.\n\nSo exciting you found a fruit to love. I\u2019ve been known to do a little dance when I find a new safe food. My youngest niece also taught me to say \u201cI win, I win, I win\u201d while doing the dance. I\u2019m in my 50s for context.",

Cooked carrots have an abysmal GI index once cooked/roasted, due to breakdown of other molecules and such, but raw ones are absolutely GREAT vegetables.\n\nI'm into ketogenic diets and low carb stuff in general (in theory, doing it with ARFID can be an extra pain in the ass depending on individual limitations), training as a Dietitian, and I would never dream of discouraging someone because they managed to add one fruit or veggie to their diet because it's not the \"best\" option.\n\n1 - there's no objective best option at all, variety is friends with good nutrition, but supplements are there for people who can't manage it through diet alone;\n\n2 - as OP said, letting the perfect be the enemy of good is asinine. There isn't good or bad foods, but there are foods with better nutritional profile than others. Raw carrots and apples are more nutritious than statbusts or chips (though it would be nice to have more engineered versions of those that have a better nutritional profile while still being tasty and consistent), and being able to go for those now sometimes is really great for OP.",
