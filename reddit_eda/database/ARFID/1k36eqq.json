  "selftext": "It\u2019s a huge inconvenience. I cannot even look in the direction of a piece of food if I\u2019m not at starving levels of hungry. I always have to bring my own meal to family events and eat it somewhere alone because I can\u2019t handle being around non-safe foods. It\u2019s *so* embarrassing to be a grown adult bringing a little cup of Kraft mac-n-cheese. I avoid food at all costs because the idea of eating just makes me feel sick. \n\nGoing to other people\u2019s houses and trying to articulate a sentence to explain \u201chey I have an eating disorder so, if I don\u2019t eat please understand that it\u2019s nothing against your cooking, i just can barely eat\u201d is embarrassing. \n\nGoing to restaurants and being the only person unable to order food because *what if this restaurant that makes my safe food makes it in a way that makes it not safe anymore* is embarrassing. \n\nHaving to explain hundreds of times to people that it\u2019s not the fact I *don\u2019t* want to try new things (because I wish I could!! I\u2019m extremely jealous of people who can just eat whatever!!), and I\u2019m not just \u201cchildish\u201d is embarrassing. I feel extreme guilt for my ARFID and what comes with it. ",

      "body": "The eating at other people\u2019s houses bit hits *so hard.* But if it helps at all, I can tell you that sometime in my late 20s I just reframed it for myself: I am managing a medical condition. I am *not* judging the cleanliness of this person\u2019s home, their cooking skills, etc. I have told them as much, so if they choose to be offended anyway by a medical condition I cannot control, that\u2019s their problem. It\u2019s like leaping to the assumption that if someone is at your house and has to leave early because they have a headache, they\u2019re stealthily trying to say your house has a strong smell or something like that. It\u2019s just an unwarranted leap. \n\nI\u2019ll only once at the same house explain some version of: I have a medical condition and am a super sensitive eater \u2014 I always eat before I come to a get together rather than make my hosts accommodate me because trust me, it\u2019s so limiting, it would ruin the meal for everyone else! I\u2019m happy to be here, I just won\u2019t be able to eat much, that\u2019s all. \n\nAnd from there I just don\u2019t really explain myself further, I just decline any food that\u2019s offered that I don\u2019t want (generally everything). I find it helps to bring drinks that I know I\u2019ll like \u2014 fizzy/flavoured waters can be a good one \u2014 to fit in a bit better at a table where everyone else is eating. \n\nIf people can\u2019t handle my condition and don\u2019t invite me back because of it, good, I wouldn\u2019t have had much of a relationship with these people anyway since managing ARFID is a big part of who I am.",
