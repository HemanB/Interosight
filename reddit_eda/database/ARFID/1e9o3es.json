  "selftext": "It's just not needed or helpful. I already know. I get it's not always the healthiest. I get that it may seem childish to you. I get that you might not like it or think it's weird. I get that maybe I'm eating at a weird time or that maybe it's not enough. I'm aware. \n\nIt's already hard enough to eat. Commenting on it doesn't help - it just makes me more self-conscious and more aware of the food. It just makes it that little extra bit harder to eat and a lot harder to eat when others are around. \n\n(I'm just frustrated. I've asked my parents so many times to please not comment things like this, and they always inevitably do. And then when I remind them, they say I'm being too sensitive and they can't say anything. It makes me feel like I'm the villain for asking them to think before speaking and it just makes me dislike food even more) ",
