When I was young that was just a pb and J but as I got older I could cook anything I wanted. Honestly they did a great job of managing things. I was able to grow out of the disorder because there was no judgement in our house. They also had a try it once a year policy. It was not a big deal if I couldn\u2019t keep it down and spit out the food or if I didn\u2019t want to eat it. The thing that was key was that I made my own alternative to dinner.  It was independence and control for me. For my parents it meant they never had to make two meals just for me. But they still quietly encouraged me to try new things. Over time I grew to love lots of food and now as an adult I only notice I struggle with textures- crudo, oysters, raw tomatoes- mostly slimey things. Heck just this year I tried strawberries again and I love them now. I found the way my parents didn\u2019t make a big deal out it really helped me. They were way ahead of the times on this too!",

It was just the wiring in my brain that \u201cnoped\u201d a lot of food once I got old enough to be really conscious of tastes and textures. In my case, I don\u2019t think they could\u2019ve done anything differently. They had a quirky kid and rolled with it as best they could. Every situation is different though, maybe someone somewhere has done an actual study on this.",
