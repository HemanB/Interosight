  "title": "Anyone else eat safe foods constantly until they hate them?",
  "selftext": "I've been recently starting to suspect that I may have ARFID due to being really underweight and restrictive eating habits but for the purposes of this post that's neither here nor there.\n\nAnyone take their 'safe foods' and eat them so frequently that it stops being enjoyable or even start to hate it? For example I've gone through a couple frozen pizza brands, different chips, even certain fruits. I just eat them every day (sometimes more than once) and they will make up a large percentage of my calories for that meal. It's amazing for the first few weeks to months but eventually it moves it's way off the 'safe foods' list and it's not the same anymore. Some can even get really gross to me. I'm such an obsessive eater it's crazy. Just wanted to know if anyone else felt this.\n\nEdit: Damn and I thought I had it bad. Stay safe and try to eat enough guys, nutrition affects more than you think and if you need help reach out to loved ones or professionals to try and work around the condition however you can.",

I keep having to put off the bloodwork though. I have severe allergies and since they wanna check for celiac at the same time I have to go without antihistamines for at least two weeks. With pollen and spores being so bad right now I\u2019m probably gonna have to wait several months. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having challenges with getting tested too, all of that would make something like this so much more stressful. \n\nI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever tried it but one thing I\u2019ve been doing to help in the meantime is digestive enzymes. The only one I\u2019ve tried so far is Beano but it\u2019s fairly inexpensive compared to some of the others and it definitely seems to help with some of the uncomfortable symptoms. The enzymes work by helping your body break things down in the digestive tract versus other supplements like Gas X which only relieves gas in the stomach and does nothing to help digest the food itself.",
