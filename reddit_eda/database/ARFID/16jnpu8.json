  "selftext": "I see a ton of posts asking if they have arfid, and I decided to make this post to help people with these questions. I am getting all of my information from \u201cCognitive behavioral therapy for avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder\u201d by Jennifer j. Thomas and Kamryn T. Eddy a Cambridge medicine book. I am not a doctor, but i want to help people in my situation. \n\nAvoidant/restrictive food intake disorder is a common feeding or eating disorder diagnosis that describes people who cannot meet their nutritional needs, typically because of sensory sensitivity, fear of adverse consequences and/or apparent lack of interest in eating food. \n\n- limited variety (avoidance of certain foods, such as fruits and vegetables) and/or volume (restriction of amount) \n\n- sensory sensitivity\n\n- fear of adverse consequences (ex. choking, allergic reaction or vomiting) \n\n- lack of interest in eating or food (ex. low hunger, lack of enjoyment eating.)\n\nTo qualify for the AFRID diagnosis, a persons pattern of eating must be associated with significant negative consequences. These include one or more of the following: significant weight loss/growth, nutritional deficiencies, dependence on tube feeding or reliance on energy-dense supplements, or psychological impairment. \n\nClinically speaking, anxiety and depression seem to co-occur in ARFID. Autism spectrum disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, ODC, and ADHD may be more common in those with ARFID. \n\nARFID is not motivated by weight or shape concerns. If avoidant/ restrictive eating co-occurs with other psychiatric or medical illnesses, the eating disturbance must be severe enough to require independent clinical attention to warrant an ARFID diagnosis.",

You should try your best to eat as nutrient-rich as you can but self-care (as in, making sure your needs are met like sleeping well, hygiene, having a safe place to unwind, helping yourself before you help others) does help the symptoms lessen a little when you're less overstimulated and stressed.

School gave me a lot of traumas I had to work through, micro and macro lol, and it did get much better for a time once I was away from my parents. \n\nThe only reason I regressed back into AFRID territory as an adult is because I overloaded myself on work... If you even suspect you could have any disability co-morbid like being autistic, I know being away from parents who are like that makes it better for a time. But it might be worth it to invest in therapy and confidence building to not have the cycle repeat from being in the workforce. Or getting a very affordable roommate situation.... being stressed about money doesn't help AFRID at all. I would never go back in time to continue living with my parents, but I went from home cooking meals to only being able to drink a specific protein shake for every meal due to financial stress. If you can bare your parents, work with a therapist to build confidence to say \"mom/dad/guardian, you need to back off\" before continuing a cycle of stress elsewhere. \n\nEither way it will be okay, genuinely. There is always time and room to improve  - as of the last 6 months, I'm back to home cooking for the first time in three years. But when I can't, I don't punish myself. Stress reduction is hard but it's so possible and your future is so bright! You sound like how I was at 18, and I'm doing alright. I'm rooting for you friend! :D",
