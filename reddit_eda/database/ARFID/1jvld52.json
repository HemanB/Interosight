  "selftext": "The only way I can eat food is if I have a diet soda of some kind. As a teen I would drink diet coke, but it gave me horrible migraines and my doctor begged me to switch to no caffeine and no aspartame. The only soda like that I could find without sugar was Diet Rite. After years of being able to eat meals and try new foods with the help of it, Diet Rite is now phased out in the Midwest, soon to be the whole country. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 is already online buying me a soda stream to make my own diet cola, but I'm terrified it's not gonna be the same. And yes, I know diet soda is the worst kind and I shouldn't be drinking this battery acid but it literally is the only way I can eat a meal. I've been drinking diet coke for a few days and the migraines are back with a fun bonus of being on the toilet the second I have a sip of it.\n\nNeeded to vent because no one else gets it (except my fianc\u00e9 who is being very sweet).",
