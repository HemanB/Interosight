  "selftext": "I (36F) have always been skinny, mainly due to a combination of ADHD and recurrent ARFID symptoms. I have the traditional \u201cmodel\u201d figure. Over the last 18 mos my ARFID symptoms, which had subsided somewhat for the previous ten years or so, have come back with a vengeance. I feel like I\u2019m a kid/teenager all over again. I just woke up hungry and thought back to what I ate yesterday: two cheese sticks and a slim Jim. I hate feeling like this. I hate being fatigued all the time, and being unable to gain weight like I want. \n\nMost of all, I hate the comments I get: \u201cyou\u2019re so lucky!\u201d Or \u201cwhat\u2019s your secret?\u201d You wanna know what my secret is? Starving. Starving is the secret. Wanna know why I can eat ice cream for dinner and not gain weight? Because it\u2019s the only calories I\u2019ve had in two days. People mean well, but it\u2019s honestly completely gross that society prioritizes looks over health like this.",

The two bites thing is actually the thing that has been my most consistent symptom, along with task initiation problems cause by ADHD, i.e., being hungry and wanting to get up to eat something, but simply being unable to or not being able to decide what I want. My grandma always used to say I \u201ceat like a bird.\u201d \n\nI was able to cope with things for a long time once I got into my later twenties by buying takeout and just eating a few bites here and there all day long. Usually by the end of the day I\u2019d eaten at least one complete mean this way. Sometimes two on good days. This became possible when I finally got a job and had money to buy takeout all the time. I also \nsimultaneously got a reputation for eating stuff that had been sitting out for way too long from a food safety perspective, which is true, but the reality is if I put it away I won\u2019t eat it because I don\u2019t like the texture after it has been refrigerated. \n\nI\u2019ve tried explaining the \u201ctwo bites\u201d thing to my husband, and the best I can do to describe it is that I don\u2019t experience the sensation of being \u201cfull.\u201d Most people seem to equate being full with feeling satisfied. My three settings are: hungry, not hungry, feeling sick. I can only eat enough to stop the hunger, usually a few bites. If I eat more than that I feel\u2026 bad. \n\nI\u2019ve relapsed hard on the food avoidance/forgetfulness though since I started taking ADHD meds, which also corresponded to a job change where it\u2019s not as easy for me to get takeout anymore. I\u2019ve gone from borderline to full blown ARFID again and it\u2019s making wonder how I survived my teens, which was the last time my symptoms were this severe.",

I feel you tho, its like not even worth it to cook food then have to just put it right in the fridge so it\u2019s really hard for me to have any motivation to cook my own food.",

The secret is constantly being on the verge of needing to be hospitalized becasue my body is *just that weak*. The secret is a disorder that prevents me from doing one of the absolute most basic things necessary across all living creatures! \n\nI hate the compliments. I hate the stupid catty jealousy or envy and all that bs. This body is not goals. This body is wasting. Last week I found out I have organ damage from being like this for so long, and it might be permanent! So no! Its **not** worth being able to eat ice cream for dinner! \n\nI would give *anything* to be normal. I would be so much happier if I could just ***eat food***, even if it meant I was 20, 30, even 50lbs heavier. At least I'd be healthy, and able to live my life.",

Its actually embarrassing to go out to eat cause waiters always fuss over me thinking I didnt like the food cause \u201coh honey you didnt touch it are you sure your meal was ok?\u201d And meanwhile i loved it and am completely stuffed like I just had thanksgiving dinner and its awkward trying to assure someone no I really am just full after 2 bites theres nothing wrong with the food.",
