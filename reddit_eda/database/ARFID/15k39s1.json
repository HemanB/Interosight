Which hurts. i no longer surround myself with people who shame my personal life, including and especially my eating habits.  They took up all of my energy and time that I could have spent consoling myself and healing from intense emotional childhood trauma, and I am done letting those type of people continue to hurt me\n\n\nSome people just don't understand it, and they won't. I  think at the end of the day, at least based on some of your other comments, you are working on these issues and actually trying. And I think that's awesome. Especially because it's not as easy as they all think it is. Shits really hard to break away from. I have ARFID too and my bottom line with my day is that I have at least eaten enough to function (although I'm aiming to do better than the minimum) I say, if mc chicken nuggets is all you can stomach, because it's consistent, then that's what is important.",

So no offense or anything but I\u2019m not gonna take advice of a random Redditor seriously when my nutritionist and therapist are going about it differently than you are. \n\nI\u2019m defensive because I get really frustrated with people commenting as if they know exactly how my disorder works when in reality ARFID appears very differently for each person it affects. \n\nThe point I was trying to make is that there ARE NOT ENTIRE GROUND UP BABY CHICKENS IN MCNUGGETS. Yes, it is ground up chicken meat. But it\u2019s not entire baby chickens, beak and feathers and all like these people claim. THAT is a myth. THAT is a guilt-tripping scare-tactic to manipulate people into feeling bad for their food choices. THAT is what these people are criticizing me for irl and that\u2019s what I\u2019m frustrated about. \n\nI am not a \u201cchicken killer.\u201d I am a meat-eater, but I don\u2019t go out to the chicken pen myself and rip their heads off or suffocate them. For you to tell me I am is actually insane when the vast majority of people in the US are meat-eaters. The INDUSTRY is the killer, the consumers are just trying to survive. We have to eat to live and unfortunately I don\u2019t have the luxury of being vegan or vegetarian because of my eating disorder. To label me as a chicken killer because of this is insane. \n\nI didn\u2019t ask for your help or advice, nor did I want it. I\u2019m working with professionals and I trust their approach more than some random person online. I\u2019m not gonna take your advice seriously when it\u2019s basically just \u201cyou should probably not eat chicken nuggets everyday\u2026\u201d like no shit that\u2019s the entire thing I\u2019m working on. \n\nPlease just get some humility and recognize that your approach is not best for everyone with ARFID.",
