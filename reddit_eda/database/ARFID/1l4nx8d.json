  "selftext": "Just thought I\u2019d share a funny thing that happened. I was diagnosed with ARFID about a year ago and my family (particularly my dad) have had a hard time understanding. My dad has always picked on me for being so particular about food and never being very hungry. He has been overweight for most of his adult life and loves to eat everything lol. Well, he was recently prescribed a weight loss medication similar to ozempic and has been complaining recently about how he feels sick when he eats and has lost interest in food and feels that he needs to force himself to eat. I heard this statement and laughed because I told him this was exactly how I feel all the time and it\u2019s why I hate eating. He looked at me in surprise and I think he finally realized how miserable it is! Since then he has not picked on me for not eating most of my plate because he isn\u2019t either ;)",
