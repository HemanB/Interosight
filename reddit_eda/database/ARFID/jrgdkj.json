I like to share my ARFID experience because I only found out what ARFID was from someone else sharing their story. Before that all I had was a selective eating disorder diagnosis that didn't get me any substantial help.\n\n>\n\nBut every time I've explained myself, I get attacked. I've never once seen people sympathize and talk about the struggles of eating disorders, it's always \"yeah but it's not that you CAN'T eat things...\" \"It sounds like you're playing games with people\" \"it's all in your head\"\n\n>\n\nIf I could go to restaurants with friends I'd give anything to do that. But I physically can't make myself swallow a lot of uncomfortable foods because I have an eating disorder. \n\n>\n\nIt's so upsetting that some people can't even tolerate that someone else is eating something different than them...",

      "body": "Definitely not trying to defend people being assholes here, just trying to see/explain why it's so easily misunderstood/undermined.\n\nI think the thing with ARFID is that's it's a problem that people really don't comprehend as being a problem. I'll take something else for exemple, that even myself can have a hard time really understanding to some degree: anxieity. Like eating, we all get anxious from time to time, it's a natural thing. However for some folks, it can be overwhelming, to the point where it actually become troublesome for their usual lives. That's when some might wonder what's wrong with these people, why can't they just get over stressfull moments like everyone else. And I think that's where the rift is created. It's the same with food. They got over trying new food. A great roomate I had who helped me try new stuff couldn't really get why texture was such a big thing for me, because to her it's barely something she cares for at this point. This rift exists because mental health isn't something you can diagnose the same way you do physical health, with easy to understand measurements, and thus it's easier to dismiss/misunderstand. \n\nNow, anxiety have been talked about a lot, and thus people are starting to accept it's existence. ARFID is very new however. Just like most of us here, I grew up without even knowing a diagnosis like this existed. We likely had never encountered other people like us, and were thus quickly assumed to just be really picky, like some people can be.\n\nNonetheless, I do think it's still important to mention it when relevant. I discovered the term existed because someone mentionned it somewhere in a subreddit, and that was definitely a pretty big \"oh wow this isn't just a problem I experience alone!\" moment, and it's great to know you're not the only one with that problem. So I know it's important we share it.\n\nThough yeah, I know it's always hard. In real life doctors,  nutritionnists  ,and psychologists usually don't know what you're talking about (especially if english isn't your primary language, with the diagnosis being so recent from the DSM). But with time, hopefully people will learn about it's existence, and while you can't expect everyone to adapt to you (same with any mental health), I hope we get to a point where people can accept it more.",

      "body": "Remember one thing - Reddit isn't the real world. Hell, most of the time, when you're browsing Reddit, it isn't even representative of itself, because the dynamic of each subreddit can be so different to any other sub.\n\nGenerally, the more specialist the subreddit, the less chance there is of running into an asshole (probably because in a sub with 30k members, 10% actively posting, consistent asshole behaviour is more likely to stand out than it is in a 1.5m member sub with 10% posting).\n\nSo if you goto ARFID, FairyTail (an anime), StormlightArchive, etc, you'll get a lot more tolerance than you will in AskReddit or News (and that goes tenfold for StormlightArchive and the other Brandon Sanderson subs - the closest I've seen to asshole behaviour there in literal years of browsing StormlightArchive, Cosmere, Mistborn, are things like disagreements over the interpretation of in-universe abilities, and those never go beyond disagreement).\n\nThen there's the simple anonymity factor. I'd place good money that virtually none of these jackasses would be willing to say any of it to your face. But behind the anonymity of a free username they can dump whenever they want, they'll say anything they feel like.\n\nIn real life, I've only met two or three people who weren't understanding about it, and they were tangental enough to my life that I didn't even notice an effect from cutting them out.",

I'll take something else for exemple, that even myself can have a hard time really understanding to some degree: anxieity. Like eating, we all get anxious from time to time, it's a natural thing. However for some folks, it can be overwhelming, to the point where it actually become troublesome for their usual lives. That's when some might wonder what's wrong with these people, why can't they just get over stressfull moments like everyone else. And I think that's where the rift is created. It's the same with food. They got over trying new food. A great roomate I had who helped me try new stuff couldn't really get why texture was such a big thing for me, because to her it's barely something she cares for at this point. This rift exists because mental health isn't something you can diagnose the same way you do physical health, with easy to understand measurements, and thus it's easier to dismiss/misunderstand. \n\nNow, anxiety have been talked about a lot, and thus people are starting to accept it's existence. ARFID is very new however. Just like most of us here, I grew up without even knowing a diagnosis like this existed. We likely had never encountered other people like us, and were thus quickly assumed to just be really picky, like some people can be.\n\nNonetheless, I do think it's still important to mention it when relevant. I discovered the term existed because someone mentionned it somewhere in a subreddit, and that was definitely a pretty big \"oh wow this isn't just a problem I experience alone!\" moment, and it's great to know you're not the only one with that problem. So I know it's important we share it.\n\nThough yeah, I know it's always hard. In real life doctors,  nutritionnists  ,and psychologists usually don't know what you're talking about (especially if english isn't your primary language, with the diagnosis being so recent from the DSM). But with time, hopefully people will learn about it's existence, and while you can't expect everyone to adapt to you (same with any mental health), I hope we get to a point where people can accept it more.",

Hell, most of the time, when you're browsing Reddit, it isn't even representative of itself, because the dynamic of each subreddit can be so different to any other sub.\n\nGenerally, the more specialist the subreddit, the less chance there is of running into an asshole (probably because in a sub with 30k members, 10% actively posting, consistent asshole behaviour is more likely to stand out than it is in a 1.5m member sub with 10% posting).\n\nSo if you goto ARFID, FairyTail (an anime), StormlightArchive, etc, you'll get a lot more tolerance than you will in AskReddit or News (and that goes tenfold for StormlightArchive and the other Brandon Sanderson subs - the closest I've seen to asshole behaviour there in literal years of browsing StormlightArchive, Cosmere, Mistborn, are things like disagreements over the interpretation of in-universe abilities, and those never go beyond disagreement).\n\nThen there's the simple anonymity factor. I'd place good money that virtually none of these jackasses would be willing to say any of it to your face. But behind the anonymity of a free username they can dump whenever they want, they'll say anything they feel like.\n\nIn real life, I've only met two or three people who weren't understanding about it, and they were tangental enough to my life that I didn't even notice an effect from cutting them out.",
