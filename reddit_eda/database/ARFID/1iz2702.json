  "selftext": "I am 23 and started showing symptoms of ARFID when I was 3. My whole life I have been called a picky eater or been told I eat like a child. Even my own family, partner\u2019s family, and extended family make fun of my eating habits. I try to explain that it is really difficult for me to change my habits and I will get severe anxiety for certain foods and start to gag. They just tell me to get over it and I\u2019m weak. Do I have a right to be upset when people call me a picky eater? I hate that term, it\u2019s not like I chose to be this way. ",

You know yourself more than they do, let their comments reflect badly on them and not you. \n\nAt the end of the day, they can\u2019t even give you the respect to take time to understand it, and that shows a lot about them.",

I could probably write word for word what you posted, sad to see it's such a common experience\n\nIt's hard, but learning that this says more about how human beings in general have this fucked up habit than it does about you helps. it's really hard going against something that is basically the status quo, but people really *are* fucking weirdos for this. what we eat is our business and nobody else's.\n\nI used to bawl at the term picky eater, then hated it, now sometimes I use it because its just the easiest way to explain it. Therapy has really helped, because it lowers my anxiety and makes it easier to eat. I've also been to psychiatrists that focus on ED and the medicine has helped out a lot!\n\nIt's a journey, but I promise there's a version of you that can actually be ok with all this family drama shit that comes with ARFID lol",

I tell them I made the crayon with my grandmother's recipe that's been handed down for generations, plenty of people that I know love them. Even a kid will eat a crayon without being forced to. If they are willing to eat a crayon I'll eat whatever it is that we are arguing about (never ends up going that direction). When they admit they are too weak to eat what a 3yo is willing to eat, they shouldn't be criticizing me.",

I wouldn\u2019t care a bit if someone called me picky about eating or anything else. But it definitely seems to be a sensitivity. \n\nI\u2019m sure your family loves you. You should definitely speak up about how this is hurting you. In fact, IMO what will help this situation most, is a lot more honest and open communication. There is ARFID specific therapy available online and even includes the whole family in a lot of situations.",
