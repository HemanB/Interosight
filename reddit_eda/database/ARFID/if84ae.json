  "title": "I (24f) finally told my parents it's an eating disorder and not just being fussy/picky",
  "selftext": "So tonight while eating a roast dinner (no veg or gravy for me) we started talking about roast potatoes and I talked about how my in laws make their own rather than buying frozen from a shop, my Mum went on to say that her and my Dad used to do the same until I \"started getting fussy\". I finally said I'm not fussy it's an eating disorder, cue both parents banging on about how when they were younger they just ate what they were given, an eating disorder is only a thing with the younger generation, essentially brushing it off as made up and assuming I really am just fussy. They don't seem to understand times have changed, research has been done, new eating disorders have been discovered. I imagine other eating disorders or even mental illnesses such as anxiety also weren't commonly known when they were younger (they're in their 50's). Honestly I'm beginning to resent them. They used to say when I was a kid \"it's all in your head, maybe you should see a doctor and have therapy\" and now I look back and think well okay why the hell did you not actually do that? Maybe if they had I could have been diagnosed and had treatment as a kid and be \"normal\" by now. Instead here I am still suffering with this damn disorder in my 20s. My diet is expanding slightly thanks to my wonderful and patient partner and I can't thank him enough, but I could have had a better relationship with food so much earlier if my parents had actually done something instead of just talking about it. I want to cook and try more foods but I know if I do it at home they'll make a big thing of it and I don't want that, my partners kitchen is small so doesn't really have room to do any proper cooking, so I'm stuck waiting until my partner and I find a place together with a bigger kitchen before I can really start cooking and trying new things. My thinking is if I cook it myself I know exactly what's gone into it. \n\nIdk I just needed to vent because this whole conversation tonight has given me a headache.",

Even if they took me to a doctor and then the doctor said I was just picky and I'd grow out of it, at least they'd have done something, but they did nothing.

But with all due respect you can't say MY parents did their best when you don't know them, the only person who knows them and whether they did their best or not is me.",

How would you like to go until you are 50 without understanding why you eat like a child?\nI do understand what they are saying to a point because it seems fashionable to have a disorder now. Unfortunately, young people are diagnosing themselves with things and making it harder for people who struggle with real problems to get taken seriously. I have two cousins that have applied so many labels to themselves, it is hard to take them seriously.\nI am not sure if there is a therapist to go to. Nobody knew where to send me at age 48 after I stopped eating a lot of the time. Do you have one now? Most of the specialist are for anorexia, which this can turn into (it did for me for awhile)\nI don\u2019t think you should be so hard on your parents. It is a strange disorder. They were right that you needed therapy, they just did not know where to send you. Even now, it is not a diagnosis, but it is real. Maybe instead of telling them you have a disorder, send them the ARFID information and include risks so they understand why this is serious.\nI am not saying it will do any good, but at least they may recognize you in the description.\nFeel glad you are making progress and don\u2019t live in the past of what your parents could have done for you (that can make you very bitter and it won\u2019t change anything. They did their best) ! I have started eating a few more things too. My parents missed many opportunities to help me in many areas, but they were limited by their belief system. You will probably also make mistakes with your kids. I have made mistakes with mine. People are imperfect.",

Most people would not think so.\nEven if they understood what was happening and had  a lot of knowledge, where would they send you?\nSome people have a certain way of thinking and they raise their kids according to that. That is what I meant whenI said they did their best. I did not say they did THE best - I said they did THEIR best. They raised you with their limited and sometimes faulty view of the world. In their view, you are don\u2019t have an eating disorder, so they are not neglecting you. \nMy mom did not believe in getting help for anxiety disorder and depression, so I suffered from that until I was 21. She did not believe I had back pain (I still have fibromyalgia). She did not believe me at first when that I needed glasses because my sister had just gotten some glasses, so I went nearly a whole year borrowing my friend\u2019s glasses (too weak for her).\nSo, I totally understand being disappointed in parents.",
