  "selftext": "Has anyone ever told you that if you\u2019re hungry enough you\u2019ll eat something? How does that statement make you feel? For me it is almost a trigger. When my parents say this to me, it makes me want to punch a hole in a wall.  It feels like my eating disorder is being disregarded and that I\u2019m just being written off as picky. It\u2019s almost like no matter how many times I explain ARFID to them, They don\u2019t understand that I WILL NOT eat something I am not fond of\u2026.I literally would rather eat nothing. So the statement of \u201cif you\u2019re hungry enough you\u2019ll eat it\u201d is like a huge slap in the face to me. It\u2019s as if they\u2019re telling me to \u201cjust be normal and eat\u201d\u2026.The Truth is, even if I feel that I AM hungry enough\u2026.I\u2019m not going to eat it unless it appeals to me.",

It's that my brain literally doesn't process it as food. \n\nI've found when I say I don't like a certain food, people picture food *they* don't like. And the fact is, a person without ARFID who doesn't really like, say, asparagus, will still eat some if it's that or miss a meal. But ask them how hungry they'd have to be to eat like, a literal car tire. Or cement. *That's* what our brain is telling us we're eating. \n\nI've also had some success with changing my verbage. Saying you're \"not fond of\" certain foods will absolutely make people without ARFID think of food that is just kind of not their favorite, but that they would eat to be polite if the situation called for it. It just won't get through to them. I've had more success with \"can't eat\" or \"can't tolerate,\" but I'm still working on finding the best possible phrasing.",

      "body": "I am on my way to your worst case scenario and it's awful. It's true that I can't see how thin I am, but I've never tried actively not eating. Only recently when I went down with a depression, did my appetite go completely away. I've always been driven to eat by my appetite, even though it has always been for few specific foods etc. Without my appetite, I'm just a person who can't get anything down. It's like I despise the thought of tasting, every flavor is somehow unappealing and even in a way revolting. It's been like this for around 2 months now and I'm scared that it won't come back until I've already been hospitalized or something for my lack of eating. \n\nIf only my parents understood that it's much harder to eat than they would ever know. They have always been overweight and have trouble going on diets because they are so driven by food, so it's really hard for them to understand, but it's like they don't even try. At least give me a \"hey we know it's hard for you, we may not understand why or how it's so hard for you to eat, but we'll be here to support you through it until you've overcome it or gotten good help for it\". Instead they say \"it's not that hard\", \"just eat\" and \"if you're not eating, you're not truly hungry\".\n\nBut I still have hope and believe that I'll someday be at a point in my life where I've gotten my appetite back. (also my parents confuse appetite with hunger??)",

As dismissive and annoying as it is, I just wish it was true.\n\nI'm really scared that I will someday be in the position where I'm not just threatened with going hungry for a meal or a couple days like I've done plenty of times before, but that I'm literally in a position of starving to death. It's not like I hate vegetables so much I'd rather die than eat them out of principle. I very actively try to feed myself and can't actually swallow it and get the calories into my body. \n\nI fully admit I'm a stubborn person who doesn't like to face a well-deserved \"told you so,\" but god I really really wish I could know I was wrong here.",
