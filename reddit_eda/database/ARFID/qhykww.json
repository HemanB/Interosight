For me personally, Zofran has been a lifesaver for the most part, I always have it on hand from my doctor. If Zofran isn't working for her anymore then I would also recommend Phenergan (it's for nausea, talk to your doctor about it!), it's stronger but it will make her extremely tired- it really knocks me off my feet and I only take half. I mainly take Zofran right now though since the other makes me so sleepy. I hope she starts to feeling better- I wish you guys luck!",
