Here's what they have for the ARFID Bunny:\n\nIntroducing the ARFID Rabbit Plushie Dreadful, a comforting companion designed to raise awareness and express sympathy for those dealing with Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID). \n\nThis plushie features a unique zipper pouch, perfect for storing the included \"safe food\" of bread. \n\n\ud83c\udf5eWe recognize that bread is not a universal safe food for everyone with ARFID, but due to production limitations, we have chosen it as one of the more commonly accepted options.\ud83c\udf5e\n\nThe bread is itself a mini-plush that you can remove and attach via a stretchy band. It can also fit in the stomach.\n\n\nSymbolism:\n\nCream Color for Paleness and Anemia\n\nEmpty Stomach (trauma) due to attempts from others to punish those with ARFID into eating\n\nPlush bread friend for safe food choice\n\nSwirls in the ears for dizziness \n\nEarth symbol for dryness/dehydration",

It feels like there is a scale here. I IDd as pan before I realized I was ace and ficto) but it seemed like the company itself had moved forward from that? When I googled the company + homophobia specifically, which is what they said the company was, the only thing I found was a post about the MLM bunny not being flag accurate and/or ugly? It seemed like a minor thing.\n\nThen a lot of people saying they were creepy and weird and too negative and why would anyone over 10 want one.\n\nPlus the tag had a typo, but they sent acorrect one too. This was the first run and misprints happen a LOT in production. My workplace is dealing with that rn.",
