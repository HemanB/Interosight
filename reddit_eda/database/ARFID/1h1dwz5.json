To be fair to them, they all gave up a very long time ago when it came to food with me. They might eye my plate, but they wouldn't say anything. The toxicity was around, well, absolutely everything else. It got to where I only forced myself to see them on holidays, and that made me dread holidays. Since I stopped talking to them, I love holidays! They're so chill at my house. Quiet, peaceful, and fun. And you're right. That's how it should be. \n\nMy son works in a steak house, so he almost always works on Thanksgiving. He's got Christmas off, though, and it's similar. I make what I feel like. He eats pretty much anything and everything except cake, though. I fought my ARFID so hard when he was little to set a good example for him, and I'm so glad it worked. If he'd turned out really restrictive about food after all those things I learned to pretend to like when I wanted to be sick, I'd be so upset. I have to say, though, it actually did help me expand what I could eat. I was honestly pretty mad that the doctors were right about that. Lol. It did not expand what I like, though. It just made me able to tolerate more without freaking out.",
