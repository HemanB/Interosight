  "selftext": "It\u2019s already hard enough dealing with ARFID. Trying to find good things to eat that will keep me alive, struggling to gain weight, people calling me boney & anorexic, feeling embarrassed when I go out to eat with friends & family bc I can barely finish the food I ordered while I watch everyone talk about how amazing their dish was. The struggles are endless with this disorder. Then to top it off I go online to relax for a bit and I just see brain dead takes like this. \n\nThey act like picky eaters CHOOSE to be picky. Why would I actively choose to limit myself from eating amazing foods? I find it absurd to tell people they don\u2019t know how to love others if they have a disorder that\u2019s completely out of their control. This whole post just really upset me so thanks for listening to me rant. ",
