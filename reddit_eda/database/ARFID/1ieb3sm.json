Guys this is such a big deal for me even if it\u2019s only popsicles. \n\nI live on Ensure 2cal and milo milkshakes so actually chewing and swallowing something is huge. \n\nI just told myself well if it gets stuck it\u2019ll melt eventually right? lol. (I have a fear of choking and aspirating). I\u2019m really hoping it leads to taking bigger risks like transitioning into having a small bowl of soup. ",
