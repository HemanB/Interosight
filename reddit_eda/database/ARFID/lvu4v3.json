  "title": "I am... flabbergasted to find this thread. After 27 years on this planet, I feel less alone now than I ever have. I don\u2019t even know where to go from here.",
  "selftext": "(long post, I\u2019m sorry) \n\n[this is a combo advice/support post]\n\nif you wanna just provide advice: i have an appointment with a clinic specializing in EDs, including ARFID, and have no idea what to prepare for, could use advice re: what they\u2019ll ask, what will help me feel more prepared \n\nI\u2019m sure my story matches many of you here. I feel like I can be more vulnerable here than in any other space because... you get it. You all get it. \n\nA little about me - I\u2019m a 27 year old woman with endometriosis, PCOS, and type 2 diabetes. I have ALWAYS been fat. Top 99% of the weight range all of childhood. I\u2019ve never been skinny, and I\u2019m at my healthiest and happiest at a weight still considered obese by BMI standards. \n\nAll that to say!! I have never ONCE been taken seriously when I have brought up - while crying - to my doctors (for various ailments) that I think I have an eating disorder. \n\nMy personal favorite responses were: \n- you\u2019re diabetic because you can\u2019t stop eating, weight loss is good if it means you\u2019re not eating \n- you have endometriosis because of your weight (???) and you clearly didn\u2019t get there by not eating\n- we won\u2019t even assess you for an eating disorder because you don\u2019t meet diagnostic criteria (i.e. you\u2019re fat, no way you have an ED) \n\nBut what they don\u2019t understand (and what you all DO) is that I have never once sat in front of a plate of food, excited to eat. Food has only been an obstacle. \n\nVery safe foods of similar colors and textures were okay. Cheese, bread, meat (until now, I\u2019m phasing out meat and now ALL meat is no longer safe), rice, etc. \n\nAnd then as a kid, being mocked by my mom and dad for being picky. \n\nMy moms response was to not force me to eat foods but to make me try them, which worked sometimes. \n\nMy step dad\u2019s response was to only cook meals including foods I wouldn\u2019t eat. To help me lose weight. \n\nANYWAY: cut to adulthood \n\nI could make a list of my safe foods and if I truly ONLY list what is ALWAYS safe it\u2019s.. five food groups. \n\nThe list for UNSAFE DANGER foods would be like a mile long. \n\nIdk, feels bad, man. I booked a consultation with an eating disorder clinic specializing in ARFID on Friday. What do I say? What will they ask? \n\nTL;DR been crying all weekend because i finally have an answer and reading every single post here has finally make it click for me \n\nNo, I\u2019m not just a picky eater. I\u2019m not a fat person who just doesn\u2019t want to eat healthy or feel better. No, I\u2019m not addicted to carbs or sugar. \n\nI am a chronically ill, disabled woman who isn\u2019t even 30 yet. And I just need some support.",

      "body": "In your appointment, they will most likely take your blood. They will check for cholesterol, probably check your thyroid, and look for any deficiencies, such as Iron, Vitamin D, and folic acid. They may also check your liver. As you have diabetes, they may also check your blood sugar. \n\nThey will ask you if you have been screened for Autism. ARFID goes hand in hand with Autism, and while it is possible to have it without being autistic because it is a sensory processing disorder they will likely check. \n\nThey will ask you what it is about the foods you can't eat. Texture, smell, sight, all those fun questions. Find the colours of food to be overwhelming... Be honest, and explicit. If the idea of putting a carrot in your mouth makes you want to vomit - tell them. If it gives you a physical reaction, such as your mouth filling with saliva and actual retching - tell them. The more they know, the better they can help you. \n\nThey will also ask if you're ok to get on the scales. They don't like asking this question, the first time my nutritionist asked me this, she looked terrified that I was going to have a meltdown. Do yourself a favour, and allow yourself to be weighed. Knowing my weight has actually massively helped in my recovery. \n\nYou may then be referred to specialists, including therapists. However, because you're at a specialised clinic, chances are they'll tell you to come back at a certain time and date for a follow-up. \n\nThey will most likely give you homework - if there is a portion of healthy food in your safe food list, it may be to eat that food with every meal for example. I was told to eat a banana and yoghurt for breakfast. \n\nAs for the doctor who told you you have endo because of your weight. FUCK THEM. What an absolute shitbiscuit. A full-blown knob jockey. \n\nAs for everything else - welcome to the club. Feel free to vent and scream here, we know how it feels. I wish you so much luck in this journey, it's a hard path, but as someone who is two years into it - it's so fucking worth it.",

You are not alone in this, we are many people who have this strange ED that falls between two chairs and doctors usualy just think anorexia or bulimia. \n\nIts so good that you have reached out for help,I am so proud of you\u2661 be totaly honest with them, tell them about your struggles and tell them you are totaly open for help. You have taken a small but an important step on the road to recovery,big hugs\u2661",

I have 2 children with autism and mental health issues and it\u2019s so hard to get drs to listen to me because I have a mental illness. I also have drs refuse to investigate my chronic health issues because I\u2019m fat. Thankfully now I have a family therapist who is advocating for all 3 of us and they are reluctantly listening. I\u2019m sure that they just see me as a stressed out overwhelmed mum. \n\nI\u2019m so glad that you have found some answers. Best of luck with your appointment.",
