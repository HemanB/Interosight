  "selftext": "My son is 8, turning 9 soon. He has ARFID. Getting him to eat anything is a battle. It's a hit or miss if he eats Breakfast, and if he does then it's a few bites and he is done. The won't even touch his school lunches. Just ends up throwing his whole tray away. He goes to a private school and his lunches are amazing and all the other kids eat it up. His teachers have been concerned too. At dinner time, he eats the smallest bites possible and it takes HOURS to get him to eat what his 3 year old brother can eat in 10 mins. I'm talking a single pea at a time for example. He is so picky that he will pick one thing he wants and will eat only that. Nothing else. If it's not exactly what he wants then he just doesn't eat. When told he can't leave his plate till he puts effort in trying, he will purposely gag himself till he throws up. But its not like there is anything in his stomach other then water. This kid won't even eat a snickers bar. I'm about to switch doctors because I'm tired of being told that he is fine and will eat when he is hungry but he is never hungry! Being able to count every rib and vertebrae is not normal! His shoulder blades stick out so much and he cant sit on hard seats because of his boney butt. He can't keep up with his friends. He is so weak that he can't do what the other kids are doing like running, climbing the monkey bars, jump rope, anything due to no muscle mass at all. Hugging him feels like hugging a skeleton. I'm losing my mind tring to get him to eat. Snack bars, protein shakes, vitamins, pastas, McDonald's, anything to get him to pack on some pounds. We ask him why and he tells us he just doesn't like it or just doesnt want anything. Even if it was something he told us was his favorite. The other day he had a PB&J sandwich with a handful of chips that took him an hour and a half to finish. No distractions. Just him at the table starring at it. One micro bite at a time with his mom and I reminding him every 15 min that he needs to focus on eating so he can go back outside to play with his friends. We feel so frustrated. We are thinking of putting him on medication to increase his appetite. We put him in a karate class thinking he would work up an appetite but it hasn't worked. I don't understand it. ",

The SSRI calmed that down a little, and he was less suspicious of his safe foods. \n\nHe is not purposely gagging himself. This is ARFID, he\u2019s not refusing to eat on purpose. You need to change your mindset in order to help him. Minimize pressure and force around eating. When eating is full of stress, his symptoms will be worse. I recognize how difficult this is, as I\u2019ve been there. Fed is best - if your son will eat ice cream for breakfast, give him ice cream for the time being. I sent my son with a candy bar for lunch for months while he was in treatment - because it is genuinely better than nothing.",

I was in the exact same position as your son. I was eating very little, and I was forced to sit at the table eating things I may or may not like until I finish it, not allowed to pursue any other stimulation. I've always had trouble with eating, but having such an astronomical amount of pressure put onto me because of something I simply can't control contributed to my food trauma and later ARFID.\n\nI distinctly remember being shown pictures of extremely slim and boney people with anorexia, and told that I would turn out like them, malnourished and unhealthy. I felt such shame from that. You need to understand, not eating is not a choice but rather a mental block that you can't bypass consciously.\n\n> He is so picky that he will pick one thing he wants and will eat only that. Nothing else.\n\nThis is what we call a safe food. It's usually something reliable or simple that doesn't take much mental effort for us to eat, or something our brains simply decided wasn't a threat. If he won't eat anything else, give him some of his safe food. It may feel wrong, especially if it's unhealthy for whatever reason, but it's so much easier to stomach safe foods over unsafe foods.\n\n> No distractions. Just him at the table starring at it.\n\nI can't stress this enough: don't do this. Cease immediately. Depriving a child of stimulation is questionable enough, but when it's done in the name of forcing a child with ARFID to eat it never helps. Try to let him eat while watching TV, or doing something else that he finds enjoyable.\n\nYou don't seem to understand that your child has a serious eating disorder that can't be rectified with mere parenting. Provide a safe, stress-free atmosphere for your child. If you're looking for somewhere to start, then try to abolish meal times and provide simple things to snack on throughout the day.",

          "body": "I really recommend just getting this book [The Picky Eater\u2019s Recovery Book by Dr Jennifer J Thomas](https://amzn.eu/d/5xdiFWU). It\u2019s literally a self-help guide, has loads of tables and worksheets. The first part of the book explains what ARFID is and the 3 different ways it can present, plus a host of possible causes. Just the first part of the book is invaluable IMO. \n\nObviously recovery is not easy, but this book has at least made it possible. (My fianc\u00e9 has ARFID and we\u2019ve gradually found more safe foods with the aid of this book).",
