It can be \\*too\\* plain for me sometimes but some marinara can be too chunky for me so it's a good balance. Marinara is VERY inconsistent though. I used to hoard packets of it when fast food places made a good batch that I liked.",

What helped me with the gross tomato texture was to just buy \u201cstrained tomatoes\u201d (I like the Pomi brand but there\u2019s got to be many others) and cook that with garlic cloves, olive oil, and basil leaves. I pull out the garlic and basil and just have a perfect, smooth yet flavorful sauce. Dipping sauces besides ketchup with a small handful of foods tend to make me sick, but this is my method for a foolproof pasta sauce at least!",
