  "selftext": "I have had ARFID for ages and I didn\u2019t really bother to eat more or work through it because i thought i was fine. But i promise - if you\u2019re tipping underweight you genuinely have to try have 5 small meals, or 3 meals a day, no matter how much you don\u2019t want to eat. \n\nI am 5\u20191 and was 40kg, but i went through a breakup and completely stopped eating. I dropped to 36kg and became a medical emergency in just two weeks, adding traumatic hospital visits and harsh meals plans. \n\nIf you minimise the amount of food you eat, your stomach shrinks until it becomes so small that you can\u2019t even eat a carrot without getting full. Guys, it doesn\u2019t matter what you necessarily eat or drink, please up your calorie and protein intake and create some sort of comfortable meal plan, even if you build up slowly\n\nBeing a picky eater or having ARFID is completely fine, but ending up with a low BMI isn\u2019t and health issues isn\u2019t.\n\nYou\u2019ll regret it when you\u2019re in hospital with endless symptoms that affect you for life.\n",

You can be at a \"healthy\" (or even \"overweight\") BMI and still be in a really bad situation when it comes to nutritional deficiencies and the physical toll it's taking on your body. Like, I thought I was fine bc I'm considered overweight, but my ARFID has been really bad for a long time. Now I'm so weak that I can't even take a shower more than once every two weeks, and I have to take breaks while using my loofah. That's no way to live. All EDs are dangerous, y'all. We gotta find the strength to push through. \ud83e\udef6",
