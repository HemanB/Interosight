One huge gigantic thing that can take over your life if you're struggling with lots of health, money and living issues. \n\nIt never ends it's just something that you have to do every single day, on the harder it is to eat and all the stuff around food the more likely it is for my body to feel like garbage which makes it harder to overcome any of these things.\n\nAnd all the help run are for seems to be about trying to get people to eat more food rather than trying to improve the quality of life, though because of how we don't take care of our poor sick disabled people even if people did start thinking that way most of us wouldn't have access to what is recommended.\n\nThis subreddit is one of the only places where I've seen honest conversations about what it's like.

One huge gigantic thing that can take over your life if you're struggling with lots of health, money and living issues. \n\nIt never ends it's just something that you have to do every single day, on the harder it is to eat and all the stuff around food the more likely it is for my body to feel like garbage which makes it harder to overcome any of these things.\n\nAnd all the help run are for seems to be about trying to get people to eat more food rather than trying to improve the quality of life, though because of how we don't take care of our poor sick disabled people even if people did start thinking that way most of us wouldn't have access to what is recommended.\n\nThis subreddit is one of the only places where I've seen honest conversations about what it's like.
