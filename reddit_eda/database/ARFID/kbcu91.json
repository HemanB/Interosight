Heck, my mom and I were talking about how unlikely it was that my aunts would have ham as part of Christmas dinner because they think my mom can't have a single bite when really she just needs to limit it to garnish for anything she can eat lots of.  If they limit the meal to things they think I can eat, it's going to be pretty sad.",
