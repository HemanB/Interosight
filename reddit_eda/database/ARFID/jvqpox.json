      "body": "I am not certain I would use an app like this unless it focused 90% on the mental health aspect of it. \nIt would be more beneficial as a robo-counselor specific to ARFID with actual roadmaps and many customizations. \nYou might do better not only interviewing people with ARFID but get interviews with qualified individuals who treat ARFID so you know how to structure the suggestions based on whether users are open to new experiences. They should take a short quiz to determine where they are on the OCEAN acronym scale. \nFor instance, I am open to new experiences (60%) but highly neurotic (100%) so my impulses are pretty unpredictable and based on my mood I may be wildly receptive to a new food one day and go back to only eating one thing for a whole week. Anticipating this type of behavior would be extremely useful in an app. \nAdding some kind of mood tracker (how you feel while consuming the food) would be beneficial I think. \n\nA lot of the struggle with ARFID is in the fear/aversion mindset. \nOur mental relationship with food can be just as strong as the association with the flavors and textures. Texture and gag reflex is sometimes the only factor with certain aversions to foods even if they taste good in the mouth. Lol \n\nFor instance, I can\u2019t eat most savory sandwiches without potato chips or toasted bread. \nI absolutely hate anything remotely mushy or slimy. Even crunchy veggies are difficult because they make the bread soggy. \n\nFor me I find myself fighting to finish food as quickly as possible so I don\u2019t run the risk of anything getting soggy or flavors mixing too much. \n\nYou might add tips like \u201cPut the cheese on the interior of each slice of bread so there is a barrier between the lettuce and the bread. \nThis will limit the water content from the lettuce seeping into the bread.\u201d\n\nCooking instructions and recipes that are texture-integrity and mental health focused. \n\n- Not everyone understands just how bad and mushy overcooking pasta affects the texture, for instance. \n\nThe mental health side could look like:\n\u201cConsume in a well lit area with someone you love.\u201d\n\nYou could also add in quick buttons that allow you to select certain common activities people with ARFID engage in. \n\nMine would be snacking at 1am on the only things I will eat (usually crunchy cereals and cookies with yogurt) instead of eating the new meals I prepared to be eaten at 6-7pm. \n\nI sometimes forget to eat in general and so the mental health aspect should come into play with a notification like \u201cYou have late-night snacked 7 days in a row this week (marked \u201cstop doing\u201d) would you like to set a reminder to increase snacking during daylight hours?\u201d\n\nYou might want to look at an app called Daylio. \nIt\u2019s a mood tracking app/journaling app that uses activity buttons which makes it extremely quick to use. \n\nI think that marrying some aspects from that app (ease of use, ability to create category files and its cute UI) would be great. \n\nIt HAS TO HAVE DARK MODE and don\u2019t use cheesy looking old emojis anywhere or cell shaded images. Use crisp and clean simple vector designs for the graphics. \n\nIt should be fun and something a kid could use but also aesthetically pleasing to adults. \n\nToo many diet type apps use the most boring or unreadable blog article fonts and blindingly white backgrounds and too many menus of unclear categories and data isn\u2019t easily found within those menus. \n\nI have ADHD and the only app I have used for 3 months in a row every day is Daylio, which is why I suggest modeling it after that app. \n\nI also believe that you should keep the community NOT ON THE APP but instead make a Subreddit and Discord. Having a social media aspect will just bog it down imo.  \nIf I wanted to use this to connect with people then I would be looking to Reddit or a separate forum anyway. \n\nThe current idea would work best having a narrow focus within the app but then develop a strong social media and website community just outside of it. The app could link to the website and community forums for contact quite easily without bogging down the official app with that stuff. Plus then you\u2019d be running a niche blog for ARFID on a separate website which will be profitable. The Reddit or web forum could serve as the hub for suggestions. \n\nAdd a customer service phone number. \nIf I can\u2019t speak to a real person when I\u2019m having issues with my account, it\u2019s over. \nLook up User Experience. It\u2019s separate from Customer Service (but under that umbrella) and it\u2019s extremely important).",

      "body": "I work for a software startup and would love to beta test if you need it! Some things I would recommend: \n- If you create a community in the app, make sure it is pretty limited. You may end up with a harmful environment of people who come to get better but then are triggered. I\u2019ve experienced a few online communities for eating disorders that are not monitored and it gets messy. \n- I\u2019ve used \u201cMy Fitness Pal\u201d for a while and loved the fact that there were common food items with the nutritional value added. Made it easy to search and count calories. Not sure how possible this would be to implement since I believe the data on that app comes from its large user base. \n- A recipe forum would be AMAZING. A place to share favorites and tasty food combos. The ability to bookmark them would be cool. \n- One thing that may help people is if you could rate food items as \u201cwill eat\u201d, \u201cwilling to try\u201d, and \u201ccannot eat\u201d. It could match safe foods with other food items they\u2019re willing to try that go well together. \n- The ability to enter your age, weight, height, etc to calculate a healthy daily calorie/nutrient recommendation. \n- maybe a daily diary to log how you feel, progress you\u2019ve made, etc (should stay private) \n\nSuper excited for this and I wish you luck on your creation!",

I know for majority with ARFID (myself included) it might not bother someone to see the calories and have an idea of foods that are similar in calories/macro nutrients. However, there are individuals with ARFID who also have other eating disorders - it's not uncommon that ARFID can overlap with other EDs. It's also not uncommon for ARFID to eventually lead to other more well known eating disorders ( and a behavior can be calorie counting). So maybe just something to be mindful of!  \n\n\nAlso, putting allergen warnings would be helpful if you're coming up with recipes! There's some with ARFID who fear negative consequences such as allergic reactions so being able to know what allergens are in the food and how they can modify it and eventually work their way up to the actual food.  \n\n\nMaybe adding an option to create your own hierarchy of fear foods with a rating of like 1-5 or something like that. Having a visual of fear foods to then check off these foods as you expose yourself to them, or a way to visually see the food and a recipe in which the fear food can be added.",

You may end up with a harmful environment of people who come to get better but then are triggered. I\u2019ve experienced a few online communities for eating disorders that are not monitored and it gets messy. \n- I\u2019ve used \u201cMy Fitness Pal\u201d for a while and loved the fact that there were common food items with the nutritional value added. Made it easy to search and count calories. Not sure how possible this would be to implement since I believe the data on that app comes from its large user base. \n- A recipe forum would be AMAZING. A place to share favorites and tasty food combos. The ability to bookmark them would be cool. \n- One thing that may help people is if you could rate food items as \u201cwill eat\u201d, \u201cwilling to try\u201d, and \u201ccannot eat\u201d. It could match safe foods with other food items they\u2019re willing to try that go well together. \n- The ability to enter your age, weight, height, etc to calculate a healthy daily calorie/nutrient recommendation. \n- maybe a daily diary to log how you feel, progress you\u2019ve made, etc (should stay private) \n\nSuper excited for this and I wish you luck on your creation!",

I know for majority with ARFID (myself included) it might not bother someone to see the calories and have an idea of foods that are similar in calories/macro nutrients. However, there are individuals with ARFID who also have other eating disorders - it's not uncommon that ARFID can overlap with other EDs. It's also not uncommon for ARFID to eventually lead to other more well known eating disorders ( and a behavior can be calorie counting). So maybe just something to be mindful of!  \n\n\nAlso, putting allergen warnings would be helpful if you're coming up with recipes! There's some with ARFID who fear negative consequences such as allergic reactions so being able to know what allergens are in the food and how they can modify it and eventually work their way up to the actual food.  \n\n\nMaybe adding an option to create your own hierarchy of fear foods with a rating of like 1-5 or something like that. Having a visual of fear foods to then check off these foods as you expose yourself to them, or a way to visually see the food and a recipe in which the fear food can be added.",

You may end up with a harmful environment of people who come to get better but then are triggered. I\u2019ve experienced a few online communities for eating disorders that are not monitored and it gets messy. \n- I\u2019ve used \u201cMy Fitness Pal\u201d for a while and loved the fact that there were common food items with the nutritional value added. Made it easy to search and count calories. Not sure how possible this would be to implement since I believe the data on that app comes from its large user base. \n- A recipe forum would be AMAZING. A place to share favorites and tasty food combos. The ability to bookmark them would be cool. \n- One thing that may help people is if you could rate food items as \u201cwill eat\u201d, \u201cwilling to try\u201d, and \u201ccannot eat\u201d. It could match safe foods with other food items they\u2019re willing to try that go well together. \n- The ability to enter your age, weight, height, etc to calculate a healthy daily calorie/nutrient recommendation. \n- maybe a daily diary to log how you feel, progress you\u2019ve made, etc (should stay private) \n\nSuper excited for this and I wish you luck on your creation!",

Sometimes it's observable (color, texture, flavor [soure, spicy, etc.]), sometimes it's deeply personal and therefor not.  For example, I avoid sausage unless it's cut into tiny pieces and served as a topping on pizza because I'm afraid to choke (it's not sexual... I choked multiple times on breakfast sausage at mom and pop restaurants).  It's probably best if you let the userbase add their own tags.  Maybe an algorithm can let other people see a tag after it shows up x amount of times.  In the meantime, the users who put the tag can refer to it when using a search function.\n\nAlso, do you use github?  As a programmer that doesn't  know much about apps, I might learn from what you're doing.",
