  "selftext": "I never considered how psilocybin could help with ARFID until I got the chance to trip with a good friend for the first time. For context- I believe I\u2019ve had ARFID for my entire 24 years. I had very few safe foods and prior to my trip I was eating 3 safe foods and spiralling pretty much everyday. I actually wanted to do shrooms to help with my depression but decided to set an intention to deal with ARFID right before drinking the tea. That itself was so hard because I have never been able to eat mushrooms and I was crying while we were making it and telling my friend I couldn\u2019t but I powered through. \n\nAnyways, on my trip my friend offered me blueberries and fed them to me. And I tasted them for the first time. It was incredible. And somehow I ended up naked in the bathtub with cherry tomatoes and blueberries and cucumbers and I was squishing them and eating them and rubbing food on my body. And I looked in the mirror and saw myself as a skeleton and dead because I had never been able to nourish my body. \n\nMy friend made me pea soup- I\u2019ve never been able to eat it before but I did while high and it was amazing. And now two days later I have tried so many new foods and am snacking and eating new meals. I actually can\u2019t believe it. I really hope there is more research on psilocybin and eating disorders because this shift would have never happened without their help. I feel brand new and excited to eat for the first time in my life. \n\nCurious if anyone else has successfully treated ARFID with the help of shrooms.",

It\u2019s almost like tripping let me get out of my own head for a few hours, and I \u201crealized\u201d lots of things that I logically knew in my head but my ego wouldn\u2019t let me internalize. For example I \u201crealized\u201d that my \u201cunsafe\u201d foods aren\u2019t actually unsafe, and there is nothing really different about them. The real work comes after the trip though. Tripping definitely helps, but when you come down you\u2019re faced with the same challenges as before and you need to learn how to use your new knowledge.\n\nIdk if anyone can relate to this, but whenever I trip or even smoke a lot of weed I find processed food gross. Then I kinda crave vegetables and I\u2019m driven to try more of them.",

The key for me: a loving, patient, supportive person to continue suggesting and offering new food to me. My partner is a great eater. He offers me everything he eats without pressure or expectation - just offers! My challenge to myself is to say yes every single time, and I do. This has helped me find new staples that I love: Caesar salad, avocados, oranges, and so much more. Every meal I incorporate something new, and I\u2019ve chosen not to rely on my safe foods each meal. I can\u2019t give advice but these steps have absolutely transformed me. Finally, reading the book Your Psilocybin Mushroom Companion by Michelle Janikian helped me prepare and my partner serve as a successful trip sitter. \n\nI\u2019ve also learned that I have food preferences that have nothing to do with my (former!) eating disorder. \n\nI felt ready for this experience and relied on past exposure therapy to help me integrate. Everyone\u2019s experience will be different. Please update us. I\u2019m already happy for you!",

There is a rant below, which you don\u2019t have to read if it\u2019s a potential trigger. \n\nARFID takes loads of forms, and mine flares up when I get too anxious. Otherwise, my friends and family see me as a \u201cfoodie\u201d, which adds to the pressure. So I have tried most foods in my life, and enjoyed them immensely when life is going well, it\u2019s when it becomes too stressful that I suddenly develop an aversion to almost everything. I\u2019ve even been feeling like my safe foods are \u201ctoo delicious\u201d (i.e. they have too much flavour), and it\u2019s depressing the hell out of me. The pressure I put on myself is enormous because at the best of times, I\u2019m underweight. It\u2019s so scary and exhausting. \n\nBut I do have hope, and I have been eating better in the last few days. I have a new hypnotherapist and I am looking for an ARFID specialist as well. I am taking two weeks off work to sit in my feelings and fears and let them come up with a sense of curious calm. Breathing exercises and weed are helping me enormously. \n\nAgain, thank you so much for the messages. To all my fellow beloved ARFID peeps, I send all of us my love. Xxxx",

      "body": "This log of progress is helpful to me, so I\u2019m posting again! Hello to anyone else reading this, too \ud83d\ude03\n\nTl;dr My progress is holding strong. And now I have stronger food preferences. My diet is intentionally and joyfully diverse. \n\n\nI feel more like a \u201chealthy adult\u201d eater now. My first few months after this experience, I felt like a child in a healthy environment learning about food. I tasted vegetables for the first time. I didn\u2019t know how to cook anything expect my prior safe foods. And each food experience felt new and interesting. \n\nToday, I\u2019ve experienced hundreds of new foods. Most of these new foods I\u2019ve tried in several ways: cooked differently, combined with different ingredients, and in different social/physical environments. That means I\u2019m becoming acclimated to most foods and the typical experiences they provide. Today I ate pork belly on a crostini: both pieces were familiar to me, and the combination felt 10% different (that\u2019s a guess). The first month, food was 90-100% different each time I tried something. \n\nI see this (mostly) neutrally. A pro: food is less of a time-consuming distraction. Fewer new experiences means less information to process and understand every meal. A con is I have food preferences (like any human does) that make me *slightly* less curious and open to new foods. \n\nExample: Every time I bring up this concern, my partner reminds me of how he perceives me. He says, \u201cYou will try anything, even if you choose not to eat the entire plate. Then every meal, you exclusively eat \u2018new\u2019 foods compared to Old You. That is still adventurous.\u201d And that, \u201cyour food preferences are that you like *good* food. You always like broccoli when it\u2019s cooked right.\u201d And I agree. I had an eating disorder for 27 years, and I\u2019m sometimes nervous that not enjoying a dish of undercooked veggies means that it\u2019s creeping back. It\u2019s not. I just have snobby taste, I think? \ud83d\ude39\n\nI\u2019ll also share details about my typical meals. Before I changed, I ate 1-2 of the same frozen pizzas each day. I also relied on toast with cheese, cereals, some yogurt brands, freeze-dried smoothies, and various carbs in rotation. \n\nTo compare, my favorite foods now are avocado, pork belly, oranges, kiwis, salmon avocado sushi, passion fruit, and\u2026most things!\n\nMy typical M-F meal schedule:\n* Breakfast: Hi-caf black tea, no-sugar lowfat greek yogurt with pumpkin seeds and wheat germ, orange or kiwi on the side.\n* Lunch: The sandwich is the main dish: A piece of my partner\u2019s homemade part-whole-grain sourdough bread, fried egg with salt/pepper/nutritional yeast, piece of fried cheese, whole avocado, cherry tomatoes, and microgreens if we have them around. I'll also eat another piece of fruit and a handful of nuts like pistachios.\n* Dinner: Usually a salad of some kind. Caesar is my favorite! Once a week we do salmon avocado sushi. If I\u2019m still hungry, I\u2019ll have peanut butter sourdough toast, or some nuts, or something with hummus. \n\nI hope this information is helpful to someone. This is still the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me. Wishing any readers relief!\n\nEdits: typos.",

The key for me: a loving, patient, supportive person to continue suggesting and offering new food to me. My partner is a great eater. He offers me everything he eats without pressure or expectation - just offers! My challenge to myself is to say yes every single time, and I do. This has helped me find new staples that I love: Caesar salad, avocados, oranges, and so much more. Every meal I incorporate something new, and I\u2019ve chosen not to rely on my safe foods each meal. I can\u2019t give advice but these steps have absolutely transformed me. Finally, reading the book Your Psilocybin Mushroom Companion by Michelle Janikian helped me prepare and my partner serve as a successful trip sitter. \n\nI\u2019ve also learned that I have food preferences that have nothing to do with my (former!) eating disorder. \n\nI felt ready for this experience and relied on past exposure therapy to help me integrate.

I don\u2019t experience the same fear I had in my first few weeks after this experience. I feared each new food, but thankfully felt happy or neutral when actually eating it. Now I\u2019m filled with curiosity and interest. I attribute this to an ongoing choice to engage in self-directed exposure therapy: it would have been easy to revert to old ways. But because it felt *available to me* to try new foods \u2013 and because of the positive experiences each time I tried foods \u2013 I\u2019ve consistently chosen curiosity. It\u2019s paid off. This experience seems similar to how children learn how to eat: some holistically choose curiosity which leads to a wide palate. Some choose comfort which can lead to fewer new food experiences. No judgment \u2013 and I\u2019m grateful to now have the tools to consistently choose this curiosity. \n- My husband jokes that each time I go to a restaurant I say \u201cthis is a top 5 food for me now!\u201d Recently I\u2019ve tried and loved escargots, pig\u2019s feet, poke bowls, caviar, Brussels sprouts (previously I couldn\u2019t be in the same room with the smell), and so much more.

          "body": "This log of progress is helpful to me, so I\u2019m posting again! Hello to anyone else reading this, too \ud83d\ude03\n\nTl;dr My progress is holding strong. And now I have stronger food preferences. My diet is intentionally and joyfully diverse. \n\n\nI feel more like a \u201chealthy adult\u201d eater now. My first few months after this experience, I felt like a child in a healthy environment learning about food. I tasted vegetables for the first time. I didn\u2019t know how to cook anything expect my prior safe foods. And each food experience felt new and interesting. \n\nToday, I\u2019ve experienced hundreds of new foods. Most of these new foods I\u2019ve tried in several ways: cooked differently, combined with different ingredients, and in different social/physical environments. That means I\u2019m becoming acclimated to most foods and the typical experiences they provide. Today I ate pork belly on a crostini: both pieces were familiar to me, and the combination felt 10% different (that\u2019s a guess). The first month, food was 90-100% different each time I tried something. \n\nI see this (mostly) neutrally. A pro: food is less of a time-consuming distraction. Fewer new experiences means less information to process and understand every meal. A con is I have food preferences (like any human does) that make me *slightly* less curious and open to new foods. \n\nExample: Every time I bring up this concern, my partner reminds me of how he perceives me. He says, \u201cYou will try anything, even if you choose not to eat the entire plate. Then every meal, you exclusively eat \u2018new\u2019 foods compared to Old You. That is still adventurous.\u201d And that, \u201cyour food preferences are that you like *good* food. You always like broccoli when it\u2019s cooked right.\u201d And I agree. I had an eating disorder for 27 years, and I\u2019m sometimes nervous that not enjoying a dish of undercooked veggies means that it\u2019s creeping back. It\u2019s not. I just have snobby taste, I think? \ud83d\ude39\n\nI\u2019ll also share details about my typical meals. Before I changed, I ate 1-2 of the same frozen pizzas each day. I also relied on toast with cheese, cereals, some yogurt brands, freeze-dried smoothies, and various carbs in rotation. \n\nTo compare, my favorite foods now are avocado, pork belly, oranges, kiwis, salmon avocado sushi, passion fruit, and\u2026most things!\n\nMy typical M-F meal schedule:\n* Breakfast: Hi-caf black tea, no-sugar lowfat greek yogurt with pumpkin seeds and wheat germ, orange or kiwi on the side.\n* Lunch: The sandwich is the main dish: A piece of my partner\u2019s homemade part-whole-grain sourdough bread, fried egg with salt/pepper/nutritional yeast, piece of fried cheese, whole avocado, cherry tomatoes, and microgreens if we have them around. I'll also eat another piece of fruit and a handful of nuts like pistachios.\n* Dinner: Usually a salad of some kind. Caesar is my favorite! Once a week we do salmon avocado sushi. If I\u2019m still hungry, I\u2019ll have peanut butter sourdough toast, or some nuts, or something with hummus. \n\nI hope this information is helpful to someone. This is still the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me. Wishing any readers relief!\n\nEdits: typos.",
