  "title": "Does anyone else lose their appetite when cooking for themselves?",
  "selftext": "Hi!\n\nI recently started living alone again and I realized that when I cook for myself, the act of watching the food cook and waiting for it to be done makes me lose my appetite and not want to eat.\n\nHowever, if I can get food within a few minutes of when I notice the signs of hunger, it is easier (but not always *easy*) to stomach the food and get it down.\n\nI don\u2019t know what is causing this but I want to be able to cook food for myself because it is cheaper and healthier than eating out all the time.\n\nIf anyone has any tips that might make it easier, I\u2019m here for it. If you also experience this, please let me know so I don\u2019t feel so alone.\n\nThank you so much!!",

      "body": "Me!! I have tried to figure this one out for many years. I think for me it comes down to two things: one, by the time the food is done I'm sort of sick of smelling it, feeling it, etc. but with prepared food, I don't taste or smell it until I'm about to eat it.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTwo, sometimes I just really don't want to know how the sausage is made. When someone else makes me an omlette I see an omlette. When I make me an omlette, I see raw eggs. I like that the middle step of ingredients transforming is invisible to me and the final result is more than the sum of its parts.\u00a0\n\n\nI definitely am nowhere near having this mastered, but two tips that help me are: choosing recipes with a rest period or enough time away to reset my brain, and leaning heavily into the world of spices, right down to understanding how to best utilize their flavors (whether they are fat, water or alcohol soluable, etc). With my best buddy MSG and a palette of spices, a heavy hand can give me that restaurant \"oomph\" I need for it to feel appealing!\u00a0",

I make a dozen or so meals on sunday just during the afternoon or something, portion them out into tupperware that I can just microwave later in the week (or re-heat in the oven for better quality if I have planned well enough that I don\u2019t need to eat *right now* lol).\u00a0\n\nI usually will make chicken breasts some way (fried, broiled, baked, strips, etc) and some sort of side. I actually really enjoy cooking and baking so it\u2019s nice to have some time set apart weekly to do it. however, I often don\u2019t eat one of my meal prepped meals on the day that I make them all b/c idk it\u2019s just too much or something. but I figure if I set myself up for success the rest of the week, it\u2019s okay to have snacks one day lol\n\nalso this would work with salad or sandwiches or something that doesn\u2019t need to be warmed up, but might take some prep work too!! like sometimes I will do raw veggies or apple slices for my side, and I will just cut them up and portion them out ahead of time that way, when hunger strikes, I just need to open the fridge and grab a container \u2014 no prep needed! or if you order pizza one night and have extra, portion them out into containers easy to grab and go for future days!",

Due to poverty and my upbringing, I have been exposed to bad meat and eggs, whether off or legit gone bad. I have also had sensory issues where there are unknown bits or things like veins, arteries, that greatly disturb me.\n\nSometimes these thoughts are conscious and sometimes they're subconscious. I get overly sensitive to seeing if the foods are off and doubting myself. Does this smell/taste weird? Is the texture weird? Could this have been mishandled by myself, a family member, or earlier in the food process?  Or even if I know it is safe to eat, sometimes I'll think it is low quality and has a bad flavor. For example, too game-y or freezer burn.\n\nI don't have any solutions but I commiserate!",

It\u2019s actually considered one of the healthiest fast food restaurants out there, so there\u2019s that at least. No judgement here. I can understand the intense mental chaos that comes with knowing what to do but being unable to do it. Before I got healthy I would literally lay in bed fantasizing about all the various exercises I could be doing and looking at pictures of healthy foods because I thought I could make myself like them that way. Didn\u2019t quite work, but maybe it kind of gave my brain the push it needed to shift my cravings. Honestly I think if you like vanilla milkshakes or any kind of milkshake, you\u2019d be able to get away with fairlife protein shakes. They have a bunch of protein, but they don\u2019t taste chalky and weird like other protein shakes. I also always tell people about Gruns gummies because they\u2019re whole food fruit and vegetable supplements that taste like a berry flavored gummy bear. Plus since they\u2019re whole food based instead of extract based your body reacts as if you actually ate fruits and vegetables! You\u2019d also likely benefit from a combination prebiotic/probiotic/postbiotic/digestive enzyme supplement to help your gut microbiome. Since you\u2019re on glp-1\u2019s you might also see a benefit to adding akkermansia. It\u2019s something that helps your body produce glp-1 naturally, and would be a great bandaid if you couldn\u2019t find any injections in time for your next one. A lot cheaper too.",

So it\u2019s really mentally taxing know what\u2019s best but really not being able to do it. Like this week I have had a lot of Taco Bell. Why because at least I\u2019m eating. I have adhd too and my meds make my appetite non existent. I have been on glp-1 shots in the past both wegovy and mounjaro just depending on what\u2019s available. And it gave me odd food aversions. Which it\u2019s like cool didn\u2019t need any more of that. \nI\u2019m unsure about the whole cooking because I also can\u2019t seem to throw like a pizza in and eat it. Not at home. I can at work just not at home",

There were some people in one of the weight loss subreddits, I forget which one, who used that for cravings for unhealthy food. This is merely an educated guess on my part, but it could be that for some reason your brain is getting the same fulfillment it usually would from eating as it does watching the food cook. \n\nAs for a solution I\u2019m not sure\u2026 if there\u2019s money for it takeout is always an option. I know when I lose my appetite I just rely on smoothies and supplements so I don\u2019t miss out on the nutrients I need.",

          "body": "That\u2019s fair\u2026 my husband eats Taco Bell just about every day. It\u2019s actually considered one of the healthiest fast food restaurants out there, so there\u2019s that at least. No judgement here. I can understand the intense mental chaos that comes with knowing what to do but being unable to do it. Before I got healthy I would literally lay in bed fantasizing about all the various exercises I could be doing and looking at pictures of healthy foods because I thought I could make myself like them that way. Didn\u2019t quite work, but maybe it kind of gave my brain the push it needed to shift my cravings. Honestly I think if you like vanilla milkshakes or any kind of milkshake, you\u2019d be able to get away with fairlife protein shakes. They have a bunch of protein, but they don\u2019t taste chalky and weird like other protein shakes. I also always tell people about Gruns gummies because they\u2019re whole food fruit and vegetable supplements that taste like a berry flavored gummy bear. Plus since they\u2019re whole food based instead of extract based your body reacts as if you actually ate fruits and vegetables! You\u2019d also likely benefit from a combination prebiotic/probiotic/postbiotic/digestive enzyme supplement to help your gut microbiome. Since you\u2019re on glp-1\u2019s you might also see a benefit to adding akkermansia. It\u2019s something that helps your body produce glp-1 naturally, and would be a great bandaid if you couldn\u2019t find any injections in time for your next one. A lot cheaper too.",
