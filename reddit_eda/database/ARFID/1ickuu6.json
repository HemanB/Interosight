The disorder is not characterized by the fear of gaining weight like anorexia is. Anorexia is the fear of gaining weight to where you restrict calorie intake. Two very different eating disorders. You didnt get your anorexia from your ARFID, as they cannot cause one another but you can have both of them at the same time, which is very unlucky :(\n\nMe for example, I was *born* with ARFID due to my autism spectrum disorder but I *obtained* anorexia when I got bullied in middle school. From ages 12-18 I was anorexic but now I\u2019m not, because my body dysmorphia went away. I still have ARFID though because I\u2019m too comfortable with my safe foods to go back into food therapy now that I\u2019m old enough to choose going or not.",
