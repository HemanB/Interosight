Mostly because not ordering something always feels a little embarrassing to me but ordering something that I won\u2019t eat feels like a waste. \n\nMy mates are all pretty understanding, most places I can find something but if they suggest something that I know I can\u2019t manage like idk Wagamamas for example I\u2019d just politely suggest somewhere else and usually that fine by them.\n\nGoing out with my friends is definitely more important to me than feeling awkward or not being able to eat tho! I cant drink cocktails for example but if my friends are going somewhere for cocktails then I\u2019d still go to see them because seeing them is what\u2019s important! \n\nIf you want my advice I guess talking to your friend is your best bet: ask them if they still want to be invited to somewhere where they have no safe foods? Or if you have a place in mind mention it so they can decide if they can manage it or you could consider elsewhere.\n\nYou sound like an awesome friend for trying to find ways to support them! I maybe wouldn\u2019t  overly insist on them going places they don\u2019t really want to, but I imagine if you\u2019re close they\u2019d love to spend time with you anyway! Hope this helps!",

If everything else on the menu was effectively poisoned and you knew this?\n\nIf you want your friend to be happy going out with you, find venues they can eat at, or places that have options like buffets or food courts. It's otherwise often a stressful thing to find time to eat beforehand to then sit in a restaurant being pressured to try things or to buy things you can't enjoy.",
