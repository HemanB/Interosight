  "selftext": "when i was in residential treatment for ARFID, my dietician who specializes in EDs said something very wise to me:\n\nthose who restrict heavily are prone to low bone density. lone bone density can cause bone loss, pain, and higher risk of fractures since you're not getting the proper nutrients your body needs. (osteopenia)\n\nin your 20s, osteopenia is 100% reversible; if you eat properly, your bones can be brought back to full health. (i can confirm, within a few weeks of eating 3 meals and 3 snacks a day, my bone density skyrocketed back to normal, according to my doctor)\n\nonce you hit your 30s, you will not be able to restore your bones to their full health. your osteopenia can evolve into osteoporosis, which is not reversible and can lead to lower life expectancy. (it is still treatable but again, not curable)\n\nnot trying to scare anyone, but i feel this information is important to share. \n\ni got treated by the Emily Program. i've also heard good things about Equip.\nif you can't afford healthcare, check out \"THE PICKY EATER'S RECOVERY BOOK\"  it's an amazing book that you can use for at home treatment! it covers all the different types of ARFID. just ignore mentions of BMI since that's an outdated measurement.\n\nedit: i should note that while this information was relayed to me by a professional, it's important to do your own research, too; take what i say with a grain of salt. it is NEVER too late to begin recovery no matter what age you may be.\n\nedit 2: i'm really glad this struck a chord with yall, i am probably going to stop responding to comments because i am overwhelmed LMAO and i don't want to be giving unsolicited medical advice because i am not a professional. if you have questions about my experience in recovery or before recovery, or even my thoughts regarding diet culture and the American healthcare system, feel free to DM me! thank you so much for sharing your experiences or simply commenting. \n\n(i also went ahead and edited a few comments so they can be more concise, i am very ADHD so you will notice some thoughts may be out of order, lol)",

Just some side info before I answer your question: estrogen is very supportive to bone strength, and during menopause, women's estrogen tanks so this is why bone health and strength is a big topic for middle age women and up. Without knowing your age, your testosterone would help you with your muscle and bone strength but it is still important to know that without giving our bones the nutrients they need to stay strong, anyone could be at risk. So with ARFID, this is a conversation worth having with anyone. Does this help?",

Unfortunately, many doctors in the United States believe that weight loss and thinness are the ultimate markers of health and well-being.\n\nFor example, many providers use a BMI calculator to measure patients' weight and health, even though BMI has proven to be an outdated measurement and has often falsely categorized people as healthy or unhealthy. (including me!)\n\n\nLots of people with EDs are classified as \"overweight\" or \"normal\" and are then dismissed since their idea of a starving person is someone who is very thin. Less than 6% of people with EDs are medically diagnosed as underweight. (Source: Flament, Henderson, et al., 2015)\n\n\nDoctors, and in your case, even dieticians are not immune to diet culture and may look over signs of malnourishment and deficiencies in certain nutrients. And/or they don't know what to look for. They look at your weight instead. \n\n\nyou are right to trust your instincts. if you feel like death all the time, you certainly need help!!! i'm so sorry your doctors haven't been helpful, i know how it feels to be dismissed when you feel really sick. it's quite frustrating.\n\ni hope that answers your question, and i hope the ED clinic gets back to you soon!",
