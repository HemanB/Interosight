      "body": "Joke's aside, this discovery has been both eye-opening and a gut punch to me for the past week. Moreso because my family has a more *conservative* attitude toward mental disorders.\n\nI've been seeing a therapist about my clusterfuck of a brain for a few months, she diagnosed me with severe ADHD (kinda saw it coming), and during one of the more question/answer style sessions, she asked me about my diet. She was a bit shocked to learn about how I eat basically no fruits or vegetables or much of anything other than the classics (chicken, potatoes, and pasta ftw) for all my 22 years of living.  That one of the things that infuriate/disgusts me the most is whenever I'm indoors and someone starts eating cooked food (couldn't they take that shit outside?!). The fact that I will (and have) literally starved myself instead of eating undesirable food. The list goes on...\n\nAfter a while, she started to tell me about ARFID. Just like my ADHD diagnosis, everything she told me about ARFID and how it works felt like such an illuminating moment. Like all the puzzle pieces of my life up to now just slid into place. In fact, she's said my ADHD also likely ties into ARFID. But right now I don't know what to do about it. She said we'll discuss treatment options at our next session but that's not for another month (finding a time when she's available and I'm not having classes is a pain in the ass).\n\nRight now I'm freaking out wondering what the next step is. It sounds weird saying it out loud (or even typing it), but all my life I've watched people eat whole plates filled with balanced meals, watched them take big spoonfuls without thinking about it, and wished I could *just* do that. I've seen shows and movies of people eating salads and non-white bread and exotic dishes and thought to myself \"That looks good, I wish I could eat that\" even though I know if those meals were magically teleported from the screen as they were right in front of me I would do what I always do. Choke down some bites, get distracted for several minutes, choke down some more, and before I know it the food has gone soggy or dry, and I've eaten less than a quarter of it, I lose my appetite and with full shame put the leftovers in the microwave, say \"I'll finish this later today\" (this is a lie, I *know* this is a goddamn lie) forget about the leftovers, then throw it all away the next morning because it got spoiled. Don't forget another healthy helping of shame I feel when I scoop the food into the garbage.\n\nWith my ADHD diagnosis, I was more relieved than scared. I got this feeling that a lot of my faults are not my own but the result of this mental disorder. I've tried treating it with the typical stuff: yoga, exercise, and meditation. None of it helped. And with the diagnosis, my therapist said she can give me a referral to a psychiatrist to get prescribed Adderal and I'm not afraid to admit I was elated. A possible solution to a lifelong problem that feels doable (hooray for drugs). But ARFID feels different.\n\nI thought, like many of you, that I was just a picky eater and I just had to \"get over\" my hang-ups. That if I choke down enough healthy diets I'll eventually enjoy it. But with this diagnosis, I felt the opposite way than how I felt getting diagnosed with ADHD. I know I haven't spoken to my therapist about treatment options, but doing my own research this feels a lot harder to solve than my ADHD.\n\nI guess what I'm wondering now is:  how do you guys cope? how did you feel getting diagnosed and how did you deal with it? do you brute force your way to a healthy diet or is there a more doable solution (doesn't *have* to be medication, but you know...it helps).\n\nIf you made it through this gargantuan wall of text, thanks for indulging me. It's 3 am, I'm too antsy to sleep, research binging and all, but I'm probably gonna tucker out soon, so if I don't respond to comments right away know that that's what I'm doing. Have a good one!",

I constantly feel guilty about the fact I consume mainly sugar and I'm 6 weeks away from giving birth but then I remember to my first pregnancy when I felt so guilty to the point I didn't eat AT ALL which of course, NOT a good thing when you're growing a human. Then I'm reminded \"hey, at least you're EATING and it's not ALWAYS all sugar. You're gonna birth an average size baby rather than a worryingly small baby\" and it makes me feel better. Food is food!

      "body": "I was told I\u2019m a picky eater all my life, so it just stuck with me.  I work in mental health, and having to read the DSM in class, it didn\u2019t even completely occur to me that I could have ARFID because I thought, \u201cI don\u2019t have an eating disorder.\u201d  I joined this subreddit maybe a year or two ago, but I thought that since I didn\u2019t have as severe of a case as some people I\u2019d read about, maybe it wasn\u2019t ARFID.  So I found several ways to talk myself out of thinking I could have it.  But when I\u2019d talk about my eating habits, I\u2019d tell people that at this point, I know it\u2019s all anxiety-based and in my head.  The more I started to think that way - \u201cthat it was all in my head\u201d - the more I started to think about ARFID as an actual diagnosis for me.  I\u2019ve been working with a therapist certified in working with eating disorders for several months now, and it has been the most validating thing.  Lots of tough work already and plenty more to go, but for the first time (in my late 30s), I have some hope.",

      "body": "I told my doctor about this eating disorder last year in February. I found out months before I told her about ARFID. My doctor had to look it up because she didn't know what it was and my doctor agreed with me that I have it. Before I found out about ARFID, I just always thought I was a very extreme picky eater. But when I read about ARFID I was like so relieved that I finally knew what was going on with me.\n\n But at the same time I wasn't because I just want to be able to eat all of the delicious foods. My doctor told me to start taking those ensure drinks/protein drinks and a multivitamin last year, when I told her about it. I tried a couple different drinks but I just couldn't do it. The smell was the same for those drinks I tried, which was a very very strong disgusting smell. And the taste was so so bad as well like I had to spit it out. \n\nLike I really did try my best to like them but I just couldn't do it. Because I know I really do need those drinks to help me but I just can't. Then the same thing with the multivitamin, I tried a couple different kinds of them as well. But the smell and the taste was super strong and I just couldn't do it. Like I forced myself to eat one and I almost got sick and my stomach hated me for doing that.\n\n My doctor still thinks I'm taking the multivitamin because when she asks me about them I say yea that I'm still taking them but I don't. I know I shouldn't lie to her about taking them but if I don't I feel like she would think I'm not trying to help myself. Because she gives me so many options I can try to get better but I turn most of them down like going on a medication to eat more. But I don't have a problem with eating like I know when I'm hungry it's just that I have a very small amount of food I actually like. I'm starting therapy soon for my eating disorder, my first appointment is on March 16th. \n\nI know I won't like it because I will have to try new foods eventually but at the same time I will. Because I can work on getting better and I really need to gain weight. I have always weighed 97 pounds ( I'm 22 and I'm 5 feet 2 inches) but I have been losing weight since last July and I'm currently 92 pounds if I didn't drop more. My doctor told me my weight is getting dangerously low. So I really need to like more foods and also it will give me the vitamins and minerals I need so badly because I get probably none of those.\n\n I saw that a person needs to try a food at least 20 times before their taste buds decides if they like a certain food or not. So the foods that looks good and smell good to you, give them a try multiple times. I know it will be hard but we can do this. I don't know if my therapist will have me eat one bite of a new food or have me eat it all. But which ever one it is, I will be forcing myself to eat that new food because I want to be healthy and get to a healthy weight. \n\nI hope we can both get a little bit better at liking some more foods. Also this might help you but I'm going to be hiding like vegetables and other foods inside of food. Like in cheesy dishes or make the vegetables so tiny hidden in the food where I can't really taste or see them.",

I just read this subreddit\u2019s top posts inside and out. \n\nDisinterest in eating. Fear of adverse reactions like throat swelling again, food poisoning, choking, ect. Limited number of things I eat. Fear of eating new foods. Fear of new restaurants. Never feeling hungry until my blood sugar crashes. Feeling like my stomach is always full and bloated when stressed. Nausea because I didn\u2019t eat, but nauseous when I do eat. \n\nYou mean to fucking tell me that ALLLLLL of this that I\u2019ve been struggling with for a YEAR could be an eating disorder and that this isn\u2019t just come crazy thing affecting only me??? What the hell!! \n\nI used to be sort of a foodie. I tried new recipes and foods all the time. I would eat whatever I want, damn the consequence. Now I can\u2019t even eat a chocolate bar, because I\u2019ve never tried it before, and obviously, it will give me an allergic reaction. \n\nMan. This sub has given me a lot to think about \ud83d\ude05 thanks for making the post I guess?",

      "body": "Oh, man sugar has always been an issue for me. For as long as I can remember I can't drink coffee unless it has milk and an obscene amount of sugar. Hell, I would call it an unreasonable amount of sugar because sometimes I don't stir it thoroughly and by the time I've almost finished the cup there's this thick bed of sugar at the bottom. So I didn't even enjoy most of that sugar or even notice that not all of it is mixed properly.\n\nFirst off, congrats on getting through growing another human in you. I have a hard enough time eating for myself, eating for two sounds like a nightmare and you sound pretty badass in my book for pulling it off.\n\nSecondly, your advice rings true with what I've both read and experienced. The biggest scare about finding out I have ARFID is also finding out I may have scurvy, or if not I'm definitely at high risk for it. I have this \"benign\" rash down my arms shoulders and back that's stuck with me through puberty, always thought it was just me being unlucky in the genetics department since the rash doesn't itch and isn't irritating in any way. Telling this to my therapist she suggests I immediately try to incorporate more fruits and veggies in my diet, as I'm most certainly severely lacking in vitamin c. I asked her if I can't just take vitamin c supplements and she advised against it, claiming it's better to eat foods with vitamin c as that solves several problems at once: \n\nSolves the nutritional deficiency problem.\n\nI'd be eating more food, so I'm no longer needlessly starving myself.\n\nHelps me accustom myself to eating food groups I hate.\n\nI've been trying to eat an orange a day to get that vitamin c (therapist says I should feel the effects of this nutritional intake in 2 weeks, given how long I've gone without it) and it's not been easy. I hate the fleshiness of fruits, and more so their inconsistent texture. Why do orange slices have to have this layer of flesh followed by orange juices and chunks of pulp?! It's horrible. My mom and sister haven't been the most supportive about this, claiming I'm exaggerating and should just \"get over it\" (as if I fucking want to be this way), so finding a community of like-minded individuals with the same struggles has been the best thing to come out of the diagnosis. Thank you for the advice.",

I just read this subreddit\u2019s top posts inside and out. \n\nDisinterest in eating. Fear of adverse reactions like throat swelling again, food poisoning, choking, ect. Limited number of things I eat. Fear of eating new foods. Fear of new restaurants. Never feeling hungry until my blood sugar crashes. Feeling like my stomach is always full and bloated when stressed. Nausea because I didn\u2019t eat, but nauseous when I do eat. \n\nYou mean to fucking tell me that ALLLLLL of this that I\u2019ve been struggling with for a YEAR could be an eating disorder and that this isn\u2019t just come crazy thing affecting only me??? What the hell!! \n\nI used to be sort of a foodie. I tried new recipes and foods all the time. I would eat whatever I want, damn the consequence. Now I can\u2019t even eat a chocolate bar, because I\u2019ve never tried it before, and obviously, it will give me an allergic reaction. \n\nMan. This sub has given me a lot to think about \ud83d\ude05 thanks for making the post I guess?",

Moreso because my family has a more *conservative* attitude toward mental disorders.\n\nI've been seeing a therapist about my clusterfuck of a brain for a few months, she diagnosed me with severe ADHD (kinda saw it coming), and during one of the more question/answer style sessions, she asked me about my diet. She was a bit shocked to learn about how I eat basically no fruits or vegetables or much of anything other than the classics (chicken, potatoes, and pasta ftw) for all my 22 years of living.  That one of the things that infuriate/disgusts me the most is whenever I'm indoors and someone starts eating cooked food (couldn't they take that shit outside?!). The fact that I will (and have) literally starved myself instead of eating undesirable food. The list goes on...\n\nAfter a while, she started to tell me about ARFID. Just like my ADHD diagnosis, everything she told me about ARFID and how it works felt like such an illuminating moment. Like all the puzzle pieces of my life up to now just slid into place. In fact, she's said my ADHD also likely ties into ARFID. But right now I don't know what to do about it. She said we'll discuss treatment options at our next session but that's not for another month (finding a time when she's available and I'm not having classes is a pain in the ass).\n\nRight now I'm freaking out wondering what the next step is. It sounds weird saying it out loud (or even typing it), but all my life I've watched people eat whole plates filled with balanced meals, watched them take big spoonfuls without thinking about it, and wished I could *just* do that. I've seen shows and movies of people eating salads and non-white bread and exotic dishes and thought to myself \"That looks good, I wish I could eat that\" even though I know if those meals were magically teleported from the screen as they were right in front of me I would do what I always do. Choke down some bites, get distracted for several minutes, choke down some more, and before I know it the food has gone soggy or dry, and I've eaten less than a quarter of it, I lose my appetite and with full shame put the leftovers in the microwave, say \"I'll finish this later today\" (this is a lie, I *know* this is a goddamn lie) forget about the leftovers, then throw it all away the next morning because it got spoiled. Don't forget another healthy helping of shame I feel when I scoop the food into the garbage.\n\nWith my ADHD diagnosis, I was more relieved than scared. I got this feeling that a lot of my faults are not my own but the result of this mental disorder. I've tried treating it with the typical stuff: yoga, exercise, and meditation. None of it helped. And with the diagnosis, my therapist said she can give me a referral to a psychiatrist to get prescribed Adderal and I'm not afraid to admit I was elated. A possible solution to a lifelong problem that feels doable (hooray for drugs). But ARFID feels different.\n\nI thought, like many of you, that I was just a picky eater and I just had to \"get over\" my hang-ups. That if I choke down enough healthy diets I'll eventually enjoy it. But with this diagnosis, I felt the opposite way than how I felt getting diagnosed with ADHD. I know I haven't spoken to my therapist about treatment options, but doing my own research this feels a lot harder to solve than my ADHD.\n\nI guess what I'm wondering now is:  how do you guys cope? how did you feel getting diagnosed and how did you deal with it? do you brute force your way to a healthy diet or is there a more doable solution (doesn't *have* to be medication, but you know...it helps).\n\nIf you made it through this gargantuan wall of text, thanks for indulging me. It's 3 am, I'm too antsy to sleep, research binging and all, but I'm probably gonna tucker out soon, so if I don't respond to comments right away know that that's what I'm doing. Have a good one!",

          "body": "Joke's aside, this discovery has been both eye-opening and a gut punch to me for the past week. Moreso because my family has a more *conservative* attitude toward mental disorders.\n\nI've been seeing a therapist about my clusterfuck of a brain for a few months, she diagnosed me with severe ADHD (kinda saw it coming), and during one of the more question/answer style sessions, she asked me about my diet. She was a bit shocked to learn about how I eat basically no fruits or vegetables or much of anything other than the classics (chicken, potatoes, and pasta ftw) for all my 22 years of living.  That one of the things that infuriate/disgusts me the most is whenever I'm indoors and someone starts eating cooked food (couldn't they take that shit outside?!). The fact that I will (and have) literally starved myself instead of eating undesirable food. The list goes on...\n\nAfter a while, she started to tell me about ARFID. Just like my ADHD diagnosis, everything she told me about ARFID and how it works felt like such an illuminating moment. Like all the puzzle pieces of my life up to now just slid into place. In fact, she's said my ADHD also likely ties into ARFID. But right now I don't know what to do about it. She said we'll discuss treatment options at our next session but that's not for another month (finding a time when she's available and I'm not having classes is a pain in the ass).\n\nRight now I'm freaking out wondering what the next step is. It sounds weird saying it out loud (or even typing it), but all my life I've watched people eat whole plates filled with balanced meals, watched them take big spoonfuls without thinking about it, and wished I could *just* do that. I've seen shows and movies of people eating salads and non-white bread and exotic dishes and thought to myself \"That looks good, I wish I could eat that\" even though I know if those meals were magically teleported from the screen as they were right in front of me I would do what I always do. Choke down some bites, get distracted for several minutes, choke down some more, and before I know it the food has gone soggy or dry, and I've eaten less than a quarter of it, I lose my appetite and with full shame put the leftovers in the microwave, say \"I'll finish this later today\" (this is a lie, I *know* this is a goddamn lie) forget about the leftovers, then throw it all away the next morning because it got spoiled. Don't forget another healthy helping of shame I feel when I scoop the food into the garbage.\n\nWith my ADHD diagnosis, I was more relieved than scared. I got this feeling that a lot of my faults are not my own but the result of this mental disorder. I've tried treating it with the typical stuff: yoga, exercise, and meditation. None of it helped. And with the diagnosis, my therapist said she can give me a referral to a psychiatrist to get prescribed Adderal and I'm not afraid to admit I was elated. A possible solution to a lifelong problem that feels doable (hooray for drugs). But ARFID feels different.\n\nI thought, like many of you, that I was just a picky eater and I just had to \"get over\" my hang-ups. That if I choke down enough healthy diets I'll eventually enjoy it. But with this diagnosis, I felt the opposite way than how I felt getting diagnosed with ADHD. I know I haven't spoken to my therapist about treatment options, but doing my own research this feels a lot harder to solve than my ADHD.\n\nI guess what I'm wondering now is:  how do you guys cope? how did you feel getting diagnosed and how did you deal with it? do you brute force your way to a healthy diet or is there a more doable solution (doesn't *have* to be medication, but you know...it helps).\n\nIf you made it through this gargantuan wall of text, thanks for indulging me. It's 3 am, I'm too antsy to sleep, research binging and all, but I'm probably gonna tucker out soon, so if I don't respond to comments right away know that that's what I'm doing. Have a good one!",

      "body": "Yo, as soon as I read your \"I don't eat fruits or vegetables\" with the exception of potatoes, I immediately thought scurvy. Potatoes contain vitamin C, but if it is your only source of vitamin C (depending on how much you eat/how you prepare the potatoes), it probably isn't enough to keep your vitamin C levels high enough that you weren't mildly deficient. \n\nMy diet was the same, also with copious amounts of sugar... I decided to eat healthier because I needed to lose weight, so I cut out potatoes and frozen pizza, aka my only sources of vitamin C. \n\nI ended up developing latent scurvy and then manifest scurvy. Fun fact, the first symptoms of scurvy tend to be neuropsychiatric; depression and kind of hyperchondria/health anxiety. Your body knows something is wrong, but when you're begging for help from your doctor... the depression and hyperchondria put you on the \"psych patient\" pipeline, and the doctor assumes everything is in your head. \n\nSupplement the vitamin C as well as eating what fruits you can, your body needs it, and like... an anorexic patient being given Ensure (nutritional drink) when unable to finish their meal... to ensure they meet their caloric needs, you should be taking vitamin C to ensure you meet your nutritional needs. They wouldn't (shouldn't) deny a patient with an eating disorder (ED) adequate nutrition if that ED was anorexia/bulimia, especially telling them \"ok but like just eat?\", they sure as fuck shouldn't be doing this with ARFID. \n\nSupplementing vitamin C actually helped my obscene sugar cravings too. It gave me energy to function (and make better dietary choices), cleared up the rashes I've had most of my life... the constant joint pain? It's still there after 4 weeks, but I don't need painkillers as much... oh, and wounds are healing again, like properly healing, not just kind of healing and then reopening and then ...repeat for months. Like an ingrown hair I picked out (scurvy messes with hair follicles), it had been trying to heal for 4 months. I wasn't that rough... it has finally healed now.\n\nSorry, I kind of ended up ranting, but tl;dr - Supplement vitamin C, scurvy fucking sucks!",
