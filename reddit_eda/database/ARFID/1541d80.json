I think ARFID recognition has come a long way.",

I\u2019d never heard of ARFID before and didn\u2019t know such a thing existed, or that there was really anyone else like me in that way. \n\nI have learned a lot from reading through this subreddit and some literature online about ARFID and it\u2019s been a pretty life-changing couple of days for me. I edited my original comment on that post to reflect how I\u2019m feeling now about the situation.",

For the record, I haven\u2019t vomited due to a food in about 2 decades now because I\u2019m avoidant. So it\u2019s not even a current issue just a constant concern. \n\nIn another scenario the girl I once planned to marry told me she wouldnt consider marrying me until I \u201cfix\u201d my eating. I began seeking therapy to try and fix it so I could marry her and she left me during the process. I think it was never really the eating the eating who made her hesitant to marry me. At least not the main thing. \n\nThen I found someone almost as picky as me and we understood each other. \n\nStay hopeful and I know you too will find someone who can accept your challenges in life and love you none the less for it \ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffb",

I have a problem with some processed food, but haven't tracked down if it's a specific ingredient.\n\nPeople don't even need fake meat.  It's just vegans trying to insist that meat-eaters have no reason, even a stupid one like liking meat, not to give it up.  (They expect to not be given a hard time over their choices, FFS.)\n\nI'm low-meat, as in I don't know if I have lacto-vegetarian days because I'm not paying attention to what was made with lard instead of oil.  Then I get grumpy and really need to eat a porkchop or something.  According to food-morality, I'm being better than someone who eats a pound of flesh every day.  Also I don't really care about food morality in more than an abstract group sense because some individuals have limited choice.\n\nSorry if this came off as rantish.",
