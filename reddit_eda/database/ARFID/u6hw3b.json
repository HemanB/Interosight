I recently saw this subreddit pop up on a google search and figured I\u2019d offer tips/advice for those who need it.\n\nARFID is a very common eating disorder that can be treated effectively and efficiently with a strategic and sound approach. I know how difficult it can be to work through - what questions do you have for me?\n\nEdit: Need to take a break for now, I'll try getting to the rest when I can. :)",

If so, how did you approach their treatment?\n\nI'm 37F and have presented ARFID symptoms since I was 3, but only learned of it two years ago. Also autistic w/anxiety, but while I know those are factors...I just don't like or enjoy food. I have my safe foods which I survive on, but if I pay too much attention to their taste and texture, then even they disgust me. \n\nThe only treatment help I've been able to access so far is a dietician without ARFID experience, and her first step was requiring me to eat at regular intervals and eat without distractions. \n\nReading while I eat has been my coping mechanism since childhood, and focusing on my food now makes me so grossed out that I'd rather starve. I had to pause treatment for unrelated reasons and am not sure how to approach that when I begin again.\n\nDo you recommend mindful eating to your ARFID clients? If so, how do you coach them through it? I've been poor my whole life, so I have a lot of experience going hungry--and when I pay attention to what I eat and that causes me to gag and choke on the food, I'd much rather just stop trying to eat at all.\n\nThank you so much for doing this!

She has a very restricted number of foods she will eat that are considered \"healthy\", and it is a constant source of challenge for me to ensure she is eating enough to meet her nutritional needs, in spite of her eating enough as I don't limit her safe foods - she is tall and a healthy weight. She has indicated that apart from texture, and a fear of what something will taste like, she cannot handle foods that make too much noise inside her head when she chews. Anything too crunchy is a real problem, as well as anything mushy or gristly in texture. \n\nI am quite exhausted by the rotating of these safe foods in order to ensure she doesn't tire of them, and wondering what a dietician might do to support? And, if this sounds like ARFID in spite of her seeming to thrive? She often won't eat much at all outside of the house if there aren't any safe foods for her.\n\nThank you!",

The only cooked vegetable she will eat is green beans. She eats all colors of bell peppers, cucumbers, celery, baby spinach, and lettuce but it has to be shredded. She is fine with most starches but will only eat potatoes in the form of fries from very specific places. The only sauce she will eat is alfredo. She will not touch anything that has tomatoes. So no ketchup, no pizza sauce, no spaghetti sauce. She can tell if I bought a new kind of pasta.\n\nShe has intense anxiety surrounding food. She needs to have control over what she eats. She has been like this since she was a toddler. At 12 she is better. We have a system worked out. If I am cooking something she doesn't like she is allowed to make her own dinner. She can cook and is quite the avid baker. If I am making pasta alfredo she gets pasta with alfredo sauce on top and whatever meat element on the side. For tacos she gets unseasoned ground beef, a tortilla,  a pile of cheese, a pile of shredded lettuce, and sometimes a pile of sour cream. These are all eaten separately. For spaghetti she gets plain noodles and usually adds parmesan. \n\nThis is just a general idea of her around food.

      "body": "Good question. There's two ways people often go about life with an ED, in my opinion. \n\n1. They manage the situation and deal with it. There's distress and it's uncomfortable, but it's almost 'accepted' as \"I get this is a big obstacle in my life... but this is just me\".  \n2. They are actively working on treatment and recovery.\n\nMany people flip flop in between these two as well. The dilemma is that in treatment for ARFID the client is required to work through significant anxiety and discomfort. It doesn't feel good. There's very little reward for completing the task, and when compared to the avoidance techniques developed to cope with the issue (distraction for example) it's hard to consistently feel like you're in the place to challenge these behaviors. Doubled down by the fact that you need food to live, so there's this dichotomy muddying the water as well.   \n\n\nThe brain needs this persistence though. With ARFID the brain really needs to understand food and the sensations that come with it. I always remove the 'self' from the explanation because it's not a fault of the person that this has happened, as our behaviors are dictated significantly by experiences and observations. But it's the client's goal to start noticing the sensations that come with the experience of eating, which is technically mindfulness. The forces the brain to adapt. Eating consistently is a fairly good recommendation as well because our hunger hormones (and a lot of our biology) is rhythmic. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, yes - you would feel better not being mindful. And in many cases, this is a good route to get someone nourished. But it's not actually working on the issue as much as it is avoidance behavior as interpreted by the brain. The brain learns that distracting is the solution, as opposed to adapting to the sensations the come with food. A good approach would utilize distraction at most meals to start, and then gradually bring in a small amount of hyper mindful eating. A snack a day or a snack a week even is helpful.",

Considering that one doesn't always have a perfect mindset or perspective of a topic is an important skill in life.    \n\n\nYour logic makes sense, you'd like to ensure that you're nutritionally sound. I think that's great. But the logic is rooted in the thought that you will always be a little 'stuck in your ways' when it comes to eating. So you're looking for alternatives to 'make due', to some extent. Clients that I've worked with improve significantly - a full recovery is possible. Of course, one's perspective on foods will always be considering past experiences so it's not like they just 'forgot' about dealing with ARFID. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI dislike the idea of replacing meals with a drink. It's what I'd call an avoidance behavior, or a management behavior in certain cases. If you're REALLY struggling, a meal replacement will be preferable to not eating. But even attempting a meal is progress. During the recovery from something like ARFID, you will be physically changing the contents of your mind as you work through some of this anxiety. It's very difficult to imagine a state of recovery, so sometimes I suggest not getting tripped up in this. Trust the process. Set small realistic goals that provide a little bit of a challenge. Ideally, you want to go into food situations/trials pretty confident that you'll be able to complete whatever the task is. For example, if eating in social situations is very difficult - try specific challenges where you eat in front of close friends/family/ or as suggested above even in front of pets/animals! Every time you engage with food, and create a positive experience, the brain starts learning that the anxiety response is unnecessary. Over time, the anxiety response disappears - but it does take continued effort and persistence. People do often get stuck in avoiding the situations that make them feel uncomfortable, but that only perpetuates the problem. The brain then starts learning 'well I deal with this problem by avoiding it', and this isn't a realistic or healthy solution. You need the brain to recognize that whatever aversion it has picked up, is irrational.",

But me, I'm thinking I need to live with a healthy diet before I get anemia and/or diabetes at a young age, and if this can solve it, then that's a success, Feeling comfortable in social settings by expanding my safe foods is an optional/secondary goal. Am I having a bad mindset here? Is your end goal with patients completely \"normal\" eating habits? Or is it like this sort of damage control with meal replacement drinks and supplements?",

Rationale, logical decision making, and even physical functioning are somewhat thrown out the window during a period of high anxiety. It's not that these people are choosing this, or just dislike certain foods. It's a lot more than that, and loved ones not understanding this is a common frustration shared by those with ARFID. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow you approach definitely depends on where he's at in recovery. I've had clients whose BF/GF are super helpful in assisting with new foods and challenging them. But I've also had clients who just aren't ready for that. The best you can do is communicate, and support him wherever he's at. As long as you come from a place of wanting to understand, I don't think you should worry about discussing food and eating.

Why this occurs can be important for an individual\u2019s curiosity, but doesn\u2019t seem to be particularly important for recovery. \n\nI believe it helps a lot to be \u201cstrategic\u201d around the approach, and that\u2019s where someone like a dietitian (who has experience in ARFID) can help a lot. \n\nHowever, the work boils down to the avoidant behavior being the limiting factor to progress. We work through two phases typically 1. Food trials which start at very low intensity such as bringing back foods that were \u201cdropped\u201d (used to eat), or even just changing the presentation of a food (such as sandwiches that are typically cut in half, try uncut). These increase in difficulty until the person feels comfortable working with heavily feared foods. Phase 2. Is incorporation. Taking the foods that were less aversive and working them into the diet frequently. Food being unappealing or having low appetite is often a complicating factor, but improves as a persons nutritional status improves and as consistency in eating improves. Our body is very rhythmic, so hunger cues will self regulation to our behaviors. If eating sporadically, hunger cues typically fade or we just don\u2019t get the same impact from them. Sometimes phone reminders can be nice to just remind the person to eat -something- and keep their body consistent.\n\nAlmost everyone I\u2019ve worked with makes really fast progress in the world of eating disorders. 20-30 sessions can yield enough progress to fix many nutritional deficiencies and reduce anxiety around eating so that the client can continue the work outside of guidance. Many people make huge improvement in just one month of consistent effort, and this month benchmark is often a good indicator for future progress in recovery.  6-8 months is the typical amount of time I\u2019d work with someone, but it can vary a lot depending on many different factors",

Someone who chooses to be vegan or vegetarian is typically making a cultural or spiritual choice that supersedes other potential desires or needs. This is fine, but people are often dishonest about their intentions and when it comes to self-care, you have to be honest with yourself.\n\nRestrictive diets get repetitive, and often lead to food fatigue. Food fatigue is a real experience, and usually leads to weight loss and nutritional deficiency. Someone might be fine eating the same foods on repeat for a few years\u2026but a few decades? It\u2019s worth considering if that\u2019s acceptable for the person.\n\n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that food is such a big part of our lives, and we cannot change human nature. So if someone is feeling that they can\u2019t go to events without some emergency food plan, or food decisions are active and consistent thoughts I would reckon there is a problem.  When food is not enjoyable, a very deep psychological issue can develop as abstinence from the sources of natural pleasures has been studied deeply. We do need to engage with these pleasures and have moderation around them. \n\n\nJust be honest with yourself. No one can be honest for you.

All of which are relatively new fields to study, so we probably won't have concrete research for many decades. I'm under the impression that ARFID is often caused (at least in part) by lack of sensory exposure to foods at a young age. Why would this be the case? Well...a few different reasons. You simply might not have had exposure, and parents never made an effort for whatever reason. You might have had a traumatic food event (like choking) which never really was worked through and this can cause self regulating avoidance behaviors which cause limited sensory exposure. Or you might just have a predisposition, such as the 'super taster' gene which makes foods a little more intense and this can cause avoidance.\n\nWhat's interesting is that autism is showing connections to our gut microbiome. So an underdeveloped gut microbiome is connected to Autism, but that's really the extent of what science knows so far. Poor gut microbiome is usually a result of limited exposure to bacteria, but especially bacteria in the food we eat. So it becomes an interesting question of what comes first? Is it that Autism being more connected with restricted food intake = poor microbiota? Or is it the microbiome leading, which is impacted by a more hygienically fixated society? I don't know the answers to these questions, but these are the questions that are limiting further developments in the field.",

Part of the reason why I do the work that I do is that I love helping and seeing people go from that feeling of despair to hope. There's hope for everyone - don't let negative thoughts convince you otherwise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know of any other treatments for ARFID. Exposure is really the main way because it forces the brain to adapt. Some people confuse that statement with 'It forces you to deal with it' - not exactly true. The brain and body will eventually decrease the anxiety response, but it does take time and hard work. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA feeding tube wouldn't be a relief. A relief would be freedom with food, eating when you are hungry, having your health, being able to do to things you want to do, etc. Living off products like that isn't *ideal*. Fruits and vegetables contain small compounds called phytochemicals that cannot be synthesized or extracted from foods. These compounds do a lot - strong anti inflammatory, anti chronic disease, etc. You would miss out on these which can be a problem. Given their elusivity, it would also be an impossible thing to 'prove' that you're not getting enough. Those on tube feedings usually  have a lot of GI symptoms, which can get old. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nARFID is recognized in some treatment centers, and if not they usually have connections to people who do this work. I don't know of any services on cooking classes, but I'm sure there is something! I'd also caution the thinking that some behaviors are 'part of the OCD' and some aren't. We have one brain and mind, and mental health diagnoses are just someone's best guess at what defining criteria you fit in. Other thoughts and behaviors that don't fit within that exact criteria don't mean they are a different problem or won't improve with the work that is done in general therapy/treatment. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSounds like you definitely should check in with someone - feeling that weak and having those symptoms like you did in college should be addressed ASAP. I know it's hard...you can do this.",

      "body": "First, I always try to explain that anxiety is inherently functional. It\u2019s somewhat normal that our brain\u2019s neurological pathways have associated aspects of fear and anxiety with food. \n\nOur brains are actively learning every single time we eat. As someone with a passion in the subject, I\u2019m still amazed by the degree to which people of all ages subconsciously learn during eating. \n\nOf course the problem is that we don\u2019t have a filter on that learning. Food aversions are created just as easily as preferred foods. Food situations, especially the social situations you mentioned, can be as fulfilling as they can be detrimental.\n\nThe specifics of what will help you will be individual, but the process is ultimately consistent for everyone. You need to create more positive food-centric social situations. That strategy of how this is done is really the key, but someone who is introspective could do this on their own. Start as small as you need to, these challenges should be challenging without seeming impossible. If eating in front of ANYONE produces anxiety - have a tea party with your dog or cat. Seriously. If you can tolerate a few close friends or family, practice that. \n\nYou want a surmountable challenge, you do not want to be practicing at some grand feast. The problem typically is that people start with challenges far too hard and/or avoid challenges all together. The work is meant to induce this anxiety, and you need to work through it, but it needs to be an appropriately tailored challenge so that you can almost guarantee success.\n\nFurthermore, practicing in controlling our inward focus (are they watching me? What do I look like? Are they judging the foods I\u2019m eating?) with meditation is totally invaluable. Meditation is the skill of consciousness, NOT an activity that is done to reduce stress. Practice observing without judgement. I like the app Waking up by Sam Harris for this.",

The problem with bone density is that we stop building stores for this in our early 20s, and the job then becomes maintaining that density through healthy behaviors. \n\nFor appetite - it can often improve with consistency due to your hunger hormones becoming more regular. If someone has been consistently eating and sees no improvement we would often look at ways to reduce for most meals. Some will seek treatment and be told to eat challenging meals frequently, but this will backfire often. Look at the meal experience as a whole - are you in a comfortable environment? Meals that you eat should be preferred unless you\u2019re specifically working on 1 or 2 foods to incorporate during that meal. Are there other things in life that might be worked on to help with the baseline anxiety and/or depression? Connection to others, sense of meaning, etc - these can be topics discussed with a therapist and often do come up as significant behaviors for eating so the RD might touch upon these. If you\u2019re undernourished, getting nourished is the primary goal because malnourishment will breed anxiety and often will lead to poor appetite. If that\u2019s the case, often you\u2019d want to distract yourself at meals as opposed to being mindful. Television, phone, music, etc. These can be helpful in the pursuit of nutritional restoration. \n\nOften those who struggle with ARFID lack intake of omega-3 fatty acids which can really exacerbate poor mood and anxiety.

          "body": "Good question. There's two ways people often go about life with an ED, in my opinion. \n\n1. They manage the situation and deal with it. There's distress and it's uncomfortable, but it's almost 'accepted' as \"I get this is a big obstacle in my life... but this is just me\".  \n2. They are actively working on treatment and recovery.\n\nMany people flip flop in between these two as well. The dilemma is that in treatment for ARFID the client is required to work through significant anxiety and discomfort. It doesn't feel good. There's very little reward for completing the task, and when compared to the avoidance techniques developed to cope with the issue (distraction for example) it's hard to consistently feel like you're in the place to challenge these behaviors. Doubled down by the fact that you need food to live, so there's this dichotomy muddying the water as well.   \n\n\nThe brain needs this persistence though. With ARFID the brain really needs to understand food and the sensations that come with it. I always remove the 'self' from the explanation because it's not a fault of the person that this has happened, as our behaviors are dictated significantly by experiences and observations. But it's the client's goal to start noticing the sensations that come with the experience of eating, which is technically mindfulness. The forces the brain to adapt. Eating consistently is a fairly good recommendation as well because our hunger hormones (and a lot of our biology) is rhythmic. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, yes - you would feel better not being mindful. And in many cases, this is a good route to get someone nourished. But it's not actually working on the issue as much as it is avoidance behavior as interpreted by the brain. The brain learns that distracting is the solution, as opposed to adapting to the sensations the come with food. A good approach would utilize distraction at most meals to start, and then gradually bring in a small amount of hyper mindful eating. A snack a day or a snack a week even is helpful.",

Considering that one doesn't always have a perfect mindset or perspective of a topic is an important skill in life.    \n\n\nYour logic makes sense, you'd like to ensure that you're nutritionally sound. I think that's great. But the logic is rooted in the thought that you will always be a little 'stuck in your ways' when it comes to eating. So you're looking for alternatives to 'make due', to some extent. Clients that I've worked with improve significantly - a full recovery is possible. Of course, one's perspective on foods will always be considering past experiences so it's not like they just 'forgot' about dealing with ARFID. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI dislike the idea of replacing meals with a drink. It's what I'd call an avoidance behavior, or a management behavior in certain cases. If you're REALLY struggling, a meal replacement will be preferable to not eating. But even attempting a meal is progress. During the recovery from something like ARFID, you will be physically changing the contents of your mind as you work through some of this anxiety. It's very difficult to imagine a state of recovery, so sometimes I suggest not getting tripped up in this. Trust the process. Set small realistic goals that provide a little bit of a challenge. Ideally, you want to go into food situations/trials pretty confident that you'll be able to complete whatever the task is. For example, if eating in social situations is very difficult - try specific challenges where you eat in front of close friends/family/ or as suggested above even in front of pets/animals! Every time you engage with food, and create a positive experience, the brain starts learning that the anxiety response is unnecessary. Over time, the anxiety response disappears - but it does take continued effort and persistence. People do often get stuck in avoiding the situations that make them feel uncomfortable, but that only perpetuates the problem. The brain then starts learning 'well I deal with this problem by avoiding it', and this isn't a realistic or healthy solution. You need the brain to recognize that whatever aversion it has picked up, is irrational.",

The only cooked vegetable she will eat is green beans. She eats all colors of bell peppers, cucumbers, celery, baby spinach, and lettuce but it has to be shredded. She is fine with most starches but will only eat potatoes in the form of fries from very specific places. The only sauce she will eat is alfredo. She will not touch anything that has tomatoes. So no ketchup, no pizza sauce, no spaghetti sauce. She can tell if I bought a new kind of pasta.\n\nShe has intense anxiety surrounding food. She needs to have control over what she eats. She has been like this since she was a toddler. At 12 she is better. We have a system worked out. If I am cooking something she doesn't like she is allowed to make her own dinner. She can cook and is quite the avid baker. If I am making pasta alfredo she gets pasta with alfredo sauce on top and whatever meat element on the side. For tacos she gets unseasoned ground beef, a tortilla,  a pile of cheese, a pile of shredded lettuce, and sometimes a pile of sour cream. These are all eaten separately. For spaghetti she gets plain noodles and usually adds parmesan. \n\nThis is just a general idea of her around food. Does this sound like ARFID to you?\n\nIs there anything else I can do to support her? We do buy whatever food she asks to try.",

Don\u2019t be afraid to look for those doing telehealth, it\u2019s a great option and this expands the search to anyone who is licensed in that state.",

Same with pork and beef and salmon. The other protein she eats is the occasional cocktail shrimp no sauce. For fruit she eats watermelon, grapes, specific types of apples, and mandarin oranges. The only cooked vegetable she will eat is green beans. She eats all colors of bell peppers, cucumbers, celery, baby spinach, and lettuce but it has to be shredded. She is fine with most starches but will only eat potatoes in the form of fries from very specific places. The only sauce she will eat is alfredo. She will not touch anything that has tomatoes. So no ketchup, no pizza sauce, no spaghetti sauce. She can tell if I bought a new kind of pasta.\n\nShe has intense anxiety surrounding food. She needs to have control over what she eats. She has been like this since she was a toddler. At 12 she is better. We have a system worked out. If I am cooking something she doesn't like she is allowed to make her own dinner. She can cook and is quite the avid baker. If I am making pasta alfredo she gets pasta with alfredo sauce on top and whatever meat element on the side. For tacos she gets unseasoned ground beef, a tortilla,  a pile of cheese, a pile of shredded lettuce, and sometimes a pile of sour cream. These are all eaten separately. For spaghetti she gets plain noodles and usually adds parmesan. \n\nThis is just a general idea of her around food. Does this sound like ARFID to you?\n\nIs there anything else I can do to support her? We do buy whatever food she asks to try.",

      "body": "I'm not a dietitian like u/EDRD621 but as someone who has done a lot of research into meal replacements I would say that you can definitely 'make do' with a nutritionally complete meal replacement like Soylent. Any product that is branded in that way will contain all the nutrients that are generally considered by expert organisations (e.g. the WHO or FAO) to be essential in the human diet, and will, on average, tend to be healthier than any other type of food or meal (although this may depend on the dietary context).\n\nHowever, if you are talking about living solely (100%) on meal replacements, there are important caveats that I should state here. The issues below mostly arise from the fact that meal replacements are typically based around a small (restricted) number of ingredients, and, in terms of the last one, that they are typically liquids.\n\nFirstly, it is possible that there are other nutrients which will in the future be discovered to be essential, or to improve / optimise human health, and they may not currently be included in one or many meal replacement products. Some phytonutrients are a possible example of this. There are definitely phytonutrients in essentially all meal replacements, from their plant-derived ingredients (e.g. oat flour), however there may not be as many as there are in whole foods. I would emphasise, however, that such nutrients are unlikely to be important, as many of them have already been researched in some detail. That's especially true for whether nutrients are essential. If there were more essential nutrients, we probably would've discovered that from the numerous people who actually have lived on meal replacements for months at a time. I would further note that the benefits from having an otherwise nutritionally complete diet are likely to outweigh any negatives caused from missing one or two beneficial but non-essential nutrients.\n\nAs a stronger criticism of the above, this caveat probably also applies to most modern diets, which are likely to be missing not only some beneficial nutrients, but to contain significantly insufficient quantities of some (or many) essential nutrients. You could, however, make a stronger case for a comparison to a whole foods diet which is, in fact, close to nutritionally complete, although it's my view that such diets are quite rare, even among the health-conscious.\n\nNonetheless it is entirely possible to supplement a particular non-essential nutrient or two if one has good reasons to be concerned about it, and there are meal replacement formulations out there that include such nutrients, e.g. Super Body Fuel. In the case of phytonutrients, it is not difficult to add tons of different ones using some sort of dried vegetable powder (e.g. 'Super Greens').\n\nA second caveat is probiotics, which actually seem quite important. Again, however, these are easy to add to one's diet, and some meal replacements, e.g. Huel, include them. Also again, they are not necessarily included in the average solid-food diet. Finally, chewing may be important, even for brain health. However, this issue can easily be eliminated by chewing gum, or using some solid-food meal replacements.\n\nAt the moment, I can't think of any other relevant issues, but I'll let you know if I do. I have thought about this topic quite a bit in the past.\n\nIn summary, a sceptical person may think it is safer, at our current level of knowledge, to not go on a 100% meal replacement diet, although some people have been successful with this. It also seems that the uncertainties surrounding such a diet are fairly minor, and may not even exceed the uncertainties we have about many other modern diets.\n\nApologies for the long post by the way - just wanted to make it comprehensive.",

I would further note that the benefits from having an otherwise nutritionally complete diet are likely to outweigh any negatives caused from missing one or two beneficial but non-essential nutrients.\n\nAs a stronger criticism of the above, this caveat probably also applies to most modern diets, which are likely to be missing not only some beneficial nutrients, but to contain significantly insufficient quantities of some (or many) essential nutrients. You could, however, make a stronger case for a comparison to a whole foods diet which is, in fact, close to nutritionally complete, although it's my view that such diets are quite rare, even among the health-conscious.\n\nNonetheless it is entirely possible to supplement a particular non-essential nutrient or two if one has good reasons to be concerned about it, and there are meal replacement formulations out there that include such nutrients, e.g. Super Body Fuel. In the case of phytonutrients, it is not difficult to add tons of different ones using some sort of dried vegetable powder (e.g. 'Super Greens').\n\nA second caveat is probiotics, which actually seem quite important. Again, however, these are easy to add to one's diet, and some meal replacements, e.g. Huel, include them. Also again, they are not necessarily included in the average solid-food diet. Finally, chewing may be important, even for brain health. However, this issue can easily be eliminated by chewing gum, or using some solid-food meal replacements.\n\nAt the moment, I can't think of any other relevant issues, but I'll let you know if I do. I have thought about this topic quite a bit in the past.\n\nIn summary, a sceptical person may think it is safer, at our current level of knowledge, to not go on a 100% meal replacement diet, although some people have been successful with this. It also seems that the uncertainties surrounding such a diet are fairly minor, and may not even exceed the uncertainties we have about many other modern diets.\n\nApologies for the long post by the way - just wanted to make it comprehensive.",

The issues below mostly arise from the fact that meal replacements are typically based around a small (restricted) number of ingredients, and, in terms of the last one, that they are typically liquids.\n\nFirstly, it is possible that there are other nutrients which will in the future be discovered to be essential, or to improve / optimise human health, and they may not currently be included in one or many meal replacement products. Some phytonutrients are a possible example of this.

          "body": "I'm not a dietitian like u/EDRD621 but as someone who has done a lot of research into meal replacements I would say that you can definitely 'make do' with a nutritionally complete meal replacement like Soylent. Any product that is branded in that way will contain all the nutrients that are generally considered by expert organisations (e.g. the WHO or FAO) to be essential in the human diet, and will, on average, tend to be healthier than any other type of food or meal (although this may depend on the dietary context).\n\nHowever, if you are talking about living solely (100%) on meal replacements, there are important caveats that I should state here. The issues below mostly arise from the fact that meal replacements are typically based around a small (restricted) number of ingredients, and, in terms of the last one, that they are typically liquids.\n\nFirstly, it is possible that there are other nutrients which will in the future be discovered to be essential, or to improve / optimise human health, and they may not currently be included in one or many meal replacement products. Some phytonutrients are a possible example of this. There are definitely phytonutrients in essentially all meal replacements, from their plant-derived ingredients (e.g. oat flour), however there may not be as many as there are in whole foods. I would emphasise, however, that such nutrients are unlikely to be important, as many of them have already been researched in some detail. That's especially true for whether nutrients are essential. If there were more essential nutrients, we probably would've discovered that from the numerous people who actually have lived on meal replacements for months at a time. I would further note that the benefits from having an otherwise nutritionally complete diet are likely to outweigh any negatives caused from missing one or two beneficial but non-essential nutrients.\n\nAs a stronger criticism of the above, this caveat probably also applies to most modern diets, which are likely to be missing not only some beneficial nutrients, but to contain significantly insufficient quantities of some (or many) essential nutrients. You could, however, make a stronger case for a comparison to a whole foods diet which is, in fact, close to nutritionally complete, although it's my view that such diets are quite rare, even among the health-conscious.\n\nNonetheless it is entirely possible to supplement a particular non-essential nutrient or two if one has good reasons to be concerned about it, and there are meal replacement formulations out there that include such nutrients, e.g. Super Body Fuel. In the case of phytonutrients, it is not difficult to add tons of different ones using some sort of dried vegetable powder (e.g. 'Super Greens').\n\nA second caveat is probiotics, which actually seem quite important. Again, however, these are easy to add to one's diet, and some meal replacements, e.g. Huel, include them. Also again, they are not necessarily included in the average solid-food diet. Finally, chewing may be important, even for brain health. However, this issue can easily be eliminated by chewing gum, or using some solid-food meal replacements.\n\nAt the moment, I can't think of any other relevant issues, but I'll let you know if I do. I have thought about this topic quite a bit in the past.\n\nIn summary, a sceptical person may think it is safer, at our current level of knowledge, to not go on a 100% meal replacement diet, although some people have been successful with this. It also seems that the uncertainties surrounding such a diet are fairly minor, and may not even exceed the uncertainties we have about many other modern diets.\n\nApologies for the long post by the way - just wanted to make it comprehensive.",

Other than that you can use something like [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/) or [CompleteFoods](https://www.completefoods.co/) to try to estimate your average daily nutrient intake including meal replacements and all your other foods, and compare it to standard nutritional guidelines. It takes a fair bit of effort though, and doesn't really account for personal characteristics (e.g. how well you personally can absorb or use certain nutrients).\n\nEdit: By the way, what meal replacements are you planning to use (if you have any mind)? I would recommend double checking that they are in fact nutritionally complete, as there are some imitators, and/or products which aren't as healthy, e.g. due to having a high sugar content. You may also find [this website](https://www.blendrunner.com/) useful, which has a great database of meal replacement products.",

To name a few things, both are far higher in sugar, use worse sources of complex carbohydrates (which also increases their GI substantially), and their macronutrient ratios are also quite different. It's my understanding that they were developed to taste good and keep people functional, whereas Soylent and co. are more concerned with allowing average people to conveniently obtain optimal nutrition, and/or improve on their previous diet.\n\n> Liquid fibers aren't as effective in many cases\n\nThe fibers used come from solid, whole foods, which are also fiber sources in many typical diets. If you're referring to the fact that they are mixed with water in meal replacement drinks, that's also true of other fiber sources, e.g. porridge. I'm not sure I see how that would have any impact on efficacy.\n\n> I don't think there's enough information on phytonutrients to make a definitive judgement, it just seems better to assume they are helpful.\n\nUnderstandable, and that is why some people (and companies) include them in their meal replacements.\n\n> Seems like you've done a lot of research and have helped many people though!

          "body": "I'm not a dietitian like u/EDRD621 but as someone who has done a lot of research into meal replacements I would say that you can definitely 'make do' with a nutritionally complete meal replacement like Soylent. Any product that is branded in that way will contain all the nutrients that are generally considered by expert organisations (e.g. the WHO or FAO) to be essential in the human diet, and will, on average, tend to be healthier than any other type of food or meal (although this may depend on the dietary context).\n\nHowever, if you are talking about living solely (100%) on meal replacements, there are important caveats that I should state here. The issues below mostly arise from the fact that meal replacements are typically based around a small (restricted) number of ingredients, and, in terms of the last one, that they are typically liquids.\n\nFirstly, it is possible that there are other nutrients which will in the future be discovered to be essential, or to improve / optimise human health, and they may not currently be included in one or many meal replacement products. Some phytonutrients are a possible example of this. There are definitely phytonutrients in essentially all meal replacements, from their plant-derived ingredients (e.g. oat flour), however there may not be as many as there are in whole foods. I would emphasise, however, that such nutrients are unlikely to be important, as many of them have already been researched in some detail. That's especially true for whether nutrients are essential. If there were more essential nutrients, we probably would've discovered that from the numerous people who actually have lived on meal replacements for months at a time. I would further note that the benefits from having an otherwise nutritionally complete diet are likely to outweigh any negatives caused from missing one or two beneficial but non-essential nutrients.\n\nAs a stronger criticism of the above, this caveat probably also applies to most modern diets, which are likely to be missing not only some beneficial nutrients, but to contain significantly insufficient quantities of some (or many) essential nutrients. You could, however, make a stronger case for a comparison to a whole foods diet which is, in fact, close to nutritionally complete, although it's my view that such diets are quite rare, even among the health-conscious.\n\nNonetheless it is entirely possible to supplement a particular non-essential nutrient or two if one has good reasons to be concerned about it, and there are meal replacement formulations out there that include such nutrients, e.g. Super Body Fuel. In the case of phytonutrients, it is not difficult to add tons of different ones using some sort of dried vegetable powder (e.g. 'Super Greens').\n\nA second caveat is probiotics, which actually seem quite important. Again, however, these are easy to add to one's diet, and some meal replacements, e.g. Huel, include them. Also again, they are not necessarily included in the average solid-food diet. Finally, chewing may be important, even for brain health. However, this issue can easily be eliminated by chewing gum, or using some solid-food meal replacements.\n\nAt the moment, I can't think of any other relevant issues, but I'll let you know if I do. I have thought about this topic quite a bit in the past.\n\nIn summary, a sceptical person may think it is safer, at our current level of knowledge, to not go on a 100% meal replacement diet, although some people have been successful with this. It also seems that the uncertainties surrounding such a diet are fairly minor, and may not even exceed the uncertainties we have about many other modern diets.\n\nApologies for the long post by the way - just wanted to make it comprehensive.",

But my family is saying that it's not a healthy mindset because its a cop out, it causes even more \"abnormal\" eating habits, and doesn't solve the actual problem of not eating food in public places. They say that it might end up narrowing my food choices, and that eventually I would just be on that drink. But me, I'm thinking I need to live with a healthy diet before I get anemia and/or diabetes at a young age, and if this can solve it, then that's a success, Feeling comfortable in social settings by expanding my safe foods is an optional/secondary goal. Am I having a bad mindset here? Is your end goal with patients completely \"normal\" eating habits? Or is it like this sort of damage control with meal replacement drinks and supplements?",

          "body": "You strike me as very wise! Considering that one doesn't always have a perfect mindset or perspective of a topic is an important skill in life.    \n\n\nYour logic makes sense, you'd like to ensure that you're nutritionally sound. I think that's great. But the logic is rooted in the thought that you will always be a little 'stuck in your ways' when it comes to eating. So you're looking for alternatives to 'make due', to some extent. Clients that I've worked with improve significantly - a full recovery is possible. Of course, one's perspective on foods will always be considering past experiences so it's not like they just 'forgot' about dealing with ARFID. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI dislike the idea of replacing meals with a drink. It's what I'd call an avoidance behavior, or a management behavior in certain cases. If you're REALLY struggling, a meal replacement will be preferable to not eating. But even attempting a meal is progress. During the recovery from something like ARFID, you will be physically changing the contents of your mind as you work through some of this anxiety. It's very difficult to imagine a state of recovery, so sometimes I suggest not getting tripped up in this. Trust the process. Set small realistic goals that provide a little bit of a challenge. Ideally, you want to go into food situations/trials pretty confident that you'll be able to complete whatever the task is. For example, if eating in social situations is very difficult - try specific challenges where you eat in front of close friends/family/ or as suggested above even in front of pets/animals! Every time you engage with food, and create a positive experience, the brain starts learning that the anxiety response is unnecessary. Over time, the anxiety response disappears - but it does take continued effort and persistence. People do often get stuck in avoiding the situations that make them feel uncomfortable, but that only perpetuates the problem. The brain then starts learning 'well I deal with this problem by avoiding it', and this isn't a realistic or healthy solution. You need the brain to recognize that whatever aversion it has picked up, is irrational.",
