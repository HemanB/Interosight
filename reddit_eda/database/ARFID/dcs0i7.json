In a surprise to absolutely no one, I did not like it.\n\nThere were quite a few items to try, and I did taste several of them. Also, apparently there is \"good\" sushi and \"bad\" sushi (I have to take this part on faith, of course) , and she insisted this was good, so I reckon that  my due diligence requirement has been met, and I don't have to try again.\n\n(Disclaimer: I probably don't have ARFID, but I'm close enough that y'all can consider me an ally.)",
