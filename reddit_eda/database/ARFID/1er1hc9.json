  "title": "I almost starved to death in a wilderness program as a kid, and I\u2019ve had severe ARFID for 20 years because of it",
  "selftext": "When I was 16, I was sent to a wilderness program where we got stranded in a blizzard, ran out of food, and I fully EXPECTED to die from either the hypothermia or the starvation every second of every day.\n\nThe full story is here for anyone who is curious. HUGEEE TRIGGER WARNING THOUGH!!!! In addition to the physical and nutritional neglect, and being forced to survive severe weather conditions in one of the most isolated areas of the world as a kid, this also includes kidnapping and hints at CSA, as well as a few, more \u201ctame\u201d but still TW worthy themes\n\nhttps://open.substack.com/pub/survivingthetroubledteenindustry/p/whiteout-in-the-west-desert?r=2mh2r2&utm_medium=ios\n\nFor the three years after that experience, I was forced to live on just enough caloric intake to stay alive.\n\nEver since, I have had severely debilitating ARFID symptoms. At the moment, I\u2019m dry heaving from the intense and painful nausea I get instead of hunger pangs, I haven\u2019t been able to eat for 2 days straight, and the food we have available in the house makes me want to vomit at the thought of even putting half a bite of any of it into my mouth, let alone actually chewing and swallowing it.\n\nI hate this. I hate living like this. I hate that my kids don\u2019t know what a \u201cfamily meal\u201d is at ages 10 and 14 because it\u2019s so bad that I can\u2019t even force myself to eat in front of my own kids so they can experience a normal family dynamic around food. I can rarely cook without getting too disgusted to finish preparing a meal. I have a severe aversion to kitchen spaces in general. That carries over to grocery stores as well.\n\nWhy am I so physically, mentally, and emotionally incapable of doing one simple thing that is necessary to the survival of every single living thing and needs to be done multiple times a day without feeling like I\u2019d rather rip my own skin off than put food into my own mouth??\n\nI\u2019m just venting now, and I don\u2019t even remember the original purpose of this post. \n\nI just wish I could have one day where the fact that food exists and that I need it to live doesn\u2019t trigger a panic attack or meltdown.\n\n",

      "body": "I truly cannot imagine what you went through. I also suffer from ARFID, for as long as I can remember\u2014around 18 months old, according to my parents\u2014but apparently an illness with a terrible-tasting medicine (or something along those lines) was the impetus to my \u201cpicky\u201d eating. \n\nI wish I could hand you a cure, but I\u2019m still searching for one. But I really do hope you open up (to your own comfort level) to your kids about your experiences because you don\u2019t deserve to feel shame and I don\u2019t believe you need to suffer from isolation at mealtimes as long as you can sit with others as they eat. I\u2019m not always hungry, but I\u2019m happy to sit and eat with others!! (As long as it doesn\u2019t smell HORRIFICALLY strong. That can def influence my mood tbh.)\n\nI can\u2019t say I know exactly how you feel\u2014because I\u2019m not you\u2014but I absolutely know what it\u2019s like to feel ashamed and embarrassed and wildly anxious at mealtimes. I know the depression and shame that follows anyone\u2019s unnecessary comments on my eating habits. I can\u2019t be there in person for you to give you a hug. But I am rooting for you and wishing you all the best \ud83e\ude77\ud83e\ude77\ud83e\ude77",

My heart truly goes out to you because I lived with that intense aversion to food you describe, in almost all the same ways. I feel guilt not being able to eat meals with my kids too most days, or cook regularly for them. I\u2019d rather sit in the grocery store parking lot for an hour than go in and just get the physical action of buying food done. I had to unfollow recipe accounts on social media because I\u2019d be gagging and throwing up just scrolling through social media. It was horrible. Ensure plus was the only thing that got me through 1 entire year. \nI\u2019ve been healing since then though, healing what apparently caused the dysfunction and while I still deal with Arfid, I can at least tolerate the sight and smell of food now which in turn makes it easier for me to eat when I know I have to, but just don\u2019t feel the cue (it\u2019s been over a decade of not feeling the feeling most people know as hunger - I used to only know I hadn\u2019t eaten when it had gone too far and I got headaches, weakness, and lethargic) I still regularly forget to eat, but I\u2019m not vomiting to the point I can\u2019t when I try to rectify that now. \nI hope you find peace one day friend, I hope you get all the help you have available to you, and I hope it changes your life for the better.",
