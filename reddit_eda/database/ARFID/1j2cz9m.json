I was told by a close friend, that my ARFID is an insult to those who are \u201cimpoverished and starving\u201d because they would be happy to have any food offered to them. Sadly this isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve been told things like this. I\u2019ve also been made to feel like I\u2019m \u201cunappreciative of my wealth\u201d simply because I have a hard time picking out things from the grocery store. How do I politely respond to snarky remarks like this? Or does anyone have any advice about what to say? Also I\u2019m by no means \u201cwealthy\u201d.. not that that matters. Just wanted to clarify that. ",

Once it was clear there\u2019s something more to it, I started digging around to see what I could find, and found ARFID, several resources, and this community.

Invite them to read some of the information you have about ARFID, and show them that this is a legitimate eating disorder, not just picky eating on a whim. If they still don\u2019t get it, do give them some time. It took me a little while to come to terms with it, even through I now knew it wasn\u2019t something he could control.

According to her logic those with ED's, whether it is binge eating, anorexia, bulimia, etc, then she is also calling those people selfish.

In fact it made it worse because my mother couldn\u2019t understand why I didn\u2019t eat and pushed harder to get me to eat what she made, as not to waste food. We couldn\u2019t afford to cater to my \u201cpickiness\u201d. \n\nUsing your money to help with your disability is not insulting the less fortunate. Ask them, would someone getting an electric wheelchair be an insult to a poorer person only being able to afford a manual wheelchair? Is it insulting for someone to get laser eye surgery when I can barely afford glasses?",

I literally collapsed because there were no safe foods and we were there for 5 days. 5 days of no eating and being super active. Finally, they found me a cup of fruit cocktail and I ate that. It's not easy and I'd gamble that people with ARFID have a higher chance of starving than a typical person. Poor people have options still if they're resourceful.. Imagine being homeless AND having ARFID where someone hands you a sandwich you can't eat. It would just be an added challenge. It's NOT a choice.",

I promise you, ARFID isn\u2019t a wealthy privilege thing. Every person has their own journey with food. Ours just looks different from the norm and because of that people want to find fault and blame and shame us for it. \n\nIf this friend doesn\u2019t come around after you tell them off politely or otherwise, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re really a friend",
