It\u2019s just that *now* it wasn\u2019t just our word, a medical chart has demonstrated that it\u2019s impacting her health. \n\nLike, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve got ARFID too - had it my whole life.

I just know that certain textures cause like, an electric signal that triggers an instant gage reflex, and the need to throw up. \nIt\u2019s like, rejection. Not fear.  My body and brain *reject it*. Irrational shit that has no basis in logic or reason, refuses to swallow those substances.\n\nYou can\u2019t reason your way out of something that you never reasoned your way into. \n\nIt\u2019s why I\u2019ve always been a lot more sympathetic to my daughters eating than anyone else in my family.  I got it. I totally understood. \n\nBut she\u2019s got even more restrictions than I do, and she\u2019s got absolutely no hunger cues. \n\nSo her eating issues became obvious enough that the medical people could see it plotted on a graph. \n\nThus, diagnosis.",
