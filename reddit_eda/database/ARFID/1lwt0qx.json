  "selftext": "Hi I know the title is going to come across as ableist. So basically my friend only eats fast food (McDonald\u2019s, Wendy\u2019s, Taco Bell etc) and gets pissy at me when I don\u2019t want to eat wherever she wants. The thing is I have a health condition where I should not be eating things high in sodium. I don\u2019t see why it\u2019s a big deal for her to get food from one place and me from another. \n\nEdit: Thank you all for the advice. I think I should just be really blunt with her and tell her that food isn\u2019t good for me.",
