The rest do not enter my mouth in any form. \n\nI got through it and did see a little bit of a chart before the inevitable paywall. It claims I'll gain 4 pounds in the first week with their plan and hit my 8-pound goal by June. But then it also gives me a chart of which body parts I'll lose weight in, which... is not really the point.\n\nOf course I'm not actually interested in their program, I just like hitting buttons!",
