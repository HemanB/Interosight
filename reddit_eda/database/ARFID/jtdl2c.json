I learned to enjoy eating out much more after working in a restaurant and discovering that LOTS of people ask for adjustments and no-one cares (well, some chefs get a bit pissy, but the customers don't see that, lol)\n\nI dont apologise because I'm embarrassed or even sorry tbh, I just do it out of politeness, because there's always more chance of getting what I want by being nice to the staff rather than being demanding (which I'm sure you're not) \n\nNot nice that your friends feel the need to say anything. I'm not sure of the best way around that, I hope you can find a way to make them stop embarrassing you like that.",
