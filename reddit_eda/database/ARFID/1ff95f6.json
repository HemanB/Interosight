  "title": "It\u2019s not fair that it is so difficult for people with ARFID to get feeding tubes (an opinion from someone with a feeding tube)",
  "selftext": "I have a feeding tube that is partially in to treat my ARFID. But I didn\u2019t originally get it for that. It\u2019s just one of the reasons it\u2019s stayed in for over 4 years now. I have a surgical Gtube. \n\nI wish I had advice to give people so they can get one too. I am a strong believer that feeding tubes can save the life of people with ARFID. Especially people whose autism is the main source of the problem. Doctors and therapists think that therapies and treatments will fix it, if that were true no one would have autism. There is no cure for autism so I don\u2019t understand why doctors and therapists think therapies and treatments will cure ARFID in patients with autism. \n\nI wish there was a way I could advocate for people with autism related ARFID to get feeding tubes. If cancer patients can get feeding tubes to survive why do people who can no longer function due to ARFID related malnutrition not deserve proper nutrition too. Everyone should deserve the right to health and proper nutrition. \n\nAlso I think that even getting a temporary tube could be so helpful. Having a temporary tube would allow the patient to receive proper nutrition which could ease the pressure of completing treatments and therapies and possibly make recovery more likely by knowing that they don\u2019t have the pressure to force themselves to eat so they can take their time to recover. \n\nI really wish there was a way I could talk to doctors or even speak at a conference or something so that doctors can understand the benefits of people with ARFID getting feeding tubes. So often I read posts here from people who say they feel like they are dying, they are starving, and no longer know what to do. Many have tried a number of therapies and treatments to recover but many have found little or no success at all. I think that even patients that do not have autism could benefit from getting a temporary tube. I feel like recovery could be so much more successful if the stress of getting proper nutrition was eliminated so they can focus all their energy on recovery. \n\nFor my personal story. I was given a feeding tube after a failed surgery left me unable to eat, speak, or drink due to my surgeon accidentally paralyzing my vocal cords during my surgery. That put me on the fast track to get a feeding tube. And the timeline is kind of confusing but at the same time I was diagnosed with ARFID and told I would start feeds as well since at that time lab work showed that I was malnourished. For a few months after getting it I took speech therapy to regain my ability to speak and swallow but I also started seeing a cognitive behavioral therapist and an occupational therapist to help treat my ARFID. However, I was extremely lucky that those people understood that autism is not curable so because of that and another reason my gtube has stayed in. Unfortunately it took a failed surgery for me to get proper nutrition for the first time in 26 years. It should not take a failed surgery to get the proper help that I needed. \n\nNow at 30 I am doing so much better and finally living the life I\u2019ve always wanted. I went from sleeping 16 to 18 hours a day, no social life, dropped out of college for two semesters, and living in my parents basement to working almost full time, having lots of friends and being able to live alone. But why did it take a failed surgery to get here? And why is it so hard for people with ARFID to get feeding tubes to save their life? It\u2019s not fair. We like everyone else deserve life, health, and proper nutrition. \n\nTLDR: if autism is not curable why are doctors and therapists convinced people with autism related ARFID can recover with treatments and therapies? And if people with autism cannot recover why is it so hard for them to get feeding tubes to save their life even when there is documented proof that therapies have not helped? And why is it so hard for people with non autism related ARFID to get temporary tubes that could help make recovery and therapies more successful? I wish I could do something to change this as a feeding tube has saved my life. ",

I do feel like therapies can improve things sometimes but there is a point where the autism is preventing full recovery and at that point I think it should be easier for people to get feeding tubes. I don\u2019t believe someone should just be able to walk into their PCPs office and claim therapy is not working. But my other point is that getting a temporary tube which would be a nasal gastric tube and not a surgical tube could be so beneficial too. It\u2019s not as permanent and can ease the stress of getting proper nutrition and make recovery more likely.",
