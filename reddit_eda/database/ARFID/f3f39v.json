  "title": "Why do people hate picky eaters so much?",
  "selftext": "Why are they so determined to shame us for \"having the tastebuds of children\"? They act like we've insulted them personally. I'm the one with the eating disorder, I'm absolutely revolted by some of the things most people eat, yet I keep quiet about it because I'm not a fucking child. I can't control what people eat, and I won't try because I don't get to make choices for other people. So why do they try to force *us* to eat things? Their hatred is so weirdly intense. \n\nThat recent thread on r/whitepeopletwitter about onion hate is filled with condescending comments towards people who hate onions and treating us like we're mentally delayed or something for it. Well we're not the ones throwing hissy fits because someone doesn't like the same things we do. \n\nI'm lucky my disorder isn't as bad as a lot of people here (there is quite a lot on willing to eat just to avoid being shamed) but it still affects my life quite a bit. I just can't understand caring about what other people don't like to eat.\n\nAnd on the topic of onion hating - why the fuck do onion lovers always tell you you can't even taste the onions, and when you ask why they even bother adding them then, they tell you it's because it \"adds to the flavor\"? Either it has flavor, or it doesn't (and it most definitely does lol).",

      "body": "Let me see if I can draw an analogy.  I may have a near-unique perspective to answer this question.\n\nThing 1 is I don't have ARFID.  In fact, what draws me to this subreddit and similar forums is I'm the opposite.  I *love* food, and I'll eat anything.  Most of the analogies ARFID sufferers draw are lost on me.  I *would*, in fact, eat raw liver.  Have.  So I hang out here because I find it fascinating, and also because my deep knowledge of food sometimes enables me to make genuine suggestions.\n\nThing 2 is I don't like music.  It's mostly annoying noise to me.  Yes, I've tried all the genres.  Yes, that one, and that one too.  I just don't get most of it.  And I'm nearly 50, so I've had plenty of experiences to form an opinion.\n\nIf you're like most people, you'd respond to Thing 2 with near-disbelief.  And then you might think there's something seriously wrong with me.  And then it might upset you, because I don't like your favorite singer.  It's incomprehensible to you, maybe.  *How can somebody not like this thing I like?*\n\nDo you see what I'm getting at?\n\nFood, music, and a few others are near-universal shared human experiences.  Substitute \"music\" for food in the rest of this paragraph.  If you're like me, you think about food a lot.  You invest time, money, and effort into this food thing on a bunch of levels.  When you're planning an evening, the central event involves food.  And then, when you find out there's somebody who dislikes or is indifferent to the entire subject of food, it seems weird and off-putting.  Like that person is insulting this thing you've put so much into.\n\nThis is just speculation based on personal experience.  I admit, I was stunned when I first heard of ARFID, which goes back many years before ARFID was even officially A Thing.  I felt the things you've probably all heard.  You eat like a child, you just have to try it, etc.  But I understand it better now, and I'm pretty sure there's merit to my analogy.\n\nJust my $0.02.\n\nTL;DR: I don't like music.  People tend to react toward me the same way they react toward ARFID sufferers.  If you can understand the reaction toward my indifference to music, perhaps you can understand others' reactions toward ARFID.",

I still have to get used to the advice I receive being from love and not from rudeness, but I want to try new foods most of the time now. But I still like my food very much on the plain side.\n\nThat said, I hate how picky eaters are always compared to kids. I'm twenty-one years old. Stop infantilizing me. I would never pick on you for how spicy you like your food to be or how many flavours you want your meal to have. I'm no less grown up or respectable for being satisfied with simpler foods.",

But while I certainly may have a hard time finding common ground with someone who hates music, I also wouldn't respond with the vitriol that a lot of people do towards picky eaters.

Will they feel there is a huge part of you that they aren't able to relate to? Also yes. But they shouldn't make judgements on you as a person.\n\nSo I still don't understand, because as someone who has constantly been made fun of for things such as my limited diet, I've developed empathy and I just chose to accept when people don't like the same things I like. It would be one thing, of course, if they were to directly insult the thing I like and make judgements on me for liking said thing, but that's usually not the case with picky eaters/people with ARFID when speaking of the foods we dislike. \n\nAlso, ARFID is an eating disorder and not something that's simply annoying. I have an actual phobia of certain foods, to the point that there are things I wouldn't even touch if my life depended on it. A more accurate comparison would be people responding with anger toward someone with severe sensory issues who can't physically can't handle listening to music. \n\nThanks for sharing your thoughts though, I get where you're coming from but I have to disagree for the most part.",

I asked why people hate picky eaters because that's how the majority see us. They have no idea what ARFID is nor do they care.

I\u2019ve never in my entire life had a \u201cjust try it\u201d person been truly concerned over my health or nutrition. Because if they really were, it wouldn\u2019t be about *trying* a single food (How does pestering me over some mayonnaise laden dish or dessert help btw?), it be an intervention with the goal of getting me to a doctor.\n\nAnd can\u2019t you get all the necessary nutrition from like 5 things anyway? But if I\u2019m perfectly healthy by subsisting on those 5 things people still get annoyed and then it\u2019s suddenly not about nutrition anymore but about ~variety~.\n\nI just don\u2019t get it! I\u2019m uninterested in trying food or having an arbitrary variety and that should be okay; I don\u2019t understand why that is or should be a negative thing! Why can\u2019t some people like variety and to try new things and some not? Why is it an ideal forced on everyone that goes completely unexamined??",

But while I certainly may have a hard time finding common ground with someone who hates music, I also wouldn't respond with the vitriol that a lot of people do towards picky eaters. Though I'm sure there are people who act that way towards you. \n\nThe thing is, I think people who judge you for not liking music are idiots as well. Is it hard to understand? Yes, maybe. Will they feel there is a huge part of you that they aren't able to relate to? Also yes. But they shouldn't make judgements on you as a person.\n\nSo I still don't understand, because as someone who has constantly been made fun of for things such as my limited diet, I've developed empathy and I just chose to accept when people don't like the same things I like. It would be one thing, of course, if they were to directly insult the thing I like and make judgements on me for liking said thing, but that's usually not the case with picky eaters/people with ARFID when speaking of the foods we dislike. \n\nAlso, ARFID is an eating disorder and not something that's simply annoying. I have an actual phobia of certain foods, to the point that there are things I wouldn't even touch if my life depended on it. A more accurate comparison would be people responding with anger toward someone with severe sensory issues who can't physically can't handle listening to music. \n\nThanks for sharing your thoughts though, I get where you're coming from but I have to disagree for the most part.",

In fact, what draws me to this subreddit and similar forums is I'm the opposite.  I *love* food, and I'll eat anything.  Most of the analogies ARFID sufferers draw are lost on me.  I *would*, in fact, eat raw liver.  Have.  So I hang out here because I find it fascinating, and also because my deep knowledge of food sometimes enables me to make genuine suggestions.\n\nThing 2 is I don't like music.  It's mostly annoying noise to me.  Yes, I've tried all the genres.  Yes, that one, and that one too.  I just don't get most of it.

It's incomprehensible to you, maybe.  *How can somebody not like this thing I like?*\n\nDo you see what I'm getting at?\n\nFood, music, and a few others are near-universal shared human experiences.

And then, when you find out there's somebody who dislikes or is indifferent to the entire subject of food, it seems weird and off-putting.  Like that person is insulting this thing you've put so much into.\n\nThis is just speculation based on personal experience.  I admit, I was stunned when I first heard of ARFID, which goes back many years before ARFID was even officially A Thing.  I felt the things you've probably all heard.  You eat like a child, you just have to try it, etc.  But I understand it better now, and I'm pretty sure there's merit to my analogy.\n\nJust my $0.02.\n\nTL;DR: I don't like music.  People tend to react toward me the same way they react toward ARFID sufferers.  If you can understand the reaction toward my indifference to music, perhaps you can understand others' reactions toward ARFID.",

Like that person is insulting this thing you've put so much into.\n\nThis is just speculation based on personal experience.  I admit, I was stunned when I first heard of ARFID, which goes back many years before ARFID was even officially A Thing.  I felt the things you've probably all heard.  You eat like a child, you just have to try it, etc.  But I understand it better now, and I'm pretty sure there's merit to my analogy.\n\nJust my $0.02.\n\nTL;DR: I don't like music.  People tend to react toward me the same way they react toward ARFID sufferers.  If you can understand the reaction toward my indifference to music, perhaps you can understand others' reactions toward ARFID.",

It's just that the vast majority of 'genres' of food are off the table, while the foods that are safe can still be enjoyable.\n\nAlthough there are definitly people with ARFID who have problems with food in general, so there's not like there's no equivelent to not liking music at all in the food world.\n\n> It's mostly annoying noise to me.\n\nYou say mostly, so maybe there are some genres better than others? Or some individual songs that are good? Or is no music always preferable, and some songs are just more tolerable than others? You should look up [musical anhedonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_anhedonia) if you haven't.\n\nYour analogy's spot on by the way.",
