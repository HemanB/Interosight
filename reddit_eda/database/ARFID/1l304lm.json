  "selftext": "So a bit of background, I (16n) was sent to stay with my grandmother for a week against my will and I kid you not, on the very first day this conversation happened.\nHer: \u201cSo (birthname) do you plan on ever getting over your food thing?\u201d\nMe: \u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s complicated. There\u2019s two main problems I get from it, which is the restrictive diet and then the general lack of interest in eating and trouble processing/ignoring hunger signals. I don\u2019t really want to do the treatment for my diet because it seems long and painful and I\u2019m pretty stable with that right now always\u2014the problem is really regularly not eating three meals a day, or eating three very small meals a day. That\u2019s the part I need to worry about.\u201d\nHer: \u201cOkay\u2026you know I struggled with picky eating when I was a kid once too...\u201d\nMe: *sits in uncomfortable silence while she explains something that is not at all the issue I have*\nMe: \u201cI mean I might consider getting treatment someday but right now I just have so much going on that I just couldn\u2019t handle it.\u201d\nHer: \u201cThat\u2019s fair. So you might someday?\u201d\nMe: \u201cYep.\u201d\nHer: \u201cThat\u2019s good. So you know this affects the people around you too right?\u201d\nMe: *instantly flabbergasted*\nHer: \u201cYou know it\u2019s like the same thing with drug addicts.\u201d\nMe: *thoroughly and utterly flabbergasted* She is not\u2026\nHer: \u201cThey think, \u2018well it\u2019s my body it\u2019s my choice and I can put drugs into it if I want to\u2019. And they don\u2019t ever think about how it affects those people that care about them.\u201d\nMe: *speechless* How is my eating disorder at all relevant to that?\nHer: \u201cTake my cousin for instance. He struggled with drug addiction for a really long time and (something in here I don\u2019t entirely remember what) What about his parents? What about the money they spent on treatment? What about the PRAYERS they spent on him? What about the love they had for him?\u201d\nMe: *Too mortified to try forming a coherent argument* How- how does ANY of that apply to me?\n\nWe rode home in silence, and now I know what it\u2019s like to have my eating disorder directly compared to drug abuse.",

      "body": "Honestly people think it\u2019s the same because all they can see is us \u201cchoosing\u201d not to eat something, which equates us to picky children. They can\u2019t feel the things we feel, or hear the thoughts, or experience the mental and physical sensations we experience. All they see is a person not eating the meal they lovingly made, or not going to dinner with them, or even perhaps embarrassing them in a social situation. \n\nIt sucks, especially the last one - but they just don\u2019t and can\u2019t get it. The one reason I decided to pursue some sort of treatment was because of a post in the AITAH sub from a chef who was embarrassed by her boyfriend being a \u201cpicky eater,\u201d and at first I was mad on his behalf. But hearing the story only from her perspective made me think. She didn\u2019t say he had ARFID specifically, and as far as boyfriends go he was being a little ridiculous from her context, but in their situation she kind of had a right to be embarrassed?\n\nAnd I was suddenly struck by the thought that I never wanted to be that person. I don\u2019t want to be unable to eat a lovingly prepared meal because someone happened to forget to ask - or didn\u2019t know to ask - for a list of \u201csafe foods\u201d or if I had specific or odd aversions. I dunno about y\u2019all but \u201cAre you allergic to anything or have dietary restrictions?\u201d is always way too broad a question for ME. Technically the answer is no, sure - but how do I spout off all the things that make my skin crawl if I put them in my mouth?? Or the ones that trigger a gag reflex? How do I explain that if eggs are store bought they\u2019re fine but if they came from someone\u2019s backyard from pet chickens my brain refuses to accept them as food?!\n\nThe simple explanation is, I can\u2019t. So I don\u2019t. And sometimes it\u2019s fine, but sometimes I end up fighting for my life trying not to offend or embarrass someone I care about. So that\u2019s what I focused on in treatment\u2026tamping down the visceral reactions to foods that trigger me so that I can go about a meal without feeling like the world is about to end. I just wanted to be able to realize a food wasn\u2019t trying to kill me - or whatever tf my body thinks is happening. \n\nAnyway, thinking about it like that is what helped me. And all of that to say, it\u2019s the WAY your grandmother said what she did that\u2019s the problem here. Eating disorders ARE hard on the people who love us, but not understanding what\u2019s actually happening is part of the problem. If you\u2019re offended and need to keep away from her then that\u2019s entirely valid. But it also might be a good time to sit and try to tell her how YOU feel. We don\u2019t choose to be this way. Some people can finally come to terms with that, and some can\u2019t. See which one she is first.",

      "body": "I love my husband very much. He has struggled with both alcoholism and ARFID. Thankfully, he has been able to overcome alcoholism and has been sober for many years now. He can\u2019t really make any progress on ARFID. It\u2019s much more difficult for him. \n\nThere are certainly many similarities but the main one is denial. For both conditions, denial is the first and biggest challenge. You must admit there\u2019s an actual problem before you can start to heal. It\u2019s difficult, because helping someone realize their behavior is harmful, means you have to *tell them* how it\u2019s impacting everyone. It\u2019s really hard to tell people these things. And it\u2019s even harder to hear. These are always going to be very difficult and uncomfortable conversations. But necessary. \n\nMy husband convinces himself that he\u2019s \u2018stable\u2019 because he ignores or minimizes any evidence to the contrary. He sets up his day everyday so that he never has to confront his disordered eating. Then something unexpected will happen -because life happens-and suddenly the ED will be painfully obvious and he\u2019ll spiral into self loathing. But, he\u2019ll easily default to his same habits that allow him to avoid food and within a day or 2 he\u2019s back to convinced that he\u2019s \u2018stable.\u2019 He convinces himself that the food itself is the problem, not his emotions about the food and his inability and unwillingness to learn to manage those emotions. The coworkers and customers that worry about his low weight and awkwardly ask if he\u2019s sick and dying\u2026those people are just incredibly rude. Can\u2019t be a sign that he needs help. He just happens to know a lot of really rude people, that all act in the same rude way. Coincidentally. \n\nSame way he convinced himself that drinking 12+ beers every single night and being drunk before noon every weekend was \u201cfunctional\u201d and didn\u2019t impact our family at all.  He literally compared it to other dads that go golfing or fishing. As if his drinking was just a unique type of hobby and therefore can\u2019t be a legitimate problem. Because really the problem is me. I should stop nagging him about his \u201chobby\u201d and stop being sad all the time (from the emotional and verbal abuse he issued while drunk but could never remember the next day). Deflection. Minimizing. Ignoring. Rationalizing. All effective ways to maintain denial and therefore never have to do anything about the problem. Not because he\u2019s some worthless, heartless monster. But because he had a condition that took him over and controlled him. And made him think there was no other way, no escape. \n\nI understand you\u2019re offended, anybody would be. Nobody wants to be compared to a drug addict. But if someone feels the need to have this sort of conversation, understand that they are trying to help you. Try to be curious and open to hearing her concerns. A very limited diet can have serious medical consequences that can be lifelong and irreversible. Your grandma loves you and wants you to be healthy and happy. I promise.",
