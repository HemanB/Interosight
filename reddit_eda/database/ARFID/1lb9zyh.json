I am white, grew up in New York(not the city), and was raised on a very red meat and potatoes kinda diet. My favorite food when I was a child was spinach and I\u2019ve always hated meat. Luckily for me, I have a medical condition and can\u2019t eat cooked meat; raw fish is okay though. I was introduced to Indian food when I was in high school bc my boyfriend at the time had parents heavily involved in an Indian religion (I can\u2019t remember the name. It was yoga something) Then over the years I explored lots of different Asian cuisines with my grandmother and found so many of my favorite foods. It really does bother me though that ARFID is very much presented as a disorder that only people in the US and UK have and has caused it to become very white washed in the assumption of what people\u2019s safe foods are (pizza, plain pasta, chicken nuggets, etc) I hope this all makes sense \ud83d\ude05 I\u2019m quite brain foggy at the moment and my keyboard is bilingual and keeps autocorrecting me in Spanish making it hard to keep my thoughts together haha.",

I definitely feel you with the chronic illness cooking dilema. I'd say one of the best things I did to help make cooking easier was having an instant pot and Thermomix. With the instant pot, it was great to put in frozen chicken and season it and have it done usually in under 30 minutes. The thermomix is perfect for more complex meals as it can do most of the functions for you like chopping/shredding and even cooking while stirring ingredients. It's definitely a huge investment, but it saved us so much money over eating fast food constantly.",
