      "body": "I\u2019m 57 and have had many years to add things to my safe foods even though I only learned about ARFID this year. It is always interesting to see how different peoples safe foods are. I still think of myself as \u201cmost unique super duper pickiest person in the universe\u201d. I hadn\u2019t written down a safe food list in many, many years. Sometime in the last week or two I did a safe food list on a thread here and was shocked at how few things had \u201cspecific brand, cooked only one exact way, only if I\u2019m in right mood, changes frequently over a couple hours\u201d. My safe food list in ~2004 almost every one of the 15-20 items had that next to it. \n\nI prefer grape tomatoes cut exactly in half to cherry tomatoes as cherry are a little too big for my mouth. I can eat cherry cut into fourths and regular tomatoes if that\u2019s what\u2019s available.\n\nSalad is fairly new safe food. It was a rare thing for me to eat until some time in my mid/late 30s. Prior to that I\u2019d occasionally pick out the tomatoes and cucumbers if they didn\u2019t have dressing and eat them plain. I had a low blood pressure problem in my mid-20s/early-30s and doctors insisted I eat more salt which is when I forced myself to add salt to things I used to prefer plain. Now I prefer with salt or Italian dressing (able to eat most brands)\n\nI cut all gristle and fat off my steak as well as any meat touching them. So I understand why you don\u2019t like it. I prefer to get lean cuts and cook on grill or under broiler so less greasy. I\u2019ve been known to pat with paper towels to degrease. LOL\n\nFor mashed foods they must be perfectly mashed, no lumps. Same with gravy, no lumps. I don\u2019t actually like potatoes much but I love my homemade super duper too much garlic mashed potatoes with gravy or sour cream - the potatoes are simply an acceptable delivery for those. Like one thin layer of potatoes and 2x of gravy, eat with spoon. \ud83e\udd23\n\nOne of the cooking tricks that has helped increase the number of safe foods for me is to use tons of seasoning to drown out taste of foods I don\u2019t care for. I didn\u2019t realize that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done for most of my life until I heard about ARFID and was reading various ways people use to make an unsafe food safe and a lightbulb went off. In many cases where a recipe calls for a teaspoon of this, a 1/2 teaspoon of that, I multiple each by 4. Recipe calls for 4 garlic cloves I use a head of garlic. I don\u2019t automatically increase as above. Each time I cook something I increase a little until it smells and taste right. I cook based on smell because I\u2019m not eating food that is gross and then not able to eat dinner. Plus since I cooked different food for my family than I did for me I had to learn how to know it was right as no way was I getting it anywhere near my mouth. \n\nProcessed food is reliable. Always same shape, texture, smell, taste. Many of us with ARFID are wedded to specific brands or restaurants because it exactly the same every time.\n\nBeing able to cook is probably going to help you a lot in increasing your safe foods over time. Especially since you are able to cook foods you won\u2019t eat. It has for a number of us. \n\nIt can be difficult to say ewwww gross respectfully - your doing a great job of that. I commend you.",

So its inclusion seems meant either as a defensive slap to the face (\u201cHow dare you suggest I haven\u2019t tried tofu\u2014I was born in Korea!\u201d) or possibly a brag (\u201cI\u2019m too cultured to be ignorant of tofu, you silly tofu neophyte\u201d). \n\nLaughing at someone who\u2019s trying to help you, specifically for asking you a question they couldn\u2019t have known the answer to without you telling them, is pretty arrogant and rude. The implication is basically: \u201cOMG you\u2019re an idiot for not knowing this already\u201d and/or \u201cYou\u2019re wasting my time.\u201d \n\nThe arrogance comes from the assumption that everyone, even strangers on the internet, should automatically know details of your personal life/identity\u2014you are *that* important. (And they should\u2019ve already read your TMZ bio? I don\u2019t know the logic there, LMAO. \ud83d\ude06).\n\n\u201cLMAO\u201d can also be interpreted as more aggressively laughing *at* someone than \u201cLOL\u201d, as you might have picked up on from my use of it above. I wouldn\u2019t normally use LMAO in this context for that reason.\n\nThe arrogance part could be more in line with your youth than anything else. My 7 year old frequently thinks people are dumb for not reading his mind, because he still lacks theory of mind. I\u2019m not equating you to him; we all experience lapses/misapplications of cognitive skills at times. But theory of mind does seem to be more consistently applied with age and experience.\n\nHope that helps lmao. (I kid, I kid).",

Greek yogurt is also my go-to for protein. I eat it by itself or in smoothies. The nice thing is you can go as uniform with consistency as you want with smoothies\u2014just juice and yogurt is perfectly fine. Soft/extra soft tofu can be added if you need even more of a protein boost.",

Genuinely thanks for the suggestions but I can\u2019t do most mushy foods/thick liquids, even when they\u2019re uniform in texture. So far, the only sources of protein I can consistently eat are some types of seafood (like shrimp and scallops) and fried eggs, which don\u2019t actually have that much protein but it\u2019s enough to sustain me ig",
