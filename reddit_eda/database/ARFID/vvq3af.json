  "selftext": "I'm honestly really pissed.\n\nThe idea that only children are picky eaters and that ARFID symptoms are somehow \"childish\" is not only blatantly false, but actively *harmful*. I can't even count the number of times I've seen people with ARFID be told to \"grow up\" and being mocked for suffering a legitimate and serious *eating disorder,* all because people have it in their heads that it's a children's thing. These kinds of ideas are why ARFID flew under the radar in the medical community for years until it was finally recognized as a disorder in 2013. And why, even today, ARFID is so underprioritized compared to other eating disorders. People have possibly *died* due to these effects.\n\nWhile it's not the kind of thing anyone should be banned over, Reddit should be paying attention to the kind of users and communities who spout these harmful, unscientific statements.\n\nI was banned mere minutes after putting in the report. Permanent suspension on that account. No prior warnings, no reaching out for clarification. I doubt they really read it through or put any thought into it.\n\nI submitted an appeal, but the character limits on those appeals are pathetically small so I couldn't even entirely express what I stated in my first paragraph.\n\nAnd it'd be one thing if they just didn't take the reports seriously, but they straight up banned me on first offense. Way to discourage *anyone* from reporting *any* hateful content on the site, threatening to ban them if you don't agree it's hateful.\n\nReddit, do better. Listen to disabled voices.",

It isn't called \"nature's candy\" for nothing. It's extremely sweet, so it's one of the only fruits I eat since the taste covers up the texture for me.
