He listened pretty well, which is\u2026 not as common as one might hope with specialists, especially. \n\nAnyway, we were talking about colonoscopy prep (as one does), and I mentioned that I wasn\u2019t sure whether I\u2019d be able to drink the prep liquid due to my flavour and texture issues. To which he said, \u201cwell, it\u2019s a liquid, it doesn\u2019t have a texture\u201d. I was just like\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, WHAT? \n\nI explained that water is a different texture from plain milk is a different texture from chocolate milk is a different texture from protein shakes\u2026. He seemed to kind of take my word for it \ud83d\ude05\n\nBut, like. So many things are liquid? Oil is not the same texture as water? Smoothies are still kinda liquid and they\u2019re Very different?? \n\nI am Confused by the normies \ud83d\ude05",
