  "selftext": "My (26m) entire life I\u2019ve just lived off of processed junk. I\u2019m like 5\u201910 and only weigh 140 on a good day. Never had a good relationship with eating, like not only do I eat nothing but shit (cookies, chips, etc.), but I also just hate eating. It feels like a chore and I don\u2019t even really feel hunger anymore, which I\u2019m assuming I am like 24/7.\n\nMy day to day is basically just Oreos and milk a couple times a day, Doritos for lunch, sometimes other salty snacks throughout the day. Occasionally ill drink a mass gainer, but I can never be consistent with it. I fucking hate every bit of it. From going to the grocery store and loading a basket up with this shit every week and people making jokes about it, to going to drive thrus and just ordering fries and having to hear the \u201cthat\u2019s all?\u201d I dread going out to eat with people because it feels like everyone\u2019s judging me. I hated being dragged to restaurants when I was younger because I just feel alienated watching everybody eat while the entire fucking menu is unpalatable to me. I at least feel comfortable around friends, but my family just doesn\u2019t get it and never offer anything constructive, and everything they say is criticizing me. \n\n\nI\u2019ve been to four therapists at this point, and it\u2019s helped me the square root of fuck all. Finally found a program that may be able to help, but it\u2019s a 6 month wait and I\u2019m kinda gatekept by needing a primary care physician in their hospital to be eligible for it, which I can do, but it\u2019s an additional step. Did I also mention I\u2019m petrified of hospitals? I can deal with it for a doctors appointment, but this is definitely gonna land me in the hospital at some point at this rate, and that just fuels my anxiety. I\u2019ve never had blood drawn, and I already know if they need to for this program I\u2019m gonna bail. I want to get better and finally feel like I\u2019m gonna have the drive to do it this time, but I feel like there\u2019s always some shit that\u2019s gonna come up. Anxiety has been taking over my life lately.\n\nTrauma dump over, thanks for reading this far.",

      "body": "It would be awesome to just push a button and my body would have everything it needs to function properly. I'm 22 and I too mostly just eat junk food. If you don't really get hungry, you could ask your doctor to prescribe you something. I can only eat grilled cheese and frozen pizzas everyday and I hate it too. Because I really want to be able to eat other foods but I can't. \n\nAt least right now I can't eat new foods but here soon I'm going to be in an intensive outpatient program. Because I need to really gain weight and get the vitamins and minerals my body needs. When someone in my family takes the rest of the family to restaurants I know how you feel. I never eat anything when I'm at a restaurant because I know there is nothing I like. But my sister always tells me to try something. \n\nSo I usually get chicken or pizza but most of the time I don't like, so I feel bad about ordering it. Because it cost them money for me to try it and almost all the time I don't like it. The only restaurants I like are McDonald's, KFC, Papa John's, and Little Caesars. And I only like a few things from each. For McDonald's only fries, ice cream, and their water, it is the only water I can drink.\n\n For Papa John's pizza and Little Caesars bread sticks. And for KFC mashed potatoes and popcorn chicken and I also like their chicken like the big pieces but haven't eaten that in so many years. My family doesn't understand either about my eating disorder. One of my sister's tells me to just try new foods but it's harder then she thinks it is. And I haven't told most of my family because I know they will say the same things my sister does. My mom, dad, and one of my brothers knows I need help and don't really/not at all tell me that I need to try new foods.\n\nThat sounds horrible having to go to 4 different therapists and get like no where. I know somewhat how that feels but not with therapists but with surgeons and my insurance company. It probably feels like you are getting no where after years of trying. Because that's how it feels for me. It's great that you found a program to help you.\n\n But it sounds like you won't be happy in that program because it seems like it is an inpatient program. And you said you don't like hospitals but if it helps then that's awesome. I don't know if this would be better or not for you but have you heard of an intensive outpatient program? That is the kind of program I'm gonna do because it works for me. I don't want to be like locked in a place I don't know and I don't want to be away from home. I hope the program helps you when you can get in it.",

I found out about an antidepressant called Remeron that supposedly helps increase hunger and my dr let me try it. It has helped me so so much with hunger and bc of that, I feel more inclined to eat things that I\u2019m not as excited about. I also did a residential program which helped me a lot and its not a hospital setting! The only thing is you are living in a home but after residential I did PHP. Its like residential except you dont live there",
