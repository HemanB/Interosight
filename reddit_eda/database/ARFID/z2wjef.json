Each year I\u2019m left with an empty plate while my relatives feast. There\u2019s no point in me being there as we don\u2019t even give thanks at the table. I hate it. All it does is ostracize me and make me anxious. Does anyone else absolutely dread thanksgiving?",

His dad tries to get me to eat new foods, not sure if he's teasing me or genuinely trying, because sometimes he's really pushy and sometimes he's not, but he always has mac and cheese at his house for me. So, he's at least supportive in that way. \n\nBut the teasing does bother me, especially when he does it in front of other people. My husband's brother and sister have said something once or twice, but I feel the most pressure from his dad. \n\nI married into a foodie family, so that was my first mistake.",
