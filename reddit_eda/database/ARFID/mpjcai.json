One frequent punishment was going to bed immediately after supper and not read or play with toys while my friends and brothers played right outside of my window while I cried in bed. Thanks for reading my rant because I\u2019m crying while I type this and it\u2019s probably cathartic. Oh, I\u2019m 63 years old.",

      "body": "*hugs* I'm so sorry that's caused you so much pain. I know what you mean about \"won't\" vs \"can't.\" Red and green peppers smell amazing, but I just can't handle the crunch. I know I used to like fresh tomatoes, I have distinct memories of the delicious flavors of toast and tomato sandwiches, but after a bad one I still can't tolerate them. So much food smells delicious at Asian restaurants, but I'm afraid to try so much of it because it might be too spicy or full of crunchy vegetables.\n\nI'm in an odd position where my ARFID has improved over time, and I'm able to eat a lot more foods than I could when younger. I have a friend (also has ARFID) who I met since my ARFID improved, and I don't think he believes me that until relatively recently, my diet was almost identical to his - beige foods, not much else. At least most people don't see me as \"picky\" anymore? I still feel pretty restricted on what I'm able to eat, though.",
