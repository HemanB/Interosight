  "selftext": "I\u2019m not diagnosed but textbook arfid sufferer since early childhood. I have about 10 safe foods. I cope fairly well in day to day life but since I started working (commercial law) I have found that eating (or not eating more specifically) in professional contexts is causing issues for me. \n\nUsually the problem is that there\u2019s a selection of food for an event, meeting etc and I can\u2019t/don\u2019t want to eat any of. Usually generic salads and sandwiches. I don\u2019t do sauce as one of my big rules, and generally eat simple, which kind of kills a lot of stereotypical lunch options. It isn\u2019t possible to not eat without being noticed and whether I do or don\u2019t broach the subject, and whether I go into detail or keep it light hearted, ultimately I feel self conscious, awkward and embarrassed.\n\nI fear that this condition will genuinely impact my career if it hasn\u2019t already, I find myself skipping work lunches and events that involve food, accordingly missing out on networking and other professional development opportunities. I don\u2019t even like to attend the office because I end up eating my lunch alone as I don\u2019t want any judgements or comments on what I eat. I wish it was as simple as saying I have an intolerance to this or that - most people straight up don\u2019t understand or don\u2019t care to understand what it\u2019s like. Ughhhh. Any advice please! ",

      "body": "Hey, I work in a corporate environment and used to travel frequently for work. This frequently involved nights out with clients at restaurants and the like.\n\nRaise this with your HR. You have a medical condition that impacts the food you can eat; provide HR with a small list of safe foods and advise them that you'll be happy to work around this where possible if your restrictions are too severe. \n\nFor your coworkers - I promise you, all you need to do is say it's because of a medical condition. If they pry, say you'd rather not go into it. If they get arsey about it, go to HR - this is also why we tell HR about these things.\n\nWith my ARFID, I can get away with having chips, pizza, and chicken in most forms. This allows me a lot of leeway over nights out. That being said, I have ended up at restaurants where I haven't been able to eat what's offered, and conferences where my needs weren't communicated. Often the wait staff will be able to accommodate you with small requests so that you can still participate in the night (e.g. bread rolls, drinks, the like), and in a corporate environment, you can get away with \"oh, it's this medical thing, it's no problem - I wish I could enjoy it like you do!\" and then direct the conversation away from your food. \n\nYou can do this. The people in your office will get used to you. They have to get used to Kathy having the most god awful eggy fishy salad every day and John eating with his mouth open; they can easily tolerate you having the same possibly odd lunch every day.",

Don't mind me.\"\n\nI will say that my coworkers never said anything outright about my eating habits, but the more I avoided, the weirder it felt. Just bring your lunch and say you prefer what you packed. You're prepared, professional, and fed: which is enough. It would not be wrong to talk to someone you trust and say that you don't eat offered food, you bring your own. Most people aren't going to expect you to waste what you brought to accommodate their emotions.

(And since you have a corporate job you probably have good health insurance\u2014yay!!!)\n\nThere are many ways to accommodate ARFID and I have had to use all of them to at some point or another. If lunches etc are ordered by an admin your best bet is to find out who that is and talk to him or her about your medical condition. You need not mention what it is\u2014and in a corporate setting I would absolutely not give any more info than is absolutely necessary. Usually it\u2019s easier to ask to see the catering menu that they order from than to suggest things. And if it\u2019s on-site, it\u2019s fine to bring your own meal. Off-site is more problematic\u2014but easier to control the food. You can literally call them and say you are with xyz party coming for the mtg on such and such a date.

I'm so used to it at this point.\n\nThey ask questions because they genuinely don't know. Most people don't know about ARFID and most will just consider you picky and be curious. You need to own it. That is the ONLY option that won't leave you feeling self conscious while other people scratch their heads and wonder what is up with you.\n\nI'm lucky that in my career, I am in a close knit mgmt team. We have all been here for years and they know \"ask her because she's the one who eats pretty much nothing\" when figuring out what to eat for a lunch meeting. I don't like being the one to always pick so sometimes I'll just eat before, and that's OK. They know about my ARFID and don't care. They're just hungry, they're not worried about me and what I'm doing.\n\nFor bigger meetings/conferences with people I don't know? I will always hate the options. This one I'm going to has a \"I'll bring my own lunch\" option, and I remember there being food places nearby. I could just buy my own food and eat with everyone else, or I will just eat before and confidently tell everyone \"I'm good\" if they ask if I'm going to eat or if I'm hungry. I've also noticed that people judge way more if they think you're just \"picky\".. if you actually tell them you have a disorder you can't control, they will be far more understanding. You can just say \"sensory processing disorder\" if you dont want to get too into it. If you REALLY don't want to say anything about it, just say you're on a macro diet or something weird lol. My coworker is doing some points diet and she never eats with us and no one questions it, because diets/weight loss efforts are seen as admirable. The \"picky eater\" can just sound immature.. So that's why I tell people it's a real disorder and I say it lighthearted like \"yeah I got some issues lol, I've always been like this\" or try to explain it like \"someone telling me to eat this egg would be like if I handed you a stapler and told you to eat it. It doesn't compute. My brain doesn't consider it edible\". Sometimes I tell them all the things I've never eaten and they're amazed, and sometimes I share stories like \"I literally only ate canteloupe the first 4 years of my life\". \ud83d\ude02When you're in on the joke and can make fun of yourself, you take the power away from others to find you \"weird\" or talk about you. Own it! People can sense when someone is self conscious or ashamed and that's when they focus on it more. When you're not, they don't even think about it.\n\nI used to be soo weird about it and it would cause me so much stress. Stressing wont suddenly make me normal, though. It solves nothing. This is just the way I am and have always been. Think about this.. We have spent our whole lives being around people who eat things we consider gross (unsafe).. Are you judging or making fun of people for eating those things? Probably not.",

          "body": "Ha! I was literally just choosing a meal option for a work conference where it's all weird shit I would never eat, lol. I'm so used to it at this point.\n\nThey ask questions because they genuinely don't know. Most people don't know about ARFID and most will just consider you picky and be curious. You need to own it. That is the ONLY option that won't leave you feeling self conscious while other people scratch their heads and wonder what is up with you.\n\nI'm lucky that in my career, I am in a close knit mgmt team. We have all been here for years and they know \"ask her because she's the one who eats pretty much nothing\" when figuring out what to eat for a lunch meeting. I don't like being the one to always pick so sometimes I'll just eat before, and that's OK. They know about my ARFID and don't care. They're just hungry, they're not worried about me and what I'm doing.\n\nFor bigger meetings/conferences with people I don't know? I will always hate the options. This one I'm going to has a \"I'll bring my own lunch\" option, and I remember there being food places nearby. I could just buy my own food and eat with everyone else, or I will just eat before and confidently tell everyone \"I'm good\" if they ask if I'm going to eat or if I'm hungry. I've also noticed that people judge way more if they think you're just \"picky\".. if you actually tell them you have a disorder you can't control, they will be far more understanding. You can just say \"sensory processing disorder\" if you dont want to get too into it. If you REALLY don't want to say anything about it, just say you're on a macro diet or something weird lol. My coworker is doing some points diet and she never eats with us and no one questions it, because diets/weight loss efforts are seen as admirable. The \"picky eater\" can just sound immature.. So that's why I tell people it's a real disorder and I say it lighthearted like \"yeah I got some issues lol, I've always been like this\" or try to explain it like \"someone telling me to eat this egg would be like if I handed you a stapler and told you to eat it. It doesn't compute. My brain doesn't consider it edible\". Sometimes I tell them all the things I've never eaten and they're amazed, and sometimes I share stories like \"I literally only ate canteloupe the first 4 years of my life\". \ud83d\ude02When you're in on the joke and can make fun of yourself, you take the power away from others to find you \"weird\" or talk about you. Own it! People can sense when someone is self conscious or ashamed and that's when they focus on it more. When you're not, they don't even think about it.\n\nI used to be soo weird about it and it would cause me so much stress. Stressing wont suddenly make me normal, though. It solves nothing. This is just the way I am and have always been. Think about this.. We have spent our whole lives being around people who eat things we consider gross (unsafe).. Are you judging or making fun of people for eating those things? Probably not.",
