So yes, I do understand feeling comfortable and wanting to just accept that, but (reasonably speaking) what makes us uncomfortable is usually where our weakness lies and what we should put some effort into. IMO, if you are healthy currently, it would honestly be a good time to just try a little branching out. Ideally you\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised and find some new stuff you enjoy, and long term it would absolutely be a safety net in case stuff you currently like shifts out of your favor. Don\u2019t overwhelm yourself, maybe even a goal of one new bite a month.

I didn\u2019t become brave enough to step outside my comfort zone until I became comfortable with where I was at already. Knowing I was safe to eat what I wanted and that I wouldn\u2019t be judged helped me a lot in feeling safe and treating food like a friend rather than an enemy. Pressuring yourself to try things before you\u2019re ready can just have the opposite effect: it feels bigger and scarier to try new things because you\u2019re already afraid of what you\u2019re eating day to day. Let people come to their exploration naturally.\n\nEdit: just saw OP said they\u2019re anorexic, which changes things. But honestly I think it\u2019s better for them to start eating more of what they\u2019re comfy eating rather than force themself to try new things and risk not eating enough. At a certain point you have to value caloric intake over the food pyramid.",
