  "selftext": "Does anyone else ever feel hungry but the food you have at your house or wherever you are either isn't up to your standards or just isn't what you like that week? Sometimes I even do like the food I have at my disposal but I just don't feel like putting in the effort to make it. It drives me insane that I'm basically just eating junk food and drinking protein shakes. It's not a great diet but I guess I'm alive.",
