They even deny my lifestyle because I have A/RFID and don\u2019t eat salad all day. I\u2019m trying to get better but when people laugh at you or demean you for not liking [X] food, it\u2019s a painful feeling. And I always have to specify what I eat: protein and carbs. A fuck ton of both of them. Now please be less insensitive, I\u2019m trying to seek treatment.",
