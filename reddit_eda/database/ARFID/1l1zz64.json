  "selftext": "*File this under \"I can't believe I have to make this post\"*\n\nDue to not one *but two* recent instances of users claiming to be treatment providers but acting aggressive, defensive, rude, or otherwise unprofessional towards our users, we are adding a new rule, which reads as follows:\n\n**Treatment providers who visit our community are always invited and encouraged to submit their information to the Treatment Provider Database to share about services they offer.**\n\n**Anyone claiming to be a professional who treats ARFID must submit their credentials to the mod team for review.** **Should they choose to participate in conversations, they are also expected to act professionally and ethically** ***even if comments about them are critical.***\n\nThis group must, above all else, remain a safe space for individuals with ARFID and their loved ones to brainstorm, vent, and share experience. Though we welcome advice and ideas from professionals, peer discussion *about* those professionals will not be interfered with.",
