  "selftext": "Do you ever have the cashier comment on what you're buying ? Today my cashier said I must be stocking up for the kids because I bought a few of the same item but different flavours. Normally I'd just say yea and move on but today I said they were actually for me, recommended by my dietician bc I have a lesser known eating disorder and can only tolerate certain things currently.  She then told me she's the same, avoids so many foods to keep her stomach feeling good, doesn't eat until after supper, worries about what certain foods will do to her. Im glad I spoke up. \ud83d\ude0a",
