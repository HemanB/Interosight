  "selftext": "This was yesterday. I\u2019ve been wanting to do exposure therapy with some new foods, and strawberries was top of my list. My family members eat them a lot and it made me feel kinda silly when I would replace it with chocolate or something. \n\nSo I ate one! I gagged a little bit while I did it, but I ate the whole thing! It doesn\u2019t taste that bad either!! It was a little sour but like in a good way. The seeds didn\u2019t even freak me out the way I thought they would! \n\nIdk I\u2019m just really happy about it :)",

      "body": "congrats!!! whether or not strawberries become part of your regular diet now, trying and finishing one was certainly an accomplishment. strawberries for me are a food where i quite like the flavor but can't stand the texture (see also: omelettes, sauteed onions, most nuts). my family also eats a lot of them, and i typically only partake when we can get local in-season strawberries (better and more consistent texture/flavor).\n\nsomething i recently started doing is just putting a bunch of whole strawberries in a blender with a few other ingredients (water, lemon juice, honey, cornstarch) and freezing them into healthy or \"all-natural\" popsicles. that way i can enjoy the flavor but with a much easier, and more uniform, texture. it also nullifies any of the weird or bad textures that come with out-of-season strawberries, because they're all blended up. if you liked the flavor of strawberries but not so much the texture, then i highly recommend blending them into popsicles or smoothies; it genuinely feels like eating a dessert, except it's actually somewhat healthy. \n\noh yeah also, beware of frozen strawberries!!! people without arfid will try to tell you that they taste the same as fresh ones, but *they are lying to you!!!!!* (mostly kidding, but i swear there's something *off* about frozen strawberries and nobody seems to believe me)\n\nsorry for the rant; i've just also been excited about strawberries lately because i found a way to more reliably eat them. again, i'm so glad for you that you were able to work up the courage to try one, and i hope that this can potentially lead to more opportunities to try things or even a new safe food (and like i said, even if it doesn't, trying it at all is a huge win on its own). this stranger on reddit is proud of you :)",

I think she managed to eat one but I'm sure he had no idea what it took her. The camera pressure probably helped a lot.\n\nAnyway, glad to hear this as someone's who has never eaten one. They have tons of vitamin c which is good for everything and hard to find in other foods.",
