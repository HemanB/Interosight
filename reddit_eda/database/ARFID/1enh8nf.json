  "selftext": "Does anyone here ever wish they could just try new foods like ofc that's the whole problem but like. Idek how go explain like I love the idea of eating a sandwich or a burger or salad like I feel like I would love it if I was normal but it doesn't mean I want to taste it. Like it it were infront of me I just wouldn't be able to get myself to even try it but in my head I really like the idea of being a person that eats this food.\nSmtn that recently really highlighted this feeling was the cucumber salad thing on tiktok\nI don't eat any veggies except potatoes and don't like any of the toppings that they add and sauces and stuff but I love the idea of eating it tho if it was infront of me I wouldn't try it\n\nIdek what I'm talking abt or if I'm just misinterpreting smtn super simple into smtn complicated \n\nIf anyone relates lmk \ud83d\ude4f \n\nEDIT: I haven't been diagnosed with ARFID and made a post asking abt if I should seek a diagnosis so I would really appreciate if someone checked out my other post on this sub it would really help cuz I've been struggling with food lately more than ever",

Or that I could crave a food, and *finally* have it placed in front of me, and just eagerly, greedily dive into it! \n\nI love the idea of *wanting* a food. Of *enjoying* eati.g it! \n\nSo many times, I'll watch a cooking show, and I just see them making these dishes that would be absolutely mouthwatering to a \"normal\" human, ans I just want that! I *want* to want the food! \n\nOr like, have you *seen* how tasty food looks in anime!? I *want* that! But I know I can't!  And it breaks my heart just ~~a little bit~~ so fcking much! \n\nOr even just something so simple as a salad, or a wrap, or a burger, or some ribs. \n\nI love the *idea* of ***so many foods*** and I want to want them, and be able to eat and enjoy them so badly! \n\nBut no matter how much I want it, as far as my brain is concerned, I may as well be presented with a plate of moldy sawdust if ever I get it.

But when presented with it, he's not usually open to trying it. So if he were able to articulate, or I were able to predict, how he would envision it being cooked, seasoned, etc., I could try to replicate that...but that articulation is very difficult for someone who doesn't really have the experience with foods to be able to reference those specifics and doesn't know what they COULD tolerate bc there are so many things they CANNOT tolerate. It's a catch 22 for sure, and I in no way want to turn him off to these things, so I would rather wait until he's able to fully communicate what his interests are. Hope that makes sense.",

Of *enjoying* eati.g it! \n\nSo many times, I'll watch a cooking show, and I just see them making these dishes that would be absolutely mouthwatering to a \"normal\" human, ans I just want that! I *want* to want the food! \n\nOr like, have you *seen* how tasty food looks in anime!? I *want* that! But I know I can't!  And it breaks my heart just ~~a little bit~~ so fcking much! \n\nOr even just something so simple as a salad, or a wrap, or a burger, or some ribs. \n\nI love the *idea* of ***so many foods*** and I want to want them, and be able to eat and enjoy them so badly! \n\nBut no matter how much I want it, as far as my brain is concerned, I may as well be presented with a plate of moldy sawdust if ever I get it.

But when presented with it, he's not usually open to trying it. So if he were able to articulate, or I were able to predict, how he would envision it being cooked, seasoned, etc., I could try to replicate that...but that articulation is very difficult for someone who doesn't really have the experience with foods to be able to reference those specifics and doesn't know what they COULD tolerate bc there are so many things they CANNOT tolerate. It's a catch 22 for sure, and I in no way want to turn him off to these things, so I would rather wait until he's able to fully communicate what his interests are. Hope that makes sense.",
