I never really got acne even as a teen so there isn\u2019t that much there is pick at which is probably a godsend because the few times i did have things I could pick at you could consider it DUG. I remember as a kid every now and then getting a deep pimple, literally not visible at all but i could feel it and id take a needle and jam it into the pore in my face pretty deep to get it all out. Definitely horrendous for your skin but also now that you mention picking maybe im not actually crazy? Also I obsessively pick at my lips. If they\u2019re dry i just rip those bishes off till they bleed and when they\u2019re not i bite the skin to rip off little pieces :/",

Id never really thought about this before but now seeing all the comments i can relate so much and its just interesting.  \n\nBut yeah the lips are a daily thing for me too but I can\u2019t seem to stop. Sometimes like in class it\u2019s absent minded but other times ill be in a conversation and just focused heavily on picking at my lips but can\u2019t pull myself away and lose focus on the conversation. I also really am crazy lucky i never had much acne anywhere cause if I did my face would be soooo scared from picking it.",
