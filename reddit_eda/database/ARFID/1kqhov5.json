  "selftext": "I am really angry because people can't understand when I explain what my disorder consists of. Why is the sentence \"I can't tolerate consistencies\" so difficult? How do you explain it?? I have really lost my will. After explaining to my mother-in-law for 20 minutes what it consists of she told me: \"If you have this problem it is because your mother didn't force you to eat foods when you were little, she made you eat what you wanted. If you were my daughter you wouldn't have had this problem, I would have accustomed you to consistencies and forced you. Instead you are afraid of consistencies because you were not accustomed, it is something in your mind\". Why do people think they know more than my psychologist??",

I am adult and that's obviously much easier to do at my age. As a child and until I had a choice, I made myself scarce by helping out with the younger children and sticking to the children's table.

What do you think they're going to tell you when you say you get a food poisoning type reaction to some food? \"It must have been cooked improperly and that's why you got sick.\" \n\nSomeone who is afraid of needles at the doctor being asked to push a needle into their skin themselves is more realistic (IMO).

It doesn't matter who is offering it or how it is prepared, their answer is going to be no.  \n\nThe overeating is just an ancillary anecdote when someone says heroin, or under eating is bad for you.
