  "selftext": "Went to Canada to visit my long distance partner. She\u2019s incredibly understanding of my condition but we agreed to try a few safe-adjacent foods to see what happened. One day while waiting for a pizza she let me try a little cannabis to relax. Twenty minutes later I had eaten two slices without even contemplating how many not safe foods were on it. \nUnfortunately this won\u2019t be an option when I go back to the U.K. Still, I now know my brain is capable of not having ARFID. Just gotta figure out how to recreate that without getting stoned lol.",
