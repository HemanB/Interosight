  "selftext": "Like the title says, I tried lettuce yesterday after my tattoo artist made me a grouper sandwich.  I felt an immense pressure to try this sandwich, which made me almost spiral, but I guess 4 days of tattooing had me so tired that I had no fight in me.  The lettuce wasn\u2019t bad, the grouper was not great tho.  Very sloppy texture, and the crunchy of the lettuce wasn\u2019t bad.  The mixture of the two wasn\u2019t great but I believe I could definitely put lettuce on a burger now.  36 years and this may be the biggest breakthrough I have had.  It\u2019s kinda terrifying and great at the same time.",

Good job. \n\nI'll tell you how I defeated lettuce. I did it at the Wendy's salad bar. They used to have one in the 80's. It rocked. I would get one leaf of lettuce and tear it into pieces the size of my fingernail. I would then smother them in croutons and blu cheese dressing. I tried all the dressings beforehand and the only one that tripped my trigger was blu cheese. It smelled like a moldy jockstrap but it made my nose tingle. I've never eaten a food that did that to me. I would eat a single piece of lettuce with some dressing and a crouton and I couldn't even tell there was any lettuce there. It has no flavor. The pieces of lettuce got bigger and bigger and over the course of 4yrs I can now eat a salad and even other types of dressing. Some still suck. \n\nTo do onions and pickles on a burger, start with just ordering a burger with only pickles. When you get the burger, remove the pickles. Taste the burger where the pickles were. It's a mild vinegar pickle flavor. In low doses it's actually pleasant. Next time wring the pickle juice out on the meat and try it a little stronger. When you are good with that, try a thin sliced pickle. Now add onions. Remove most of them at first. Just a taste. Work your way into it. Most of this stuff is actually healthy for you so there is no reason to feel guilty adding it. The flavors can be complex and amazing. You can do this.",
