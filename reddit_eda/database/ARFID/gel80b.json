The only things allowed on a plate with another food are ketchup and fries/chips.\n\nBut for some reason, when I order a burger, I'll have onion (in fact, I usually have *double* onion), lettuce, burger sauce (or big mac sauce), ketchup, burger, bread. I won't do cheese, not a fan of cheeseburgers, and I don't like pickles. No idea why my brain makes an exception but it does.\n\nEven odder - the above *only* applies to beef burgers. When I go to the Harvester with my parents, they used to do a really nice southern fried chicken. Then they took it off the menu and made basically all their chicken rotisserie (and I will not do bone). But, on that menu, there is a burger called (for some reason) the Cowboy. It's literally the same two southern fried chicken pieces that you can't order anymore, but in a bun with bacon, cheese, etc. Well, I won't eat bacon, period, and won't eat cheeseburgers. So I end up going in and ordering the cowboy with \"no bread, no cheese, no sauce, no bacon, literally just the chicken and the chips\". Which always gets a weird look and several assurances that yes, I literally mean two pieces of chicken and the chips on a plate, and no, I definitely don't want the cheese or the barbeque sauce or the bun.\n\nThough the funniest one was a time I stopped into McDonalds for some post-interview fries and the woman in front of me ordered \"a large big mac meal with no meat\".
