      "body": "I remember my Mom crying pulled over in the car line in elementary school. She would beg me to drink the vanilla Ensure and I\u2019d be chocking, screaming, gagging, all of it. It was a regular routine. Having to pick me up every year on day 2 of camp cause the staff couldn\u2019t get me to eat. Concerns from other parents, I didn\u2019t talk but I could hear every word.. god she had to be so embarrassed. Still, she told me I was beautiful every day. I remember all the times drove 1.5 hours home from work every Sunday morning just so I would eat breakfast before church with my Dad. Just last week she cried because in 30 years I never ate a piece of my own birthday cake. Moved out at 17, I just had to come back home this year because it crept back up and I couldn\u2019t get control of it this time.. three fucking months I couldn\u2019t eat.. that\u2019s ok, she cooks the best food. And I\u2019m safe here \ud83d\ude0c Even know I know she just wants me to be happy; I can\u2019t help but to feel like I failed her yet again when my favorite meal last month is now repulsive. I know she will never fully understand that I want to eat trail mix only for 2 weeks but absolutely nothing is wrong. I wish I could have been the cuddly loving child she expected as her only daughter and youngest child.. but life had a different plan. She never once failed me, because she never gave up. There hasn\u2019t been a day of my life that I didn\u2019t feel unconditionally loved. Despite the frustrations, that is what a child needs from their parent, love will never fail. You\u2019re doing great Mama. As long as they always know where to find you and that you will be there \ud83c\udf31\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffd",

ARFID can just be a real son of a bitch sometimes and it can make you feel so powerless. I'm so sorry your family is going through this. If you haven't already tried them, meal replacement shakes can be a real lifesaver, but I'm guessing you've tried that already. It's tough to find the right one that works for you but that's what personally saved me. I wish there was more than I could do other than to say that sucks and I understand what you're going through and you are absolutely not a bad parent by any means",

They have a lot of extra nutrients and vitamins she's probably missing out on too. \n\nThere are different brands and flavours, some taste good, some are bad, some are decent, but she'll hopefully find one she can tolerate and you can use them for more than one meal if you need to.

I was in such a severe depression that my appetite disappeared and I stopped eating solids for two and a half months. I survived solely on malted milkshakes mixed with Ensure. Now I'm not sure what meal replacement shakes are dairy free, but I'm sure they exist, though you might have to do some searching. Dairy-free ice cream and dairy alternatives are pretty easy to find. I personally really like soy or coconut milk-based ice cream, and I also like almond milk. (I don't need to be dairy free, but I have friends who keep kosher so we go with non-dairy stuff if we're making milkshakes for dessert after we've eaten meat at dinner) I would suggest  you start with the milkshakes even if you can't find a dairy-free meal replacement immediately, it will at least keep her from losing more weight and give her some energy. Good luck, this is a rough disorder, but it does sound like you're doing right by her.",

Concerns from other parents, I didn\u2019t talk but I could hear every word.. god she had to be so embarrassed. Still, she told me I was beautiful every day. I remember all the times drove 1.5 hours home from work every Sunday morning just so I would eat breakfast before church with my Dad. Just last week she cried because in 30 years I never ate a piece of my own birthday cake. Moved out at 17, I just had to come back home this year because it crept back up and I couldn\u2019t get control of it this time.. three fucking months I couldn\u2019t eat.. that\u2019s ok, she cooks the best food. And I\u2019m safe here \ud83d\ude0c Even know I know she just wants me to be happy; I can\u2019t help but to feel like I failed her yet again when my favorite meal last month is now repulsive. I know she will never fully understand that I want to eat trail mix only for 2 weeks but absolutely nothing is wrong. I wish I could have been the cuddly loving child she expected as her only daughter and youngest child.. but life had a different plan. She never once failed me, because she never gave up. There hasn\u2019t been a day of my life that I didn\u2019t feel unconditionally loved. Despite the frustrations, that is what a child needs from their parent, love will never fail.
