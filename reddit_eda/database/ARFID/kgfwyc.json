Back when this were made by the big brands you could go to any store and pick up some McCain chips, but now it's store brands you gotta go to M&S to get M&S brand chicken and bacon pasta, Morrison's to get Morrison's brand Spaghetti meatballs, Lidl to get ...you get the idea!! Not very pandemic friendly either, never mind time consuming. I wish I'd never looked in Abu other store, but because I've travelled a lot I know what's available everywhere so I crave a Tesco pizza (only one I eat) and I can't have one. \n\nPS: 3 scariest words in ARFID world: new improved recipe.",
