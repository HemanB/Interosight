      "body": "I\u2019m lucky in that the fruit I actually like the taste of (apples, grapes, melon) are the ones I can stand the texture of. Couldn\u2019t eat an orange because of the texture, couldn\u2019t eat a pear because of the taste, but those three are good.\n\nIn fact, I used to love grapes so much that I became the only person I know who got told to cut down my grape intake and up my salt and caffeine intake by a consultant cardiologist, because as a teen I had pretty low blood pressure and grapes decrease blood pressure slightly. But when you\u2019re eating a bunch of grapes a day or more, slight becomes significant. I\u2019d nearly pass out just standing up out of a chair. So cut down that and add more stuff that bumps blood pressure.",
