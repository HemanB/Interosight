      "body": "literally hate how fucking VILE so many people get over picky eating/restrictive ED. like why the fuck does it matter to y'all so hard that everyone eat the same foods? Do y'all think i like having to constantly deal with eating the way that i do? food and eating give me so much anxiety and discomfort that i very often cannot enjoy eating at all. the fact that so many people want to characterize this as selfish and childish is fucking infuriating. especially hate that the same people will turn around and be all caring about someone going on, like a fucking paleo diet or something. sorry im stuck with the psychological torture nightmare of being unable to properly conceptualize veggies as FOOD at all, and that all wrong food textures trigger an extreme gag reflex for me. sorry my brain won't let me just eat food. im pretty sure the person having the worse time in this situation is me, but whatever.\n\nI think the other thing that blows my mind about all of these \"grow up\" people is that they're walking all the way past the realization that compassionate and accommodating people in your life is often how you can become comfortable eating around other people and potentially work towards trying a fear food. I was able to try MUSHROOMS while eating out with my auntie because she always asks me to look over menus of restaurants we go to before picking to make sure that they serve something I will eat, and because she says nothing when i won't eat something (often she'll even eat the veggies that come with my meal when I don't).  in my experience, a hostile and unaccommodating eating experience is enough to ensure i eat nothing, starve myself for hours and potentially develop new food aversions. when i was a kid my dad tried to force feed me raw carrots, and because of that I don't think I'll ever be able to eat them raw or crunchy. frankly people accommodating or not accommodating me wrt to food is a literal deal breaker. I don't expect people to like, go out of their way, but letting me know what's in the food you're putting out and graciously accepting when i don't want to eat it goes a long way towards making me feel comfortable eating with you. if i don't feel comfortable eating around someone i will dodge their meal and party invites ad infinitum \ud83d\ude02\n\nI'm so sorry that all of these people were so fucking vile to you OP. Happy that you have such wonderfully accommodating people in your life. Wishing you light and healing. :)",
