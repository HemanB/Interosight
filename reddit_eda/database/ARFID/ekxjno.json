  "title": "Found a chart that helps people like me/us enjoy vegetables and I FINALLY enjoy asparagus now. Hoping to eat even more veggies in 2020!",
  "selftext": "So, my biggest nemesis in ARFID are vegetables. I so badly want to be healthy and treat my body well, but to me if a food is green, that means it's bad, right? Food shouldn't be green? And bitter? That's why my silly ARFID-riddled brain tells me at least. So, proper nutrition has been hard to acquire and I can tell my body is suffering for it at way too young of an age.\n\nSO I did some digging around with various Google searches such as \"how to eat vegetables when you hate them\" and I came across this chart: https://www.precisionnutrition.com/dont-like-vegetables\n\nIt includes a bitterness scale of vegetables and and sort-of flow chart of which ways to cook certain vegetables and suggested flavors to pair with the veggies to help offset the bitterness and etc. I'm not even explaining it that well but once you open the link, you'll see how fool-proof it is. \n\nSo I picked asparagus, and paired it with crushed red pepper flakes, cayenne pepper, garlic and some butter, sauteed it, and actually really liked it! One thing that ARFID didn't take from me is a love of spice, so, I coated those m-fers in spice and it really helped to just pile on lots of seasoning and garlic to help introduce the new flavor to myself. \n\nI was so happy I could cry. After years of literally dry heaving at the thought of most vegetables, and especially asparagus, I finally enjoyed it and actually look forward to trying it again.\n\nThis isn't an overnight success story, I'm sure the next vegetable I try won't be so easy because asparagus is about as least bitter as it gets, vegetable-wise.\n\nBut, for anyone here who struggles with vegetables, I thought I'd include this very helpful link in case someone feels up to trying out something new.",

Being able to put exactly what I want in it and knowing nothing \u201cweird\u201d was secretly hiding in it, and also being able to taste along the way. I\u2019m not sure if I actually have this ED or if I was just a very picky eater, but I relate to a lot on here as far as \u201csafe foods\u201d and the way \u201cunsafe foods\u201d just seem so vomit inducing even though you logically know it should be fine. I had a lot of issues with liking things separately but not combined (sandwiches and burgers are still hard to eat). \n\nBut yeah, this chart is awesome, and the concept of it in general is too. So many foods I thought were gross growing up, I like now, either because the way my mom cooked them was not the best, or because I wasn\u2019t physically putting them together myself, so they didn\u2019t feel safe. Also, I\u2019m not sure if you like bacon or olive oil, but my favorite way to cook veggies (broccoli, asparagus, brussels) is roasted in the oven with a ton of olive oil, fresh garlic, and seasoning salt. For asparagus, if you wrap pieces of bacon around each piece.... omg so good. Obviously not the healthiest but a great treat.",

A year ago i didn't eat any of the vegetables in the chart. Now I eat asparagus (first i tried), brocoli (discovered about 6 months ago) and yesterday i tried spinach and i see potential there.

It's not even that I've tried others and didn't like them, it just happens that i decided to start with those.\n\n\nFor me the process is:\n\n1 Try it but not eat a full plate: Literally just taking a bit with the fork and then keep eating a safe food. Normally I'm absolutely disgusted by it even if i recognize that it's ok. It's just that the flavour profile is very different from all my safe foods.\n\n2 Full small plate with safe food alternative: Even if I've liked it i wait for another day to eat it as a meal. That way i can mentally prepare myself for it and it isn't scary as I'm not trying something that i don't know. Usually i don't enjoy it at this point but is doable. If I'm really struggling I stop and eat the alternative. It's weird cause even if I can't stand the food i know that there's potential for me to like it. It's like i like it but my brain doesn't want me to.\n\n3 Keep eating it: i find that after a couple or three times i start enjoying it and become used to it. I tend to have a phase in which i eat it A LOT and it's the only food in that food group that i want to eat. Then i get bored and stop for a while and then i integrate it normally to my repertoire.\n\nCurrently I'm in the \"like it but it's gross\" phase with spinach, mainly due to texture, \"omg this is the only vegetable i ever want to eat again\" with broccoli, and \"welp another nice food\" with asparagus.
