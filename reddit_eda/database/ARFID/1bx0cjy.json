They only have treatment for children. \n\nThe best they can do is send me to see a diatition who specialises with adults who have mental health issues. So I drive an hour each way to the closest private therapist who deals with adults with ARFID. I can only afford to see her every fortnight.\n\nI wish that ARFID in adults was more recognised, and I wish that there were better treatment options.

Arfid sucks to have, and if you've never had arfid, it can be hard to understand that it's way more than picky eating.\n\nLmao, I'm again really sorry you were in that situation, but it has NOTHIG to do with what I was responding about. I'm starting to gather you weren't commenting that you heard narcissistic tendencies were associated with ARFID bit rather you commented it because it's what you believe because in your mind your situation is way worse\n\nWhich arguably, yes, abuse is awful and condemnable. No one should suffer abuse. But we are two humans woth different lives. My worst situation and going to be different than yours. It doesnt make my problems less valid or less hard to deal with.\n\nIf you don't have Arfid, I don't get why you are here on this subreddit in the first place.\n\nAnd I'm not spoiled. I was never offered food I disliked. And even if I was, I always made an effort to try it. But I have an eating disorder called ARFID. And if you don't get that fine.\n\nBoth situations suck. We both go through our own pain regarding food. I don't get why you are insulting me over this.\n\nYou were abused. I have an eating disorder. The situations are not even comparable.\n\n I'm not even mad. I'm just utterly confused by why you are even replying when your initial comment had nothing to do with your childhood trauma of being starved, and while that sucks you are on a subreddit for an EATING DISORDER that you do not have.\n\nAnd criticizing/insulting me, who has said eating disorder,  saying me not eating food was simply disliking it and calling me spoiled. That's the farthest thing from the truth.\n\nI can imagine your situation cause that really sucks and NO human EVER should have go through what you did. I can empathize and care about that. But I will not allow you to insult me.\n\nSo kindly stop responding.\nCan we agree to disagree that we both have shitty life circumstances and move on.",

I wish It was just something I had to manipulate people into feeling bad for me.\n\nBut I've actually spent more time than I'd like to admit not eating at all around people so I don't have to explain myself to anyone. \n\nTrying new foods on the floor of my bathroom in fear of vomiting and/or gagging. \n\nI am looking at a spread of food at family events or parties and tearing up cause there is nothing I can eat. And I have to pick at things Trying to make do.\n\nEating the same food happily for weeks until someone calls me weird for not eating anything else.",

You did not mention in your initial comment about where you grew up staying at home and weren't allowed toe at. So I didn't know that. Of course, that is awful, and I'm sorry you went through that. Though I do not see what that has to with arfid?\n\nUnless you have arfid, so they purposefully excluded you as not to be embarrassed. Or punished you because they didn't know how to help or deal with you? I'm trying to understand, but your point appears to be unclear and unrelated in this case.\n\nAs for me, I do eat whay I please, but it's not healthy. All my safe foods are junk foods. This is why I want to try new things and grow healthier. However, due to arfid, I really struggle to eat and try new things. It's torture forcing myself to try things. Healthy or not, my bodies reaction feels like punishment. I just hate the fact there are people who think arfid is just some ploy to get out of eating healthily and to get attention. And if anyone is out there faking it for those reasons... that's even worse and makes me sad.",

I don't know you lmao.\n\nI WAS COMMENTING ON THE ARFID BEING ASSOCIATED WITH NARCISSISM cause that is in itself just wrong. Arfid sucks to have, and if you've never had arfid, it can be hard to understand that it's way more than picky eating.\n\nLmao, I'm again really sorry you were in that situation, but it has NOTHIG to do with what I was responding about. I'm starting to gather you weren't commenting that you heard narcissistic tendencies were associated with ARFID bit rather you commented it because it's what you believe because in your mind your situation is way worse\n\nWhich arguably, yes, abuse is awful and condemnable. No one should suffer abuse. But we are two humans woth different lives. My worst situation and going to be different than yours. It doesnt make my problems less valid or less hard to deal with.\n\nIf you don't have Arfid, I don't get why you are here on this subreddit in the first place.\n\nAnd I'm not spoiled. I was never offered food I disliked. And even if I was, I always made an effort to try it. But I have an eating disorder called ARFID. And if you don't get that fine.\n\nBoth situations suck. We both go through our own pain regarding food. I don't get why you are insulting me over this.\n\nYou were abused. I have an eating disorder. The situations are not even comparable.\n\n I'm not even mad. I'm just utterly confused by why you are even replying when your initial comment had nothing to do with your childhood trauma of being starved, and while that sucks you are on a subreddit for an EATING DISORDER that you do not have.\n\nAnd criticizing/insulting me, who has said eating disorder,  saying me not eating food was simply disliking it and calling me spoiled. That's the farthest thing from the truth.\n\nI can imagine your situation cause that really sucks and NO human EVER should have go through what you did. I can empathize and care about that. But I will not allow you to insult me.\n\nSo kindly stop responding.\nCan we agree to disagree that we both have shitty life circumstances and move on.",
