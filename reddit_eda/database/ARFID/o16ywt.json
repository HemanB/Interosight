  "selftext": "Sometimes I remember that as a child I used to think I would die pretty young (I literally didn't daydream about how my life could look like when I'm 25 because of that, I thought I'm gonna die around 20-25). I'm almost 22 right now, physically pretty healthy except for being underweight for like almost 2 years and my thoughts on this of course have changed now. I do wonder though if anyone else used to think like that or maybe still does?",

          "body": "Thank you for your reply. :) You're definitely right. I need to stop googling symptoms and illnesses. The human body is much more resilient than people believe. It's inspiring to see people who are 40+ and still going strong :)  \nI've been working to feel better about my eating choices. I'm trying not to chastise myself for eating this way, but still taking things in moderation, being mindful, and even trying to look for healthier options of my safe foods. It really helps to have a better relationship with food.",
