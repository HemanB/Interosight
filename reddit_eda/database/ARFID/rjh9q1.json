  "title": "Anyone with ARFID not a particularly picky eater (flexible trying new things) but will skip out on eating entirely if there\u2019s nothing I want to eat availible, too lazy to eat sometimes",
  "selftext": "I haven\u2019t been diagnosed with ARFID but fit a lot of the symptom profile and have ADD Inattentive. I\u2019ve been dealing with stomach issues- particularly constipation for the past couple years. I went to a doctor over it and she thought they could be caused by anorexia because I\u2019ve considered \u201cseverely underweight\u201d (BMI of 15, but it hasn\u2019t changed much since I was a kid). I was annoyed at this because body image has never played a role in my eating habits- it doesn\u2019t seem to be a good explanation from a mental/emotional standpoint, but perhaps I wasn\u2019t consuming enough calories and think I could have an eating disorder. Often when I\u2019m on my own at college I won\u2019t feel motivated to eat until like 5 PM and sometimes have only 1-2 meals a day. My dad has said before sometimes it seems like I\u2019m too lazy to eat. However I\u2019m really not a picky eater and am adventurous in trying new foods, however what I feed myself can be a bit samey, sometimes I go through food fixations of only eating certain foods which I heard is common with ADHD folks. For example, my breakfast always contains either a bagel with cream cheese, toast and eggs, or yogurt and I don\u2019t really deviate from that. I\u2019ve always been a slower eater than the rest of my family and don\u2019t like the feeling of being full as it\u2019s uncomfortable.\n\nMy question is could these habits be ARFID or would it be better explained by a different eating disorder or simply ADD brain? Most posts I see here are people who are extremely picky eaters to the point it interferes socially which is not my case.",

I much prefer having a kitchen over the dining halls, but still struggle with eating enough and will forget to and get faint.\n\nbut as far as the samey foods go, I would 100% eat something else if it was available. I think it is because I want those particular things- I don\u2019t not want everything else. I\u2019m truly not a picky eater and there are few foods I find inherently bad if they\u2019re well prepared, although I\u2019ve been vegetarian for a few long periods in my life. \n\nI should add that I used to be a very picky eater and there were a number of foods I didn\u2019t like up through my teens but I\u2019ve completely lost that. I used to be made fun of for only liking Mac and cheese, didn\u2019t like tomatoes or mushrooms for texture/taste reasons but I\u2019ve gotten over it. my parents are also great cooks which I think helped me out. so I don\u2019t know if this all disqualifies me from having ARFID and it is just ADD. the thing about \u201clack of interest in food\u201d with this disorder is very much me though and I haven\u2019t found much in the way of explanations for that.

          "body": "i have both ADHD and ARFID, and i do something kind of similar with the intermittent meals\u2014if my routine gets messed up, i just don\u2019t eat until either i\u2019m so hungry i\u2019m faint/hurting, or someone sits me down and tells me to eat. even now, i usually only have two meals a day, sometimes snacking between, sometimes not. \n\nthat being said, ive always attributed that to ADHD, and based on what you\u2019ve said, especially with what you said about being away at school, i think that\u2019s probably the case for you too. it sounds like it\u2019s not the eating itself that you\u2019re avoiding, so much as the process. especially with ADHD, things that are otherwise simple tasks are these arduous multi-step processes that feel like they take forever. \n\nthis is what my first year of college was like, if i was thinking about getting food (via dining hall): \n\n step 0 - find a good stopping point for the current activity. step 1 - get up. step 2 - find meal card. (step 2.5 - find keys. my student ID was both, so that was one less step for me) step 3 - go downstairs. step 4 - walk to dining hall. step 5 - realize that this dining hall closed twenty minutes ago. step 6 - cuss/cry about it. step 7 - look up which dining halls are still open. step 8 - go back to your room because you just don\u2019t have the energy to go across campus for some shitty pizza and whatever other mediocre food they\u2019re serving. \n\ni lost a lot of weight freshman year because my college\u2019s dining hall was closed more than it was open, and the next nearest one was half a mile away. (i also lived on the sixth floor, and the elevator was usually out, which didn\u2019t help with \u201ci\u2019ll just make a quick run to get some food\u201d, knowing i had six flights of stairs waiting for me, but you get the point)\n\nthe samey foods thing is fairly common among ADHD and autism, so i guess it\u2019s just a question of are they samey because you *want* those same foods, or because you *dont* want other ones? if you had those foods *right* in front of you, would you eat them? even if it was disappointing, would you still be fine eating other (safe) foods, if they were what was available? \n\n\nin any case, i empathize with your situation, OP. with a lot of these kinds of comorbidities, it\u2019s really hard to tell what\u2019s causing what\u2014and sometimes that\u2019s because *everything* is contributing in some way. i hope you\u2019re able to find some clarity \ud83d\udcaa",

          "body": "thank you so much for this response! I relate so much to what you said about the process of going to the dining hall LMAO. my first year away at college I lost a concerning amount of weight living in the dorms, due to the dining halls being far away or having shitty hours. I would get scattered and it would take too much effort to go and eat (I was always losing my keys as well lol). the food they were serving was just bad in quality and the preparation so it wasn\u2019t that appetizing and caused demotivation to go at all.\n\nsince leaving the dorms I\u2019ve struggled instead with grocery shopping without a car and preparing food consistently. I much prefer having a kitchen over the dining halls, but still struggle with eating enough and will forget to and get faint.\n\nbut as far as the samey foods go, I would 100% eat something else if it was available. I think it is because I want those particular things- I don\u2019t not want everything else. I\u2019m truly not a picky eater and there are few foods I find inherently bad if they\u2019re well prepared, although I\u2019ve been vegetarian for a few long periods in my life. \n\nI should add that I used to be a very picky eater and there were a number of foods I didn\u2019t like up through my teens but I\u2019ve completely lost that. I used to be made fun of for only liking Mac and cheese, didn\u2019t like tomatoes or mushrooms for texture/taste reasons but I\u2019ve gotten over it. my parents are also great cooks which I think helped me out. so I don\u2019t know if this all disqualifies me from having ARFID and it is just ADD. the thing about \u201clack of interest in food\u201d with this disorder is very much me though and I haven\u2019t found much in the way of explanations for that. I think it might run deeper than just ADD but I am having trouble navigating the causes for it.",
