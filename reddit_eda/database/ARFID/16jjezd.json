Especially because people think I'm just being dramatic or picky or choosing not to eat. Because it's not that I don't even want to enjoy eating - I do, because it's such a shared human experience? It's just so hard and it shouldn't be and it feels like it's something I will always struggle with, so I wish I just didn't have to deal with it. \n\nI am just having a crappy day and the fact that people are watching how much I am eating right now is making it even harder :(",
