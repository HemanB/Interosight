  "selftext": "I (30F) have pretty severe ARFID that started as a toddler and as a result, most foods I haven't even tried (had somewhat of a neglectful childhood)\n\nBut my friend took me out for a bunch of small sharing plates and gave me no pressure to eat!\n\nHe did say: this calamari is really good, I really wish you'd try it.\n\nA couple of cocktails in and I just said: Give me that small one! And ate it without overthinking or my gag reflex kicking in!\n\nIt's by far the \"newest\" thing I've ever eaten, and definitely the first seafood, and I just wanted to share with you all \ud83d\ude0a",

My brother has ARFID and when I help him try new foods, we always have him try it first at a very nice place. If you live in the middle of the continent this is a problem for seafood (so maybe try it on vacation). \n\nOur experience is that local and fresh makes almost all the difference. You don\u2019t want to be trying a food for the first time that\u2019s been prepared terribly or made from bottom of the barrel ingredients. It\u2019s expensive but the most important thing is making a positive first impression. Imagine if one of your safe foods was done horribly. You would know that isn\u2019t what it should be like. The same applies here.",
