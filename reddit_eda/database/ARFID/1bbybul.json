For example, I cant drink the last bit of milk in a bottle. I call it the Cursed Milk because for some reason that milk is dirty and I cant drink it. What are some of your restrictions that you find funny?",

I had the worst year of my life last year which is where this started. Now my life is better and I\u2019m still losing weight. My restriction is everything. If I know I\u2019m going to go somewhere the next day and eat in public or if I know my family/friends are making a meal, I won\u2019t eat anything at all the day before in order to \u201csave room\u201d in my stomach. Basically, I have to be starving to eat a full meal. \n\nIt\u2019s genuinely disturbing to me to read through these comments of people who generalize ARFID as being picky, and people saying it\u2019s hilarious. It is NOT picky eating. It is an intense aversion to food and it\u2019s just not funny at all. This has affected my life beyond what you can even guess. I really would not continue to say ARFID is funny because it is not.",

I see doctors and dietitians and therapists but at the end of the day it\u2019s all up to me to fix. ARFID is not funny. And there is a difference between being a picky eater and having ARFID. I had the worst year of my life last year which is where this started. Now my life is better and I\u2019m still losing weight. My restriction is everything. If I know I\u2019m going to go somewhere the next day and eat in public or if I know my family/friends are making a meal, I won\u2019t eat anything at all the day before in order to \u201csave room\u201d in my stomach.

      "body": "It's not a stupid question! Very few people really know about super tasters even existing, so being aware of how to find out if you are one isn't a stupid or silly question. :)\n\nThere's actually two ways to test. One is relatively reliable, the other is considered either very reliable or maybe 60% reliable from a light google search. Both are fairly cheap.\n\nThe cheap and fairly reliable method involves [food dye, and a piece of paper with a standard sized hole punched through it](https://www.wikihow.com/Tell-if-You%27re-a-Super-Taster) . The link is to a WikiHow that uses a hole punch sticker if that's easier, but basically just using the size of the hole for one of those 3 ring binder pieces of paper is what you use. Then you just have to count. I suggest googling for images of reference.\n\nThe other method is a simple strip of paper that can be purchased (usually from Amazon), and [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B001D7FF5E?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title) is the one that I used and was shared around my dad's office. It's a strip of paper with PTC on it, and it will taste really bitter if you're a super taster, to the point of some people retching. Normal tasters may taste a little bitter but be okay with it, and non-tasters just taste paper and nothing else. I wound up tasting it as really, really bitter after a few moments, whereas the super tasters in my dad's office tasted it almost immediately. Thus why I lean towards I'm \"mostly\" a super taster.",

And every so often I\u2019d come across a gallon that tasted so bad but only to me. I\u2019d have other people try it and they said it tasted normal.\n\nBut I can mix plant based milk no problem. In fact I prefer it in some cases. I like mixing the normal oatly oatmilk with the full fat oatly oatmilk because that tastes and feels the best.",
