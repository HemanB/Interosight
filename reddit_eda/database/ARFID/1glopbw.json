      "body": "Hi! I am an ARFID dietitian and just want to share a couple tips and validation. Anxiety is the MAIN trigger I find with ARFID so working on anxiety reduction overall with your therapist could be helpful not just food related. As a matter of fact unless your therapist is specialized in ED's/ARFID it might be more helpful to find a dietitian in your area specialized in ARFID instead. But some tips I use with my clients\n\n1. choose safe foods - these are foods that you can usually get yourself to eat 9/10 times\n\n2. don't eliminate that power of liquid calories; sometimes sipping on some juice or a protein shake or a smoothie will help calm the anxiety/tummy and at least give you some nutrients while it usually opens up the appetite a bit for my clients\n\n3. distraction distraction distraction. a lot of ED's use CBT in therapy and in my opinion it doesn't always do well bc its main framework is learning to cope in the moment to distress by engaging with the trigger; I don't think this works well in ARFID so for my clients I engage with ANY DISTRACTIONS - eat with someone, turn on a show, use coping skills, go for a walk, go outside, do anything that helps remove you a bit from food while you attempt to eat it.\n\n4. sometimes the ED quiets down when you challenge it a bit more sometimes it doesn't the goal is to challenge when you can and rest when you can't but hopefully the above helps a bit!",
