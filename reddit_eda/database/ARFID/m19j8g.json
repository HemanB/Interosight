These are also the easiest ones to overcome because you just pick off the stem or eat nanas before they get this brown. \n\nI don't eat oranges often for this reason and if I do it will be one or 2 segments of my bf's orange and I have to pick off all the pith and just suck the juice out. I drink a glass of OJ every day though so I don't feel like I'm missing out. \n\nI can eat an apple but not if I have to bite into it, because it gets stuck in my teeth when I do and I hate the sensation. I can eat one that is cut up though... My boyfriend often does this for me. \n\nAnd finally blueberries... I used to think they were gross as a kid for this reason. I can eat them now but there are usually a few bad ones that I just don't eat.\n\nI guess we all have our reasons though. No 2 people with ARFID will have the same food rules but there is a lot of similarities between us.",

I put a bunch of cinnamon and like a tablespoon or two of maple syrup in and I can\u2019t even taste the apple.\n\nIdk if it makes a difference but I use steel cut oats and put 2 parts liquid (milk, water, nut milk, etc. but I like milk) and 1 part oats. I toast the oats in butter on the stove, stirring them for about a minute, then pour in the liquid and turn the stove down as low as it will go (I have a gas stove so I just turn it until there is barely any flame). Then I add the cinnamon, maple syrup, apples and whatever else I wanna put in and cover it with a lid. It usually takes like 45min-1hr for it to be ready. Its not the easiest meal in terms of effort but I like it. I have a major sweet tooth and I think it tastes like a dessert.\n\nThat was kinda long, sorry. But if you like apple pie you might like that. Another idea is applesauce and lots of cinnamon. Apples are one of the few fruits I\u2019ll eat but usually they require cinnamon for me to actually like them.",
