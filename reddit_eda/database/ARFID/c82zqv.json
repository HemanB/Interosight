  "selftext": "I'm 19, have had arfid as long as I can remember, and have never actually eaten a vegetable. Growing up, my parents tried to make me eat all the food on my plate but most things would make me gag or throw up, especially the vegetables. Then I'd just get yelled at which made me hate food more. I've been trying to be healthier lately since most of my safe foods are junk foods and decided to buy a little vegetable sampler with broccoli, carrots, and celery. The broccoli wasn't good, I only ate a little bit but it didn't make me gag. The celery was horrible and made me gag a little after a tiny bite so that's a definite no. BUT the baby carrots actually weren't bad. I ate 6 whole baby carrots which is something I never thought I'd do. I actually thought I would die before eating a whole vegetable. I then cried in my husband's arms because I was so proud of myself. He's been really supportive and it's been great. After this success, I feel like I could do anything. Hoping to try more vegetables soon.",
