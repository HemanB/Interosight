  "selftext": "Seeing this sub made me legit burst out in tears, mainly because I finally found a place where people can understand where I\u2019m coming from. The struggle I have with food, and how difficult it can be to cope. I\u2019m 21, been diagnosed with OCD, and food plays a big part in my everyday anxiety.\n\nI can\u2019t stand eating in front of others, I avoid it like the plague. I order food off the kids menu and come up with excuses that it\u2019s for a younger sibling. Every time I eat with people, they look at me weird. I tend to eat before going out, and it\u2019s easy to feel so isolated when food is involved. \n\nI wish I didn\u2019t have this, and so many people don\u2019t understand how you can\u2019t just \u201ctry it\u201d and be okay. But now, I have the support and knowledge from you guys. I\u2019ve gone all these years frustrated and alone, but I\u2019m glad we can all relate to those feelings. Thank you \ud83d\udc95",

Work events cause me so much anxiety it's unbearable, especially because most of them are centered around food. It's so embarrassing, I've had coworkers ask if I'm doing intermittent fasting and I just went along with it to explain my lack of eating.",

The only reason I'm in an okay place with my ARFID right now is because I'm kind of a shut in, I totally get the feelings of not wanting to eat around other people and it sucks that this is a thing that I have to warn people about before we hang out. I'm glad I found this group and so many other people like me.",

I was almost in tears on the phone and I DREADED going to the weekend, even though it was supposed to be fun. When we had dinner I got all the questions and comments and I just wanted to vanish. During lunch time I lied and said I'd eaten already just to avoid the subject. It's so good to find out I'm not alone!",
