After the waiter had left after taking our order, one of the moms said something to me along the lines of, \"You are allowed to order anything you want \\[well, within reason of course\\]. You are the one paying them; not the other way around.\" I was so grateful to her for saying that because before that I wanted to just hide under the table until dinner was over.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe waiter brought me my plain spaghetti with an obnoxiously large plate of cut up butter slices. It would have been a nice gesture if it wasn't so over-the-top in the amount. Not sure if I even used any of it...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n...and then the restaurant charged me freaking $20 for my plain pasta and butter plate.",
