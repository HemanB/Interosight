  "title": "I ate a salad today!!",
  "selftext": "It sounds so silly but I'm really proud of myself. For context my safe foods are dairy, grains, and the rare fruit every once in a while. \n\nI found out my cholesterol is pretty crazy (partly genetic but definitely diet too) and I'm overweight from eating junk food all day every day, so I decided to make some changes. Every day I've been having a smoothie with blueberries, part of a banana (used to hate them but they're not bad now) ground flax seeds, vanilla greek yogurt and some sugar free vanilla syrup (it makes smoothies so much better lol). \n\nToday I ate a salad with iceberg lettuce (better than the romaine I tried once before), a bunch of ranch, cheddar cheese, and croutons and it wasn't horrible!! I don't like the texture or taste of the lettuce very much but I keep telling myself I can get used to it. \n\nPlease recommend any salad toppings/combinations you like (no meat), any vegetables I should try, and any fruits you like for a good smoothie!!",

I've been hospitalized for kidney stones multiple times and I just tell myself \"it can't be worse than excruciating pain.\"\n\nSalads have always been scary and intense but I've always been jealous of people who can eat something so healthy and readily available at most restaurants. My dad doesn't have arfid by any means but we're from the midwest and he didn't eat very many vegetables growing up, he had to learn to like them as an adult. I asked him how he started eating salads and he said he slathered lettuce in ranch (we're a hardcore ranch family) and threw in half a bag of croutons and club crackers and added less extras every time. \n\nI will say I don't like getting unexpected lettuce (I love cheese quesadillas and a lot of fast food places will drop lettuce in...gross) and I'm not 100% sold on lettuce but I'm gonna keep trying & I hope one day you can enjoy a salad!!",
