It tastes like a creamsicle and you do not taste the spinach at all, but if it\u2019s too much mentally you can always leave it out. My kids call them shrek or Hulk smoothies. We are all anemic so the iron + calcium combination is important. \n\nFrozen baby spinach leaves (generous handful- approx to the 8 oz mark on the blender)\nFrozen peaches (for sweetness- you can use a different fruit like frozen banana adds a creamy texture- I use about 3-4 peach slices per serving)\nVanilla bean whole fat yogurt (to taste- I use about half a cup)\nOrange juice (enough to thin- I use about 6-8oz)",
