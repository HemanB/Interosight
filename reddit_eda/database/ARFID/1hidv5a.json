  "selftext": "hello i\u2019m a 20 year old female with arfid and medically considered \u2018overweight\u2019 bc all my safe foods are junk but anyway. \none of my safe foods is the meatball sub. and only meatballs. no add ons, not toasted no cheese just meatballs. \nEVERYTIME, i get this in subway i get unnecessary remarks and comments made about it. \n\u201cthat\u2019s a bit plain and simple\u201d - with a judging look\n\u201care you sure you want nothing on it???\u201d \n\u201cno cheese????\u201d no \u201care you sure??\u201d YES. \ni hate getting it toasted too bc it makes the bread all crusty and i hate it. but they just INSIST that i need to add something to my sandwich to make it better.\nand they pry on and on and on about am i sure i want it that way and proceed to laugh in my face. it makes me feel really self conscious bc they are clearly judging me to my face about my food order bc they consider it plain and boring. it\u2019s gotten to the point that i just order it directly to my house instead of going in because i know they are going to make stupid comments at me. \n\nit\u2019s not just subway. like i know i\u2019m not the only person to customise and burger at mcdonald\u2019s to only ketchup. 9/10 times my order is delayed bc they will find my table and MAKE SURE that i want nothing in my burger and it wasn\u2019t a mistake. like??? i\u2019ve even had someone say to me \u201ci\u2019ve never seen a burger so lifeless\u201d or \u201cthat\u2019s weird\u201d or \u201ci\u2019ve never seen anyone do that\u201d like FUCK OFFFFF. \ndon\u2019t even get me started when they assume i\u2019ve made a mistake with the customisation of my order bc it\u2019s too weird to be true so they put everything in anyway. you best believe i\u2019m storming up to the counter with my receipt in hand. \n\nAND KFC no matter how many times i add in the order notes \u201cno sauce and salad\u201d they have never ONCE removed it. and i am entirely convinced kfc employees cannot read. like what if i was allergic what then. i then have to proceed to wipe off the sauce with kitchen roll and be left with the lingering taste of mayo :/\n\nin conclusion \nsubway employees are assholes\nmcdonald\u2019s employees are dickheads\nand kfc employees cannot read. \n\nif you work in any of these places it\u2019s nothing personal lol just my ranting and experiences. i\u2019m sure you are lovely ",

They don't get paid enough and the job is taxing, but comments like this are just uncalled for. I've been to places where they have happily accommodated my needs even when they were busy. To a certain extent, I can understand them wanting to double-check because sometimes mistakes happen and some entitled customers end up yelling. So I personally don't mind a small delay, but I detest stuff like \"Are you sure you don't want this?\" and \"Why don't you try this with it? That will bring some flavour.\" My subway orders always get messed up because they keep adding stuff I did not opt for and specifically said not to add, and I end up with the same thoughts and emotions as you.\u00a0",

I did not care what people ordered for the most part, but a sub with just one meat and nothing else would have made me so happy! I might have made a comment about it being easy thinking I was being friendly, though. I hope I never hurt anyone's feelings, because I honestly appreciated the sandwiches that weren't piled with so much stuff they were hard to close and wrap. I also appreciated that they weren't combinations that grossed me out a bit. \n\nLuckily, my ARFID doesn't really make me sick from dealing with food I cannot eat myself, but some combinations, man, why?!",

Obviously, I didn't really understand the whole \"safe food\" thing at that age. I just ate what I liked and felt comfortable to me.\n\nSo one day my mom and I went to the place where she worked on an off day and there was a new waitress there. \n\nAnd, she asked what I wanted, I said a cheese sandwich. And the waitress was like \"we don't serve that here\". And mom and her had a whole big discussion about how you could just charge for a grilled cheese, not grill it, and put mayo on it (for an extra charge).\n\nI think like the store owner or manager had to sign off on it or something. It was a whole weird thing. \n\nAs an adult, looking back on it, I see both sides. On one hand, what I wanted wasn't on the menu. But, on the other hand, they have the stuff to make a grilled cheese and mayo is a condiment option for the burgers. Like, 1 + 1 should equal 2, yeah?\n\nBut, like, I was 5 or whatever. And I didn't really get the big deal. I was just asking for something I liked and thought was easy to make (because Mom made them for me all the time), you know?\n\nAnd, I can see how ordering \"off menu\" in most situations is kind of weird. Like, as an adult, I wouldn't go into a Taco Bell and order a Whopper or whatever. \n\nSo, yeah, just a funny little story from my childhood I wanted to share.
