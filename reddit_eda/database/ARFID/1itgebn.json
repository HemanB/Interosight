Ordered takeout from a restaurant with my bf and got Mac and cheese. The second it was in my lap I got grossed out by it and couldn\u2019t eat more than 2 bites. I got overwhelmed by the cheese again. I felt so bad.",

I can eat them all again now but I try to be more careful. \n\nOn occasion it can be something else, I bite into something and it has something gross inside (a mini bell pepper that was slimy inside traumatized me for a while. I eat them again but break them open) or like I eat something and it tastes off. Ate a warm hard boiled egg once (was in my lunch box all day) nothing wrong with it but it being room temperature messed with the taste and I couldn\u2019t eat hard boiled eggs for a while. \n\nI also have a weird thing with boiled cabbage where it disagrees with me after I\u2019m like partway through eating the portion. I think it\u2019s the sliminess\n\n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019m missing some others but yeah it happens to me for varying reasons and it drives me nuts. Frustrating to loose some of your few safe foods",
