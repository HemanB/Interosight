  "selftext": "Today I tried my mother spaghetti sauce for the first time. I helped make it with her and we added bell peppers, onions, garlic, and mushrooms along with ground beef and pork. \n\nI struggle with gagging in response to the texture of new foods, and tomatoes and sauces in general have always been a struggle for me. But today, I licked some off my finger, and then I ate a piece right out of the simmering pot. I didn't gag, I didn't feel anxious, I LIKED the taste! \n\nI feel so happy right now, and my friends and family are very proud of me. I look foreward to possible further endeavors with sauce and tomato based food items. This is a huge step for me, and I hope the same fortune may come to bless anyone who reads this.",

A victory like this is huge- becoming comfortable with sauces can open up a whole new category of foods. \n\nWhen I got out on my own I started to see how cooking things for myself made me more adventurous. I think for me it\u2019s having the control over the food and knowing exactly what\u2019s in it/how it\u2019s been prepared that makes me feel safer. I hope you keep experimenting and finding new foods to enjoy!! \ud83c\udf89",
