There are health consequences to ARFID and wishful thinking won't change that. \n\nI've been disappointed at the nature of conversation here to be honest, this is where I discovered there was a name for this condition. My hope was that a community like this might make the condition more well-known so that we can mitigate the effects of the wider public being ignorant or dismissive to just how difficult it is to live with and maybe reduce the psychological issues that come with that. \n\nHowever more and more, I see people making this an issue of identity and ideology - there are many here who are pushing a \"healthy at any size\" kind of delusion which is demonstrably false, they're more concerned with having the condition \"catered to\" rather than recognized as a condition. \n\nIt's a shame but it seems there's a lot of anti or pseudo scientific sentiments peddled here with the aim of making people feel better rather than addressing reality.",
