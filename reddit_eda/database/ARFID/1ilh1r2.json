  "selftext": "Not sure if it\u2019s an ARFID thing or just me thing lol.\n\nBut even with safe foods, sometimes I\u2019ll be chewing and just mid-chewing I\u2019ll realize, \u201coh, ew actually I don\u2019t want this in my mouth I need it out now\u201d. Then I have to spit out what I\u2019m eating and can\u2019t finish the rest. My body and throat physically won\u2019t let me swallow what I\u2019m chewing on. Sometimes I start to feel nauseous. \n\nWhen it happens it makes me worry that I\u2019m starting to dislike a safe food which is alarming. After a few days, I can usually go back to the meal/food and have no issue eating it again. Is this just me? \n\nEdit: I am SO glad and relieved that others can relate, but also feel for you all because this sucks. It makes me feel better to be able to associate this with ARFID and I\u2019m not alone. ",
