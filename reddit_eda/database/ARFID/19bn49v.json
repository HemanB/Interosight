They refer to things like basic accommodations as \u201ccoddling\u201d or \u201cspoiling\u201d\n\nThe smugness is from the fact that their children either don\u2019t have the issue, or they have abused them into behaving \u201cnormally\u201d.

He knew I hated onions but would put them in the spaghetti sauce anyway and then complain when I picked them out. He was my first bully.\n\nFortunately, he worked nights so once he left for work, my mom would make me whatever I wanted. Which was Kraft Mac & Cheese or Rice-a-Roni and hamburger patty with garlic powder and American cheese. I lived off that and Franco-American spagetti & meatballs (RIP) for years. My mom was less concerned with *what* I ate, she just wanted me to *eat*.\n\nMy dad never really calmed down about my eating habits. Thirty years later and he still tries to get me to eat stuff he knows I don't like, and rolls his eyes when I say so. I found out later that his parents did the same thing to him, and the typical refrain from folks of his generation is \"if I had to suffer, so do you, it's only fair.\" :|",

      "body": "For me, the first step was identifying if my aversions to individual foods were flavor or texture based, then slowly starting to rule in and rule out cooking methods for the problematic textures.\n\nFor example: I can eat raw baby carrots with ranch, but I can\u2019t stand them cooked. The flavor isn\u2019t the problem there, it\u2019s the texture. Now when I cook with them, (say I\u2019m making a chicken soup) I cook the carrots separately in a bit of broth and then blend them to death. Adding some of the blended carrots into the broth gives a hint of the flavor I like without a detectable texture. If I decide not to risk it and just have my broth and noodles, that\u2019s ok! I can add as much or as little as I\u2019m comfortable with depending on the day.\n\nThe blender and strainer are my friends. Bad textures get evicted before serving. I make a delightful French onion soup with all the offensive caramelized onion bits strained out at the end. I double up the beef stock (Better than Bouillon brand) and load up on the melted cheese. \n\nI also make a sweet potato soup with a chicken stock base with pumpkin pie spices. I have to blend it until it\u2019s a smooth orange fluid, but it\u2019s full of calories!\n\nI try not to set too many \u2018rules\u2019 for what any meal has to be. I don\u2019t like most sandwiches, but I can eat some of the ingredients separately! A few leaves of lettuce or baby spinach (with ranch), a few pieces of skinless rotisserie chicken breast (because all the nuggets in my life seem to have a horrible texture recently) and a couple pieces of buttered toast are 70% of a sandwich, even if those ingredients never touch each other.\n\nWhen I\u2019m really struggling to get fruit into my diet, I\u2019m not above buying those squeezable fruit pouches for toddlers. Sometimes finding a safe toe hold in a food category is the first step toward a more balanced diet. From cartoon-themed applesauce pouches I went to regular applesauce, then apple slices, then apples with peanut butter. Even if I regress back to the pouches for a while, I\u2019m not cut off from fruit options completely.\n\nWhen in doubt, try to identify what you like about a safe food and build upon it. Are French fries safe? How about hashbrown patties? Does the potato tolerance extend to a baked potato with butter and salt? Lots of calories in that, a solid emergency meal.\n\nI generally find that when I cook for myself and taste as I go, I\u2019m much more willing to push the envelope flavor wise. I also try to associate eating with positive times and expose myself to people who are passionate about and creative with food. I especially like to watch Sorted episodes while I eat or cook, it helps put me in a better mind space to interact with food.\n\nI am sorry for the late response, but better late than never I suppose.",
