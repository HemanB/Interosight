Im diagnosed restrictive of food based on fear of allergic reactions. I have about 5-7 things I cycle through and don\u2019t branch out for fear of dying.  I am a mature and self reflective adult. I am aware this is a mental health issue etc.  but just because I can\u2019t eat more than a few safe foods doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t eat at all.  As a matter of fact through the power of getting older and PCOS I\u2019m quite a bit overweight (by about 80 pounds) for my height.  I can\u2019t help but feel like I\u2019m missing something? Are there people like me in this community? I don\u2019t want to dismiss the absolute horrible struggle that those with fear of eating for other more dangerous reasons. It\u2019s just I\u2019m feeling a little imposter syndrome here. ",

So it came on later in my adult life and it came with a fear of anaphylaxis and death. I've been seeing a lot of progress lately because I have to get gallbladder removal surgery and that completely upended most of my safe foods because I was so afraid of eating my safe foods lately because I don't want another gallbladder attack is that hurt. \n\nI definitely feel the frustration of not being taken seriously because it's already hard enough that I feel most places don't recognize our eating disorder. And then there's like the furthest stigma of not being critically underweight so it's almost like well you're fine. And I feel like even worse yet the fat phobia that we see in the medical system that would say oh well you should probably lose weight anyways. But the body doesn't work like that. When you're restricting as much as you probably are You're probably not going to lose weight. Or you know you might just be eating enough calories it's just not nutrient dense calories you know?\n\nOne thing that's really helped me in recovery is doing EMDR. I'm not saying it's a cure-all, but it could be worth looking into. I've also been seeing an individualized eating disorder specialist and that's helped too. Again, though my situation is different because I haven't always had this eating disorder it came on much later in my adult life and I actually used to love eating and I lived abroad for 2 years and I enjoyed trying new foods and whatnot so it's been quite the 180 to go from that to being afraid to eat most food and only having a small selection of foods that I feel okay eating.",

An ad for treatment randomly popped up when scrolling on Facebook and I\u2019d never heard of it, but it stopped me in my tracks because I think this is why we are struggling so hard with our child. People keep giving us tips and tricks and nothing works for getting them to eat more than what they always eat and always have. There are maybe five meals total we can get in and maybe two vegetables. Fruits are a little better, but it\u2019s mainly pasta, Mac and cheese, and chicken nuggets from a specific place. I asked about a list of foods and why they were on the \u201cno\u201d list and taste and texture are both always the culprit. They absolutely have actually gagged on food before, due to texture. They will sometimes ask to eat something new, but eat two bites and that\u2019s it. It\u2019s to the point I have to tell people not to be worried or offended if they don\u2019t eat their food when they go to other\u2019s homes, because they are \u201cso picky\u201d (or so I thought). I actually think I may have even learned some things about myself while researching this. \n\nAnyway, the one thing stopping me was the mention of weight loss as a symptom on all the information I found and that not being the case. I think it being processed foods is why we don\u2019t have that. I am overweight. My kid isn\u2019t actually overweight, but \u201csolid\u201d and definitely not underweight. I was thinking maybe it couldn\u2019t be it because of that and then I saw this thread. The last bloodwork at the doctor showed that numbers are starting to be thrown off and diet and exercise were mentioned as fixes and I wanted to cry because we have been trying it all to improve that and literally can\u2019t. I actually told my husband before our kid was ever born that I didn\u2019t want them to be picky like me and I made sure they had a huge variety of foods and then they got older and it just morphed into only eating those items. They will just not eat if offered anything else. I\u2019ve even made a three bite rule (again, being told it was pickiness and to keep offering) and also offer a side of \u201csafe\u201d foods and they will end up only finishing those foods or will ask for them. People on the outside think it\u2019s just spoiling them, but I do think it\u2019s way more than that. They are willing to try new, but most of it is written off never to be tried again.",

Often they sort-of sense the malnutrition coming before it hits and prepare your body for it by holding onto the fat reserves. So ARFID people are often normal weight/BMI or even obese/high BMI. She said she has a client whose ideal body weight, based on whatever metrics are generally used, is 250lbs, and if she goes much below that she can get into malnutrition problems.\n\nIt's the reason Denver ACUTE ED hospital's admission criteria of a patient generally being below 15 BMI before they can be admitted (a policy dictated by their insurance company, BTW) is so unfortunate and harmful. I asked my dietician and my ED doctor what it would take for me to get to that point so I could get admitted, and they both said I would die before I could get that low. I'm 62, 5 feet, 7 inches tall and weigh 145 lbs, but am in a malnutrition state as proven by my lab work (low pre-albumin, anemic, etc,) \n\nARFID has a long way to go towards being very well understood by the medical profession, much less the families and friends of those who have it.",

So it came on later in my adult life and it came with a fear of anaphylaxis and death. I've been seeing a lot of progress lately because I have to get gallbladder removal surgery and that completely upended most of my safe foods because I was so afraid of eating my safe foods lately because I don't want another gallbladder attack is that hurt. \n\nI definitely feel the frustration of not being taken seriously because it's already hard enough that I feel most places don't recognize our eating disorder. And then there's like the furthest stigma of not being critically underweight so it's almost like well you're fine. And I feel like even worse yet the fat phobia that we see in the medical system that would say oh well you should probably lose weight anyways. But the body doesn't work like that. When you're restricting as much as you probably are You're probably not going to lose weight. Or you know you might just be eating enough calories it's just not nutrient dense calories you know?\n\nOne thing that's really helped me in recovery is doing EMDR. I'm not saying it's a cure-all, but it could be worth looking into. I've also been seeing an individualized eating disorder specialist and that's helped too. Again, though my situation is different because I haven't always had this eating disorder it came on much later in my adult life and I actually used to love eating and I lived abroad for 2 years and I enjoyed trying new foods and whatnot so it's been quite the 180 to go from that to being afraid to eat most food and only having a small selection of foods that I feel okay eating.",

Unhealthier processed food are nearly the same every single time. So they become safe foods. As a kid you're developing and active and growing so you don't see the weight gain. Then you become an adult and everything slows down but you're still eating the same. So you start gaining weight.",
