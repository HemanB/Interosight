  "selftext": "I tried a hard boiled egg for the first time in years, and I tolerated it! I don\u2019t like the yolk part, so I popped it out and let my dog eat that part. I cut the egg white part into small pieces and added a handful of feta cheese, a good sprinkle of salt & pepper and red pepper flakes. Feta is one of my favorite foods, and had a similar texture to the egg whites so it helped make it easier. \n\nI also ate Greek yogurt with granola! It felt almost like a regular, normal breakfast.",
