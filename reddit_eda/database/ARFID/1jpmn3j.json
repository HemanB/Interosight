  "selftext": "This trend has been going around TikTok asking for tips but like not your normal tips like \u201cjust try and eat multiple small snacks through the day!\u201d Like no what\u2019s the weirdest things you do that helps you?? I\u2019ll go first:\n\nYou know those \u201cwhat my 21 month old eats in a day\u201d videos?? Yeah I watch those a lot so when I\u2019m having a hard time getting myself to eat, I pretend I\u2019m filming one for myself and literally will say as I\u2019m making my food \u201chere\u2019s what my me-month old ate or didn\u2019t eat today\u201d specifically in a British accent bc one of the moms I watch has one \ud83e\udd23 and then I\u2019ll go through all the foods im making and even make note of my mood or how I\u2019m feeling  so I\u2019ll be like \u201ctoday I offered her eggs and toast but she\u2019s been in a mood today so I don\u2019t have high expectations \u201c\n\nIdk it helps me bc it reminds me that I don\u2019t have to finish and it\u2019s okay. It makes it feel less serious and more fun! I\u2019ve also been an immersive daydreamer since I was a teenager so I think that factors into why this helps me so much. But even days when I really don\u2019t even wanna try, it\u2019s easy to be like okay but your me-month old needs to eat what would the TikTok people in your brain think if u don\u2019t feed her (myself)",

I didn't have anything to try though, so nothing was accomplished there. It's been months since I had my hands on shrooms too.. but I've also been considering getting extremely drunk and seeing how well that could help.\n\n- **having a dom/domme force me to try new foods--obviously in a sexual way:** I have no idea where I could find someone to participate with me in this (single, don't wanna hire anyone, don't know how to explain), but I think it'd be really hot if some dominatrix was basically forcing me to eat. I think my horniness would greatly override any anxiety I have related to trying new foods.\n\nEdit: guess these aren't really tips, but I have a fair bit of confidence they could actually help me, lol.",
