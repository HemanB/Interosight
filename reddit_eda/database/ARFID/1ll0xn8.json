  "title": "Teased at My New Job for Having ARFID",
  "selftext": "I\u2019m really struggling at my new job. I am self-diagnosed ARFID. The ONLY things I can eat are Kid Cuisine meals. It\u2019s just what I can handle. Every time I have tried to eat something else I feel like I'm going to pass out. But now that my coworkers know about it, things are getting out of hand.\n\nIt started with my colleague calling me a \u201clittle baby\u201d on the first day when they saw my lunch. Someone messaged me on Teams asking if I had my \u201cLunchables\u201d packed for the day. It's really escalated and now it feels like bullying. Every time I pull out my lunch everyone in the break room is like \u201cwhat\u2019s for lunch today? Another Kid Cuisine?\u201d One coworker even came up to me and said \u201coh look, it\u2019s a five star meal for the five year old.\u201d Another one started singing the Kid Cuisine jingle like I\u2019m some kind of freak.\n\nThe worst part is that my boss is actually getting in on it. I have a bowl cut, so my boss has started calling me \u201cMoe\u201d from The Three Stooges every time I walk into the break room. He even made a joke about how I \u201clook like a Moe with a side of chicken nuggets.\u201d And during a meeting last week, he said to the group, \u201cHey, if you\u2019re ever looking for Moe, he\u2019s probably in the break room eating his frozen dinner like a true adult.\u201d Everyone laughed but I just sat there feeling like I was going to burst into tears.\n\nThe entire vibe is OFF. I was telling a coworker that I don\u2019t like certain textures in food, and they mimicked the sound of me gagging while pretending to chew. \u201cWhat, do you need your food in a special texture for your kid meals?\u201d they said to me. Another time, when I was talking about how hard it is to go to parties where there\u2019s food I can\u2019t eat one of the HR people said \u201cyeah, I bet your idea of a party is one big Kid Cuisine buffet.\u201d\n\nI feel so humiliated. I know ARFID isn\u2019t something everyone understands. I wasn\u2019t expecting to feel like I\u2019m the joke of the office. I\u2019ve tried to laugh it off but it\u2019s starting to take a toll. I feel like I can\u2019t even eat without everyone watching and making snide comments. In fact, I've started to eat in my car alone. I got a microwave to work via the cigarette lighter in my car and heat them up and eat them alone in my car. \n\nHas anyone here had a similar experience at work? How do you deal with people who don\u2019t understand ARFID but are making fun of you for it? I really don\u2019t know how much longer I can take this. I have worked hard to get into this position and want everyone to be professional. We have a big client dinner at a hip Asian fusion restaurant coming up soon and I am SO nervous.",

Which surprised me as we work with kids with autism and I feel like that\u2019s a common condition within the autism community (I also have AuDHD). But he stopped after I had a meeting with him after work (I cried at this meeting to be honest). I did threaten with going to HR but sounds like you need to go above HR after submitting a formal complaint. Like many others have said, keep a notebook with dates, times, names, and what was said so you have a record. Be blunt yet professional as your medical condition doesn\u2019t deserve to be joked at. No one should say anything about your appearance unless it violates dress code. Consult with an employment lawyer",

While I can eat a few moreso \"normal\" things during lunch events, I generally legit eat Lunchables as a 30+ yr old, simply because it's quick and ez; pre-packaged + generally doesn't need to be microwaved. I mean, even my lunchbox is pretty kid-ish... Pastel pink, with unicorns & rainbows \ud83e\udd79 Lunchbox design choice aside-- Idk if no one bothers me bc I'm kinda masc/butch?? \ud83e\udd14\n\n\nI normally try to go somewhere the least crowded, and prefer eating alone to have privacy, but damn... I'm so sorry your coworkers are like that. That's honestly so depressing \ud83d\ude2d I hate bullies, and it's an unfortunately ugly reality that bullying actually doesn't stop after school and becoming an adult... It often continues, and sometimes seems way worse than before. You'd think people would mind their own damn business. \ud83d\ude24\u00a0\n\n\nIt's a shame I can't really recommend anything as a defense against them, because sometimes even HR is completely unhelpful... And I doubt if mentioning having a disorder would help, either; people tend to be cruel, to the point of wraponizing your own shit against you... just to continue making fun of you. \ud83d\ude14\u00a0The only thing I can think of is maybe attempting to find a different job, because NO ONE should be treating you like shit because of an eating disorder and sensory issues.\u00a0\n\n\nIt's ableist/discrimination imo and you should probably be keeping track of the dates, times, & names of all the people involved who keep making remarks like this, and what exactly they're saying... because if it happens *this* often, you should be able to make a case against them, or at least have it be written/recorded somewhere. Like, this bullying is the kind of shit that could take you down a *really* dark path... but I fear assholes like that wouldn't give a shit, regardless.\u00a0\n\n\nI just wanted to post to let you know you aren't alone \ud83d\udc96 Sometimes just knowing that can help, even a little.\u00a0\n\n\nI'm sorry I can't really help much personally, but I hope others here have some good advice!\u00a0",
