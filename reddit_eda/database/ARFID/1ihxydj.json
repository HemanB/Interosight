  "selftext": "i\u2019ve been home almost 4 hours and im hungry but i\u2019ve stayed in my room bc my dad loves to CAMP in the goddamn kitchen and i don\u2019t feel like talking to or eating around him or anyone else. i finally just went to the kitchen and he\u2019s still there and already started saying some shit to me and it just felt like he was hovering over me and it upsets me so much. is it just me who gets this bothered by stuff like this?? i know my emotional dysregulation makes it even worse but everytime stuff like that happens it either fills me with rage or makes me feel like im gonna burst into tears (or both).
