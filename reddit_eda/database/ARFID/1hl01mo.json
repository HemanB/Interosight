  "selftext": "I want to cry. I get being concerned, really. I know my diet isn't the best. Lol. But commenting on what I am eating and when and asking if I had food before and all that other stuff just stresses me out. Especially *right after* I went to grab food? Especially when the person commenting has judgements on what good is \"good\" and \"bad\" and makes it very clear? Especially when they aren't home half the day anyways? Especially when they dont respect my food choices? \n\nI feel guilty about not eating enough and making people concerned, but I'm trying my best and knowing people are constantly monitoring and watching when/what/how much I eat stresses me out so much. And I have a dietician and therapist too.\n\nI'm trying my best, but it just never feels good enough to people. And it just makes me want to stop trying so hard because even if I eat more and eat more of a variety, it feels like it'll never be enough for them. I wish I could just not care, but.... I do. I dunno. ",

But it triggers me nonetheless, regardless of their intent.\n\nYou have to first assess the boundary. I would suggest saying something along the lines of, \"I have an eating disorder/medical condition. I don't want to hear any comments about food, about my health, or about my body. Respect that or I will have to limit our interactions.\" \n\nI think most people without eating disorders will comment on food and bodies because for them it's often an easy conversation topic.",

Random ppl commenting on unhealthy eating vs your parents doing so are very different things, so which is it\u2026\n\nPersonally my parents/family made a lot of comments, which is understandable considering they were being forced to watch their daughter slowly kill herself from malnutrition. If they hadnt been making comments then that would mean they didnt care if their daughter died or not. Concern is a sign of love, when they stop making comments thats when you should question the relationship. Yes these types of comments arent usually helpful so i agree with you on that, but this post doesn\u2019t really seem to be about that and how to handle it, it seems to be a rant about the specific ppl making comments and thats what im pushing back against bc its truly sad to see you want to punish ppl for caring about you. Youre blaming them for their reaction but not willing to see that their reactions are that way bc they love you.",

I\u2019m fairly tolerant of queries and questions or comments about my eating habits and whatnot when it\u2019s a new person or stranger, and usually don\u2019t mind it unless they\u2019re really pushing it. Then I get frustrated at myself unfortunately and depressed.\n\nWent to Turkey and we were at a family friend\u2019s relative\u2019s house, where they had prepared a ton of local cuisine. All the people that didn\u2019t know me (which was 95% of the people there), particularly the women, were commenting about how I wasn\u2019t eating anything and asking if I didn\u2019t eat meat, then red meat, or whatnot and one even asked if I\u2019m anemic (I\u2019m not, somehow). This is all second hand as I don\u2019t speak much Turkish, and it was translated by friends, but anyway! Surprisingly one person who I\u2019d met a few times before came to my defense. I\u2019m not entirely sure what was said, but I appreciated it a lot, as it stopped further inquiries.\u00a0\nThis woman doesn\u2019t even fully understand how bad I have it with food, but she wanted to help. \ud83e\udd70 Maybe she saw how it was kinda a lot of people ganging up on me in a way haha.\u00a0",
