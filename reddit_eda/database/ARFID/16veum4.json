  "selftext": "Hi everyone! \ud83c\udf89  \nI am happy to announce I just launched the first version of my food checklist app made for people with ARFID!  \nThe app allows you to track your preferences, discover new foods, set goals, and share your food preferences with others.  \nIt is available on iOS for free with no in-app purchases or ads.  \nIf you use Android feel free to visit my website and join the waitlist.  \n[App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/arfid-picky-eaters-pitaya/id6448952961?platform=iphone)\n\n[Website](https://arfid.app/)  \nI am curious to hear your thoughts - feel free to comment or DM me with any feedback or ideas! Hopefully the app will be useful to you \u2764\ufe0f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hud4kibgq7rb1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=3056c3843d1e2356a3f35d7c696fa2c16d11eacf",

Maybe also a \u201cfrom certain places/brands\u201d checkbox for each item? Love the app idea!\n\nEdit: also a \u201cwith/without skin\u201d for meats fruits etc",

The food preferences you've put for \"choose your preference\" are so spot on.\n\nI love that you guys put mushrooms as a seperate category when most would put it with the vegetables because they are either such a love them or hate them food. It's very easy to cook them badly but even when they're cooked well, I can only tolerate the texture.\n\nA cool feature would be adding meals where you give put the average ingredients in that dish so we can say \"I like this meal but with/without this food\" and \"would like to try it with this added\". A good example is that I love tuna mornay (which is kinda weird even for non-disordered people) but don't like it with peas. Only corn which I still barely tolerate. Maybe ask here and see what the most common love/hate/want to try meals are.\n\nHuge plus, It's incredibly easy to navigate and understand. Awesome work. Not only is it great for the average person with ARFID, it's great anyone with loved ones with sensory issues around food. This is a game changer ARFID, so many parents with children who have autism or ARFID will love this app. Including older parents with adults who aren't great with technology. Advertise in groups pertaining to that demographic because I bet it would be incredibly helpful to them.\n\nI'm very impressed. Well done, dude.",
