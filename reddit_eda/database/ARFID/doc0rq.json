When I say mustard, the default understanding should be yellow.  Otherwise it's clearly trying to be \"fancy\"(read: pretentious) and I haven't got time for that nonsense.",

Just my own definition of \"burger.\"\n\nOf course, when I say \"most places,\" have a burger, I am excluding any place with any kind of remotely non-American food. Yup, nope, can't eat at any of those.\n\nI like spaghetti, but only Stouffer's frozen spaghetti. So Italian restaurants are out, too. Also I don't eat frozen spaghetti as often because of the cognitive load of deciding whether each bite should be spaghetti or meatball. And sometimes I accidentally get spaghetti and meat sauce, which I tried once when I made this mistake and I literally couldn't eat it because each bite has both.\n\nIt's fun, but I actually do OK these days. If I have to go out to eat socially, I try something that looks nonawful, take world's smallest nibble, say \"Yum, delicious!\" and then put it down forever. It's a running joke.\n\nAlso, when playing *Never have I ever*, \"...eaten a sandwich\" kills every other player, every single time.",
