  "selftext": "i see too many people rant about how arfid isn't a \"real\" disorder because people with it only eat \"processed junk.\" that people will eat if they're given a variety of foods rather than given access to what they like. does this not just infuriate y'all? i don't eat processed foods solely because they taste good, i eat them because it's the same texture and flavor every time. not to mention it's not only processed foods. i like black beans and rice, those two are fairly consistent with overall texture and flavor as well. \n\ni think the problem is very rooted in how not only are processed foods cheap, but they're familiar and similar each time you have them. a huge fear factor for me is having too many different textures and flavors on the same plate. i always eat pretty much one dish of the same flavor and texture because that's what i'm used to. unfortunately, usually the only foods that do this are processed. i don't understand what people don't get about that. \n\n(ps. i know it's probably weird i don't have any post history, i deleted my reddit account yesterday and started clean. i was actually pretty active on this sub before.)

It's similar for weight, I've seen people online mocking a person with ARFID who was overweight because \"If they really had ARFID they wouldn't be able to eat enough to be like that\" which is just so stupid lol.   \nI generally don't like the hate on processed food because, whilst health concerns are valid and understandable, people always make it into a morals thing. You are not morally \"bad\" or \"greedy\" because you eat processed or unhealthy food. It's just food , which says nothing about your personality or morals.....",
