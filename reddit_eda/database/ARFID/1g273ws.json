Eventually one of them asked why I turned down every invitation and I explained, \"As you know, I have an eating disorder that limits my palate and it is very difficult for me to find food to eat at the places you choose, and it's really uncomfortable to just sit there and watch everybody else eat.\" So the next time we were all going to dinner, I was asked to pick the restaurant. I chose a familiar restaurant I enjoy that had plenty of options, even for discerning palates.

Explain that it's more than just eating only chicken tenders. It's very close to a phobia of new food and textures and tastes because they can overwhelm us. Explain that eating at the same places can be very anxiety inducing and that it is extremely painful to live mentally, especially when people say we're being a burden because they can't eat what they want.",
