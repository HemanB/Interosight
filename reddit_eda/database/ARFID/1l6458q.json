  "selftext": "today my mom took me and my little sisters to a Vietnamese restaurant. at first i was worried bc ive never had Vietnamese food before and nothing on the menu even resembled a safe food for me. suddenly i get the great idea to open Doordash on my phone, bc they let you see what each dish looks like and show any modifications you can make to it. i decided to order pho (its like a vietnamese soup) but i took off the onions and cilantro and left the scallions. usually, seeing anything green in my bowl would immediately kill my appetite but today i was feeling brave. when the bowl finally gets to the table, i take a deep breath and dig in. IT WAS REALLY GOOD! the broth reminds me of my mom\u2019s soup (super flavorful and smoky like bbq kinda), and the scallions had zero taste. i even added some bean sprouts, which i can only eat if they are cooked down or hidden in something. because the broth was damn near boiling, it softened the bean sprouts so they didn\u2019t have that earthy taste. this was a crazy long rant im sorry but IM SO PROUD OF MYSELF FOR TRYING PHO! i nearly finished the entire bowl before i got full and opted to take the rest home.\n\n\nedit: thank you guys so much for the support :)",
