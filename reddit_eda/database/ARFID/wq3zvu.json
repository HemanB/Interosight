When I waste *hours* of my week trying to meal plan and find recipes that I'm not sick of or can actually tolerate the ingredients of, and when it comes time to cooking literally anything I planned on making, but I reeeeeeally don't wanna, and my toddler comes running to me asking me to make one of the only foods he'll eat and my internal response...
