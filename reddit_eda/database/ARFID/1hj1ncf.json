Then it's an awful guessing game matching the picture on the paper inside to rhe chocolates and hoping I picked correctly. There's maybe 4 total in this box that I like which means the remaining 90% of it goes to waste which is depressing. I wish I could just pop these in my mouth without giving a shit for once! Argghh!",
