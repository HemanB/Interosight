  "selftext": "This is kind of embarrassing but I'm sure this is a safe place to talk abt this and that I will find others in the same boat. Right now, I'm mainly surviving off 2-3 boost drinks a day and will have maybe some light dinner or candy or something. Food is just so... uninteresting. My brain usually doesn't want it. I don't ever feel hungry until much later in the day, and my choices are usually the same. I have a lot of foods I can eat, my problem is I have a disinterest and almost like lack of instinct to eat food. This is one of my low points but I know it's temporary. My ED typically reacts to stress. Anybody else want to share? Thanks for listening. ",

You can try to recreate the boost flavors, but I typically use whole milk Greek yogurt as it has a high protein and high calorie count and some type of juice and my favorite frozen fruits (and a sweetener like honey or maple syrup if you don't like just plain yogurt). I try to use high caloric fruits like pineapple and coconut. There's some juices with electrolytes in them which might be beneficial to you to use if this is all you're eating. You can also just make yogurt drinks if those are easier to drink. You can also try to mix it up by drinking both Smoothies and the boosts or switching off days etc :P\n\nIf you're not already doing this I also reccomend having a daily multivitamin.

Recently noticed instead of feeling hungry, I will get the shakes when my body needs food. It\u2019s the only indicator I have for now. Anytime I notice I\u2019m shaking I get an applesauce cup and a cottage cheese cup and eat them together. The protein sugar combo really seems to help.",
