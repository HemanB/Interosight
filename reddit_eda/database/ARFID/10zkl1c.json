Wouldn't you know it, people start calling them an asshole and ranting about how much they hate picky eaters. There was even one person pointing out that they probably have an eating disorder and people arguing back that they were still an asshole because their disorder was a \"burden\" on the family. Even more people said they should get a part time job because apparently kids with eating disorders don't deserve to eat unless they make money to feed themselves. I hate people.",

I struggle to chew and swallow foods I don\u2019t like and then I struggle to keep that food down. Its not like I\u2019d simply prefer something  else, eating that food is actually painful.\n\nY\u2019all get it though. You guys know. Its not a choice I made to want to eat a very specific set of foods. I want to eat more foods. I want to like them. I want to feel safe trying new foods. I want to be able to eat whatever is served. I want to be able to eat a more balanced diet. Its an inconvenience for me. If it was easy to just eat something I 100% would do that.\n\nJust because you don\u2019t experience the same thing as someone else, doesn\u2019t mean their experience is wrong. It is possible for people to experience the world in a way that is very much unlike your own. People don\u2019t seem to understand that their experience is not universal. They are the entitled ones. They are the selfish ones. They can\u2019t imagine someone might perceive things differently than they do so they see everyone\u2019s actions through the lens of their own experience and wonder why it doesn\u2019t make sense.",

This is partly why I have the disorder.\n\nAs a result of that, eating around people with whom I'm not 100% comfortable, is a nightmare. It's why I would order from the kids menu as a teen whenever we were at restaurants, because I didn't want to risk having a reaction in public because people would bully me if I did.

I don\u2019t choose not to eat things because I\u2019m not in the mood or its not my first choice. I can\u2019t eat things I don\u2019t like. My body literally fights it. I struggle to chew and swallow foods I don\u2019t like and then I struggle to keep that food down. Its not like I\u2019d simply prefer something  else, eating that food is actually painful.\n\nY\u2019all get it though. You guys know. Its not a choice I made to want to eat a very specific set of foods. I want to eat more foods. I want to like them. I want to feel safe trying new foods. I want to be able to eat whatever is served. I want to be able to eat a more balanced diet. Its an inconvenience for me. If it was easy to just eat something I 100% would do that.\n\nJust because you don\u2019t experience the same thing as someone else, doesn\u2019t mean their experience is wrong. It is possible for people to experience the world in a way that is very much unlike your own. People don\u2019t seem to understand that their experience is not universal. They are the entitled ones. They are the selfish ones. They can\u2019t imagine someone might perceive things differently than they do so they see everyone\u2019s actions through the lens of their own experience and wonder why it doesn\u2019t make sense.",
