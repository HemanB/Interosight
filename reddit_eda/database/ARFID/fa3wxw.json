  "title": "I tried Mac & Cheese!",
  "selftext": "I have SUCH an aversion for soft foods, and quite the big hatred for pasta in general ... but there was something about Mac and cheese that just made me want to try it at least once. Maybe it\u2019s the fact that there was cheese involved, and I like cheese? The fact that it seems to be literally everyone\u2019s comfort food? I don\u2019t know. Whatever the reason is, I still couldn\u2019t make myself take the leap and make a pot of Mac and cheese. But I recently got a dental procedure done where I need to eat soft foods (cue me, looking at a list of foods I can eat for the time being and struggling to find more than one) so my boyfriend and I went to the store and decided that it was time. Knowing that he would eat it if I didn\u2019t like it definitely helped me overcome the fear, and also the fact that I got to stand there and make it with him. \n\nI took it one noodle at a time and wasn\u2019t sure how I felt about it at first, I continued to pick at it periodically and decided that it was okay! I liked it. It was bland (it was Kraft, but unseasoned) which pushed me away from eating bigger bites but it wasn\u2019t bad! \n\nToday, I went to the grocery store and bought more of the same kind I ate yesterday. I made it (and screwed up the ratio of milk to noodle and almost scrapped the whole pot), added salt, pepper, Italian seasoning and garlic powder .. and also a few different kinds of shredded cheese along with the packet it came with to try and personalize the taste and make it less bland. It worked! I\u2019m currently eating full bites of it because it tastes so good. I\u2019m thinking next time I\u2019ll turn the cheese blend into more of a sauce so that it melts better but I think this is how I\u2019ll be making Mac and cheese from now on. Cause I\u2019m going to be eating it, for sure! I\u2019m so proud of myself.",

I made it recently and it is a similar texture to mac and cheese, but the sauce is blended pumpkin, and cream. This would be an excellent way to get some nutrients in! No pressure at all - just a suggestion. But if you're keen let me know and I will send you a recipe.",
