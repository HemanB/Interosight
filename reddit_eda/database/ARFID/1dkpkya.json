  "selftext": "Usually when you think of a picky eater it\u2019s just the quintessential \u2018chicken nuggets and fries\u2019 which is automatically placed upon us. But not all picky eaters are the same and sometimes they eat things that others don\u2019t. So what is that weird \u2018safe food\u2019 on your list? \n\nFor me I think my weird \u2018safe food\u2019 would be tofu. Idk why people dislike it it\u2019s basically plain, soft and chewy and has protein in it. ",
