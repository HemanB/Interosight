  "title": "The ANSWER Study: Are you a picky eater? Do you forget to eat? Do you worry that eating will make you vomit or choke?",
  "selftext": "ANSWER is a research study for adults with different eating habits. We are looking for adults who have trouble eating certain foods or eating enough and adults who do not have these difficulties. We want to learn how eating habits affect different parts of the brain and special chemicals in our bodies called hormones.\n\nTo do this, paid volunteers do two visits in Boston. At these visits, we use a machine called an fMRI to take pictures of the brain, we take small samples of blood to check hormones, and we ask questions about health and mood. We hope to use this information to help people who struggle with these eating habits.\n\nIf you decide to be part of the study, you will be given up to $300 to thank you for your time. You will also be paid back for the costs of getting to and from the visits. If you want to learn more about the study, please fill out the questions at the following link: [https://redcap.partners.org/redcap/surveys/?s=L9RDT7LEWEMWJJNH](https://redcap.partners.org/redcap/surveys/?s=L9RDT7LEWEMWJJNH)\n\nOr visit our website to learn more: [Rally | Seeking adults with eating difficulties for research study at MGH (massgeneralbrigham.org)](https://rally.massgeneralbrigham.org/study/answer) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c73i8hetulpd1.png?width=690&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6180c774a0b9bc250ebbfa1410e55b53c571981\n\n",
