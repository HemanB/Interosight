No unagi tho, tastes good but the texture is so yucky to me. \n\nHonestly it\u2019s cooked fish that I absolutely under no circumstances can do. The smell, the taste, the texture and bones, brother eughhhhhh it truly gives me one of the strongest food icks I\u2019ve ever experienced. \n\nBut some sushi, oysters, and shrimp are safe foods for me, surprisingly.\n\nAlso respect asf to anyone who disagrees.

The smell, the taste, the texture and bones, brother eughhhhhh it truly gives me one of the strongest food icks I\u2019ve ever experienced. \n\nBut some sushi, oysters, and shrimp are safe foods for me, surprisingly.\n\nAlso respect asf to anyone who disagrees.
