The funny thing about commercial food being in any way appetizing is how fake and made-up it all is.",

It\u2019s a kind of soup I guess. \n\nI have never put my mouth in it but smells delicious and is usually made in big groups in a pot for sometimes dozens of people at the time. Served hot and eaten anywhere a chair is available because people are busy talking among them or drinking and just having fun while the pot boils.\n\nSo it\u2019s the type of thing where I\u2019m definitely noticed while eating chips or the food I choose to repeat that day.",
