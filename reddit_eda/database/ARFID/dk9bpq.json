Or how it's bad enough that I'm ordering chicken tenders off the kid's menu but then I have to tell them I don't even want any sauce or anything with it. Like you think I want to be that guy ordering plain pasta with butter? I want to eat 'normal' meals and eat healthy but it's really hard. I don't want to start making faces and gagging in a restaurant and have to say \"it's not your food, it's me.\" ARFID is already bad enough without everyone's judgement.",
