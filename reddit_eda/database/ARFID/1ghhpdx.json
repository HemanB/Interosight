  "selftext": "As long as I can remember, I've found some foods completely repulsive. I literally can't bring myself to eat them. It always really confused me when someone would say they don't like a certain food but still eat it. Not only that, but I would also be really confused when I ate something and didn't like it but was reduced to gagging whenever it came near my mouth. But I've just realised that's what not disliking food it for most people and, when I not able to eat something it's probably ARFID.",

With some foods, my body gets sensory messages it doesn't understand and it jumps to the conclusion I am being poisoned so I gag or I get nauseated.

My fear foods give me a lot of anxiety, make me gag, etc. and I absolutely cannot casually eat them nor are they incorporated into my regular diet. But I do have many foods that are safe (don't cause more anxiety or make me gag more than my preferred foods) but that I simply do not prefer. Unfortunately, many of these foods that are safe but that I don't like are necessary for my diet. For example, I do not like the taste of chicken but it is my primary source of protein because most other sources of protein are unsafe. Likewise, I do not like foods that are salty but am prescribed a high salt diet. My lack of interest in food often makes it so that eating isn't enjoyable no matter what the food is, so I'd rather focus on getting the nutrition I need than on what tastes slightly better. At the same time, there are many times when I have so little bandwidth to force myself to eat that I feel less capable of eating anything but the safest and most preferred of my options. At these times, the foods that I dislike move more towards being unsafe instead of simply not preferred.",

Because my type is more sensory, and some people deal with PTSD from experiences such as choking, and then there are those like you - maybe there's something going on with the brain region that controls the actual desire to eat. The study could possibly include stroke patients who lose the motivation to eat and see if they can spot the smoking gun and then scan arfid sufferers and see if anything similar is going on with them.\n\nAgain, good luck, you've been through a lot of struggle with this.

Im talking about my experience, the thing you asked about, and you cant help but make it about you. Please learn some perspective, its exhausting trying to talk to you. Ive done the work to be able to be healthy, you clearly dont understand that you can do things to grow and dont just have to accept your situation as it is. Absolutes and black and white thinking are something they work on a lot in treatment, you may benefit from getting some.",

I have read a story here and there of arfid people who were sadly accused of being anorexic and treated as if they were lying and that's no good. \n\nThen the first person arfid accounts could be grouped into type(s) of arfid. More data could be gathered about whether they have conditions such as autism or ADHD, OCD, PTSD, etc. FMRI studies could look for neural connections and such.\n\nTreatment options need to be expanded as well, because I'll speak for myself anyway, not everyone is going to be desperate enough to try the bootcamp approach. Right now I'm looking at what changes I might make in order to improve my cholesterol so I don't have to go on a statin pill.
