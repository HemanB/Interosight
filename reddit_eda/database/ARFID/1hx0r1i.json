  "selftext": "*** *UPDATE * ***\nMy kid was released. F/U is in a week and they will see how child is doing then and re-evaluate. \nNow to just keep kiddo on a eating every 2 hours schedule.  Ahh.... like a newborn.  Thank you all so much for the advice, and love. I appreciate it more than you know. This has been so scary, and you all helped me through the last couple of days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI just need a hug and a place to rant.\nI have a child, 16, who was admitted yesterday due to hr in the 40s. They have lost 5lbs in the last month despite progress at home. They have been eating consistently and more over the last 3 weeks. We all though that the doctor at the appointment yesterday was going to tell us and child gained weight and be happy. Instead I was pulled back and told that child had to be admitted. RN walked us to the children's hospital that is connected right after.\nChild lost more weight  from admit check to this am, same scale, scrubs,  etc.\n\n\n\n\nThis sucks. I am trying so hard to keep it together while I am with my kid... but this just sucks.\nChild is under eating disorder protocols at the hospital and it is like prison.  No devices at all, restricted visitation, very strict diet with time limits and more. \n\n\n\nThere is just so much. Please tell me it is going to be okay. We have been working so hard with the care team, and I am afraid this will just make my child's anxiety worse.  Plus, school is back and they are not going, so more stress. \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",

      "body": "Sorry to hear what you and your family are going through. I was recently hospitalized for a month in an intensive ED facility. I was the only adult with ARFID, they didn't allow adolescents to have electronics. The facility held an ARFID meal group every week where I got to interact with the adolescents who had ARFID (there was only 2). One of them was hospitalized on the unit with me and the other was doing an outpatient program. The teen who had ARFID and was with me on the unit told me about how it sucked not having a phone, he felt alone due to the other children there grappling with other EDs he couldn't grasp. \n\nYou should explain to your child's care team how isolating of an experience they are putting her through. She can't really relate to the people he's hospitalized with. I understand not allowing him to use his phone in front of other kids who are in there but you should try to work something out with the staff for her to have private time on her phone or to contact you. Also if watching a show helps distract her from focusing on her food you should push that narrative to get her electronics maybe? If they say no then ask if she can read during mealtimes or do another distracting activity. \n\nAlso BUY HER FIDGETS!! She is probably going through programming and therapy sessions, having nee-doh, putty, or small stuffie will give her something else to focus on when things get super tough. I made a lot of bracelets when I was in there, and finished some lego sets. Goodluck!!!!",

      "body": "Aww it sounds like you guys had fun! The reasons for being sent back hopefully won\u2019t apply to them, but it was a mix of different things. I was extremely depressed and anxious and not very motivated to keep up with my treatment plan the first time around. I had a very stressful home environment. The second visit was better, I got away from the bad environment and was just sick of being so unwell all the time. \n\nMy mom tried her best and I don\u2019t blame her fully, but she didn\u2019t really understand. She would force me to eat and threaten to ground me or bring me back to the hospital if I didn\u2019t finish and it had the opposite effect. She wasn\u2019t the main factor of my home environment being bad, she was in a failing marriage and it was mostly the constant arguing and using my \u201ccondition\u201d as a weapon against each other. They blamed each other, which is silly because I was born this way as far as I\u2019m aware. My step father was actually much worse in that regard but I\u2019ve forgiven him as well. \n\nI kept losing weight and hiding food and I was very resistant to getting better. Part of it might have been to be rebellious tbh, I was just so angry at the time even though it was really only hurting myself. My second visit, she took the time to understand better and was very supportive and kept me on track. She encouraged me, but didn\u2019t force me. She didn\u2019t threaten me either. I had my ups and downs, but it was much better after that and I stayed out of the hospital and made continuous progress. My parents also finally divorced, which was hard, but my environment was much better. \n\nThe real trouble started when I moved away from home as an adult. During my early 20s, my arfid got worse. I couldn\u2019t eat at all and I no longer had a support system or anyone holding me accountable. I was picky before, but eating itself felt gross to me. I was paranoid about everything I ate making me sick, I couldn\u2019t eat more than a fistful of food or I thought my stomach would tear. \n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t know why it got worse suddenly. My only guess is that it happened around when covid struck, and I was having a lot of GI issues as well so it may have been stress piling up. It was easier for me to just fall into bad habits, and I didn\u2019t really take it that seriously until my health started really failing and then I admitted myself when I realized I couldn\u2019t do it alone. \n\nI am doing a lot better now though. I\u2019ve found this sort of balance with my arfid where I force myself to eat more and have some variety, but I don\u2019t push it so far that I\u2019m stressing myself out too much. I learned to do it all myself too. I think it\u2019s really important when your kid leaves the hospital that they have a good support system in place. Being forced to eat never helps, and motivation is extremely important. Positive reinforcement and encouragement, saying you\u2019re proud of them when they finish a difficult meal, not getting angry with them for symptoms but comforting them instead etc.\n\n It\u2019s a lot to deal with seeing someone you love suffer. But being someone they can come to for support instead of being ashamed to let them know they\u2019re struggling goes a long way. I was terrified to tell my parents when I was struggling for the longest time. Yes, they got better about that, but not before I ended up in the hospital again. Honestly, I\u2019m not a parent myself. I can\u2019t imagine how hard it must be for you. I only have experience being a difficult child lol. I do know that it\u2019s difficult for everyone involved. I know you want to do right by your child, and that is enough mostly. There\u2019s no such thing as being a perfect parent, just doing your best. As long as your child feels safe and loved and you\u2019re taking the time to understand what they\u2019re going through, I have faith that you\u2019ll do an amazing job.",

When you\u2019re there, try to bring a sense of normalcy to your kid. \n\nDuring visits, try to assure your kid that their health is more important than school. They can always catch up later. Some schools will even send work in, it could help keep your kids mind off of treatment at least and give them something to do that will help their anxiety (This is something usually coordinated with their guidance counselor). Try to act lighthearted and positive. Kids are sensitive to their parent\u2019s emotions. \n\nMy mom always acted very stressed, and it made me feel like a burden and always brought my already low mood down even lower. I know she was just worried about me, but the stress was contagious. My sister would just joke around with me and keep me company and it always helped and took my mind off of the situation.

I was the only adult with ARFID, they didn't allow adolescents to have electronics.

One of them was hospitalized on the unit with me and the other was doing an outpatient program. The teen who had ARFID and was with me on the unit told me about how it sucked not having a phone, he felt alone due to the other children there grappling with other EDs he couldn't grasp. \n\nYou should explain to your child's care team how isolating of an experience they are putting her through. She can't really relate to the people he's hospitalized with. I understand not allowing him to use his phone in front of other kids who are in there but you should try to work something out with the staff for her to have private time on her phone or to contact you. Also if watching a show helps distract her from focusing on her food you should push that narrative to get her electronics maybe? If they say no then ask if she can read during mealtimes or do another distracting activity. \n\nAlso BUY HER FIDGETS!! She is probably going through programming and therapy sessions, having nee-doh, putty, or small stuffie will give her something else to focus on when things get super tough.

Visit them as often as you can, bring things to keep your kid occupied (the boredom is the worst part after the intense treatment protocols and being watched all the time). I know they can\u2019t have devices, but things like books, journals, art supplies, etc if they\u2019re allowed. When you\u2019re there, try to bring a sense of normalcy to your kid. \n\nDuring visits, try to assure your kid that their health is more important than school. They can always catch up later. Some schools will even send work in, it could help keep your kids mind off of treatment at least and give them something to do that will help their anxiety (This is something usually coordinated with their guidance counselor). Try to act lighthearted and positive. Kids are sensitive to their parent\u2019s emotions. \n\nMy mom always acted very stressed, and it made me feel like a burden and always brought my already low mood down even lower. I know she was just worried about me, but the stress was contagious. My sister would just joke around with me and keep me company and it always helped and took my mind off of the situation. Lastly, your child will be okay! Yes, it is stressful for you both, but they are in good hands. It may be intense, but it\u2019s for the long term benefit of your kid.",

          "body": "Aww it sounds like you guys had fun! The reasons for being sent back hopefully won\u2019t apply to them, but it was a mix of different things. I was extremely depressed and anxious and not very motivated to keep up with my treatment plan the first time around. I had a very stressful home environment. The second visit was better, I got away from the bad environment and was just sick of being so unwell all the time. \n\nMy mom tried her best and I don\u2019t blame her fully, but she didn\u2019t really understand. She would force me to eat and threaten to ground me or bring me back to the hospital if I didn\u2019t finish and it had the opposite effect. She wasn\u2019t the main factor of my home environment being bad, she was in a failing marriage and it was mostly the constant arguing and using my \u201ccondition\u201d as a weapon against each other. They blamed each other, which is silly because I was born this way as far as I\u2019m aware. My step father was actually much worse in that regard but I\u2019ve forgiven him as well. \n\nI kept losing weight and hiding food and I was very resistant to getting better. Part of it might have been to be rebellious tbh, I was just so angry at the time even though it was really only hurting myself. My second visit, she took the time to understand better and was very supportive and kept me on track. She encouraged me, but didn\u2019t force me. She didn\u2019t threaten me either. I had my ups and downs, but it was much better after that and I stayed out of the hospital and made continuous progress. My parents also finally divorced, which was hard, but my environment was much better. \n\nThe real trouble started when I moved away from home as an adult. During my early 20s, my arfid got worse. I couldn\u2019t eat at all and I no longer had a support system or anyone holding me accountable. I was picky before, but eating itself felt gross to me. I was paranoid about everything I ate making me sick, I couldn\u2019t eat more than a fistful of food or I thought my stomach would tear. \n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t know why it got worse suddenly. My only guess is that it happened around when covid struck, and I was having a lot of GI issues as well so it may have been stress piling up. It was easier for me to just fall into bad habits, and I didn\u2019t really take it that seriously until my health started really failing and then I admitted myself when I realized I couldn\u2019t do it alone. \n\nI am doing a lot better now though. I\u2019ve found this sort of balance with my arfid where I force myself to eat more and have some variety, but I don\u2019t push it so far that I\u2019m stressing myself out too much. I learned to do it all myself too. I think it\u2019s really important when your kid leaves the hospital that they have a good support system in place. Being forced to eat never helps, and motivation is extremely important. Positive reinforcement and encouragement, saying you\u2019re proud of them when they finish a difficult meal, not getting angry with them for symptoms but comforting them instead etc.\n\n It\u2019s a lot to deal with seeing someone you love suffer. But being someone they can come to for support instead of being ashamed to let them know they\u2019re struggling goes a long way. I was terrified to tell my parents when I was struggling for the longest time. Yes, they got better about that, but not before I ended up in the hospital again. Honestly, I\u2019m not a parent myself. I can\u2019t imagine how hard it must be for you. I only have experience being a difficult child lol. I do know that it\u2019s difficult for everyone involved. I know you want to do right by your child, and that is enough mostly. There\u2019s no such thing as being a perfect parent, just doing your best. As long as your child feels safe and loved and you\u2019re taking the time to understand what they\u2019re going through, I have faith that you\u2019ll do an amazing job.",
