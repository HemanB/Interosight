The people that know the most about working with ARFID though are occupational therapists. :)\n\nThe way it works takes a while. First you identify what tends to trigger your arfid (texture, temperature, color etc) and from there create a hierarchy of foods from least distressing to most distressing. After that my dietitian helped me choose 1 or 2 foods a week to incorporate into meal times. I didn't have to finish the food, but I was pushed to tolerate it for as long as possible. If there was a food I'd never been exposed to before we tried in a private session. I was asked to use my senses (touch, smell etc.) And then reflect on my level of distress and any emotions/thoughts/urges I had surrounding the food. I would start with a very tiny piece of the food in my mouth and hold it there to actually experience the texture and flavor. The more I exposed myself to a particular food, the easier it got to eat or finish. Since starting treatment I have been able to add bell peppers, cashews, oatmeal, and some cucumbers to my diet!",
