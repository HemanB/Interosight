  "selftext": "Just saw a post on AITA asking if it was wrong that they don't take their girlfriend to nice restaurants because of her extremely limited diet. The entire comment section is people saying how immature and rude she's being because of her diet and that he should just dump her because of this issue. Just calling her a child in general and judging her. \n\nWho gives a shit? Why do people care so much about us eating simpler food? It's like someone being a \"picky eater\" as it were suddenly gives people the license to look down on and patronize them. So frustrating, how about they don't judge others when they have no idea what's going on with them?",

I think it's hard enough living withit without others judging, because I don't thik other people realise how much of human society is built around food. You go to dinner with friends, every major holiday involves specific food, I sometimes worry i might offend someone from a different culture because as much as I'd like to try other foods, I don't eat fish or spices or meat of any kind, and too much of other cultures dishes involve those three things.\n\nI don't know if it's just that people don't recognise it's a proper disorder, but I always dread having to explain to people about my diet. I always circle back to that lady from My Strange Addiction with the French Fries. She was the butt of the joke for so many react channels, and I can recognise that objectively, eating a blue french fry and crying over it is a bit silly, but I knew exactly what she was going through, and it's kinda hard to see that if you haven't lived through it I think.",

People without eating disorders will not understand that. People who are not neurodivergent will not understand that. I refuse to feel bad for having an eating disorder, especially because I try to find something I can eat everywhere I\u2019m taken out to eat, and I make my own safe foods at home if everyone is having a meal I don\u2019t want. I will not feel bad for being different. \n\nYou should not feel bad for being different. None of us should. Those commenters do not understand what it\u2019s like to be viscerally disgusted by the taste, texture, look, or smell of certain foods. Lucky them. That\u2019s why we can\u2019t take the shit they say to heart.

Like I have afrid and i wouldn\u2019t want to go to Chinese restaurants if I\u2019m going to just get fries and not their signature food? The OP was right in a way where it didn\u2019t even make sense for him why she would want to even go there in the first place. But she probably just enjoys going out to check new places and going out which is soooo fine and she has every  right to do so. \n\nBut him getting upset with her about her food choices is so weird ? And telling her she eats like a child is super disrespectful and I would dump him if I was the girl tbh. I grew up in a family that never validated or respected my afrid and it honestly hurt me so much. I really feel for the girlfriend and I would hate it if my partner hated me for that. It\u2019s obvious they are not compatible and if he truly loved or cared for her he would do it a a genuine gentle way. He could educate himself about picky eating , talk to her more and try to understand why shes feel this way.  He was getting fed up with for a while until he exploded. He could\u2019ve handled it so much better and actually had a proper conversation with understanding and compassion. Which he doesn\u2019t seem to have any towards her. \n\nHe hasn\u2019t really shown any concern for her health and the fact she might not even get nutritional value or anything. He seems too focused on the fact she\u2019s \u201cwasting \u201chis money by buying food he doesn\u2019t approve at restaurants.\n\nThe girlfriend may have afrid (high possibility) and her boyfriend acting this way is such a red flag. The way he handled the whole situation is wrong. She hasn\u2019t really done anything wrong because he never talked to her about it. He just let it build up. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if her boyfriend doesn\u2019t like her anymore. i think if he genuinely loved her, I don\u2019t think he would see her that way and say that stuff.\n\nIt lowkey makes me scared and sad if my significant other ever thought of me like that. They really have no idea how difficult it is to be us and what we go through. I went through a lot of pain from family treating me this way, when they truly have no idea how mentally challenging it was to even think about trying new food.\n\nAs for the comments it\u2019s sadly expected , people hate us so much and I just don\u2019t understand why??  \nLike Why does it bother them so much what we eat. I wish they showed genuine concern or questions instead of straight up bullying and belittling. It\u2019s so mean and it speaks so much about their character. And what if someone is just a picky eater?? Why is that a problem I don\u2019t understand\u2026  I guess it is when people make food their personality that behave like this . It\u2019s just rlly not that serious. Ppl r just bullies and like to force ppl to do things they don\u2019t want to do :)\n\nOP and his girlfriend are just not Compatible   or he has lost feelings. Like since he\u2019s a foodie and she\u2019s a picky eater and no honest communication\u2026 it was bound to crash.",

People can be really horrible to us for absolutely no reason, which just makes struggling with the ED itself that much harder.\n\nAnd you are absolutely right about those shows. I've seen many episodes of eating and addiction shows, especially British ones for some reason, where the person in question very obviously has ARFID and are treated just horribly. Talked down to, told it's a choice and they just need to try new food. I remember one episode where the person could only eat fries and everyone in his life thought he was pathetic for doing so, it's not like it's a huge struggle for HIM rather than the people around him. I honestly can't watch those shows at all, I find it just disgusting they way people like us are treated in the media.",
