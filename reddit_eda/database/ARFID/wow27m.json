  "selftext": "I am so annoyed. Over the past 4 years I\u2019ve seen about 6-7 different doctors for this eating disorder. Not a single one knew what ARFID was. I\u2019ve seen nutritionists, psychologists, even homeopathic specialists, and no one seems to know about this ARFID condition. I\u2019m tired of explaining these habits to \u201cexperts\u201d who have to literally ask me to spell it out for them so they can google it later on\u2026and my biggest fear in all of this is that I\u2019ll finally find someone who knows about this condition and how to treat it, but that they\u2019ll just misdiagnose me with anorexia as many people on this page have said has happened to them after explaining their situation to specialists. \n\nI\u2019m so grateful I found this page a few years back\u2026it\u2019s made me feel SO not alone in this. For a long long time I felt like this was just me who had a horrible relationship with food\u2026.and I\u2019m just grateful to have everyone here that relates and can remind me that I\u2019m not alone in this.",

It's always \"no, don't tell me about it, tell me your symptoms\". Which is fair enough I guess, and that approach makes sense in a lot of ways, but it usually leads to them trying to shoehorn my symptoms into some other eating disorder that they have heard about. Which is not helpful at all. \n\nBest approach I have seen is to look into any eating disorder organisations in your country / area. They can often suggest nutritionists and therapists (and sometimes doctors) that they know are knowledgeable on ARFID. I think once you're in the door of these places, they'll have seen several people like you, and should know how to find a doctor who is knowledgeable on ARFID, or how to best approach a doctor with his information if it is new to them.",
