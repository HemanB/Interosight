  "selftext": "I (17m) was starving at a thanksgiving party at my house, and my dad whispered to me he ordered food for me that the driver could leave at the door and I can go and eat upstairs. I heavily doubted it, but my food arrive and I got to eat upstairs in my room alone because I\u2019m too embarrassed to eat different food in front of everyone else. Anyway, uhh if y\u2019all order DoorDash tip your drivers godammit!!!!",
