  "selftext": "Me (22F) and my bf (22M) went and got pho at a new restaurant. I always order the same thing: Pho (beef broth) no meat just veggies. Everywhere I go the veggie options differ. When I got there the waitress didn\u2019t know the veggies in the Pho which is fine, their\u2019s a large variety. She remembered a couple so I told her I didn\u2019t want carrots, or cilantro. \n\nWhen I got my pho their were so many veggies in there. First I thought sweet corn would be like loose corn but it\u2019s a whole tiny little mini corn. There were also 3 unidentified veggies. My bf made me try a little piece of all of them and he tried them too. He was asking me which texture was the worst (they all sucked) trying to figure out what I like and don\u2019t like. He offered me some of his crab which I really liked it was so fluffy and fun to chew. \n\nAnyways we spent 10 mins using chopsticks pulling out every single veggie I didn\u2019t like. I do this at every place but it usually takes 1-4mins. He didn\u2019t eat until we got all the yucky stuff out of my noodles. He also doesn\u2019t get weird when I order things and take it off. I like the flavor in some stuff but the texture is a big fat no (ex. onion) \n\nWhen I reflected on this I really started to tear up, I was once absolutely humiliated by a random student in front of the whole lunchroom in elementary because of my food choices and it caused a bunch of commotion. Kids from the tables within my vicinity stood up to stare at my lunch and laugh. People forgot about it once the week ended thankfully.",

He encourages, without pressure, to try things, but he will take w/e I don't want, and is supportive when I order something to specifications, but it comes out wrong. Cause I will anxiety not eat anything rather than send it back.\n\nI'm glad you found a partner that is supportive and understanding. I'm so happy for you!",

Never underestimate the power of having a supportive person in your life! My sister also is pretty good about telling me everything that's in something she's made and never pressures me to try anything.",
