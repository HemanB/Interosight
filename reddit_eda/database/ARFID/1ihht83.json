Correlation does not equal causation. I actually looked into this more and yeah that image doesn't capture the full story.

You will, however, not do well at all if you starve yourself. \n\n  \nI would say if she continues to send you passive aggressive fear mongering images about food, you need to tell her you are going to block her and not respond to her messages.

You could always be petty back and comment on something in her lifestyle. \n\n  \nStuff like this just pisses me off. I am not interested in being made to feel bad for what I eat.
