  "selftext": "I keep catching myself lying about liking or knowing other foods outside my safe circle. My friend was talking to me about fast food places, then that turned into talking about burgers and what one is the best. She was ranting about how the burgers at ___ were better than the ones at ___ and I just kept agreeing and building on what she was saying despite never having a burger in my life. Something similar happened when we were talking about soft drinks, I claimed I liked Pepsi more than other drinks even though I\u2019ve never had anything other than water and a very certain apple juice brand lol. Is this a universal thing or am I just too ashamed of my arfid",

Sometimes I feel like if I share my real food opinions then I\u2019ll just shut down the conversation. People don\u2019t really like to hear about how you don\u2019t like most food, it\u2019s not relatable as most people have such a natural food motivation.\n\nFood is also so intertwined with morality that if I say \u2018I don\u2019t like that\u2019 or \u2018I don\u2019t really eat that\u2019 then it sometimes seems like people take it as me trying to act superior/like I\u2019m some health goddess who would never touch (whatever food the other person likes or brought up in the conversation). I promise I don\u2019t think I\u2019m better than you because I won\u2019t touch your fave food! And eating a good variety of foods you love is way healthier than my boring and bland diet anyway. But a lot of people don\u2019t get that because they subconsciously connect a restrictive diet with health even though that\u2019s not really how it works \ud83d\ude2b",
