      "body": "Yeah there's definitely a lot of ignorance still around ARFID. I mean, even from nutritionnists and such, I'm pretty sure there's got to be like 5 at max who know about it in my country in the EU. And I think, as with a lot of mental health stuff, representation in media always plays a big part in people's knowledge and impression of different things,and I'm pretty sure just like you all, I have never even seen any character ever with ARFID.\n\nI'm lucky I've mostly had folks not be too judgemental/harsh about it, just accepting it/ not caring and moving on, but there can still be the small joke here and there, not even meant to insult, but that can be a bit hurtful after you've heard a lot about \"what, you've never eaten pizza/hamburger/ x type of food? you're missing out you know...\"\n(special mention here to family members and friends who've been really understanding to me, especially when I've managed to explain more about what's my problem thanks to knowing about ARFID. I know I'm very lucky to have that and hey, if your family and friends aren't as supportive, know that this community is, and we understand the struggle)\n\nAt the end of the day, it's just like a lot of mental health issue, since you know, it is one itself. Just like you won't cure someone suffering from depression by telling them to enjoy life more, you won't solve someone's arfid by shoving food in their mouth.\n\nJust like with other mental health issue, it's something that takes a lot of time to try and improve upon. Something that bothers you a lot (not ranking anything here, it's just that it's something that bother you in every day life, in situations where other folks might not even think about it, like jesus the amount of thinking I waste because hanging out with folks who don't know your food problems is so annoying since you always wonder where you'll eat, wether there'd be something there for you to eat...), and just like with other mental health issues, while it doesn't shows on our faces, it doesn't mean that it's not there.\n\nGood luck to you all, I've only started to try out some food sometime that isn't too far in texture from what I normally eat at 22. I'm 24 now, my diet has barely changed, I've only tried small things here and there. Still, I'm super proud that now I've started to try things a bit from time to time. And there's no shame in how long it might take you to try. There's no shame in not swallowing things when you try them, or gagging just by trying to bite something, smelling it... Mental health isn't sometyhing you can magically have full control over. But I believe in you. Even if it takes you years to try some stuff, even if you just try that one thing that one time, it's still progress, trying out even one new thing is still a huge improvement and we're proud of you. And I'm glad there are folks talking about it when we get the opportunity. That's how folks will slowly learn of it. Even if it takes time, it's worth spreading the word, especially since it helps folks suffering from it know this diagnosis even exist. I know it's been a huige relief to know this exist and to finally learn some more stuff about this whole big part of me. And I'm sure it'll be just as useful to many others suffering from this.",

Chicken fingers? A hotdog with ketchup?\n\n> people are willfully misinterpreting the point at issue as a matter of health or diet, but clearly the issue is that it is unattractive to knock back four cokes like a god damned 9 year old at chuck e cheez\n\nThere are so so many more. I just wow I know Twitter is toxic but this is by far the most toxic non political tweet replies I\u2019ve seen.\n\nLike yeah soda isn\u2019t good for you, and 4 cups is a bit much. But we don\u2019t even know how large the cups were. I normally order water nowadays but I know for a fact when I\u2019m nervous while out to eat I drink like crazy. I\u2019ll go through 5 glasses of water in no time. So if that was soda in front of me I\u2019d be doing the same thing.\n\nAnd then the whole ghosting the guy over it like how immature can you be. You notice one thing on the first date \u201coh wow he drank 4 cups of coke\u201d and decide to ghost him. Couldn\u2019t ya know be an adult and ask \u201cHa ha sure did drink a lot of coke is that common for you?\u201d You\u2019re on a date you can ask questions like that.\n\nNow not wanting to be with someone because their life style/health is something you couldn\u2019t support is totally ok and understandable, but you can\u2019t immediately judge those factors from a first date unless it\u2019s super duper obviously a common issue. \n\nAtleast let the guy know why you didn\u2019t want to have a 2nd date instead of ghosting over his drinks. That\u2019s just honestly the most annoying part of it all to me, ghosting is one of the most childish things someone can do when dating.\n\nAnd the comparisons to it being the person acting like a child? Uh the other majority of America adults included drink a lot of soda. (Not to mention this country\u2019s unhealthy obsession of alcohol) It\u2019s definitely not a trait I attribute to being childish.",
