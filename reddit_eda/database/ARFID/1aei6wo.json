He also sounds like such an awesome friend. \u2764\ufe0f\n\n\nAbout a week ago, I just started talking to someone to date and was dreading bringing up a few conditions, but especially ARFID (even compared to shit like chronic fainting, gastroparesis, kidney issues, legs constantly giving out/losing function, etc. that most people wouldn't expect since I don't \"look\" disabled and am in my late 20s). And he just so happens to be autistic (pretty sure I am, too, so that was a pleasant surprise) and when I told him I have ARFID, he happened to know about it a bit already and was just simply like, \"What can I do to help with it? And what all should be avoided when we're together?\" My jaw dropped, lmao. I was elated, especially because a big thing he said on his profile was about him being a foodie too, and even specifically loving some foods I can't be within 50 ft of, lol.\n\n\nWe need more people like them in the world, fr fr.",
