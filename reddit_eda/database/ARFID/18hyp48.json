      "body": "Hey, as a mom of a kiddo with ARFID, please understand that even if you weren't able to eat the broccoli trying it at all is still a win. Progress is progress and exposure is key. You're brave for posting this and this Internet stranger is super proud of you. \n\nAs a piece of advice though, sometimes forcing yourself to swallow things can be counterproductive and can create subconscious stress or fear around certain foods. Even if you just place it in your mouth and immediately spit it out it still counts as an exposure, and the more exposure you get to textures/flavors the more likely you'll be to tolerate or even actually enjoy them. My son will take a bite and spit it into the trash so many times before he figures out whether or not he actually likes or hates it. I think it's because, as you mentioned, even if the taste isn't a problem sometimes there's an unexpected element that takes some getting used to or the multiple flavors and textures just overwhelms your senses. I guess long story short, it's okay to go at your own pace. You can stay within your comfort zone and still manage to add new foods to your safe food list, there's just a balance to find. Maybe try to give yourself a reasonable \"exit plan\" when it comes to trying new food, even if you don't use it sometimes just knowing you have the option to taste but don't have to commit to an actual chew-and-swallow bite is comforting. Obviously do whatever works best for you, I'm not trying to tell you how to live your life. Just thought I'd share what I've learned so far from a momma perspective \ud83e\udef6",

      "body": "Take it slowly. If you push yourself too far you can \u201ctraumatize\u201d (i use that word lightly here) yourself and just make it even harder the next time you try it. Exposure therapy works best in increments. Going from i cant eat broccoli to im eating broccoli is a huge jump. In treatments they approach it more step by step. \n\nStep one is you plate it. You did that so congrats thats a win in and of itself! Once you can get comfortable with it on the plate and get comfortable with it touching other foods, then step two is putting it in your mouth. That could be licking it, taking a tiny nibble, or simply trying it and spitting it out when it becomes too overwhelming. For example, a good place to start if you like pasta is to eat your favorite pasta with really tiny flakes of broccoli in it. \n\nWhen you can at least let it touch your mouth without too much distress then try eating it. Based on the pic those are pretty large chunks of broccoli. It may be better to cut them up into really tiny pieces and then eat it mixed in with the other food. You could even shred it to make is as minimally noticeable as possible. So instead of just a bite of broccoli, theres just a tiny bit on the fork but the majority of the bite contains a safe food. So in that pic eat a piece of carrot with a tinny bit of broccoli. You may start off with a fork thats 75% carrot/meat and 25% broccoli. Then work up to a bite thats more of a 50/50 ratio and so on until you can eat a full bite of broccoli without breaking down crying.\n\nIts great you\u2019re pushing yourself, that deserves congratulations, but you shouldn\u2019t be so distressed that youre crying. A response like that isnt going to be very helpful in the long run when attempting exposures. Yes this was successful, but in the long run you may actually see more success in tolerating this food if you don\u2019t push so hard. It may sound counterintuitive, cause pushing yourself as far as you can go is usually a good thing, and while it is commendable its not necessarily the best tactic for beating ARFID. \n\nYou need to build trust with yourself. Trust that eating this food isnt so bad. If you force yourself to the point of crying youre breaking that trust with your own brain. If you allow yourself to stop when it becomes too overwhelming youll trust that the next time you try it, it wont be so bad bc youll know your distress will stay at manageable levels. We do need to learn to tolerate distress but there are lines where thats not helpful and will only leave us with a bad impression. The point of food exposures is to try to create good impression, to show your brain that wasnt so bad. So stopping when your distress reaches a certain point serves that purpose.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely commendable that you\u2019re pushing yourself, dont stop that but also try to be skillful in how you approach it. We kinda have the opposite problem as binge eaters. Someone with that diagnosis may avoid a certain food too much, causing them to break and go on a binge. For us its the opposite, if we force too hard we can break and then end up restricting that food even more. Its common to see \u201crelapses\u201d in treatment of ppl who did too much exposure which resulted in such an overwhelmed state that they then restrict heavily. So just find the balance that works best for you. Take this as a win absolutely, im just saying to be careful not to push too far to where it has the reverse consequences.",

So like adding a little touch of something to your safe food. \n\nFor example when I was younger, I would love \u201cnachos\u201d- plain refried beans, chips, cheese, plain cubed boiled chicken (only when made at home). Later, I moved to shredding the chicken, which I actually found better.\n\nThen, I ended up trying pineapple chicken at a restaurant and really liking it- it was similar to what I already had, with a predictable and good flavor with affecting the texture much, if anything softening it.\n\nSo *then* I cooked the shredded chicken in pineapple juice, added to nachos. Then I tried a slightly spicier bean. Then I really went \u2728crazy\u2728 and added cinnamon and red pepper to the pineapple chicken. I became okay with jalepenos on it as long as I could pick them off because I didn\u2019t mind the lingering taste. now I even eat them with sour cream! \n\nIt was a long multi year process that was entirely accidental, but it\u2019s the best way for Arfid food therapy to work often times.\n\nI also realized with this realization that my disgust was about *novelty* that a lot of foods I actually liked the smell, taste, and even texture of, but my brain was telling me it was disgusting and I should spit it out/gag because it was foreign. It was a really disconcerting realization to come to, but it helps now to think about it in that sense when I nibble or try something every once in a while, just a taste or a bite, to familiarize myself with it over time! Predictable texture is definitely a must for me but there\u2019s a lot of foods that check that box.\n\nI\u2019ve added more foods recently than in my entire life, and it\u2019s so great. Trying new food is so much less of an ordeal as well! \n\nI hope things keep getting easier!!",
