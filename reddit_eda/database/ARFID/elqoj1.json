I found this community because I was looking for help for my son who is a very poor eater and I started to realise that at 7 he was actually frightened of food, not just being a fussy kid (I'm pretty confident I didnt do anything to pass on my fears, I have 3 other kids with no food issues). I didn't even realise I had it too and how scared I was of certain foods until I started talking about it. I'm glad I can help my son better now and approach things the way I would need to be approached...but I feel a bit unsettled by discovering that I have this too.",
