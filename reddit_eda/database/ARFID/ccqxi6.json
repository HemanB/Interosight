      "body": "I don't really think it's a mental illness. If you can obtain all the nutrition you need from a small variety of foods, there really isn't a need to eat anything else. Being picky requires you to do a bit of planning, but you never have to really worry about eating out, or recipes, or trying new things. It saves a lot of time and money. The worst is when it's a special occasion. You often just have to suck it up and figure out a way to either eat something you don't like, or get a good excuse. I know a lot of them. You can often say you are on a special diet, or that you have been having problems with IBS, or gluten, and you are trying to avoid X. Say you are on a cleanse. There are plenty of excuses not to eat. \n\nNone of the above should be construed to be an endorsement for anorexia or any other dangerous practice or disorder. But if you don't want to eat kale, you don't have to.  \n\nAnd if you are really concerned that by not eating any green vegetables, for example, you are not getting enough fiber, you can take a fiber supplement, as well as supplements for any other micronutrient you think you're not getting by not eating enough broccoli, or something.",
