I don\u2019t remember to ask every time and it bugs me. It\u2019s unfair to people with ARFID as well as people with allergies. Going out to eat is already hard enough, I just want to know what I\u2019m getting.",

Little bit later, waitress comes out with something that is nothing but colors: green, white, orange, etc; looked more like a Mexican meal. \n\nI told her she must have the wrong order, and she looks at me funny and says \u201cbag of fries, right?\u201d Turns out that it was fries smothered in all kinda of nonsense. Yet this was never even remotely stated on the menu, only \u201cbag o\u2019 fries\u201d",
