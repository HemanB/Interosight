There is a food that I have purchased many times, because I wanted to like it, but for some mysterious reason I just could never get into it.\n\n\nOver the past thirty years, every once in a while I would buy some pita bread and a tub of hummus, thinking it was a healthy snack I should eat and enjoy. It does taste good. For some reason I would always have some the first day, but never finish the rest. Cannot tell you how many expired mostly full hummus containers I\u2019ve tossed. \n\n\nRecently had my blood work done and got tested for food allergies. Turns out I am allergic to one food:sesame seeds. Hummus is made with chickpeas and sesame seed paste (tahini). I never knew I was allergic to sesame seeds, probably because the occasional seed on some bread did not sufficiently bother me but my body knew to reject the hummus (never had any obvious allergic reactions though)",
