  "title": "I survived eating at a job interview!!",
  "selftext": "Lurker here (28, she/they). I started therapy almost 5 years ago with the goal of being able to \"pass\" as a regular vegetarian at academic job interviews. \n\nAnd I finally did it! I tried a Thai tofu dish including a mystery sauce, a very complex mediterranean pizza with tahini, and a pasta dish with some vegetables I couldn't eat. I let myself request one substitution or omission for each thing, breathed deeply, drank a lot of water, and focused on the conversation and I GOT THROUGH IT! I didn't finish any of the meals but was able to eat enough not to starve or draw too much attention. The committee was understanding and it was a non-issue.\n\nthis is a HUGE success that I thought I'd never be able to do. My life and anxiety have improved so much in five years!! I just wanted to share with people who get it. Regardless of whether I get this job, I feel like I've already succeeded. :)",

As badly as I want to get invited for interviews, I\u2019m (almost) relieved I haven\u2019t had any luck yet. I have a hard enough time navigating food when job candidates interview in my department and I need to have one single group lunch with them. How the hell am I supposed to get through a faculty filled weekend of meals?\n\nHuge huge win for you no matter what, but fingers crossed you get an offer!",
