  "selftext": "My grandson lives with me, (9 years old) and he has ARFID. His list of safe foods is slowly getting longer with therapeutic help, but he wasn't gaining weight, and he wasn't eating a mix of even the few foods he likes. \n\nSo I started making him bento box meals. Each little section gets a different safe food, and the large section gets a protein selection that he likes. The tiniest section gets a food I think he might like but isn't on his safe list, and it's up to him if he wants to try it or not-- no pressure. No reward or punishment if he tries the new food or not. \n\nHe can grab one bento whenever he likes, and if he's finished with most of it, he can grab another one if he's still hungry. I have up to five prepped in the fridge all the time. \n\nI started doing these about six weeks ago, and he usually eats two after school, completely gone except the new sections. He might eat another two at dinnertime if I make a food he doesn't like. During Christmas break, he often ate four full bentos, along with a breakfast. \n\n He's tried two new things, one of which is now on his safe food list (pomegranate). That's really big for him. Plus he's gained a pound. \n\nAnd I know he's eating the widest variety of foods his diet will allow every day. While the lunches seem boring to me, he seems happy to open each one, and I am much happier knowing he's not only eating chicken nuggets every day. \n\n\n ",
