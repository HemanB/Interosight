  "selftext": "Does anyone else do this? It\u2019s very annoying on top of my texture issues that severely limit what im able to eat. I often go through periods where ill be eating something I enjoy but then always on the last bite and only the last bite, it makes me gag and I can\u2019t swallow it so I just spit it out. It\u2019s a little embarrassing when my partner is around but thankfully he knows it\u2019s an issue. I just feel pretty alone on this and can\u2019t find any answers anywhere ",
