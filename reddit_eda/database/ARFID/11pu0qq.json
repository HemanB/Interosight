Upped my antidepressant which also kills appetite, so that definitely doesn\u2019t help the ARFID.\n\nJust want to say that, from my perspective as a non-expert, your lunch actually looks really good and something to be proud of. You\u2019ve got starch and carbs (often villainized but necessary for bodily function), some fruit, good variety, etc. I\u2019m proud of you OP and hope you have a wonderful day! \n\nAnd to anyone who struggled to eat today, I\u2019m proud of you too. Remember that eating _anything_ is better than eating nothing, including candy and ice cream. You deserve to be able to eat whatever you can get down without any shame or guilt, even if other people might not understand. Be kind to yourself and take care of yourself <3",
