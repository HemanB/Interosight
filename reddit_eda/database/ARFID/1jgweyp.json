They have had food, many times, that they were resistant to trying and worried that it would be revolting, but when they did try it they found it wasn't as bad as they expected- sometimes even good. They also have, many many times, experienced foods that taste and feel a LOT different than they smell or appear. They also know in the raising of children that this is generally the right approach. That it is normal to take multiple attempts before knowing for sure if the child doesn't really like it- and usually they come around. And sorry to say they are imagining ARFID as a fussy, picky eater on steroids, who probably wasn't parented properly and who might not actually know what they like because their diet is so limited.\n\nBut really, if you think about it for 2 seconds, it makes total sense that if you have severe reactions every time to certain smells, textures, etc and have known, experienced and tested and retested it for many years- that you would know. So it really is crazy to treat you like you were born yesterday.  Unfortunately, yes it really is that foreign to their experience and hard for them to understand, sorry to say, and they are not giving it much thought.  :(",

So we are subconsciously pulling from those experiences when suggesting there could be a good experience in there for you. \n\nIf it's someone that cares about you and knows that ARFID is involved, they are trying to be helpful.

My whole childhood and young adult life was filled with people who didn't seem to understand that I could tell from either the smell or the visible texture that I knew I wasn't going to be able to eat something before I ever put any of it in my mouth. My parents didn't force it, thankfully, but eating in public still caused anxiety. I was probably in my 30's by the time I stopped letting other people affect how I interact with food.\n\nWhen I became a parent of two children, both with very limited acceptable food lists, trying to make sure they still get enough nourishment from their meals is challenging. I've actually found myself saying the dreaded words just out of desperation to get them to try to expand their palates. And the thing is, sometimes we do find new foods this way. But on the other hand, I also don't force my kids to eat anything they indicate is outright repulsive. I don't want them to hate food. I don't want them to dread restaurants or potlucks. And it really is bullshit how so many people still get pushy about what someone else should eat.\n\nI don't think most people are being intentionally malicious. I think they're usually just excited to share something they like with us. Or if they made it themselves, then it's something they feel proud of and they want confirmation that they did a good job. Unfortunately, it just goes completely sideways when they don't understand our pre-existing struggles with food and the trauma that often comes with it.",

They also have, many many times, experienced foods that taste and feel a LOT different than they smell or appear. They also know in the raising of children that this is generally the right approach. That it is normal to take multiple attempts before knowing for sure if the child doesn't really like it- and usually they come around. And sorry to say they are imagining ARFID as a fussy, picky eater on steroids, who probably wasn't parented properly and who might not actually know what they like because their diet is so limited.\n\nBut really, if you think about it for 2 seconds, it makes total sense that if you have severe reactions every time to certain smells, textures, etc and have known, experienced and tested and retested it for many years- that you would know.

I quickly decided I needed to try and eat better/healthier foods to model a positive relationship with food to her. That\u2019s how I found out I actually do like oven roasted broccoli, which simply smelling made me gag as a kid. I can\u2019t stand skin on food (apples, cucumbers, the stringy parts of oranges), it\u2019s hard for me to get down, and I probably look similar to an upset toddler with how stressed it can make me. But I tried to dip cucumbers in hummus the other day and it masks the texture just enough to actually be enjoyable. I had to use a lot of hummus on each bite, but I still ate the cucumber without gagging, which is a huge win!\n\nI\u2019ve been trying to walk the line between giving myself enough space to feel how I feel about my aversions, but also acknowledging that trying the food IS actually the only way I will know/start to be able to eat it. Sure there are probably some foods I\u2019ll never be able to force down(fish \ud83e\udd22) but if I\u2019ve got enough energy in the moment, I\u2019ll give the food a try. It\u2019s easy to feel on the defensive when someone who doesn\u2019t understand the stress that comes with trying a new food, is trying to push one on to you. So my strategy with my daughter has been to have her try a food, and if she puts in a good effort and actually doesn\u2019t like it, she doesn\u2019t have to eat it. But if she immediately shuts it down before even knowing what the food is, or tries to pretend she took a bite, I\u2019m going to have to work harder to figure out if she actually doesn\u2019t like it or if it\u2019s just because it\u2019s a new thing. Most of the time, she actually doesn\u2019t like it lol, but every now and then we find a new food she does like. And I always praise her for trying the foods, even if she doesn\u2019t like them. Because I understand how having the courage to try the new foods is just as big as trying something new and discovering you like it.",

I've actually found myself saying the dreaded words just out of desperation to get them to try to expand their palates. And the thing is, sometimes we do find new foods this way. But on the other hand, I also don't force my kids to eat anything they indicate is outright repulsive. I don't want them to hate food. I don't want them to dread restaurants or potlucks. And it really is bullshit how so many people still get pushy about what someone else should eat.\n\nI don't think most people are being intentionally malicious. I think they're usually just excited to share something they like with us. Or if they made it themselves, then it's something they feel proud of and they want confirmation that they did a good job. Unfortunately, it just goes completely sideways when they don't understand our pre-existing struggles with food and the trauma that often comes with it.",

Yes, that's that sad part of ARFID that the experience of broccoli or spinach or whatever is the same as fish eyeballs, etc. It's frustrating that it also means you can't trust your body to tell you what it needs, as it has been so monopolized by this revoltion. Even harder that there does not seem to be effective treatments or motivation to explore or prioritize them. Very tough.

But I think we all find that when we are too honest with things we\u00a0are struggling with, it sucks other people into our struggle. They will try to understand it but don\u2019t always have the experience to understand it, and so it turns into judgment. Everyone experiences this, not just with ARFID. That\u2019s why in the US, for example, it is polite to ask, \u201cHow are you?\u201d and\u00a0basically, no one answers that question honestly. They don't want to get into it. They are worried about coming off negative or being judged if they share their struggles. It\u2019s also why people make up all kinds of\u00a0BS excuses not to do things or join in things socially or professionally.\n\nI was worried about the morality of these excuses/white lies until I encountered one of the details of my religion as to whether or not a lie needs to be confessed. \u00a0One of the aspects is that the person is or should be entitled to the truth.\u00a0So if you BS a waitress calling an intolerance and allergy, for example, to make sure it is taken seriously (and because you don't want to spend the time getting into the details with her - and then ultimately not have the severity be understood) that it is harmless. But, of course, don\u2019t BS your doctor or misrepresent your ARFID to date, for example. Even forgetting morality- it's not in your interest.\n\nIf it makes you feel any better, everyone has limitations of one kind or another and is covering for stuff this way. In a way, this might be some of the judgmental pushback you are getting- that you are not playing the game the way they\u00a0are, and they expect, so it sounds childlike to them (both the honesty and the dietary restrictions). Sorry if that sounds\u00a0harsh.\n\nSending best wishes.",
