  "selftext": "I hate making food, the payoff just isn't there. I seldom finish my food if I can even eat it at all. I like the taste of some foods but not enough that the effort of making it is worth it. I don't like the taste of a lot of stuff, the textures of others, and almost anything has the potential to upset my stomach. I'm so past the point of frustrated. Every time I eat I want to cry. I'm 23f, 5'7\"ish and 108lbs. I haven't gained and kept weight on since 2012 when I was about 112lbs. All I want is to just feel healthy for once instead of hungry and shaky. The only way I feel confident eating is when I smoke, but I had to cut back because I wasn't getting anything done. I've started drinking boosts but they're so freaking expensive, especially when you're drinking 2-3 a day. I'm just at a loss. I wish I could just absorb nutrients in a different way.",
