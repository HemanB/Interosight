Spice covers a multitude of flavours.\n\nI recommend giving [dosa](https://www.indianhealthyrecipes.com/dosa-recipe-dosa-batter/) a try. It's essentially a plain savoury crepe made from lentils and rice. It doesn't have a lot of flavour but is often eaten with spicy potato or a spicy soup called sambah. As it's made from lentils, it's a reasonable source of protein.\n\nAnother thing I love (semi obsessed with) are poppadoms/papads. These too are surprisingly high in protein, fibre and iron as they are made from chickpeas. In the UK you can get [homemade](https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/254945783) ones and if you make them in the microwave, they'll be lower in fat, but they are better fried and bought from a takeaway. You can get more spicy ones too.",

When I was in high school, during the ancient 80s, a restaurant near the school had a lunch special: a burrito, bag of tortilla chips, small container of salsa, and a drink for $3.00. \n\nWhenever I could afford it, my friend and I would hit the drive through during lunch period. I always got the bean and cheese burrito. One time, though, I I bit into it and it was a beef burrito. I almost threw up. My friend saw the look on my face and said \u201cDon\u2019t throw up in my car!\u201d and she pulled over so I could spit it out and rinse my mouth out. \n\nIt\u2019s been over thirty years and I can still remember the texture, taste, and smell of that burrito. \ud83e\udd22",
