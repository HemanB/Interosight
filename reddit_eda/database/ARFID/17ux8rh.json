There are videos of actual abuse that have been doing the rounds this past year, which include some of the people who layed charges. Somehow, the videos have been confused in media reports, and to the benefit of Tate because he can point to the 'consensual' video and cry 'fake news'.\n\nThe prosecuting authority unfortunately declined to prosecute at that time, but I believe the women who brought the charges back then are filing a civil case against him.",
