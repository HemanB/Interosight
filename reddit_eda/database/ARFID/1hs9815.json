  "selftext": "I\u2019ve recently been struggling a lot with eating enough. It\u2019s like I don\u2019t understand how much food someone needs to function because I\u2019ll eat something (probably half of what a meal should be) then I get upset and freak out when I start feeling weird and hungry an hour later. I try my best to eat things with protein but I just never have much of an appetite. I get so exhausted when thinking about meals etc so when I get hungry again I get frustrated because it feels like I have to \u201cdeal with it\u201d again. So like the title says, I often wish humans could live without food. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice for feeling like this or can anyone relate?",

      "body": "I used to work from home and was the sole income earner. My now ex didn\u2019t work but he was a foodie so he didn\u2019t mind doing the cooking. I loved this except for the fact he\u2019d never make a decision about what to make without my input, even if I told him I didn\u2019t care and didn\u2019t want anything. He\u2019d refuse to believe it and press me further. \nWorking from home for the employer I was working for was exhausting and overwhelming and took way more of an emotional toll than any office job should. I\u2019d be trying to finish up and get all the chaotic loose ends of the day tied up and without fail he\u2019d come in and be like \u201cso what do you want for dinner?\u201d In my head, my train of thought came to a screeching halt like a record scratching out at that question. I\u2019d always say I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t care, do what you want, because I mentally couldn\u2019t handle the thought about food while dealing with active stress from work, but he\u2019d hound me non stop because he\u2019d simply get offended if I didn\u2019t eat what he made. this was his way to make sure I ate, just ask me until i gave him an answer. Too bad that didn\u2019t work even half the time. I\u2019m not kidding you, it got to the point where he\u2019d walk in the room around 4pm and I\u2019d blurt out \u201cI\u2019m not hungry don\u2019t fucking ask me about food right now!\u201d Before he could even get one word in. It felt forced on me during a time when I really couldn\u2019t handle it and i honestly think this dynamic made my arfid way worse than it ever was before in my life, especially during the last few years of our relationship. I have the aversive and restrictive types and I can literally vomit at just the thought of food if I\u2019m not in the right \u201cmood\u201d for it. Forcing me to make food decisions when I\u2019m under active pressure to perform at work literally broke my brain, beyond just melt downs, I got to a point where I rejected ALL solids and would only consume milk to survive. It\u2019s been a wild ride, I\u2019m glad I can eat semi-normally again. \n\nWow I didn\u2019t mean to dump all this but yes, I can definitely relate to food being a tipping point for your sanity. Most people don\u2019t understand, but I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re the lucky ones for that.",
