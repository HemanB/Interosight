  "selftext": "I need to rant for a minute because this sub is the only place where I don't feel like a crazy person for venting about this. I recently went to a Hibachi grill for the first time. It would not have been my first pick, as I don't like any time of seafood, but the group I was with wanted to go and they said they also have chicken. \n\nAfter looking through the menu, I was happy to see that they had a chicken teriyaki dish that came with a side of white rice. Chicken and rice are both safe foods for me and I like teriyaki, so that sounded perfect. Some of the other dishes were described as being served with vegetable, shrimp, etc. But this one didn't, so I thought it would be fine. \n\nWhen they brought it out there were also cooked vegetables and the whole thing was mixed with onions. I hate drawing attention to myself and feel self conscious about my eating habits so I didn't say anything. I ate some of the chicken that was on top and away from the onions, but the further down I got, the more of the onion flavor it had. I eventually switched to just eating my rice, which, luckily, was served on the side.\n\nI just really wish the menu completely described everything served with a particular dish. If I had known there would be onions, I could have ordered it without, and thus would not have to either send it back or not enjoy my meal which was otherwise delicious. \n\nDoes anyone else feel this way?\n\nTL;DR: I wish restaurants put on the menu everything that comes with a particular dish, so if it comes with something you can't/don't eat, you can order it without.",

Bad times.\n\nI've gotten comfortable enough asking about onions. I can handle a bit of the flavour, but the sensation of biting into one is awful.

We have burgers on our menu and for a while they came with coleslaw but with no mention of this on the menu, enough burgers were sent back that the next printing of the menu included the coleslaw listed with the burger. Some chefs have a weird view of food and sometimes won't list what they consider a 'common sense' ingredient on the menu (see onions in hashbrowns mentioned elsewhere in these comments, hashbrown with onion is the norm not the exception so of course restaurants don't put it on the menu) and it's on the customer to ask about allergens. Even if something isn't listed on the menu, they will have an allergen chart somewhere with every single allergen in each item.\n\nNever be afraid to ask all the questions when ordering, the staff would rather spend 5mins answering your questions then risk having to remake your order or for posts like this to end up on trip advisor. As long as you aren't rude about it nobody will care.",
