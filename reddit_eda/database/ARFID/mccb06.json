  "selftext": "Fruits and veggies have been two of the biggest triggers of my ARFID- something about their texture really messes with me. Really only soft textures like bananas and potatoes or things I could cut up real small and swallow, like carrots or green beans, could be tolerated. However, the other day my aunt peeled&sliced an apple and I was able to eat the whole thing! No gagging, puking, or nausea! I can\u2019t wait to start branching out and trying other fruits raw. \ud83d\udc95",

I've found that my palate has changed as an adult, and I like things I absolutely hated as a kid (like apples and bananas!) Keep trying when you feel up to it; you never know what you could end up liking :)",

      "body": "YAY!!!! I only tried apples for the first time when I was 20ish and I'm 24 now. I loved applesauce/juice but the apple texture was too much for so long. Definitely try to cut things up! I've also found eating multiple fruits at once, one being familiar, (so like a bite of apple with a blueberry or a bite of strawberry) helps a lot since you already know what some of the texture/taste will be.\n\nI am so proud of you \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f",

I really don't understand it, some tastes are terrible, i really can only eat soft mushy carrots in soup, but peas or anything like that nope. When i see the color green i turn away. Bananas are just disgusting.",
