What if... being a \"picky eater\" doesn't actually say anything about your age or personality or...\n- Many of the foods I've struggled most with have been very sweet. Not that that matters as a defense; let people eat sweet foods! Just amused me as like... clearly this person does not understand food issues.\n- Ah, yes, not like food insecurity is a risk factor for ARFID. We're all so privileged /sarcasm. Not like forcing myself to choke down food due to not having other options made things worse.\n- Being upset with someone for being a judgemental asshole is not the same thing as being a judgemental asshole what the actual duck \ud83d\ude24 We aren't instigating you or being mean to you by being picky. You are hurting us! Being upset about harm is not equivalent to... enacting harm. We're not harming them. Cognitive dissonance explodes.\n- Oh g-d raw carrots and nuts are Not the same as chips or crackers. Carrots are initially crunchy, not crispy, and they get drier and harder to swallow the more you chew them instead of easier to swallow. And whole nuts/pieces are slidey and zjierb (word coined by Brian David Gilbert to describe the feeling experienced when biting into a limp pickle). I cannot with those textures and flavours.

People put enormous amounts of energy and resources into eating in a way they believe is right for their bodies, minds, their longevity. Do they KNOW that that way is the right way? Does anyone know? They're just hoping they trusted the right resource. If not, god, what a waste. Like if you became a doctor only to realize you can't stand the job. They feel so triggered by what **feels** to them like you being *defiant* of these views about diet, forcing them to think about the possibility that their dietary efforts are for naught, that they won't be able to think clearly or listen when you explain ARFID to them. \n\n2. Is it possible to grow up spoiled with parents who never bothered to challenge you, bent to your every will? The outcome of this is a person who can't tolerate anything that isn't just their way, and I'm betting people read this quality into many people with ARFID because what would this spoiled person do if they were FORCED to try something other than the junk food they've been eating their whole lives? They'd make a big performance about how horrible the experience is (because anything that isn't exactly how they want it to be is horrible). SO the issue here is how do you clarify that you are not this person that people without even realizing it may be assuming you are?",

And if you're judging people you *do* already know and profess to genuinely care about their health, then you're an asshole anyway, because you're not expressing concern, you're just *judging*.\n\nBullying is far more childish than \"being picky\" could ever be.",
