I think it\u2019s because picky eating (which we of course now know arfid is not) is something associated with children and not having a fully developed palate. Me personally, I have seen an improvement in my functional relationship with food and my condition since I became an adult, not least because I had had enough of the level of struggle I was used to and had to, by force, make some progress to make existing in the world as an adult easier. But I wouldn\u2019t let it get you down, dietary restrictions and eating conditions can affect anyone at any age and can absolutely be taken seriously by adults when you use the right language and start by being clear that you take your own health seriously as something more than some kind of childish issue but an actual disorder you didn\u2019t chose to have. \u2665\ufe0f",

Honestly, what I\u2019ve had to do to protect my mental health is just basically use how they handle this as the barrier for being part of my life. So I mean my fianc\u00e9 was the first one to know after I got diagnosed and he has been just incredibly supportive (it helps that he is autistic and ADHD too so doesn\u2019t mind eating the same small variety of safe foods, he actually needs it). Then my parents\u2014my mom was reasonably supportive and has done research and educated herself on it, while my father has done jack squat and has been unsupportive so I\u2019ve had to go low/no contact with him. Then the same for friends and extended family and the ones who were supportive get to stay part of my world of interactions and those who aren\u2019t supportive or treat it like it\u2019s a child\u2019s disease then they aren\u2019t worth my time and care. Hope you are able to do the same! The way I explain it is that it is an eating disorder and basically when you ask me to \u201cjust try X non-safe food\u201d you are basically asking me to eat that car tire over there. I state it matter of factly and do not back down. Most decent people respect that and let it be.",
