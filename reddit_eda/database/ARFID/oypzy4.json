  "selftext": "I first heard of ARFID in November 2016. Got an official diagnosis and began treatment in March 10th, 2017. Didn't make too much progress regarding my eating itself until 2020; it was three years of basically just learning not to be ashamed of ARFID. To finally tell people about it. Not to hide in restaurants, not to blame myself for it.\n\nApplied for and was accepted in a program specialized in eating disorders in August 2020. Had weekly appointments with a psychologist and a nutritionist and monthly appointments with a psychiatrist. I fought, and fought, and fought.\n\nI just had my appointment of the week. They said I'm... good. I was released. I can keep going and keep making progress on my own now. The idea of trying new foods does not scare me anymore. I'm still selective, sure, but I'm not afraid.\n\nI'm... free. After 14 and a half years of struggling with ARFID. After 4 years, 4 months and 25 days of treatment. I'm free. I won! I won!\n\nThis has to be one of the happiest days of my life. I felt like stopping so many times. It was so hard. It was grueling. But it's finally over.\n\nFor anyone who might be reading this and be in a battle of their own, keep going. Please, keep going. Please, fight. It is possible to get here. I promise you.",

My understanding is that the wrong kind of treatment (not designed for ARFID) can be harmful.  I am going to assume you are not in the US.  I don't know how your system works, but here are some ideas you can see if they fit:\n\n1) check out the ROME foundation website and see if there are any providers in your area.  They keep up with GI specialists, GI psychologists and dietitians.  \n2). See if ARFID could be considered for treatment by the insurer if you go the route of treating anxiety? Cognitive behavioral therapy is used in treatment, and that's also appropriate for anxiety.  You could also possibly appeal their decision not to cover ARFID of you or a provider could document it's effect on your mental and physical health.",

I've been through the mental health program and done CBT for other things, and they tried to help me with my ARFID but honestly just had no idea. They even worked in the same clinic as the eating disorder program because it's all in one big area of the hospital, and so they were able to ask their colleagues who work at the eating disorder program for tips, but everyone involved said it would be much better if I just got approved to the eating disorder program directly. But unfortunately under public Healthcare you have to do an intake with a nurse and they have very specific questions to ask, and if you don't meet their criteria they can't accept you. Even though the people at the program clearly understand ARFID and know how to treat it, they can't see me unless I pass the very strict criteria set out by the government for treatment.",
