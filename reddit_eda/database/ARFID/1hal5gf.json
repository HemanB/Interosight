  "selftext": "Had a dinner out with some immediate family members recently and they got on the topic of my eating habits. They laughed about how they could give me anything and say it was something that I\u2019m fine to eat, even if it was actually something I would never touch. \n\nI\u2019m so mad and have been having low grade constant anxiety since, because how am I supposed to eat anything they buy or make again, ever?\n\nHonestly, it is really a shitty thing to do regardless of why someone doesn\u2019t want to eat a particular thing, because some people have allergies to certain foods which can cause bad reactions or death. Even if it\u2019s not as immediately serious as an allergic reaction it\u2019s still a super shitty thing to do.",

You\u2019re likely to make the situation worse doing something like that. \nYou\u2019re totally justified in your feelings. I\u2019d ask them how they\u2019d feel if the situation were reversed, but I do not think this person understands your situation so that may just be a futile exercise.",

I don\u2019t know exactly what my husband does to our spaghetti sauce, for example, but it\u2019s delicious so I don\u2019t ask. Psychologically though if I knew what was in it that would make me not want to eat it which is dumb so I choose to remain ignorant. But this is a choice that I made _for myself_ and my husband knows he can\u2019t just do it to whatever whenever. \n\nThe only time my parents ever did this to me was after a 20+ hour journey to New Zealand, where the friends we were visiting provided lamb as dinner. I was 4. Apparently I was so hungry and exhausted I absolutely snarfed it down and asked for seconds. Mom was just excited that I liked it but apparently on my second serving I said \u2018why does this chicken taste different\u2019 so there went her hopes of me liking a new food \ud83d\ude02",
