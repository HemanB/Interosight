Waiter comes out with a kids meal, announces it's a kids meal and asks jokingly (in the way adults do to engage with kids) who this for? And I'm sat there sheepishly and say \"the kids meal is for the adult.\" The waiter was taken aback for a moment and repeated what I said as if processing what they heard \ud83d\ude05 \n\nI was jealous of the options on the kids menu, and still don't understand why they don't have the same items on the \"grown up\" menu just as a bigger portion with a bigger price tag - it was only pub food, not a fancy establishment",

I told him that I wanted the kids meal and to go ahead and charge me for an adult entree.  It worked and I got the kids meal",

They keep fish fingers on the kids menu because they sell well, they aren't added to the adults menu because they have no idea how many adults want fish fingers.\n\nCompare that to the independent resturant I work at, we have mac n cheese on both the kids and the adults menu because one time when the chefs had to come up with a new menu, the front of house team went 'hey over half our kids mac n cheese orders were for adults' When the new menu came out mac n cheese was now in both the kids and adult section, exactly the same meal just more of it for the adults. We nearly had this happen with chicken nuggets too, but the head chef ended up pulling them from the menu completely.",
