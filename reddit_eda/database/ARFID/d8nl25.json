  "selftext": "I didn't know this was a disorder,I was just always labeled as a \"picky eater\".The reason why I feel so privileged is because I've been reading some of the stories on this sub and am shocked that some people were abused by their parents for it.\n\nFor as long as I can remember,my mom was always accepting and accomodating.Even if she didn't understand my anxiety and unwillingness around most foods,she would never say anything hurtful.She was encouraging and even found ways for me to eat healthy.\n\nOne example is the soup she made.Ordinary soup with noodles but what I didn't know was that she would strain/filter the soup cause it cooked with vegetables.It was expertly made so that the vegetable taste wasn't prominent but the nutrients were still there.\n\nI love my mom and can't thank her enough for everything she did for me.",
