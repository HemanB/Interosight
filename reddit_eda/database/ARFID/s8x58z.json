When there are people who drink Fiji or Icelandic bottled water, it's overpriced water that is transported far leaving a huge carbon footprint. I've had them before and they don't taste different from regular bottled water. Assuming those car a way bigger footprint that other foods. I know somebody who is a higher up at restaurant and said that most of the carbon footprint is transportation, even more than meat alone. Also the most environment impact is caused by large corporations and not individuals.",

Most of the time it's the picky eaters getting bullied because it's more socially acceptable rather than the other way around. \n\nThere were comments encouraging (or implying) parents to starve their kids to \"cure\" them and it makes me so uncomfortable. If only Arfid (and sensory issues from autism/ADHD) was more recognised we wouldn't receive so much unwarranted hate",
