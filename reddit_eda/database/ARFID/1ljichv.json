  "selftext": "hi! i've been working on a free community ARFID cookbook site/app called \"[anyone can cook](https://anyonecancook.app)\" where you can add your preferences, post & bookmark recipes, tag them with foods/textures, and filter recommendations based on what you can eat, and i wanted to share it!\n\ni've been studying computer science and have had ARFID for as long as i can remember, and wanted to build a little side project that i thought might be useful for some of us. i wanted something to help me keep track of what i can eat, and especially the recipes i can cook, but i thought it might be cool if we could all build a cookbook together!\n\nif you're open to trying it out or adding some recipes, here's the link:\n\n[anyonecancook.app](https://anyonecancook.app)\n\nit's very simple right now, and i want to be as inclusive as possible, so if you have any ideas or suggestions please let me know or send me a DM!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6wprk1y91x8f1.png?width=1340&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e359b3304dd8d3e9f07ec4157fdd5609429a4d1\n\n>!\u200b!<",
