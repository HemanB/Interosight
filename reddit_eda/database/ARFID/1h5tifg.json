  "selftext": "i know it\u2019s been said here many times before, but this book really is great!! i wasn\u2019t that interested in picking it up since i was already in treatment, and this is more aimed towards self-help, but i was really curious about the contents of it and i am very pleasantly surprised. i\u2019m not very far in yet, but safe to say it has my official ARFID stamp of approval. it\u2019s absolutely worth the money!\n\na quick synopsis for anyone interested, the book layout is like this: \n1. defining ARFID and what it specifically means for you \n2. the steps towards change (and what change means for you!) \n3. ways to tackle each subtype of ARFID (sensory, fear, lack of interest)\n4. how to not relapse (or, how to keep these new changes going)",

Another section has practical steps for taking your safe foods and increasing the forms you can eat them - I was  also making progress hear before the annual depression. I\u2019m hoping I can move faster through the steps I was working on when the depression ends.
