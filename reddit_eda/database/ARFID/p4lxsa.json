Portion some food (even if it's small) and try your best to finish it no matter how long it takes. (Sometimes it would take me hours) Did something happen to cause things to get worse?\n\nEDIT : Disclaimer - This is what helped me but may not work for everyone, unfortunately. I hope my comment could be helpful either way \ud83d\udc97",

Honestly I remember really liking mango baby food when I wasn\u2019t eating solid food yet as a youngin.... so I always have a mango smoothie in my fridge just for an extra safe food that is quick and easy!! (Something about the texture of the mango smoothie that is easy for me to be okay with) \n\nI definitely feel where you are at because I\u2019m in a similar spot it sounds \u2014 relying on a boost a day because otherwise I just hardly will not eat anything especially in the morning.... \n\nAnother trick that has helped me a lot recently is just having a hummus that I know is safe for me + pita bread. Introducing this has helped me start becoming so much more comfortable with the thought of so many other foods!! \n\nHope you find something else that you can rely on soon!! (:",
