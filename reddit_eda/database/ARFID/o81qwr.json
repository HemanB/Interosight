  "title": "Crying in a restaurant bathroom because of embarrassment over ARFID",
  "selftext": "I\u2019m at a restaurant for a family member\u2019s birthday, and it\u2019s one of the only restaurants i\u2019ve been to that doesn\u2019t have a SINGLE meal on the restaurant that I can eat. Not even any safe dishes for me like chicken tender and fries.\n\nI was sitting next to my mother, so I asked her for help to see if she could find something on the menu that I can eat that I missed over, because the waitress was about to come and I was in panic mode.\n\nMy mom took me needing help finding something on the menu as her ordering for me, so she told the waitress \u201cMy daughter is extremely picky, could you just make her some basic pasta or something?\u201d\n\nI was so embarrassed that I panic ordered tater tots (for dinner, it was supposed to be a side but it was the only thing I felt comfortable eating) and then excused myself to the restroom to cry in embarrassment.\n\nI hate having to make restaurant staff advocate to my eating disorder, i\u2019ll just order nothing or something as simple as possible in a situation like this. And something that I hate more than anything is being called out as being \u201cpicky\u201d, it makes it sound like i\u2019m a snob and I would be more comfortable with her just straight-up saying I have an eating disorder. I\u2019ve told her not to do it since I was a kid, and she still insists on telling everyone within earshot at restaurants that i\u2019m a \u201cpicky eater\u201d\n\nI\u2019m 19, so i\u2019m a grown-ass woman and i\u2019m in a restaurant bathroom crying over food. And I get that she was trying to help me, but it made me feel like absolute dirt. I feel so pathetic because of ARFID sometimes.\n\nHas anyone else had a similar experience to this? I honestly just wanted to vent to some like-minded people because you guys might actually understand my pain",

Don't even worry. If someone says something tell them you're not that hungry. \n\nAt almost 33 and still picking as all hell there isn't much I can do. So I just don't even worry. They don't care, they're just making food. \n\nI'm really sorry your night sucked. I hope you get something yummy to eat soon. Without judgement from stupid people.",

She would feel better having it in the open, and no one would feel the need to ask why her children were only eating a side of fries.\n\nI have been in your shoes many times. It does not feel good to have your eating disorder spotlighted. Not feeling respected, or given a chance to be understood. Just straight up labeled and taken care of.\n\nI'm 29 now. I have no problem being upfront with people about my struggles with food. When I am in control of the conversation it always goes well. I have the power to explain my difficulties. When I started openly explaining exactly **why** I grew up with ARFID, I started to understand my mom's point of view. And why she always told everyone right away. If my brother and I were simply waved off as picky eaters. It becomes easy to deflect all blame, and reject all responsibility. It's painful for parents to admit they contributed to their child's eating disorder. It's stressful not knowing how to help us and to see us struggle. When you are labeled a picky eater. It becomes solely **your problem.**\n\nOwn it. Own your struggles. We all have them. Be unapologetically open and honest about it. More people will be understanding than you think, and it will feel 100 times better than letting your mother control the narrative. You are not a picky eater. You are your own person with your own struggles. They have theirs and this one is yours. Own it!",

Also, don\u2019t be afraid to order from the kid\u2019s menu. They often have mac and cheese or a simple fruit cup, even if those things aren\u2019t available on the main menu. If you have to request the kid\u2019s menu, just say \u201cI have a very restricted diet. May I see the kid\u2019s menu, to see if it has a safe option for me?\u201d I haven\u2019t seen servers refuse that.",

I used to not eat or eat the safe foods when available, but recently I learned it\u2019s okay to ask the server about other options or substitutions. My last meal out I got a lot of anxiety over asking if I could have an entree with another entree\u2019s side and they were super nice about it, no questions asked. I know not all places are as kind, but it\u2019s surprising sometimes. It is possible to call ahead to ask what options are available too if you don\u2019t want others to hear. I am 30 and it\u2019s taken me until age 30 to have the courage to ask! You\u2019ve got this! \ud83d\udc9c",

When I go to restaurants I almost always start my order with \u201cJust letting you know, I\u2019m really picky\u2026\u201d or \u201cI know this order might sound weird but\u2026\u201d with a smile to kind of get the waiter ready and on my side. Normally this works and I order something with substitutions/stuff left off a lot. I always check the menu before I go to a restaurant if possible and see if there\u2019s something I can at least amend (most often for me this means ordering a dish \u201cwith no vegetables, please!\u201d)\n\nThis has only happened a few times, but on a couple occasions waiters have mocked for ordering no vegetables, which I really didn\u2019t appreciate. But normally they\u2019re very nice and I have even had a waitress tell me she is \u201cthe same way\u201d about food once which made me feel really safe about ordering food the way I order it.\n\nI totally get not wanting to call it pickiness or seem stuck-up about food. I have cried in a bathroom stall because the restaurant had NOTHING I could eat before too. It\u2019s awful. I\u2019m so sorry. Just do whatever you need to do to get food you can eat, whether it\u2019s at the restaurant or after.",

Something my therapist and I are working on is coming up with something that I am comfortable saying to people about my disorder. Something like \"Just so you guys are aware, I am working through some sensory issues so food is  hard for me right now, I don't want to talk about it. I would rather us just enjoy each other's company.\" Something like that. The idea is to practice saying this with people I am comfortable around so that someday maybe I can say it to others, and to say it assertively. I'm sorry you had a hard night.",
