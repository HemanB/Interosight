  "selftext": "So my partner does all the cooking because I hate doing it and in return I do the dishes. I am fine doing the dishes however I have to do them in a specific way and I can\u2019t touch the water or any of the dirty dishes with my bare hands, so I wear two sets of gloves. The idea of touching the food on the dishes or even the water grosses me out and I just can\u2019t. It makes me feel really weird about food. I was wondering if this might be a ARFID thing. Does anyone else have issues with the dishes ?",
