Now that I have no appetite and am barely eating I'm so tired all the time. I literally can't gain weight. Only within the past year did I even weigh enough to donate blood (although I still don't know if I can with my current health issues).\n\nDoctors love to use BMI on \"overweight\" people but when it comes to me, who has always been underweight I hear, \"Oh BMI isn't really an accurate depiction of a healthy weight, you should be fine.\" Okay so because I'm skinny BMI doesn't matter. Huh. It's almost like weight alone doesn't give you an accurate description of one's health or situation. And maybe you could use that degree of yours to remember that weight does not usually cause health issues, but maybe the other way around. That's just my two cents anyway.",
