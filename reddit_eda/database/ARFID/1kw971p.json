It's the same as everything else: whenever there's stress in one aspect of a system, the rest goes to hell unless it compensates. Compensating is an exhausting practice. At least, that's my experience of it.\n\nIf you can drink Soylent, heck yes! That counts. That stuff has calories and vitamins and all the things. There are other drinkable options but if you can handle that one, start there. Just adding more calories on a daily basis helps if you have been short.\n\nI won't lie to you. Your safe food list is short. Too short. And apples are delicious. (Truth: I only willingly eat fuji apples. They must be cut with my special apple cutter which makes relatively thin slices. I cannot manage to eat thick slices of anything. If the apple isn't ripe enough it's not gonna happen.)\n\nWould you like to hear about how I feel about peanut butter? You can have mine. :)\n\nI digress. You're not alone. And you can do this.\n\n[This book about ARFID is decent--a lot of us have found it helpful.](https://a.co/d/fpFQt6W)",

I go periods of time where I think my fears are silly, and then suddenly I\u2019m so terrified I literally daren\u2019t leave the sofa and spend every waking minute researching my worries.\n\nPlease don\u2019t be afraid of what they\u2019re going to make you do. I don\u2019t know what country you live in, and therefore I don\u2019t know how accessible high-quality therapy is in your area, but a good therapist won\u2019t make you do anything you\u2019re not comfortable with until *you* feel ready.\n\nMostly it will revolve around tackling the thought processes that feed into these fears.\n\nI really do hope you decide to get help! You deserve to live your life as free of these fears as possible. It made an unbelievable difference to my mental health. Beforehand I was literally not functioning and now I go most days without thinking about them at all!\n\nAnxiety/OCD is extremely treatable!\n\nI wish you all the best :)",

I feel like I'm being overdramatic at times but it truly has become impossible to eat. I'm down over 50 lbs and This started about 6 months ago and has progressively gotten worse. I thought this was something you developed younger. I also didn't understand that you could actually like the taste of the food but can't eat it because of the way it feels to you. When you said that in your post it made me feel so much better (in the weirdest way) because there are foods I love the taste of but I just can't do it. I thought because I liked the taste of some of the foods it couldn't be Afrid. I feel like I'm slowly suffering in silence because I don't really even understand it and those around me don't know what it is. My stomach is in pain all the time and I make myself upset because I really want to eat. Today was kind of the breaking point when I felt like I couldn't stand up straight because my belly hurt. Any advice? \ud83d\ude2d\n.",

A lot of peanut butter and a lot of ramen. I also had Soylent for a while. I don't know whether it actually helped but you know.
