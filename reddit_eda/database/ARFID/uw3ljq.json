      "body": "I totally get your sentiment. Like, 100%\n\nIn my case personally though, I don't have problems with **any** comments on what I eat and how much, since as much as I'd like it if people would simply accept that different people have different diets, realistically it's not the case in most times, and I learned to accept that as a fact and something natural among people.\n\nWhat I *definitely do* have a problem with, and a very big one, is when people don't accept my response to their comments. Recently I started opening up more about my ARFID when necessary and most people who hear me say that I have it are fairly sympathetic, even when they don't know what it is, but there are some people that keep making such remarks and that annoys me not only because it makes me self-conscious but also because A- I know that if I had a \"famous\" ED like Coeliac for example the chance they'd behave this way would be much lower. B- it proves that they disregard what I told them.\n\nAlso, just as a side note, I kinda prefer it when people tell me honestly that they're confused by the irregularity of my menu and give me a chance to explain it over them keeping their confusion secret from me for the sake of politeness and having a negative impression about me because of it as a result. It's definitely possible to both be polite and address this directly at the same time. At least in my case.\n\nI still validate the sentiment you describe here. Completely. I'm absolutely sure that many people you refer to in this post are not the type that makes such comments politely or out of genuine curiosity",
