      "body": "First, focus on tasting and suffering on foods thatbare healthy. Im not gonna vomit, cry, embarras myself over mcdonalds nuggets. \n\nSecond, go slow. Nowdays I love banana, peanut butter sandwiches. At first, I had to find a bread brand that was healthy (whole wheat) but also good tasting to me. Orange Ezekiel Bread became that. Next, i tastes peanut butter a little bit. Verrryyyy small amounts on the corner or my bread and big gulps of water after to make the test more numb. With time, i started liking and tolerating it more. Nevertheless, there are PBs that are a no-go. Lastly, tasting banana. Same as PB. Slow and with water. If I wanna stop, I stop. After a while, i put them together and bam, perfect combo for my mouth. \n\nLearn and find your hacks. See about this PB Banana Sandwich, sometimes peacies of banana get out of the bread and are full of PB... And honestly, I FIND THAT SHIT DISGUSTING. WONT EAT IT UNLESS ITS INSIDE THE BREAD. but its ok. At least I learned to combine 3 healthy foods together. Know your combos. \n\nLastly, exercise. Exercising and returning home to a shitty ARFID diet will motivatr you to make it work. \n\nCheers :)",

Its gotta be my pesto sauce. Also, i use water and things i love to eat at the same time of tasting something new.",
