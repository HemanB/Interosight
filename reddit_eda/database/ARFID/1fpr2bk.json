  "selftext": "Spent $25 on two chicken tenders today after everyone decided to split the check. I originally was going to get the kids meal but \"nooo, we'll eat the sides and extra chicken\" \"we'll split it\" yada yada. Didn't think that meant I'm splitting the cost of your steak meals. The chicken tenders weren't even good, I barely nibbled on them. $25 to nibble on two chicken tenders in the attempt to hold myself over. I hate that I'm like this. From now on it's just boost and water at the table if I'm not 100% sure I'll eat anything or paying my own bill. So over it and being like this. Just needed to rant about it so I can get it off mind and go to bed. Lesson learned I guess \ud83d\ude2d",
