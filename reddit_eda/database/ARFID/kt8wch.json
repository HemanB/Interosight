  "title": "I hate how arfid causes a cognitive dissonance I cannot overcome!",
  "selftext": "The thing is I'd love to be vegan, I'd love to cook seasonally and I'd love to eat healthy and well balanced. But because of my arfid I can't. It's a daily struggle to simply eat enough. Sometimes I don't even manage to do that, because I have absolute no appetite and everything seems inedible. I don't eat any fruit (I'm fructose intolerant and allergic to a lot of it) and almost no vegetables. All I eat consists of carbs and fat. I hate that I can't eat the way my moral standards tell me to and I'm scared that it'll have negative effects on my physical health. I'm so fckn frustrated. I try new things when I feel like it and I'm doing better than I used to, but it's just so exhausting...\n\nEdit: wow, thanks for all the feedback! I'm so glad I've found this sub, it's always so nice and reassuring to come here. Thank you all for being here, for being nice, empathetic and non judgmental - it means a lot, really <3",

I just hate fruit (unpredictable unless it belongs in a veggie-salad) and I don't feel guilty even when I don't double-veggie to make up for it.\n\nFood morality goes out the window when you're starving, right?  Blame it on the low-energy lizard-brain that takes over in a lifeboat situation... where eating your best friend seems like a good idea.\n\nDo carbs and fat until you're not starving.  Worry about those micronutrients and fiber when you need to.",

I love it now. It has gotten much better over time with practice, and the better i learn to manage and cope with my general anxiety the more open i am.\n\nThankfully a lot of my safe foods were already vegan so i initially had that comfort but it was no good for my health continuing to live off bread and soya nuggets. My partner and his family are vegan too, and are also really patient and understanding about anxiety disorders so i was very lucky to have that support to ease me in. It took until the summer to really kick my addictions to snacks and replace with vegetable-y meals (leafy greens are still a no-go unfortunatley but im getting there). \n\nFruit is a big source of stress for me, i also have oral allergy syndrome so a lot of raw fruit and nuts, even if i could get them past my mouth, would not be a good idea. I found out i could eat berries blended with banana and sweetner and kept that up for breakfasts just to get the nutrients in me, over time ive been able to enjoy small blueberries in porridge which is nice because it means i can have warm breakfasts.\n\nSomething that really helped me was finding a gateway vegetable, cooking and chopping everything myself, having that control and being patient with myself. E.g, i didnt enjoy eating peppers so i chopped them tiny and cooked them for twice as long... anyway sorry for the long comment, but recovery is a long road and i just thought it might be helpful to share my perspective, it is still super frustrating when i have oven-food only days but over time im learning to forgive myself and keep going.",

Sometimes my husband has to remind me that even if I eat a little it\u2019s better than nothing at all.\n\nI also have weird rules I\u2019ve made up about how I eat? Like for example burger and fries, I have to eat a bite of burger then a couple fries, then back to the burger then a couple fries, etc. I have always thought of that as more of an ocd thing but I don\u2019t really have ocd and the more I learn about arfrid, I think it\u2019s actually more related to how I\u2019m perceiving the food that I\u2019m eating.
