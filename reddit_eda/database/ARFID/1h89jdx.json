  "selftext": "I\u2019ve been ordering a burrito bowl weekly from a Mexican takeout chain near me for\u2026 years. lol. Same exact thing every time. The employees know me. \n\nI was going to order today. On my way into work I pulled up the app to place my order. But\u2026 the burrito I get is no longer listed on the menu. Currently sitting in the car crying my eyes out. This was one of my few safe foods that was an actual substantial meal. It\u2019s a devastating loss for me. And now I don\u2019t even get to eat before work today. Im going to be starving until I get home in like 10 hours. Fuck my life. I wouldn\u2019t wish ARFID on my worst enemy. It\u2019s such a lonely and sad experience that barely anyone understands or can emphasize with ",
