I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d actually qualify for ARFID, mostly because I definitely am not \u2018afraid\u2019 of food, and that seems to be a big component of the technical definition.  I\u2019m not even afraid of gagging - I\u2019ve long ago come to terms with that inevitability. So\u2026 no fear.  \n\nI just have very strong and irrational reactions to an assortment of textures. \n\nThat being said, I did eventually get to a point in my early 20\u2019s, where I was able to go \u2018okay, I do understand that this is irrational.  I should actually try more shit.\u2019\n\nAnd I did. \n\nIn some cases, I took one or two bites and confirmed what I\u2019d already suspected - I was not compatible with that food. \n\nSome others, I was actually able to go \u2018you know - that\u2019s not bad. I like the flavors, and the texture isn\u2019t what I\u2019d feared.  The veg in it has been so cooked down, it\u2019s the consistency of water. It\u2019s fine.\u2019 Or \u2018if I cooked this myself, I could leave out that one thing that triggers me, and then it\u2019d be perfect!\u2019\n\nOthers I was able to realize that I actually did enjoy the flavor just fine, but yes, as I feared, something about the texture triggered by gag reflex, and there was nothing I could do about it. \n\nBut I\u2019d have *never* expanded my safe foods as much as I have, if I hadn\u2019t managed to get over that mental hurdle, and to actually trying things. \n\n\nYou\u2019ve gotta give yourself permission before hand that it\u2019s okay if you only eat one bite. \n\nIt helps if I sample someone else\u2019s food. \n\nThen I\u2019m not obligated to eat any more than a single bite. And there\u2019s no \u2018spending money and wasting food\u2019 guilt if I\u2019m at a restaurant. \n\nOne bite. \n\nMaybe you\u2019re right. Maybe it\u2019s the devil incarnate, and you\u2019ll just spit it up into a napkin and move on with your life. \n\nBut maybe\u2026. Maybe it\u2019s not actually going to kill you, and you\u2019ll find another save food. \n\nDiagnosis tends to come as the result of legitimate health concerns. My (now teenaged) daughter got diagnosed because her pediatrician was concerned about three sequential appointments with weight loss. \nKids are not supposed to be *loosing* weight. \n\nIt\u2019s not healthy. \n\nNot being able to eat, is not healthy. \n\nI\u2019m fat. My safe foods are all fatty nonsense, but I\u2019ve slowly managed to muster up a collection of more reasonable foods, so I\u2019m moving in the right direction. \n\nBut I think that we should all, at least be *open* to the idea that it\u2019s best to be *trying* to improve our situation. \n\nAnd in the case of ARFID, that means expanding our food options.",

After all, I liked it, and everybody must like all the same things as me, right? (For the record, I am being very facetious.)\n\nI did actually go (tandem) skydiving. It was amazing... in hindsight. Leading up to and during, it was absolutely terrifying. It's the most exhilarating rush, though if you're not in good physical condition, it's hard on the leg muscles.\n\nIt's also not something I intend to do again. Nor is it something that I recommend everybody go out and do. It's a matter of to each their own, and everybody should be allowed to make up their own mind.\n\nFood is the same way. So long as you're getting the appropriate mixture of vitamins and nutrients and proteins to be healthy, how you go about that shouldn't matter to anybody else.",
