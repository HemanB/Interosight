  "selftext": "**Update: it miraculously worked out. Full update at the bottom of my post.**\n\nI\u2019m an iOS developer flying out to San Francisco next week to meet my boss and team for the first time since I started my job 2 years ago. My boss has been telling us he\u2019s \u201cextremely excited\u201d to treat us all to sushi. \n\nEven though I have ARFID this is normally not a problem, because at every sushi restaurant I\u2019ve been to I can eat a California roll, a side of rice, or simply sit and sip on sake wine - things I can all tolerate. But I just learned that my boss is taking us to a small, intimate sushi restaurant with professional chefs that basically hand feed you 12 pieces of sashimi over 90 minutes on a fixed menu. He is basically renting their entire restaurant out for this.\n\nThis meal is around $150 per person and our team is about 10 people.\n\nI am fully panicking and I don\u2019t know what to do. The last time I tried to eat sashimi I got a few pieces down before the texture and smell made me gag and almost vomit. Going to this dinner is not an option because if I don\u2019t eat anything my boss will be charged $150+ dollars for me to sit there and not eat anything - which would also be extremely embarrassing.\n\nI called the restaurant to ask if they do substitutions and they said they don\u2019t, so that\u2019s also not an option. They are very \u201cauthentic\u201d aka inflexible.\n\nOption 1: I tell my boss I can\u2019t attend and ask him to not rebook the dinner. I explain to him I have a dietary restriction and that I\u2019ll meet him and the team afterwards to grab drinks. Unfortunately because my boss is such a nice person I am almost 100% certain he will rebook the whole thing (despite himself being so excited for this meal) and I fear that the whole team (and my boss) will secretly hate me. I am worried that everyone will be upset with me - I\u2019ll be denying them all this amazing private, sushi dinner experience. I don\u2019t think I could live with myself if that happened. \n\nOption 2: I fake a stomach illness the day of and say I can\u2019t go to dinner. The downside here is that I\u2019m lying, and my boss will be charged a $50 no show fee for me (if he doesn\u2019t give my spot to someone else in the office) but this is cheaper than $150. I know this will not feel great for me mentally (getting to miss out on another thing because I have an eating disorder), but at least everyone will get their amazing dinner and I can sit in my hotel room for 6 hours pretending to be sick.\n\n/r/ARFID please help me out - what would you do in this situation? I\u2019m panicking so, so bad - I am panicking so much I haven\u2019t been able to work or function since I found out about this dinner 2 days ago. I am crying so hard I haven\u2019t been able to turn on my zoom camera during the work day on calls. I know this sounds insane, but I had extensive family shaming and guilt growing up for being picky and it hurts so much. I\u2019m so distraught I\u2019m considering not going to San Francisco at all anymore and pretending I have Covid. \n\nARFID has ruined my fucking life.\n\n**Update: it worked out.** I told my boss honestly and said I\u2019d like to respectfully bow out of dinner because of a dietary restriction and let the team enjoy the amazing experience he had planned. \n\nHe was understanding and said he regretted not asking for dietary restrictions (it\u2019s standard procedure). He said he\u2019d really prefer to keep the team together for dinner but would respect my wishes. \n\nTo my surprise - he gave me an optional plan: he said he can always go to the sashimi restaurant for lunch on a different day during the trip (lunches are optional affairs) and he could simply rebook the dinner at a different highly-reviewed restaurant that was also a favorite of his with a private chef table experience. He also said he\u2019d tell a small lie about the sashimi restaurant calling and cancelling on him so the team wouldn\u2019t know it was me with the restriction. He said it was up to me if I wanted to take him up on it.\n\nSo I decided to take him up on it. \n\nThe new restaurant looks awesome. Also three people on my team have already expressed they\u2019re more excited for this new restaurant than the sashimi one! Wow! I guess it all worked out. I would not have sent the message to my boss without Reddit\u2019s encouragement. Thanks Reddit. \ud83e\udde1",

Even in the worst case scenario in option #1 where he rebooks the whole thing (which isn't a guarantee) - if the scenario was reversed, and there was a dinner you were excited for that consisted only of peanuts but someone on the team had a peanut allergy, would you resent them? It's not reasonable to be mad at someone about things they can't control. Tell him the truth, tell him you're sorry, tell him you don't want him to rebook it but you'd feel more comfortable meeting up afterwards for drinks and then believe what he tells you when he says he's sorry and he wants you to feel included and anything else. It sucks, but I think this is mostly an issue of shame on your part (and believe me, I know it sucks, big big time). Go to San Francisco. Don't let ARFID take this from you. Play it clean. Tell the truth. The consequences won't be that bad. Workplaces have accommodations for things like this.",

You know lying about this will increase your anxiety. \n\nIn your own words, say something like:\n\n\u201cthank you for organizing this team event, it is very gracious of you and I\u2019m looking forward to it. However, I wanted to discuss something with you before we go. I wasn\u2019t planning on sharing this with anyone but I privately deal with a very particular dietary restriction that would make this particular dish difficult to consume. I called the restaurant to see if any substitutions can be made but unfortunately they said no. I wouldn\u2019t want anyone to spend $150 on my seat when I cannot eat the dish. Again, I\u2019m very grateful that we can do this together. Do you have any ideas of how to navigate this situation? This is part of my daily life so I am happy to attend without eating, arrange to eat prior or even meet you all afterwards for drinks. My intention and expectation is not to cancel or reschedule this but I would love to participate. Hopefully we can find a solution together.\u201d\n\nThis touches on your disorder without being specific (no one understands anyway, it\u2019s your business), it lets your boss know you\u2019re excited to go and that not eating is totally okay with you as to not disturb the plans, that you\u2019ve already been proactive in finding solutions & and that you\u2019re inviting them to help you navigate the problem.",

I\u2019ve been in a similar situation (not sushi but generically fancy food) and what I did was email my boss and ask for a meeting and then when we were face to face I let her know that I have \u201clong-term\u201d stomach/gastro issues and I follow a strict diet to mitigate its effects. I told her that the foods I couldn\u2019t eat were not her responsibility and that I was happy she included me but I didn\u2019t want to waste company money or force them to change their plans since the rest of the team was really looking forward to it. I also said I didn\u2019t want to miss out on team building time so I think the best option would be to give my meal service to someone on the team who could appreciate it without consequence and I would join and either bring my own meal or order off the regular menu. (I don\u2019t drink either so maybe you could enjoy drinks too?). \n\nShe appreciated the heads up and invited one of the other managers in my place and had me look at the menu and called ahead to let them know I would be having a regular entree (it was fancy steak and it was awesome) and someone else would fill my place in the booking. I think it ended up costing her extra for the price of my meal but she was really kind about it and my coworkers were understanding. I did get some comments like \u201cwow I wish you could taste this!\u201d But I just deflected to something else. A question about a weird topping or smile and ask if they\u2019ve had something similar before. People prefer to talk about themselves - use that. \n\nI managed through it and I got some good face time in with everyone, and if you\u2019re feeling bold about any of it you can always ask to try a bite of a coworkers to \u201cget the taste without the consequences\u201d and if it\u2019s awful try not to make a face. Turns out I like mushroom risotto if it\u2019s prepared very, very well. \n\nAlternatively tell them you\u2019re allergic to seafood and baaaail. Good luck either way!! You can do it!",
