I have such an issue with food - suchhhh an issue with most foods - but there is something so relaxing about a good beverage. I have unfun diagnosed/monitored gastric issues, so I know my psychological comfort in beverages is because I know unexpected puking of a beverage is worldssssss better than unexpected puking of solids. BUT\u2026 do other ARFID people feel the same way?",

      "body": "I had to do a gastric emptying study where I had nuclear scrambled eggs and they took images of my stomach to see how long they took to pass through over 4 hours. The results showed delayed digestion and therefore gastroparesis. I did an endoscopy about a month before the emptying study and all my tests were negative and there was nothing visible consistent with my symptoms. I thought I could have been struggling with GERD, but I haven\u2019t received any insight from my doctors that suggests it. I also believe that I might have POTS and possibly hEDS (I actually first suspected gastroparesis after hearing someone else with POTS and EDS share on the ehler danlos subreddit, but after over a year of normal test results and no answers I really didn\u2019t have much hope of finding out what was wrong with me). I also think stress and anxiety are such a constant normal experience for me, it\u2019s really hard to not be that way, but I was also on a much higher dose of my antidepressants and I think this along with some of the other factors I mentioned contributing to intense dehydration which exacerbated my constipation and therefore also contributing to my constant nausea and vomiting. I sympathize with you and anyone else also struggling with anything like this as it made life incredibly difficult for an already struggling person and it\u2019s even harder trying to find answers and keep track of all the relevant symptoms only to be passed off from doctors as an \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with you, sorry.\u201d One symptom of gastroparesis that stuck out to me was feeling full soon after eating and I\u2019ve dealt with that for much of my life and never thought to mention it",
