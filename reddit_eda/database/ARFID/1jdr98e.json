  "selftext": "The best part? MULTIPLE textures and flavors \ud83e\udd2f\n\nSo I\u2019ve been trying to improve my diet ever since health issues started to pile up and I went down a spiral of guilt and shame because \u201cwhat if I caused this because of my food issues?\u201d. Good news, it looks like ARFID didn\u2019t give me AS, fibromyalgia, vertigo, migraines or any of my other symptoms. \n\nBut yeah, it\u2019s been a long road of forcing myself to eat some stuff, hating and dreading having to eat and all of that. \n\nBut I think I might have found the perfect meal: the mighty sammich. \n\nI\u2019ve been experimenting with vegan meat alternatives, most of which I find as disgusting as the real thing because of texture, flavor and smell. \n\nI\u2019ve tried multiple brands of beef and chicken vegan alternatives and even though I could manage to eat, it wasn\u2019t pleasant or enjoyable at all. Luckily I haven\u2019t throw up from being forced to eat something unappetizing since I was in middle school. Now I only feel sick and nauseous but no puking (yay?). \n\nThis time I chose to try extra firm tofu as it doesn\u2019t really taste like anything and doing the freeze/double freeze method actually helped with the general texture issue. \n\nI froze the tofu block, slathered with Frank's RedHot Buffalo 'N Ranch Thick Hot Sauce (a risky thing because I don\u2019t like dressings in general), let it marinate for about 30mins and then put it in the air fryer. \n\nAnd this is the wild thing about ARFID. I tried the sauce on it\u2019s own and I didn\u2019t like it. But after being fused with the tofu and throughly cooked to a crispy texture\u2026 I liked it! \n\nI don\u2019t know if tofu chips are a thing but if they\u2019re not I might have just invented them. \n\nAs I was feeling brave, I used cream cheese as a spread and to balance the spiciness, sprinkled everything bagel seasoning; then added mashed avocado, 2 tomato slices, lettuce and even alfalfa sprouts!. \n\nI don\u2019t even like these things on their own \ud83e\udd2f\n\nTurned out the mix of flavors, amounts and textures were perfect. And of course, potato chips are a staple that just made it better. \n\nI am honestly surprised and I feel like a foodie and not the freak that doesn\u2019t eat anything and when I do I have a wild set of rules and shit that make no sense to anyone but me.
