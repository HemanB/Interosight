  "title": "This Disorder is a Curse",
  "selftext": "Some may say that all it is is food issues, but that small issue opens up pandora's box. By not being able to eat most food you open up a world of health and social problems. Your health can be at risk because the foods you eat may not be good for you or even if they are you still may not be getting the nutrients you need. Me for example I literally never eat regular Vegetables and I know that if I don't start trying to make a change, my health will backfire on me. Even worse is the social aspect of this curse, even the people you love may never really understand what it feels like to have this disorder, they likely see it as you trying to be a pain.\n\nThrough no fault of our own (or anyone else for that matter) we have to suffer through this horrid condition.",

And then when you try to tell them that being severely underweight leads to extreme malnutrition and an endless cycle of sickness due to a poor immune system, they get all terse.",

Sometimes i dont eat all day because of work and I try to catch up in the evening and it some shitty food and I can already see the dufference in my hair for example.\n\nIt really is a curse.",
