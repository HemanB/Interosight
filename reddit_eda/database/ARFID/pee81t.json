I don\u2019t enjoy food, even my safe meals bore the hell out of me. \n\nHow is this a way of living? Is it going to go on forever? Who knows lmao",

Personally, I tried to take the work out of eating and supplement my diet with things like calcium, vitamins, iron pills. I'm considering Hello Fresh, or something like it, now that my safe food list is a bit larger.",

All day long I run through the options of things I can cook and it slims down because I forgot to prep anything because who is thinking about dinner at 7am when you need to take the meat out to thaw. I hate cooking. I hate eating what I cook. I am horrified to even taste my cooking most day. I wish I knew how to overcome this\u2026.",

I try to explain that when Im hungry my reaction is to wait for food because if I have to get it I don't see it as worth it. I just get no payoff for all the anxiety cooking causes and deciding what to eat causes. Running out of food and having to decide what to replace it with is awful too. And it's daily multiple times per day it's just so exhausting. I wish we could photosynthesize like plants.",

I don\u2019t have access to a kitchen where I live because I have that dorm life, but I\u2019ll take one bite of the most beautiful food I\u2019ve prepared...then I\u2019ll pawn it off on the people I made hungry because I can\u2019t stand the flavor, texture, or whatever. I usually try to get the people I give the food to clean up for me because cleaning is boring and the food smells bad when it\u2019s being cleaned. I get asked why I\u2019d make something not to eat it and like I don\u2019t know, I\u2019d like to try different things but it\u2019s icky",

I'm vaccinated and healthy and unlikely to become seriously ill - but what if I get just sick enough to lose my sense of taste and smell?  Just sick enough for food to taste gross?  Because I already have difficulty eating enough under the conditions OP describes.  If the whole experience somehow becomes even less rewarding than it already is, I will starve to death.",
