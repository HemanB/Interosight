  "title": "My boyfriend purposefully ordered me a burger with all the vegetables and thought I could just take them off....",
  "selftext": "I was mudding drywall for 7 straight hours today, so I was exhausted and looking forward to dinner. Waited forever, then the food got here. \n\nI opened the container and saw a burger with ALL THE STUFF. Onion, lettuce, tomato, etc. I gasped in horror. My boyfriend started taking all the stuff off. I said I couldn't eat it, he didn't listen. Kept \"cleaning\" it. He said to just try it. I said I absolutely could not. It was ruined. It was very distressing to have that pressure. Finally, he let it go. \n\nThen I realized that he wasn't surprised at all when it had the vegetables. I asked if he ordered it plain. \n\nHe said \"I thought I could just take all the stuff off.\" He wanted the vegetables for his own burger. \n\nI could have cried. I don't get to eat dinner tonight because of a choice my boyfriend made. Not anyone's mistake. We've been together for four years, so I was surprised he thought that was okay. \n\nI'm not angry at him. Just disappointed. It was an airhead thing he did. He's otherwise very thoughtful. Just WTF. I hate this whole situation. I hate this disorder. I hate how difficult it is for people to understand.",
