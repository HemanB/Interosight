  "selftext": "I\u2019m not 100% sure if this is a TW but before tonight it would have been one of mine. Little victory for me. Just don\u2019t wanna bother anyone. \n\nI ate a chicken wing. On the bone. I\u2019ve never been totally against meat- I\u2019d eat ground beef, or chicken if breaded and off the bone. Something about bones. Brings me into a weird place. \n\nTonight I had my first outside work function with my new boss and his family. They ordered appetizers and one was wings. I told myself, \u201cone bite at least- don\u2019t be rude. These people barely know you\u201d. I get anxiety eating in front of people and had hoped for a more dinner setting rather than family style share apps. Oof. \nSo I took a bite. And didn\u2019t feel too bad. Was able to have bites of soft warm good pretzel in between. And found myself reaching for a second. I def didn\u2019t get close to bone but it was a first and I\u2019m a little proud of myself (let\u2019s face it. A lot.). \n\nDidn\u2019t know who to tell. Thanks for listening. Xx.",
