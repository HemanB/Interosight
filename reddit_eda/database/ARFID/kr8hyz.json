Within the last 2 1/2 years (since meeting my husband) I have added several new foods that I previously avoided based on my own biased thinking. Honey crisp apples (only honey crisp w/o the yucky skin), nuts, black beans (only in certain recipes), and scrambled eggs (I can only stand them if they are light and fluffy and covered in a specific hot sauce) just to name a few. I have recently had a backslide in progress in 2020, resorted back to more of my safe foods (French fries, bread, chips, plain pizza) I think due to the immense stresses of Covid-19, and have been struggling to break out and be brave to try new thing again. Your post is inspiring and I hope one day to get back on track with more of an open mind. Thank you for sharing this.",
