Especially because when you finally get a food that works, that relief at finally having a working safe food is tainted because you know that at some point it'll go away and you'll be back in the hell of searching for something that doesn't feel like poison again. And sometimes when I do finally get a food that's \"working\" I'm so starved that all I want to do is eat that food over and over again literally 24/7 but I know that if I do I'll start to hate it immediately so it's like being hungry still no matter what you eat and waiting for the other shoe to drop until that food goes away and you don't have anything again.

He couldn\u2019t smell it but it was super strong to me. I washed those clothes 10 times, then soaked them in baking soda, then washed them again. They still smell like it to me. So now I have to wash them separately with baking soda every time because it freaks me out. We use all scentless things including candles. And we don\u2019t have pets because I am allergic to animals but being itchy freaks me out so bad that I can\u2019t stop panicking anytime it happens. So I can\u2019t just ignore it and have a dog.
