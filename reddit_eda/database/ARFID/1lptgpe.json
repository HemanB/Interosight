I explained to her I found out about arfid and that it\u2019s fairly new since it appeared in the DSM-V but she just thinks it\u2019s related to trauma and doesn\u2019t seem to be aware about arfid.

They rarely know what it even is so I don\u2019t expect much help in that department from any of them unfortunately. Sucks when things get rough and idk what to do ?? But fr they don\u2019t know what to do with it so it\u2019s pointless and exhausting to just keep explaining it and why I think I have it and stuff. I\u2019ll just suffer quietly and figure it out on my own \ud83c\udf1a I\u2019m also AuDHD tho and food issues come with that territory I think, or most drs assume so at least",

Since then I come here often for knowledge, support, and try to help others dealing with it. \n\nI\u2019ve never actually discussed it with any medical doctor or nurse. I was always made to feel like I was such an oddball with all the things I wouldn\u2019t eat that I just hid it as much as I possibly could. I always say I could be at a wedding and even if you sat next to me you\u2019d think I ate, but all I did was cut things and move them around. In my 20\u2019s, with the support of my hubby, I was able to add enough good and health foods to ensure I was healthy enough to have kids. \n\nSo yeah, compared to others my diet may be restricted, but for me I\u2019ve come leaps and bounds from where I was. Now I\u2019m ok with it and don\u2019t actually give one F what anyone else thinks of it. Also BTW I\u2019m healthier than most people my age. I have no chronic illness or conditions and take only an eyedrop to prevent glaucoma. I attribute this to my never having eaten meat. Who knows if I\u2019m right??",

The root of ARFID is different depending on people. But, your therapist should not tell you if it's a major problem or not, she should get informed on ARFID since you told her. Only you can say if it's a big problem for you (can you eat enough ? Are you struggling with deficiencies because of that ? Does it have an impact on your social life ?)\n\nMaybe it would be difficult to find a psychologist who knows a lot about ARFID (depending where you live) but you can find a psychologist who try to stay informed about what you are going through and not be like \"nah, I know everything\", it can make a huge difference",
