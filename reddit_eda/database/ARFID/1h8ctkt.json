  "selftext": "I\u2019ve had ARFID my entire life, and over the past few years, I\u2019ve become a lot more comfortable with it, and with telling other people what I have. I\u2019ve been working on trying new foods lately, but I definitely know my own limitations, and what foods are WAY too scary for now.\n\nA bit ago, one of my friends was trying to be helpful in a misguided way. I usually explain ARFID to people as a \u201cfood phobia\u201d to begin with, and I think he was struggling to see it as anything more than picky eating (since he\u2019s a picky eater). We were on the beach and he was eating chips with salsa, and I was eating plain chips. So he started encouraging me to try the salsa, and he put a very small amount of salsa on a chip and started trying to convince me that I wouldn\u2019t even taste it. (i think this is a classic ARFID experience lol)\n\nI think I looked stressed, because one of my other friends came over and told him off a little. She was like \u201chey, you don\u2019t have to try anything if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d and I was like \u201cwell I know this is gonna be WAY too hard for me, but how about I do it anyways?\u201d\n\nSo I spent a little bit working up the nerve while my friend was holding the salsa chip in my face (he was still trying to convince me it would be fine) and I did manage to eat it after several attempts. By the time I managed it though, I had FULLY burst into tears and was sobbing, and he clearly was uncomfortable and wasn\u2019t trying to make me eat it anymore. But I still ate the chip, through the tears. Lately my mindset has been like \u201cI can\u2019t let (x tiny piece of food) defeat me\u201d and it adds a lot more humour to the fear.\n\nI don\u2019t think eating the salsa chip helped me to feel any more comfortable with salsa, and I don\u2019t think bursting into tears is a recommended therapeutic method. I\u2019ve actually never burst into tears like that over eating, at least not as an adult. But it was also SO funny to see the dawning realization of \u201coh shit, this isn\u2019t just picky eating\u201d and I still view it as a victory because I did something I was so scared of. Overall, a power move.\n\nSo anyways, I would encourage anyone who\u2019s feeling capable to show the big reactions in front of people who will support you. A lot of ARFID symptoms are internal, and by externalizing it a little bit, I think it definitely helped to make others understand. Also, I think it was funny.",
