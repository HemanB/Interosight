  "selftext": "Surely I'm not the insane one here. Current example is I'm having chips (yeah yeah fries) with my dinner while my parents have seasoned roasted vegetables.\n\nWe obvs only have one oven so they're in at the same time but I just.. I just know I won't be able to eat them. If I can smell them across the room, if the potatoes had noses they'd be suffocating!\n\nSuddenly my analogy of \"If a smelly dog sits next to you, you're not going to smell like that dog?\" Is bullshit! (Their words not mine) and yet my mum always complains that when she cooks chicken her hair then smells of chicken \n\nSo her hair can smell of chicken but my chips can't taste like seasoning? Sure... even if it's just the smell, smell adds SO MUCH to how we perceive flavouring \n\nI'd rather eat in an hour by myself when the smell is gone. I feel sick just waiting for it.",
