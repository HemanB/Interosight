And I hate that food just isn't going to be a part of my romantic relationships ever.\n\nI've had significant others in the past who accept my food restrictions, so I'm not *completely* feeling hopeless about my love life... But it still makes me feel sad/isolated. Some people even go so far as to say their biggest turn off is a picky eater?? Literally why? How does it affect them?\n\nWill I ever find \"the one\", or am I doomed to be turned down forever just because I won't go on a pizza date?",

I find the whole process of digestion to be utterly disgusting, and seeing them eat makes me think of the end product of the digestive process, and I have coprophobia so I don't like to think about that. Out of sight, out of mind. I would rather eat at home alone and go out and do something than to eat in public and make that the center of the evening.

Secondly, most of the food I eat is home cooked, and it includes plenty of Asian dishes (I\u2019ve been making excellent chicken adobo lately). I would have eaten that pho in a heartbeat. But I don\u2019t have ARFID - I\u2019m in this subreddit because my partner has it.\n\nI agree that the girl calling the food \u201cgross\u201d \nis not on. However, from what I can recall the issue was that she wasn\u2019t hungry and the food was unfamiliar to her. While I can of course appreciate how in certain cultures it is polite to eat food whenever it\u2019s given to you, I also think it is unfair to expect somebody unfamiliar with those customs to abide by them. If this girl has ARFID or something similar, she was probably terrified of what might happen if she tried this unfamiliar food. And even if she wasn\u2019t, the food wasn\u2019t something she wanted or asked for, and labelling her as an arsehole for not eating something she doesn\u2019t want to eat (in other words, not abiding by a custom she may not be aware of, from a culture that she is not a part of), seems particularly intolerant to me.\n\nEdit: grammar errors",
