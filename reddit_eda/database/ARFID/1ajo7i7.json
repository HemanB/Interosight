  "selftext": "I know for a lot of eating disorders it's usually recommended to have very specific schedules and set mealtimes. I also know sometimes people set reminders on phones if forgetting to eat is the problem. \n\nThe thing is, I am very conscious of what time it is and when I \"should\" be having lunch or a snack.  The problem for me isn't forgetting. It's more that finding something that I actually can eat, making it, and then getting myself to eat it when I am not hungry and know I will feel gross after just sounds like so much? I also just have trouble making food when others are in the kitchen or just around, because I feel like they are judging me for not eating healthy or not eating enough or whatever, so I avoid it if anyone is in that area :/ \n\nI know that I need to eat more and that having a set schedule could also help with appetite? I can barely make it through half a meal before I feel full so the idea of eating three meals a day just sounds impossibly hard. For one or two days, maybe. But for the rest of my life? It just doesn't feel realistic.",
