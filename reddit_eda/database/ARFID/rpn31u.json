As an autistic person with ARFID, people will shame me for being a \u201cpicky eater\u201d until they find out I\u2019m autistic and suddenly it\u2019s not an issue anymore .. even if I wasn\u2019t autistic, it shouldn\u2019t matter if I\u2019m \u201cpicky\u201d. I definitely think that people need to care less about if others are \u201cweird\u201d, especially if it doesn\u2019t affect them",
