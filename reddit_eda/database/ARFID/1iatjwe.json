For instance, peanut butter is one of my safe foods but is high in sugar, so I get a less processed one with only natural sugars. It\u2019s a hard adjustment at first, but my issues with ARFID are mostly texture so luckily swapping has been a lot easier than I imagine it can be for some. Still, worth considering.

But I am trying and I\u2019m do want to make any excuses. I also have no issues swallowing pills. Are you getting perfect amino directly from the site? I just looked into that too. \n\nI realize I was extremely vague in what I wrote. After my doctor told me I had to cut down carbs (and I knew this), my diet then consisted mostly of avocado and low carb toast and easily I could make it through the day with it. After seeing my doctor in 2024 and she said what she did, I tried to do a lot better with variety and tried to up my proteins. I do have protein powders and I\u2019ve used Atkin shakes. I also eat eggs but most often, I\u2019m still comfortable with eating avocado and low carb toast. I\u2019m also a paramedic on 24hr shifts so in some cases where it\u2019s too time consuming to try with variety, I have been fine with making it through with bread, Atkin shakes, nuts, or in extreme cases, I\u2019ll just by some fries from somewhere. At home, I still eggs. Like I said, my main issue is meat textures. I worked my way back up to those \u201cReal Good\u201d chicken nuggets that are like 3g of carbs and 25g of protein which is perfect because I am still trying to lose weight, but I ended up getting disgusted. I am still willing to keep trying them though.",

Went back to the doctor in 2024 to her saying I was severely malnourished. She told me I need to intake protein, which is the hardest thing to do. Meat textures are the hardest for me and I am still focusing on lower carb food options so beans aren\u2019t really it for me.
