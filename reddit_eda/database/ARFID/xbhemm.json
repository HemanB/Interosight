      "body": "I have ADHD and this is definitely something I should try. I'm very \"out of sight out of mind\" (I forget about a lot of my healthier safe foods if they're not in current rotation). Making a visual chart of safe foods that are better for an anti-inflammatory diet is such a good idea. It would be a good visual reminder that I have other options, and maybe I should make a healthier choice.\n\nThanks for sharing this! I'm going to keep this in mind.",
