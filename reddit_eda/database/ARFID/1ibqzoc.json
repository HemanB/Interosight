  "title": "Finally found protein bars that ACTUALLY taste like candy bars",
  "selftext": "I have tried so many protein bars, and have hated almost all of them. They're either too gritty, too artificial sweetener-y, too dry, or just straight up gross. \n\nBUT today I picked up a few Barebells and Built puff bars and.... Holy moly. They're delicious!!! They ACTUALLY taste like candy bars, rather than a protein bar trying to imitate a candy bar. They have 15-20 grams of protein depending on which flavors you buy. Definitely give them a try if you're like me and struggle to eat protein, but love sweets. ",
