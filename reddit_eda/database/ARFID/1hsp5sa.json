Restrictive because I had so many bad experiences with food, and because my palette was so limited, and because my appetite was horribly small my whole life. Eating was a difficult hurdle every day, because just eating what I liked and what I was comfortable eating in quantity was never enough. \n\nTurns out I had a combination of issues. My appetite is better now, and Restrictive isn\u2019t as applicable, but Avoidant definitely still is. It\u2019s tough still. Hard to explain to people without coming across as entitled. I spent my whole childhood learning how to lie to parents (my own and my friends) that I\u2019d already eaten so I wouldn\u2019t seem rude if I rejected food. Or learning how to convince my parents to let me leave the table after barely eating because trying to eat the food they offered made my physically gag against my will, no matter how hard I tried not to. \n\nStuff a lot of us have experienced. Honestly I never had negative experiences with the process of eating, or rather, negative experiences never stuck with me enough to limit food. I have GERD, so you\u2019d think I\u2019d worry about what worsens the condition, but I\u2019m usually more focused on getting foods in me that I can handle than I am worried about what is better or worse for the my acid reflux. It\u2019s one of those many things that I\u2019d love to look into and focus on one day, but I need to make sure I\u2019m not failing nutrition first.",

Restrictive is more I have no interest in meals, preparing food is too much work so I won\u2019t bother if I\u2019m the only one eating, I\u2019d be happy to get all my nutrition in a pill, eating meals is exhausting. I\u2019m a snacking grazer so most of the time I get enough calories, and I\u2019ve gotten better over 50+ years of keeping some more nutritious snacks in rotation as well as taking supplements. Over the last few years with a new housemate who helps with shopping and meal prep I\u2019ve gotten better about having two fairly healthy meals a day with yogurts, protein bars, fruit, and cheese, not just junk food for snacking in between meals but I\u2019m still lacking in veggies\n\nLuckily the aversive is pretty limited:\n* Rice which I do sometimes choke on thanks to a car accident \n* All Seafood as well fresh water fish, pretty much anything that grows in water, except rice and cranberries and agar agar powder (vegan gelatin), cause gagging from smell, occasionally vomiting from smell, not being able to eat for up to 6 hours after smelling seafood, and vomiting if I end up eating it because someone thought it\u2019d be cute to hide it in my food to prove I don\u2019t actually have issues eating it. This one was always a problem but I have PTSD from having it literally forced down my throat a number of times by my bio dad. I\u2019ve gotten better to the point where I can sometimes cook seafood for others now and be able to eat when around others eating fish, shellfish, etc. but that\u2019s been less than 10 years (I\u2019m 57) and it\u2019s not something I can rely on.

      "body": "I was diagnosed with ARFID in 2020, but sometimes I wonder if that\u2019s what I have. I went to a treatment center because I was severely underweight and needed help. Then they diagnosed me, they asked if it was a texture thing and I was like \u201cno\u2026 not really\u201d but they kept telling me that I avoided textures, and every time I would tell them \u201cno I don\u2019t\u201d they would push back and tell me that it\u2019s ARFID. \n\nMy struggle back then was, I would be starving, get food in front of me, and not be able to eat it. I would chew, not be able to swallow/feel like gagging it up. Other times I would be able to eat perfectly fine. \n\nIt\u2019s still like that, but I push through it more now. \n\nI have what I think would be considered \u201cnormal\u201d aversions- like I don\u2019t necessarily love the texture of pudding or applesauce. But plenty of \u201cnormal\u201d people who don\u2019t have eating disorders say the same thing. \n\nMy mom used to make a stringy meatloaf and it would be so hard to eat. \n\nSmall things like that, but I think any person could have an aversion to it. \n\nMy biggest problem I think is executive dysfunction. \nBut also, sometimes I am starving but the thought of eating makes me gag. \n\nI for sure have food struggles, but sometimes I wonder if it\u2019s ARFID or something else.",

I was less scared of it because I had dealt with it so much that I sorta become numb to the sensation. \n\nNot sure how it'd work in a traditional sense, but in a weird way it did genuinely really help me stop letting vomiting control my life once I finally got the issue under control and got medicated for my acid reflux issues. I just had dealt with it alot. \n\nMy way isn't something you can exactly try unless you get sick, which would be shitty. I'd say I did kinda exposure therapy myself a bit with spiders by looking at photos first and then slowly transitioning into videos and then once I could handle that I would look in the tank at the zoo and now when I see just a small spider I can kill it when before I would cry.

I just had dealt with it alot. \n\nMy way isn't something you can exactly try unless you get sick, which would be shitty. I'd say I did kinda exposure therapy myself a bit with spiders by looking at photos first and then slowly transitioning into videos and then once I could handle that I would look in the tank at the zoo and now when I see just a small spider I can kill it when before I would cry. Still freak out over big ones though. I do believe exposing yourself a bit can help. Sucks while you're working on it though.",

At first I would have panic attacks almost every single time I felt it coming on. Then I started getting more and more used to the feeling because I was experiencing it. I was less scared of it because I had dealt with it so much that I sorta become numb to the sensation. \n\nNot sure how it'd work in a traditional sense, but in a weird way it did genuinely really help me stop letting vomiting control my life once I finally got the issue under control and got medicated for my acid reflux issues. I just had dealt with it alot. \n\nMy way isn't something you can exactly try unless you get sick, which would be shitty. I'd say I did kinda exposure therapy myself a bit with spiders by looking at photos first and then slowly transitioning into videos and then once I could handle that I would look in the tank at the zoo and now when I see just a small spider I can kill it when before I would cry. Still freak out over big ones though. I do believe exposing yourself a bit can help. Sucks while you're working on it though.",
