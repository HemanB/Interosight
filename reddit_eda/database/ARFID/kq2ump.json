  "selftext": "Feel like this is relevant now particularly being that\u2019s it\u2019s a new year and everyone\u2019s setting New Years resolutions. So I have ARFID and I feel lucky in that my range of safe foods seem to be wider than many people in this group, but the foods I do eat are mostly unhealthy. I don\u2019t eat any vegetables except for about 2 which are only in certain circumstances. I really just wish I could eat more healthier meals particularly for dinner as I know that i would feel so much healthier and better for it but because of my ARFID that really restricts my options. It\u2019s so hard working out what to have for dinner because I want to be healthy but my dinner options aren\u2019t very healthy and it\u2019s just so frustrating! It\u2019s almost like I feel bad for eating something kinda unhealthy for dinner even though I don\u2019t really have any safe dinner meals and I won\u2019t go hungry. Does anyone else feel my pain?",

Is there any way you could sort of hide healthier foods within your safe foods? Almost like some parents do when their child isn\u2019t comfortable with some vegetables but they still want them to get more nutrients (If you don\u2019t feel comfortable doing it yourself and are able to have someone cook it for you too this may help?). For example mashed potatoes with another vegetable (pumpkin/cauliflower/other) pur\u00e9ed through it or mac and cheese with a mostly flavourless vegetable pur\u00e9ed and mixed through the cheese. If you think this idea could potentially be helpful I\u2019d be happy to help you think of ways to incorporate fruit/veg/grains into specific safe meals! Otherwise potentially supplement drinks or multivitamins? Though I totally understand if none of this is helpful, eating disorders are super complex and it might take a bit of trial and error.

Obviously I won\u2019t be able to reach it constantly but if I\u2019m able to do it 5/7 days a week that\u2019ll be a big improvement. I\u2019ve just started being able to eat salads in like the last year and I recommend just putting some of your safe foods in them. It was a bit of stretch for me to start eating lettuce but I always liked apples and cucumbers as a kid so it was pretty easy to add those in and I just use balsamic vinaigrette (Trader Joe\u2019s one is so good and totally masks the flavor off lettuce). I\u2019ve been thinking of adding in red onions and shredded carrots, which are also foods that I\u2019m comfortable with on their own but two years ago I definitely couldn\u2019t see myself eating a salad whereas now I actually enjoy them a lot more than trying to eat cooked vegetables at least. I also gave myself the grace of being able to fall back on a smoothie if I\u2019m just really not feeling it some days which is still healthy and not as bad as just getting no servings of healthy food which is what I\u2019ve been doing most of my life. All this to say, when I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed, I try to strip it backs to baby steps that I feel comfortable with and then it makes it easier to all come together in the end. Hope this helps in some way!\n\nETA: also it helps if you use fresher produce because it\u2019s a lot more crisp and the longer the food sits in your fridge, the more mushy and unappealing it gets so I always try to use really fresh ingredients if that makes sense",

Being in college now, it feels insanely difficult to focus on something for more than 5 minutes. Though I have ADHD so that contributes, I feel like I'd be able to solve so many of my ADHD-related issues if I was getting the right nutrition & calories every day, but it feels IMPOSSIBLE.  \nIt really helps to know that you're not the only one.",
