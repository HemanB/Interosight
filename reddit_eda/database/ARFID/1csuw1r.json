I tried a sip of soda but it literally burns and tea tastes gross as well, never liked coffee either. That being said though I only like it from the little pouch. One time a family member put the Capri sun in a cup and I hated it. This is probably the only area arfid is mildly beneficial for me lmao I'm always hydrated \ud83d\ude05",

I was seated at the table that was adjacent to the kids' table and I noticed they were getting different dishes than all the other tables, particularly dishes that would be considered more kid-friendly. I don't want lobster! Just some plain ol' noodles. My 43-year-old cousin was already sitting at that table (probably has ARFID as well as he's even worse than me when it comes to food)\n\nI think my mom was trying to set me up with a single guy about my age (early 30s) who was sitting at our table, so I decided to excuse myself and slinked over to the kids' table. My aunt was so nice to even get an extra plate of food brought out since I don't think the person who did the seating arrangements had accounted for two adults being at the kids' table.",
