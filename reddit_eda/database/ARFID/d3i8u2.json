  "selftext": "I work at a sandwich shop and we usually get a sandwich at the end of our shifts. I was busy so I had someone else make my sandwich, which ended up being the new guy that my manager just hired a few days ago. He came over to me with my order and said \"is this all you want? Just Turkey and cheddar?\" I said yea and he said \"are you sure?\" I was having a bad day already so being asked that irritated me so much. I know it isnt his fault but I'm just pissed, I'm SO tired of being asked that. \"You just want a plain cheeseburger? You dont like ketchup? You dont want any veggies on your sandwich? No sauces?\" Just take my order and make it, I'm sure I'm sure I'm *sure* that that's all I want ! I only have so many safe foods ! \nI hope treatment will be available soon, I want to expand my safe foods but for now I'm stuck and I hate it.",

      "body": "Come sit in my restaurant section of no shame. I never judge whatever someone wants to eat (except people who eat like 10 oz of ranch to themselves). I might double check just to make sure I got everything right but it's not like a \"are you suuuuure?\" But I'm sorry your coworker made you feel judged. Some people just don't get it. \n\nMy first table today was two young women who looked like friends, maybe sisters. Girl 1 got a burger which has so many things on my \"No\" list.  Girl 2 wanted a burger with just the patty and bun with fries. Girl #1 teased her and was like \"that's it??\" And then laughed at Girl 2's food when I brought it over. I don't think she was legit trying to be mean, just lighthearted tease, but I felt a little heart broken for her. \n\n\nI also have a regular college student girl who comes in usually every sunday. I've been serving her roughly 2 years I think. She used to get the fish and chips, but no coleslaw and no tarter sauce. Then she changed at some point and now it's chicken strips with fries but no coleslaw and no sauce. It took me a very long time to consider that maybe she was picky like I am. It honestly seemed normal and I never questioned it. She's so sweet and I love whenever I see her come in. I think we might have talked a little about our pickiness about foods once too. Sometime I'd like to again because I've never really talked to someone who was a weird eater like me.",
