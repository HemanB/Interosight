  "selftext": "Literally writing this 30 minutes after the fact because I\u2019m so damn proud. Spaghetti Bolognese has been a meal I have outright avoided since childhood, occasionally tried a mouthful here and there and wanted to cry every time. Tomato in anything is a trigger food for me, which seems to restrict my meal options a lot (every recipe seems to use chopped tomatoes or tomato pur\u00e9e!!). \n\nLockdown has halted my progress A LOT but I told myself I wanted to cook this meal for weeks now, put it in the meal plan every week, failed to cook it every week. \n\nI went food shopping today, bought the ingredients and told myself I would make it TODAY because if I didn\u2019t the idea would be more and more daunting throughout the week. So I made it, put only a small amount of passata in the dish and added some garlic bread on the side (a safe food). I was shocked when I didn\u2019t tear up or start gagging, I ate it, enjoyed it, and I\u2019m so happy! \n\nTL;DR : Cooked spag Bol, a lifelong trigger meal, and enjoyed it.",

I was gentle with myself and reminded myself that I like mince, I like spaghetti, I LOVE garlic bread (hehe) and so the only obstacle on my plate was the tomato flavour, and honestly I put very little in it was easier for me to tolerate! I didn\u2019t like it on the first mouthful but I kept trying, not forcing myself though! And I kept reminding myself that I liked everything on the plate! \n\nI took it slow, I wasn\u2019t pushing myself to finish the meal either (but I still did!). I made sure I was hungry enough to want to eat something but not so hungry that it would be too tempting to just cook a safe meal, not sure if that makes sense! Basically, if I\u2019m super hungry I can\u2019t be bothered to put in the effort of cooking and trying a new meal and I just want a safe food to satisfy my hunger quickly. So when trying a new meal I try and find the right balance in that way too :) \n\nI also ate my dinner outside, it was a lovely evening and I could hear the birds, not sure if it helped with the food but definitely made me feel more relaxed :)",
