      "body": "My child had a cord wrapped around his neck too (needed emergency C-section). I've always wondered if he had any memory of that event because many times in playing between ages 4-6.5 years he has wrapped tape, ribbon, etc around himself. Once I explained that we can't wrap things around our head for safety, it  became a \"forbidden fruit\" scenario and he wanted to hide from me and do it. He told me that he hid because he didn't want me to be scared, that he was going to be safe, but I was always close and used distractions to play something else. We started seeing a great counselor to help with several things (anxiety, ARFID, general parenting, etc). He told me a couple times that he was playing spider and bug and that he was a bug caught in a web, wrapped up and the spider was going to eat him. (he saw this once in a book). I still don't truly know all that he was thinking/playing at those times. When he's older I plan to let him know about the cord at birth, just in case there is some subconscious impact there . Overall I feel there's a lot more contributing to his ARFID too like sensory issues and lack of regular hunger signals.\n\nI'm so sorry that reading that made you cry. It certainly doesn't paint a hopeful picture and it does highlight the trauma that can be carried throughout a lifetime. I view my child's ARFID as a part of the human experience, and just like many other experiences, it requires understanding, education, meeting needs, getting support. It doesn't make the experience easier, but it helps me to look for the ways to help and support. I hope to help prevent him from withdrawing, avoiding, and feeling shame for ARFID. This involves a lot of identifying, modifying, and eliminating societal and cultural expectations and norms surrounding food. (For instance I'm completely restructuring our Thanksgiving holidays going forward) And to help him develop what he needs inside of himself to prevent that withdrawing and avoiding. \n\nI know that article was tough to read, but I hope that I can send a little bit of positivity and hope to you today!!",
