McDonalds is the only fast food joint that adds beef flavoring to their since their \"classic\" taste was beef fat and after a scandal in the 90's about trans-fats they swapped to vegetable oil with added flavoring to make it taste more like it was cooked in beef fat instead of vegetable oil.\n\nEdit: if you want more of that richer filling flavor it has it's the taste receptor of Umami, which is typically derived from fish & beef oils & fats, and other flavoring powders like MSG.",

I\u2019d get embarrassed, uncomfortable, not want to go to certain events because of food that I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to eat but one day I decided to say fuck it. I don\u2019t care what other people think about me because they don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be us. I told my family (who complained or made comments about my \u201cpickiness\u201d at thanksgiving or Christmas) that they can pretty much get over it because I\u2019m not magically going to start eating whatever I want. I am who I am and it\u2019s not going to change and I\u2019m done apologizing for it. Don\u2019t let it hold you back. If i know I\u2019m going somewhere and there\u2019s food that\u2019s gross, I\u2019ll eat before and tell everyone I\u2019m not hungry and still enjoy their company. Don\u2019t let it control you and don\u2019t let it make you miss out on enjoying people\u2019s company because of food.  You are who you are. You aren\u2019t going to change and that\u2019s OKAY!
