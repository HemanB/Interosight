So from somebody who gets how tough this is, I am so proud of you, yes you in particular, for living with this. \n\nIf you tried a different brand than usual, even if you hated it, I\u2019m proud of you. \n\nIf you are a fry with a piece of skin on it, I\u2019m proud of you. \n\nIf you mixed two foods together for the first time, I\u2019m proud of you. \n\nIf you are food somebody else prepared, I\u2019m proud of you. \n\nIf you ate at all today, I\u2019m proud of you.",

Frozen raw meat is ok since it's solid, but not unfrozen or uncooked. I usually buy pre-formed beef patties and put them right in the freezer but today for the second time in a couple of weeks I bought a regular package of ground beef at the store and broke it up into smaller patties by hand to put in the freezer. I certainly didn't enjoy it, but I survived.",
