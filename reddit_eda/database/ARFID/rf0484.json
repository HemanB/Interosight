They'd ask \"Oh. Intermittent fasting?\" And then I'd get to go \"No, horrific eating disorder brought on by trauma. In the past week I've had about 12 chicken nuggets total. Don't comment on people's weight.\" \n\nSo frustrating. Like I know I'm big, but that doesn't mean I don't have trouble with eating. How do they think I lost 90 fucking pounds so fast??? Do they think I was TRYING??? I even had doctors tell me that I didn't have to worry. My hair was falling out from malnutrition and the doctors were telling me it's okay because I was fat anyways.
