They parrot the things their parents said to and about them when they were growing up (\"you're just lazy\" and \"they don't need drugs, they just need discipline\" or what have you) and claim that they \"turned out just fine\" (even though they very clearly didn't).\nThis might not always be the case, but I would guess it probably is in a lot of instances of this kind of attitude.",
