  "selftext": "I Iike eating the same food every day. I mostly enjoy my safe foods. I'm physically healthy, just a little underweight. Every time I have had bloodwork done it has come back fine. I know my diet isn't super healthy but I'm happy this way.\n\nHowever I hate constantly being judged for what I eat. I would honeslty say over 90% of my ARFID issues are entirely because of other people. If nobody ever got offended when I don't eat their food or made mean comments or gor frustrated when I don't want to try something everything else would be manageable. Yes, it sucks that I get nauseaus for no reason and that I sometimes can't eat when I'm hungry but I can deal with that. It's the enormous toll it takes on my social life that is by far the worst part. \n\nI don't even really want to get treatment. It feels like I would mostly just be doing it for the sake of other people, putting myself in stressful situations just so people won't think I'm weird. Does anyone else feel this way?",

As a kid though I had a hard time with some of my family members and that made me feel ashamed of having it as a kid.  I don\u2019t feel much desire to expand what I eat.",

I have been trying to manage to get better for years- I did \"food therapy\" last year for this very reason and I got incredibly frustrated. The people working with me told me, \"you're allowed to not like some foods\" at one point and it was honestly such a shitty moment. Nothing inherently wrong with that statement, we are allowed to like and dislike food, but it invalidates so much of my experience with ARFID. I wouldn't have gone to therapy in the first place if I were allowed to not like what i don't like and not eat what i can't tolerate. If only! My life would be so much easier if that were the case.",

But the eating the same exact sandwich every night for the past 7 years doesn't bother me at all.\n\nI hate social eating and I will only ever go out to eat with my husband and room mates because none of them judge me at all. I've had terrible experiences eating in groups and get high anxiety at just the thought. Luckily, I'm also an introvert and by now (mid 30s) everyone I know already knows that I decline most social events because it's too exhausting so it's not that difficult to navigate now days. The holidays are the only thing that's difficult but we always do potluck get togethers so I just make my own food to bring. I do have to figure out ways to decline someone's offer to try their \"amazing turkey stuffing and white gravy\" but I've found that I can usually say that I'm already so full that I couldn't eat another bite if I wanted to and that's good enough.\n\nI do have some minor issues with malnutrition (low protein, low iron...etc) but most of those can be maintained with multivitamins and the like.",

      "body": "i totally understand this. every single time i was with my friends or extended family, someone would make a joke about the food i was eating. i think it made my bad relationship with food even worse. one of my weird arfid things is i don't like red food (except apples because the red color doesn't spill anywhere. idk.) so that rules out pizza with red sauce, pasta with red sauce, hot dogs, and hamburgers. aka the only foods available at every single party in the US. it would annoy me because these foods are not even that healthy but i'd get ripped apart for not eating them.\n\nthen 2 years ago i was diagnosed with celiac disease so now im strictly gluten free. celiac obviously sucks especially for someone who already has a restrictive eating disorder, but it's kinda relieving that i don't have to be as socially embarrassed when i don't eat certain foods. i can just say i have celiac now and won't be judged as much.\n\ni really hate that people make comments about anyone's food. they think it's just one little harmless joke but don't realize we have to hear these jokes EVERY SINGLE TIME WE EAT WITH OTHER PEOPLE. it's exhausting.",
