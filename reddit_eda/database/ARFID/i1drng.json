  "selftext": "Do you mean that... all this time... I wasn't being a shithead? I wasn't being a burden, a spoiled rotten kid, a selfish asshole, an idiot? I was just... legitimately struggling with an eating disorder? \n\nDo you mean that I'm not alone? That there's people who understand? Who get why I hate fridges, who get why I never ate lunch at school, who get how it is to practically starve trapped in a situation where none of the food is safe?\n\nDo you mean I don't have to be ashamed of how I eat? That I can be proud of myself for trying new foods? That I don't have to feel guilty when people accomodate my needs?\n\nDo you mean all the people who told me that I was irrationnal, that I was a horrible person, that it wasn't that bad were wrong? That the fucking HEALTH PROFESSIONALS were the one being shitheads for bugging me about food for two whole entire weeks when I repeatedly explained everything when they asked? \n\nIt feels so good to finally put a name on what's ruining your life. ARFID, get ready to get your ass kicked, here I come.",
