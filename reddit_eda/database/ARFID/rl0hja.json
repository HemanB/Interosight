  "title": "You guys need to read this. Have any of you ever heard of John Rosemond? He has some strong words to say about ARFID.",
  "selftext": "**I am so mad right now.  There is this man who gives parenting advice named John Rosemond.  Look at some of the things he said about ARFID.**\n\n**These are paragraphs from an article that he wrote about ARFID.  Here is the link if you want to read the whole thing:** [https://www.indexjournal.com/lifestyles/columnists/john-rosemond/john-rosemond-tackling-the-dreaded-arfid/article\\_893a04cb-a045-5482-affe-b81d445e9b04.html](https://www.indexjournal.com/lifestyles/columnists/john-rosemond/john-rosemond-tackling-the-dreaded-arfid/article_893a04cb-a045-5482-affe-b81d445e9b04.html) \n\n\"The latest manifestation of this fraud is Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder, or ARFID, formerly known as picky eating. Lots of university health centers and independent practitioners offer therapy for people of all ages whose parents never taught them that not eating what someone else, including one\u2019s mother, has taken the time to prepare and serve is rude.\"\n\n\"Now, instead of picky eating being narcissistic and just plain rude, it is a psychological disorder that some people \u201chave.\u201d This ARFID thing has become big business, mind you.\"\n\n\"One psychologist, quoted in an online article, claims that picky eaters have control issues. That\u2019s right. They have control over whether they eat broccoli and Brussels sprouts or not. They choose to be rude because they seek constant affirmation that their almighty feelings represent universal truths to which everyone else should genuflect.\"\n\n\"A true story: Once upon a time, a child became infested with ARFID demons at an early age. He would begin gagging and sobbing at the very sight of a food that caused his tongue to feel even slightly less than fully happy. His parents \u2013 bless their hearts \u2013 catered to the ARFID demons by feeding him only macaroni and cheese, French fries and fried chicken nuggets. Sure enough, the ARFID demons grew increasingly clamorous.\"\n\n\"By the time the parents sought my advice, the child was certifiably insufferable when it came to food. He was well on his way to becoming an adult whom no one wanted to be around if the event involved eating. I told the parents to (a) feed him only what they were eating, but in half-teaspoon portions; (b) set a timer for 15 minutes; (c) put him immediately to bed if he didn\u2019t clean his plate before the time expired; and (d) let him have seconds of anything on his plate if he ate everything within the time allotted. Within a week, the ARFID demons had fled \u2013 demons cannot tolerate common sense \u2013 and said child was eating everything on his plate and asking for seconds.\"\n\n**After John Rosemond wrote this article, a petition was started by Laura Lyster-Mensh.  Here is the link if you want to sign:** [https://www.change.org/p/associated-press-apa-retract-picky-eating-article-ridiculing-children-with-mental-health-issues?utm\\_source=share\\_petition&utm\\_medium=custom\\_url&recruited\\_by\\_id=1e036a20-c391-012f](https://www.change.org/p/associated-press-apa-retract-picky-eating-article-ridiculing-children-with-mental-health-issues?utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=custom_url&recruited_by_id=1e036a20-c391-012f)\n\n**Rosemond wrote another article about ARFID in response to this petition.  Here are some paragraphs from the newer article.  Link:** [https://www.indexjournal.com/lifestyles/columnists/john-rosemond/john-rosemond-arfid-is-a-fabrication/article\\_1fa59d58-15ed-5303-a98a-ade12f27b353.html](https://www.indexjournal.com/lifestyles/columnists/john-rosemond/john-rosemond-arfid-is-a-fabrication/article_1fa59d58-15ed-5303-a98a-ade12f27b353.html)\n\n\"Ah, but a mental health diagnosis refers to nothing other than a set of behaviors. The behaviors can certainly be verified \u2014 as in, \u201cmy child refuses to eat anything but junk food\u201d \u2014 but no underlying, physiological cause has ever been proven for any mental health diagnosis. They don\u2019t refer to conditions that some people \u201chave,\u201d although that is what mental health professionals want you to believe. Without any tangible evidence, they claim that their diagnoses reflect such things as biochemical imbalances and brain differences. The *fact* is that no one has ever proven that a mental health diagnosis represents something someone \u201chas.\u201d\n\n\"ARFID, like all mental health diagnoses, is a construct, a fabrication. The problem \u2014 as reflected in the feedback in question \u2013 is that parents would much rather believe their picky eaters \u201chave\u201d something that\u2019s causing their tongues to reject normal food, than believe they created the problem by catering and enabling. One explanation absolves the parent of responsibility; the other does not. Which is more palatable, pun intended? Bingo!\"\n\n\"Per the Chinese adage again: Picky eating does not have to become \u201cinteresting.\u201d It can be, and should be, nipped in the bud.\"\n\n**These articles are very sad and give people the wrong impression about people with ARFID (and that palatable joke was so RUDE).  If you can, please up vote this post and sign the petition.  Up voting the post will help more people become aware of the lies that John Rosemond (a somewhat famous person) is spreading through his articles.

And beating hoarding is mostly about emotional work, which does put responsibility on the sufferer.\n\nWith ARFID, it sounds like if emotional work was all it took, the sufferers would happily do it.  It sounds a little like phobia.  The person isn't refusing to put their hand into a box of scorpions because they decided to be rude, they're terrified.\n\nI'm hating that the person is trying to categorize mental health problems as a construct and a way to shirk responsibility for a moral problem.",
