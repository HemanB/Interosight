  "selftext": "I was diagnosed with ARFID recently, and it\u2019s been all but mocked by my family. \n\nThey are well meaning, I know it sounds bad. But this is just a hard thing to conceptualize when they just know me as a \u201cpicky eater\u201d. Not realizing that it\u2019s not healthy to survive for 2 days on one bowl of soup and some crackers. \n\nI\u2019m 6\u20192\u201d and fluctuate between 135-165 depending on the month. I\u2019m lucky if I get half a meal in every day. And it\u2019s been so disheartening and isolating to be the only person I know who just can\u2019t fucking eat. And even when I can eat, I don\u2019t understand how people could actually *enjoy it*.  \n\nJust going through the memes and tweets on this sub have made me feel so much less alone. I have no idea how to even begin dealing with this new diagnosis, but I\u2019m glad to see that I\u2019m not alone.",
