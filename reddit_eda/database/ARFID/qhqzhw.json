I've been working really hard to try and cook regular healthy meals for myself, and now I'm understanding how a lot of my difficulties are related to ARFID. I've been researching lots of recipes and videos about cooking, so I thought it would be nice to have a dedicated space for those in the same boat. I do want to explicitly flag that everyone has their own subjective experience of ARFID, as we all have different levels of restrictions and support. I want this new sub to focus on practical tips and brainstorming; that's not something everyone is in the right place for, and that's completely valid. \n\nI've never made or moderated a subreddit before so we're gonna kind of see how this goes. I'm just going to start by posting videos and suggestions as I come across them in my own research, I hope they can be useful to others as well!",
