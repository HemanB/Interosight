I want to help and spread awareness about ARFID so I made a TikTok and will use it as a food diary to share some meal ideas I have that I think will be helpful in the community. Just started today so there's oy one video up, but I plan to have at least 2 or 3 more by the end of the week.\n\n[Buffalo Chicken Tortilla Wraps ](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZTdyEXsTY/?k=1)",
