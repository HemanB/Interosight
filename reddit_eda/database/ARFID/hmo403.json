  "selftext": "My mother in law makes \u201cbraided Swiss loaves\u201d for the family that they all really like. I don\u2019t like them, I can\u2019t handle lunch meat, so I generally eat the bread around it or slyly don\u2019t eat (you know how it is) \n\nShe\u2019s always been super supportive of me, never demanding about my eating like my parents are. \n\nMy parents and I happened to get in a fight a couple of weeks ago and I\u2019ve been NC, so I was excited to go visit the in laws for dinner. \n\nWe got there late and found out that not only had she made some with pizza filling, but she had vehemently guarded it from everyone else, and let me cut into it and have it all to myself. \n\nI never told her I don\u2019t like braided Swiss loaves (it gets old explaining everything that I don\u2019t like) she just noticed. And knew I would like pepperoni (only) pizza, so she made me one. I cried when I got to bed at the end of the day.",

My fiance's mother is wonderful about my ARFID, even since we were just friends 8-9 years ago and I would go over to her house to hang out. \n\nHer mom always offered to make me some plain buttered noodles or whatever if I didn't like what they were having. That's continued almost a decade later as they've welcomed me into their family. \n\nDoesn't matter if it's a big family meal like Thanksgiving or an important event, they always make sure I have something to eat or let me know to eat beforehand so I won't be uncomfortable, and with the exception of her elderly grandma her whole family is so great at not asking me lots of questions or making me feel bad about it.",
