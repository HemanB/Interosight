Like buttered toast and put some oregano or basil on, sounds so stupid now looking back haha but I slowly went from there to trying eggs, pizza then eventually pasta! Also do you think think there's a correlation between food colour and arfid? I see alot of cases where the diet seems to be beige or bread coloured(?) food. some people eat all green foods etc... I'd love a study to be made into this - obviously it's not as simple as that and not always the case but I just realised that my diet is mostly the type of colour as the picture above!",
