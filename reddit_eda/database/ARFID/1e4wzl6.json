  "selftext": "I went to see a neurologist today for my persistent daily migraines. For some background information, my main safe food is baby carrots. I have eaten baby carrots every day for most of my life, and because of this, I have very orange hands and feet. Today the neurologist noticed this and was very concerned about it. She told me to cut out carrots completely to avoid getting some disease caused by an excess of vitamin A. I don't eat much else other than carrots so this means I just won't really have anything to eat. I don't know what to do. There are no substitutions that can work for me like carrots do. I'm kind of freaking out right now. Crunchy foods are something I desperately need because they help with the pressure in my head. I'm so upset right now.",
