  "selftext": "The ARFID instagram accounts that I\u2019ve come across seem to generalize ARFID. It makes it seem like all of those with ARFID just eat pasta with butter or hate all fruits and veggies, etc. Sometimes it can feel a bit invalidating. \n\nFor me personally, my ARFID ebbs and flows quite a bit, and it\u2019s very impacted by anxiety/sense of safety and overwhelm. I have a wide range of foods I\u2019m ok with, and will really try anything. From my range of foods, I only choose about 5-7 at a time and foods get cycled in and out depending on so many factors. My main thing is lack of interest in food and lack of appetite, with restrictive ARFID due to sensory issues or fear of aversive consequences (this happens if I\u2019m dysregulated in my body or with sensory stuff in general).\n\nBut I just want to voice that yes I have ARFID, but I find fruit safer than chicken nuggets. I will eat veggies more than I will pasta with butter. Some times all my food is packaged and other times I love to cook. I might only eat beige foods for weeks at a time, but then have a variety of colors the next. Some months I can\u2019t handle any flavor, and others I put many spices/flavors on my food. \n\nMy point is, there are SO many variations to ARFID. I feel so lucky to have a fantastic dietitian and OT who have helped me so much. I\u2019ve been able to create \u201csafety\u201d in my environment, body, and with others, which allows me to have more stability and consistency with my eating habits. And some times, my brain just goes into overload and I end up falling back into ARFID habits. ",

      "body": "I think pasta with butter is atrocious. \n\nBut yes the severity? i guess? Of my sensitivities go up and down depending on just how stressed I am. My diet is VERY limited compared to five years ago. It\u2019s always been there on a certain level but I feel like severity sways a bit\n\nETA: I don\u2019t do anything related to contamination. So if someone else has taken a bite of my food or used my spoon or drank from my cup, can\u2019t eat it. Also bugs. No. Then I deal with textures, smells, appearances. Then I also deal with lack of interest. But the, I guess, my sensitivity to these go up and down based on how stressful my life is. They are long cycles, not like every day it changes. \n\nSo some foods I always have been and probably always will be unable to eat because of their smell or their appearance or their texture. But sometimes the foods added to that list increase, but sometimes only temporarily. Sometimes they stick. Sometimes my contamination fears are very rigid and strict, sometimes I\u2019m slightly more lenient (like wiping off the spoon instead of getting a new one entirely). And my lack of interest fluctuates as well. It\u2019s always there on some level but it can be a \u2018I don\u2019t really want this but I guess I\u2019ll eat\u2019 to a \u2018I\u2019ve no interest in that I don\u2019t want any of this food I\u2019m not eating\u2019. \n\nHope this makes sense?",

      "body": "thank you for posting this! just the other day, someone on this subreddit very rudely accused me of not having ARFID, because i could sometimes eat a wide-ish variety of veggies. they proceeded to make their own comment thread about how i don\u2019t have ARFID, then said my \u201ccharacter and the foods [I] eat are disgusting\u201d\u2026 and blocked me after i answered their questions about my ARFID. \ud83d\udc80\ud83e\udd23\n\nall cuz i like veggies sometimes! the invalidation is REALLLL!\n\njust like you, for me the issue is a lack of appetite mixed with sensory issues that change/cycle, plus a fear of aversive consequences (like vomiting).\n\nkinda off topic, but i noticed a lot of us with ARFID who eat more veggies & fruits, tend to like to cook or know how to cook. i feel like having the option to tweak my food however i want has given me a lot of control with my ARFID, and maybe it possibly does the same for others! idk, but everyone\u2019s ARFID is different and you\u2019re not alone in feeling invalidated.\n\ni will say tho, this post is very very validating :) thank you again!!",

I\u2019m having to set timers to remind myself to put SOMETHING in my body because I\u2019ve lost too much weight. I\u2019ve thankfully made connections with other therapists who have helped me start looking for an ED RD to hopefully start working with soon (if I can find one that takes my insurance). It\u2019s wild to be working in my field and not know what is going on with yourself. Just another reminder that we\u2019re out here needing to do our own work too I guess.",
