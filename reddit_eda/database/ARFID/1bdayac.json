If they're served any other way, I need to take a cautious bite first. They don't have to taste like the taco time ones or even look like them. Even I don't understand it, honestly. Putting them in that cup works! They're okay that way because they came from the \"magic\" taco time packaging. \n\nI had a friend who was a manager at one, and he gave me two huge stacks of brand new ones, so I could try other foods in them. Sadly, it only works with tater tots.",

But if it's a new place or they look different, I just can't guarantee I'll be okay with the textures or flavours. If I try one thing and it's bad, I can just not eat the rest of that thing, but if I do that with the whole sandwich, then the whole sandwich is bad. I can't take that thing off. It doesn't work. Sometimes, I can then deconstruct it and eat things separately, but not reliably. \n\nAs a kid, I deconstructed everything except deviled eggs and soups. Everything. Even pizza. It drove my mother nuts, so I'd get in trouble. That really didn't help me get over it at all. \n\nI somehow just stopped having ARFID when I hit puberty. It was awesome! And then it came back when I got pregnant and never went away again. Ugh. But it had a good lasting thing. I had way more safe foods after than before, and there were a lot less things I had to deconstruct, but sandwiches are just an issue. \n\nThrough therapy, I've managed to add a lot of veggies the last couple of years. I'm pretty happy about that. Still isn't helping with sandwiches. It's like I just don't trust them. Who knows what's hiding in there? I love subway, because I can watch them put everything on.",
