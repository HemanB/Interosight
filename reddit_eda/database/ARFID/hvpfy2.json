  "selftext": "Y\u2019all I was just laying in bed, deep in my thoughts and out of nowhere I got an urge to walk to my fridge and eat a grape. I have no idea where this came from but this is HUGE considering I have been eating the same things for the last couple years. I was surprised at how sweet it was (almost candy-esque) but the texture was still a struggle. I highly recommend to try a new food if you are completely alone as it worked for me. Hope this helps someone \ud83d\udc4d",

It was precious. \n\nEating grapes frozen is a good strategy; the texture and flavor is more consistent if you don't mind the cold. It's also summer for me, so anything that helps beat the heat sounds better than usual.",
