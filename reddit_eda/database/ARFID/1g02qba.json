She getting enough calories but not particularly nutritious. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t like taking about it but she has shared it causes her anxiety when she\u2019s somewhere without familiar food, like dinner at a friend\u2019s house. I think she beats herself up over it and wishes she wasn\u2019t this way.\n\nFor those of you with ARFID do you blame your parents? You can be honest because I already blame myself. I\u2019m sure there was a moment or maybe several times when she was younger that she didn\u2019t want to eat a food so we gave her something we knew she\u2019d eat and it probably spiraled from there. \n\nEdit: Thank you all for sharing such personal stories with me. I learned a lot that I think will help me help my daughter. ",

Made things I disliked on purpose and I had to eat it all week, for lunch and dinner. And always accused me of having anorexia/boulimia, to the point that I was not allowed to flush the toilet anymore untill she had checked it. \n\nSo that is the opposite scenario. \n\nI actually am one of the few who doesn't have to worry about safe foods tho. I know my father used to let me try lots of things. Olives, fish, calamaris. My grandmother made me familiar with lots of veggies. \n\nBut my parents seperated when I was 9, and my mother never cooked a decent meal. \n\nIn general, I rarely have a feeling of hunger. I can't eat much, more like a childrens sized portion, I am underweight, I do not enjoy eating, and have many other ARFID symptoms. \n\nYes. I blame my mother for my symptoms, but, I guess even if I had no symptoms at all, I would still blame her for being abusive. \n\nWith my toddler, I encourage her to try. She has to try a tiny bit of a new food, if she does not like it, she doesn't have to eat it. What am I supposed to do? Force it down her throat? Sometimes she likes what she tried, sometimes she doesn't. Next time, we try again. If she throws a fit, we let her \"win\". Better to finish the rest of the plate than to have her crying and refusing all of it because she is upset I guess.",

      "body": "No. In fact, plenty of kids END UP with ARFID from being forced to eat when they don't want to. There's a specific type of ARFID that can be caused by trauma, and the most common thing that causes that trauma are things like force feeding. It can also be caused by choking or a particularly traumatic episode of vomiting, but force feeding is absolutely up there.\n\nGiving your kid options is the CORRECT thing to do. (Edit: Just wanna jump back in to really assert this; ARFID is NOT caused by giving your kid options. That is a gross misrepresentation of ARFID and is actively damaging to us to hear you think being a decent parent might have caused your kid to spiral. The only way you could have given your kid ARFID is if you force fed them or did something else heinous with food. Being a normal human who doesn't force feed kids doesn't mean you caused your kid's ARFID and it's important to drop that immediately for the safety of everybody.) You did the right thing. Forcing your child would have made it worse. A lot of uneducated parents around you are going to say stuff like \"If that was my kid, they wouldn't be picky!\" and \"you should have made them eat their vegetables then they'd be fine!\" NO. THEY ARE WRONG. IF THEY HAD A CHILD WITH ARFID, THEY WOULD HAVE KILLED THEM! I'M NOT JOKING. THE PEOPLE WHO SAY THAT, ARE SAYING THEY ARE WILLING TO KILL THEIR CHILD. LET THAT SINK IN.\n\nPeople with ARFID blame their parents for forcing them to eat. Never once have I blamed my parents for NOT forcing me to eat. All of my anxiety came from knowing I'd be ostracized, maybe even outright punished, if I didn't eat what I was given. People all over the world misunderstand this disorder, they misunderstand it so severely that they give their children PTSD and worsen their condition. If you had force fed your child, you would have made their ARFID worse. That is NOT HOW TREATMENT WORKS!\n\nStop blaming yourself. That's not a dig on you, it's emotionally damaging to your child to blame yourself for a condition NEITHER OF YOU CAN CONTROL! Most people with ARFID end up sticking to their safefoods with minor changes to assure we're getting all our essential nutrients and the proper amount of calories- We aren't fixed by being forced to try new foods and we never ever will be. It's traumatic to do so and you did the right thing by not forcing it. If a parent says you should have forced it, you can tell them they sound like a horrible parent and their kid would probably be dead if that happened. A lot of cases of ARFID progress as the person ages- I loved broccoli as a kid then suddenly couldn't handle it anymore, but was that my parent's fault for not force feeding me more broccoli?? NO! And in the cases where I was forced to eat things I couldn't handle, I'd throw up and then be punished for throwing up. Now I have C-PTSD. Remember this the next time someone tries to say shit about your parenting.",

Everyone around them was telling them to force food on me with advice like the typical \u201cyou eat this or you don\u2019t eat tonight at all\u201d but they stood firm and let me eat my safe foods and found creative ways to try to meet at least *some* of my nutritional needs (so many protein bars). Thank god they never forced me to eat anything, because otherwise I would\u2019ve been straight up traumatized and my relationship with food would be even WORSE. \n\nThe only thing I \u201cblame\u201d anybody for is blaming the DSM for not making ARFID a thing until the latest edition. I kind of blame my doctors for not trying to do anything about it, but same thing: I\u2019m glad I wasn\u2019t ever shamed by a doctor (my parents made sure to find cool  ones) or traumatized by \u201ctreatment.\u201d And for what it\u2019s worth, my parents did find a speech pathologist who did exposure therapy for me; I just wasn\u2019t ready for it yet.\n\nYou might ask if your daughter is interested in seeking some form of treatment. I say that because she sounds a bit like me when I was 17 (now 22). I was in my senior year of high school and felt exhausted all the time and like my body was working against me. That frustration led me to seek out a dietician, and the dietician recommended I research ARFID and look into treatment. We found a good IOP/PHP, they took me in for two months or so (summer after graduation haha), and at the end of those two months I was eating pretty well balanced meals for the first time in my life. Now, **big disclaimer:** the key here is she has to want to do it. Don\u2019t force her to do this. The only reason it worked for me is because I was insistent on it and determined to get better. I still very much have ARFID and am still in treatment now (weekly appointments with a dietician who knows about ARFID), but I\u2019m leagues ahead of where I was five years ago. Exposure therapy is hard work, but if you\u2019re willing and able to do the work, **it can change your life!!!!**",

When I was little there were lots of times that my parents caused unintentional trauma because of a lack of knowledge. 30 years later and I can still remember exactly how certain moments at a meal felt because of how traumatic it was. However, when I was formally diagnosed with ARFID five years ago my parents did their research, apologized for anything they\u2019ve done that might have made it worse, and now support me however I need. \n\nI forgive them 100% for forcing me to eat 10 bites of rice pilaf because I was 10 years old, or 6 bites of okra because I was 6 years old. They were doing their best with the information they had at the time. That\u2019s all we can do as parents. We try our best to be supportive and give our kids the best we can, but there will always be something that is out of our control. \n\nMy own ARFID comes from a different set of anxieties than my son\u2019s does, and often his food habits will be triggering for me. I struggle with knowing when to gently challenge him on a food and when to let something go, because I over-empathize with him and put myself in his shoes. There are days when I think it\u2019s lucky for him that I have it too and days when I think I make it harder for him. But, just like my parents, I\u2019m doing the best I can with the knowledge I have. I\u2019m sure there will be things that I\u2019ll need to apologize for when he\u2019s grown up, but I\u2019ll tell him this same thing. \n\nI read a while ago that all it takes is one aversive event for a food to become unsafe to the consumer, regardless of whether that event is intentional or not. One time when I was 8 I ate my dinner too fast and puked up tubbouleh everywhere. Haven\u2019t been able to eat it since. Another time, in high school I got drunk, inhaled a can of cold spaghettios, and yarfed it all over the kitchen sink. But for some reason my brain still allows me to eat spaghettios (although now I at least heat them up in a bowl, like a lady!). Those were both aversive events in my childhood but for whatever reason my brain was able to \u201cget over\u201d the spaghettios aversive event. Who knows why? \n\nMy point is, there\u2019s not always a rhyme or reason to this disorder. Sometimes it just happens and there\u2019s not a rational conclusion that can be made. \n\nGive yourself grace, apologize to your daughter if you think it will help her recovery (hers, not yours), and then move on and support her however she needs. ARFID is such an emotional sink hole and a person who has it spends so much time feeling ashamed/anxious/embarrassed/frustrated/hungry. Make sure that your daughter is able to navigate those emotions herself (and hopefully with a therapist!) without having your guilt tossed in there too.",

      "body": "I grew up in the nineties and my food issues were treated as bad behaviour and not as a condition. As a result my parents handled the situation very badly. On a regular basis my father would scream, threaten and hit me while I sat staring at plates of food, occasionally he would physically restrain and try force feed me, when this would fail he'd rub food all over my face, it was incredibly distressing and traumatic. As a child I dreaded every social gathering and family mealtime because I knew there'd be the routine shaming and humiliation, I'd have to sit there while everyone ate, laughing, ridiculing and berating me, I honestly felt like I deserved it and was a defective person, it was this huge thing in my life and literally every single birthday wish I had as child was to just be \"normal\".\n\nMy mother had (and still does) have a lot of anxiety and would attempt to scare me into eating with various lies, that I would never be able to find a partner and \"what would I eat on my wedding day when everyone I knew was looking at me?\", the worst example of this was telling me I wouldn't survive until I was eighteen. My family played along and I believed this and instead of \"scaring me straight\" it instead caused me to accept it and I grieved my own life at a young age, by the time I was a teenager and realised none of it was true, I had severe depression, anxiety and difficulty forming relationships, I wanted nothing to do with my family and moved to the other side of the world at nineteen to try and start again.\n\nNow in my 30s I've moved home. I've had quite a bit of counsellng over the years and I've had to try and resolve this for the sake of my own family, I'm a father to two young girls now and even though they don't have food issues I just can't imagine doing to them anything like what was done to me for any reason. I needed to try and face it directly though and move on.\n\nI tried to have a frank discussion with each of my parents about what happened. I told my father that it was something I didn't choose and that the physical stuff he did was really damaging. He immediately apologized and acknowledged that it was wrong, he was father to four boys, he had lost baby before us and had to cope with my mother having a breakdown, he was drinking, struggling and his anger and frustration shouldn't have been levelled at me, he said he loved me and he was sorry. I could at least understand this and I now have a good relationship with my Dad.\n\nMy mother on the other hand was more interested in finding out details of the condition so it would absolve her guilt over my eating habits. I tried to explain that the condition itself is nothing in comparison to the psychological damage I suffered because of it, the pressure that I was put under, the shame and guilt I was buried in and the lies I was made to believe. I wanted to explain that the mixture of love, care, disappointment, guilt, shame and fear that she imparted on me did more damage than anything else, I can't trust people, I have difficulty with close relationships because of what people might expect or demand from me that I can't give them and it still profoundly affects me to this day. If it was only the condition to deal with I can just get enough calories and take a multi-vitamin FFS.\n\nMy parents aren't bad people, but they made really bad decisions, they've had plenty of their own traumatic events in life and they were scared, overwhelmed and didn't understand this thing. I'm almost sure now that my Mother has ASD that was never diagnosed, she has visible stims and is just a very textbook case of a female presentation of Autism. She can't or won't understand where I'm coming from and this has caused our relationship to be strained ever since, she'll still comment on my food or bring up stories of my childhood laughing, no matter how many times I make it extremely clear that it's not acceptable. What makes it worse is that my oldest brother openly says to me and other family members that I should be \"lucky to have it as good as I did\" and that I'm being overly-sensitive. While I'm sure there's some truth in that, it doesen't change the issues I've been dealing with ever since and doing my best to get past.\n\nAnyways, in my view you asking this question is enough to show that you care about your daughter's condition, that you recognise it as a condition that she didn't choose and that you want to help her. For me that would've been an amazing parent. Keep trying to help her and aleviate any feelings of shame, guilt and anxiety and I'm sure you'll be okay.\n\nWith the right approach things can and do get better, My ARFID is significantly better than I was as a child / teenager.  \nBest of luck",

That said, my parents (especially my mom) have always been very supportive, both regarding food and in general with emotional support. They made me tiny portions of new things to try, but my mom would always make a safe meal for me. So I always had the security of knowing I'll be able to eat something, and try new stuff if I wanted to. No one was upset when I didn't want to. She'd invite me to join her while cooking (also stuff I don't like), so I'd get accustomed to it without having to actually eat it. And now in my 30s, I think that was a great idea!\n\nBased on your comments I believe you're a very supportive parent, too. And I highly doubt you have caused your daughter's ARFID. Do the best you can to support her in her journey, and remember no one is to blame! It's tough enough for her, all you can do is give her options and support her. It's vital to have her blood checked for (micro)nutrients so she may stay healthy, and maybe supplement what she does lack. No pressure to ingest these lacking nutrients through food, though. This can come over time. \n\nFor me personally, my arfid is related to autism, and it does get worse when under pressure. Not having had the opportunity to get therapy but by being content with myself, not making a big deal out of my eating behavior (that is, not pathologizing it, not focusing on it, not thinking about it), I do eat much more stuff nowadays, out of pure curiosity and with patience! \n\nWhenever under pressure though, it does get worse and I lose my appetite. One example: I'm currently staying abroad at my in-laws' house without my spouse's support, and I am constantly being reminded of my ARFID, being asked if I like this or that, and whether I have always had this problem with eating (no, I have never had a problem with it! it was always others who had the problem and couldn't just accept me the way I am!) - \"funny\" jokes being made about hypnotizing me and force-feeding me - I feel restricting myself more and more and losing my appetite completely. Whenever at home or at my mom's though, it's much better. \n\nI believe your daughter is already gifted with a loving, caring environment, and she's very lucky to have you. Please be as kind to yourself as you are to your daughter, you both deserve it :)",

It didn't help my association of fruit = bad. \n\nBut it was also what was the most logical to do without knowing what was actually going on. There emught be many books on parenting, but none of the a re a one size fits all Procedure of Operation. Parenting is also jsut kinda fuck around and find out, so I don't blame them at all. And even if they didn't make it worse, I probably would have the same problems anyway just maybe a but less severe. Fruits are so important in a daily diet I don't blame them at all to find soemthing I did like, or to find ways I would eat them even if it was a bit. It might not have worked. But maybe it would on someone who \"simply\" didn't like it. Just not on me. But how would they know when I was an age where I could barely articulate myself to begin with? \n\nI do agree with the people to not let her know you blame yourself. It already feels so humiliating and like you're a burden in everyone else when it comes to food because alterations have to be available most of the time. If you say you blame yourself, that feeling of being a burden will grow stronger. Maybe when she's older, like adult living on her own for at least a while. But not at 17, when insecurities outside of arfid are also raging wild. \n\nBut also, it's not your fault. There can be many reason for someone to have arfid and not all are rooted in parantage. For me it's autism. Basically all fruits have something overwhelming one way or another. And like I said, there's not a one size fits all manual for parenting. You did what you could and that's what counts. Try to help her cope instead. Make sure there's always safe foods available for the moments it's needed. Be there for her when she tries something new. Be there for her to gain the confidence of saying \"no thanks, I don't like it\", even if it's over and over again, without feeling rude or like a burden. To me, from the other perspective, that's what counts.",

      "body": "ARFID is caused by many different reasons and it differs for everyone. my ARFID is caused by various factors, from being neurodivergent, having OCD, and from trauma. Partially, I do blame my parents, the reason due that the trauma was caused by my parents forcing me to eat foods that I couldn\u2019t eat. that were not in my safe list, that would trigger my sensory issues. I would be screamed at horribly until I cried, I would be physically held down and not allowed to get up, my dad would get in the way if I tried to get up. my dad is an abusive man, so you can imagine how terrified I, a little girl, was when he would scream at me and block my way. I would be forced to eat certain foods to the point where I would throw up. I first began developing ARFID when I was 3, I was diagnosed with it when I was 15, and now at 18, I\u2019m finally recovering. I didn\u2019t start my recovery process until now. I couldn\u2019t find the proper treatment because my family couldn\u2019t understand my diagnosis and the ED recovery centers I went to weren\u2019t properly trained to treat my ED and it wasn\u2019t until I experienced some freedom away from them that I was able to finally to heal a bit and recover a bit from that aspect from the trauma",

Had to do the whole throw up in my mouth and swallow it rigamarole. I guess he thought that I would eventually get used to it, but quite the opposite, anything I was forced to eat still makes me gag and throw up in my mouth, still, at the age of 36. Foods I disliked but wasn't forced to eat I can manage much better. \n\nMy father would never apologize for anything, but still, I can tell he regrets it, so I forgive him. But I know this is the reason I will never have a healthy relationship with food. \n\nAs for my mother, she was better, and wouldn't force me to eat foods, but still did one thing that greatly contributed to my anxiety around food. I was never allowed to just \"not eat\" a food, even if that food one just one of several things being served. I was only permitted to not eat a food if a replacement was provided. So, the biggest thing we fought over was potatoes, and my dad would want to force me to eat it, but my mom would want to make rice as a replacement. Eating the vegetable and meat (I'm ok with most options in those categories) alone was never, ever an option. So, when we went to a relative's house for the holidays, she would insist on making a replacement so she could talk and not have to sit there and force me to eat my potatoes bite by bite. And then the relatives would talk shit about how I \"forced\" my mom to make this rice. It was really embarrassing and definitely contributed to my anxiety and shame around food. Especially eating around others. Hard to say I blame her because I know she meant well, but it definitely contributed to my antagonistic relationship with food.\n\nI don't think you should blame yourself with your daughter, because you haven't done anything fucked up to her regarding ARFID. You just haven't done anything. There are techniques you could have tried, but forcing someone to eat a food is definitely not it. If you'd didn't know those techniques, it's better to do nothing because at least not she doesn't have trauma surrounding food. Don't beat yourself up over not having looked up those things earlier, there's a lot going on when you're raising a child. But at least now she can try doing some of those things from a position of not already having intense anxiety from being forced to eat foods. If she wants.",

I think before that, like most parents would , they thought i was just a picky eater so would try and make me eat foods i didn\u2019t like (and most of the time failed). it would usually end in tears and me being sat at the table 2 hours later gagging \ud83d\ude02 which definitely wasn\u2019t nice but i again don\u2019t blame my parents for that.

I kind of blame my doctors for not trying to do anything about it, but same thing: I\u2019m glad I wasn\u2019t ever shamed by a doctor (my parents made sure to find cool  ones) or traumatized by \u201ctreatment.\u201d And for what it\u2019s worth, my parents did find a speech pathologist who did exposure therapy for me; I just wasn\u2019t ready for it yet.\n\nYou might ask if your daughter is interested in seeking some form of treatment. I say that because she sounds a bit like me when I was 17 (now 22). I was in my senior year of high school and felt exhausted all the time and like my body was working against me. That frustration led me to seek out a dietician, and the dietician recommended I research ARFID and look into treatment. We found a good IOP/PHP, they took me in for two months or so (summer after graduation haha), and at the end of those two months I was eating pretty well balanced meals for the first time in my life. Now, **big disclaimer:** the key here is she has to want to do it. Don\u2019t force her to do this. The only reason it worked for me is because I was insistent on it and determined to get better. I still very much have ARFID and am still in treatment now (weekly appointments with a dietician who knows about ARFID), but I\u2019m leagues ahead of where I was five years ago. Exposure therapy is hard work, but if you\u2019re willing and able to do the work, **it can change your life!!!!**",

I still very much have ARFID and am still in treatment now (weekly appointments with a dietician who knows about ARFID), but I\u2019m leagues ahead of where I was five years ago. Exposure therapy is hard work, but if you\u2019re willing and able to do the work, **it can change your life!!!!**",

I am afraid to send him to the intensive outpatient therapy mostly because I don't think he is willing to change right now. I think he might become motivated on his own when he has more life experiences as he gets older like you did. Or maybe he won't. I have him seeing a therapist that specializes in eating disorders and arfid for an hour every 2 weeks. They do some exposure therapy but I don't see much progress. I am thankful to hear about you having success with the intensive outpatient treatment! I was worried that the program I was checking into was too focused on anorexia/bulimia and I was afraid it wouldn't even work for arfid but at least I know it's possible! So thank you! I am going to ask the therapist about the iop program and get more info and talk to my son more about it so he knows it is an option in case he wants to do more towards helping himself now or in the future. Thank you for sharing your story",

But my mom LOVES to cook and is great at it, she was always cooking big, nutritious meals for us and we just turned our nose up at it (I mean, obviously there was a reason for it that we know now but thinking back it must have made her feel awful). Also, they tried really hard to get me to try new things but I was just very, very stubborn (by the time I came around all my siblings had figured out their own ways of getting away with not eating what she cooked but I did not lol). \n\nSo, all that to say. It\u2019s great that there\u2019s so many new methods of parenting and things to try to work with your kids on this issue, compared to what our parents knew/had available when we were kids. But just because they\u2019re available to us now doesn\u2019t mean that any of them will work for your kiddo. \n\nI hope this didn\u2019t come off mean or dismissive.
