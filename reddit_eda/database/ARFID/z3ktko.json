  "selftext": "Hi everyone, so I am 24 and was just diagnosed with ARFID this year but have been struggling with it for as long as I can remember. \n\nAnyways, I\u2019m trying to better educate myself and improve my mental health and self esteem since that\u2019s something that\u2019s not done so well for many years (no thanks to ARFID and anxiety). And all growing up, at every family gathering and every meal out people would nitpick and criticize what or if I ate and it would always make me feel like *I* was the problem, that I was personally insulting them. If they gave up it would be with calling me a \u201cpicky eater\u201d in a derogatory manner. \n\nSo for me that term has just become one that means \u201cless than\u201d or \u201cproblem person\u201d or something like that. And the more I read it, the more it makes me want to curl in on myself because I know now that I\u2019m not childish or immature, this is a real thing that I can\u2019t control, but that phrase still carries a punch to it. \n\nAm I just being ridiculous or does anyone else flinch at that term, too?",

I use it to describe myself to others sometimes, to be honest, the same way I might say \"sometimes I take things too literally, can you clarify what you want?\" Instead of fully explaining that it's because I'm autistic. Like if I lean into it and jump ahead of it, now I took their power away. But the thing is, I was accommodated at home. Without having a word for it, my mom stood up for my right to make choices and for those choices to be respected. She didn't make me eat stuff or shame me for it. She got what I liked and she sent safe snacks to the clinic with my name on them and made sure my IEP said i could have them when i needed them...a very sane response in my opinion.",
