  "selftext": "for me:\n\n- cannot eat foods that are expiring / going out of date within 2 days or less.\n\n- cannot eat / drink anything that has been opened. like, if i open a carton of oat milk, i can only drink from it for that day; the next day, it's off limits. luckily i have a fiance who finishes everything i open so nothing goes to waste.\n\n- if the cooking time says 15 mins, you bet i'm cooking it for 25 mins just to make sure it's cooked (and consequently burnt to a crisp).\n\n- upon any attempt to eat the last bit of food on my plate, it will instantly be spat back out onto my plate. so we just leave that bit alone.",

But bland food with the perfect texture: \ud83e\udd0c\ud83e\udd0c\ud83e\udd0c\n\n- also craving the sensation of texture tather than flavour\n\n- I like making (playing wirh) food more than eating it.
