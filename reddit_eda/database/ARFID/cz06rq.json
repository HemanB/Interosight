I'm 27 and basically my only meals are pepperoni pizza or french fries (chicken nuggets from McDonald's).  I also eat a lot of snack junk foods.  No vegetables of any kind beyond tomato sauce and ketchup. The only fruit I eat is my once yearly apple.  \n\nI do a lot of camping, but it's pretty much all car camping so I just get a couple pizzas and eat cold pizzas for a few days.  I also basically live off goldfish when I'm actually out camping. \n\nBy far my biggest worry is travelling outside the country. In the States I'm never far from a McDonald's or Pizza Hut.  \n\nI just bought flights for a month long climbing trip to Turkey.  I have absolutely no idea what I'm going to eat.",
