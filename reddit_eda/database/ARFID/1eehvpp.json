  "title": "An 18 year old autistic girl has been sectioned and forced to eat non-safe foods or starve.",
  "selftext": "She lives in Scotland and she has been incarcerated after requesting a feeding tube because they were worried she wasn\u2019t getting the right nutrients. Her weight was acceptable but they wanted her to get all the nutrients she needed. They previously tried the dietary shakes which, if you\u2019ve ever had them, are AWFUL and understandably she could not drink them. Soon after requesting the feeding tube, police came and ripped Megan from hiding under her bed and arrested her mother when she tried to stop them from taking Megan. Megan has been placed in a facility where she has been stripped of her safe foods and only being fed foods she does not like. They are lying to her saying her mum sent in these foods, when she did not and Megan knows her mum would never send her unsafe foods. They say if she eats these foods, her mum will be allowed to visit (for context the only way her mum is able to see Megan is through a window). They don\u2019t understand the complexity of ARFID and don\u2019t realise she would rather starve than eat these foods. She has been incarcerated around 9 days now, and when she was first incarcerated she lost 2kg in around 5 days. This is abuse and they are leaving her to starve and putting her through trauma. Megan also accused the facility of hurting her when she was talking to her mum through a window.\n\nPlease, even if you are in a different country, share the message. If you have a social media platform of any kind, PLEASE share her story. If you want to learn more, search Megan\u2019s Voice, there are so many tiktoks about it. They are starving this girl and we need more voices to fix this injustice. Even if you are in America or Asia or anywhere else, share the message. The more it gets out, the more pressure that gets put on our government to DO SOMETHING!\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a platform and still want to help, please sign this petition on change.org. https://www.change.org/p/megan-will-die-if-she-s-not-released-immediately?recruiter=129526215&recruited_by_id=b0177555-0f95-43ca-9244-5012a49da0d7&utm_source=share_petition&utm_campaign=share_for_starters_page&utm_medium=whatsapp",
