          "body": "- 2 C pasta\n- 2.5 C whole milk (yes, whole, that\u2019s important)\n- 2 C shredded cheddar cheese (it melts easier if you shave it off a block versus bagged)\n- 1Tbs butter\n- 1/4 tsp mustard powder\n- 1/4 tsp nutmeg\n- 1/2 tsp pepper\n- 1 bag goldfish crackers (you\u2019ll measure these with your heart)\n- Old Bay if you want it to taste like mine\n\n01. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0\n\n02. Combine pinch of salt, milk, mustard powder, pepper, nutmeg, butter in saucepan and bring to boil. \n\n03. Add pasta, reduce heat to low\n\n04. Continue to simmer and stir frequently until pasta is cooked. If liquid runs low, add in more milk 1/4 C at a time.\n\n05. Add 1.5 C shredded cheese and stir until melted. Cover 3 mins. \n\n06. Pour into greased baking dish. \n\n07. Add extra shredded cheese to top evenly. Crumble and add goldfish crackers to top evenly. I always add a little Old Bay at this point. \n\n08. Bake at 350\u00b0 for 30 mins or until top looks golden and baked. \n\n09. Let rest for 5 minutes and serve. \n\nIf you want it extra creamy, add some heavy cream (base) or cream cheese (stirred in with shredded cheese) to the sauce. This isn\u2019t a healthy food. Don\u2019t try to make it healthy. It\u2019s good for the soul. \n\nWhen reheating, add 1/4 C milk to pasta. It\u2019ll keep it from drying out.",
