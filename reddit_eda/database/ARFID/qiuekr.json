  "selftext": "My go to safe food is always pasta. Alfredo is a yes, aglio olio is a maybe, and red sauce is a maybe. Well this restaurant was a very upscale 5 star sophisticated kinda place and if I wanted my safe food, I wouldve had to special order... which always dampens my mood.\n\nSo I ordered a roasted garlic and butternut squash soup expecting to hate it but hoping to love it since it sounded so good, and a ceaser salad to bulk it up a bit.   It was FANTASTIC!!! One of the best soups I've ever tasted and I practically licked the bowl clean. I pulled out large chunks of the squash (it was really only there for decoration) but I'm hardcore counting it as a win!! Ordered something new, AND cleaned my plates!!! \n\nI even had a new wine!",
