The way I then got myself to eat it was by telling myself if I couldn't stand the veggies, I'd just pick them out and only eat the noodles. It worked for me and I've increased from zero veggies to a small handful. Hopefully you can do something similar with whatever food it is and it will work for you as well :)",
