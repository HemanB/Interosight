  "selftext": "McDonald\u2019s burger for the first time ever, I tried last year and after a couple bites got upset I couldn\u2019t. \n\nMy mental thought process: Arfid is partly anxiety and muscle memory of our thoughts tied into the foods don\u2019t help us out.\nI was starving paying 9$ for a side of breadsticks eating it in a carry out parking lot by myself (y\u2019all know how it is)\nAnd just said fuck it I\u2019m doing myself a disservice not sackin up and eating it cause we are all capable if we put no stress on ourselves and just do it.\n\nIt helped being hungry and it being night rn (Not having to look at the burger the entire time) just kept eating it and thought it\u2019s soft and if I just swallow it after chewing instead of keeping it in ur mouth pandering waiting for the burger texture to off put yourself it\u2019s possible. (Kept cheeseburgers in paradise on repeat telling myself it\u2019s what every other human does so today\u2019s the day)\n\nDon\u2019t give up to whoever\u2019s reading this and I\u2019ve cried after not being able to do it before.\nJust pick one food you think you\u2019re supposed to be able to eat and not let urself eat the food you eat for pleasure untill you eat this edible non harmless food that other people eat.\nMaybe I\u2019ll actually enjoy it one day but Fear Don\u2019t Control Me so just set ur mind to it and do it. Dont let your doubt talk you out of it stick to ur goal.",

I tend to still avoid the triple though, tried it when I was in the states, to me it seemed to have too much of a burger to sauce ratio - gets a bit bland too quickly. I used to avoid Big Mac's or any burger with lettuce, but I would recommend it highly now that I've tried it. The sauce is great and completely different from the cheeseburgers. I think I've actually learnt to enjoy the lettuce when combined with it. Now I'm trying to find something else with lettuce in that I can try!",
