  "selftext": "My 8 year old (ASD) seemingly dropped all safe foods overnight.  We can\u2019t get her to eat anything but *sometimes* ice cream.  She is drinking water at least.  She has lost 4 pounds in a week. We think she had some acid reflux and that started it.  We started nexium but it\u2019s hit or miss if we can get it down.  She has barely eaten in 5 days now.  I don\u2019t know what to do and I\u2019m in full blown panic, but no one else seems as concerned?  I\u2019ve called and left a message with her GI and am waiting to hear back.  What do you do when your kid loses ALL their safe foods?!  I\u2019m scared",

      "body": "I don\u2019t how helpful this is, but something that helped me when I was a kid was going to the supermarket and trying to pick out at least one thing I was willing to try. Often it was a previous safe food that I hadn\u2019t eaten in a long time. Like I started eating cheese slices again after months of refusing them because I went off my other safe foods. Sometimes I would find a new food that was similar enough to the foods I wasn\u2019t eating anymore, like replacing my old favourite biscuits with a similar biscuit that was new but still safe. I also liked flavoured milk (if it was made just right) and I could usually drink something even if I wouldn\u2019t eat.\n\nEta: I\u2019m also autistic and getting sick after eating something (whether it\u2019s throwing up, reflux, or just an upset stomach) is the easiest way to turn me off a safe food. Even as an adult I didn\u2019t eat pasta for a year because I got sick after eating it, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that *is* what happened with your daughter. I\u2019m also on nexium long term, and probably wouldn\u2019t be able to eat much without it.",

I have so much sympathy for you and your daughter. \n\nThis happened for my daughter a few months ago (she turns 8 next week) she had a partial bowel obstruction and was vomiting a lot including vomiting her own feces. \n\nI took her to A&E and they diagnosed the bowel obstruction and sent her home with movicol. She\u2019s gagged at literally every single thing she\u2019s tried to eat since. She has no safe foods anymore. \n\nAfter speaking to her dietician and gastroenterologist we decided to try an NG in the interim and honestly it\u2019s the best thing we ever did. It was suggested to me before but I didn\u2019t want that for her, I only bought it up when I did because she herself asked for the tube. I always involved her in discussions about her medical care so she knew it was an option from when it was first offered in 2022 after she was recovering from surgery. \n\nShe\u2019s diagnosed with asd/pda and sensory processing disorder so it\u2019s always been an uphill battle to get her to eat even before we knew about the ARFID. \n\nSince starting with the tube she\u2019s so much more energy and it\u2019s taking much more for her to be overwhelmed or meltdown than it did before. \n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the same for your daughter, but for mine mealtimes have always been traumatic even since she was a baby and weaning she would be so upset whenever I tried to feed her or even sit her in the high chair. \n\nWe did the high calorie milkshakes and smoothies for years which was less traumatic for her but still it was hard to get her to take it. We\u2019ve tried pretty much every meal replacement drink sold in the UK at various times, she\u2019ll tolerate one particular one if she\u2019s in the mood but that\u2019s rarely. \n\nIf I\u2019m honest my only regret is not going forward sooner with the tube. She\u2019s got a PEG tube now which was a big decision but it\u2019s for her best and she\u2019s happier for it. \n\nBest of luck with whatever happens.",
