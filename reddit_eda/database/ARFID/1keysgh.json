  "title": "So Tired of this \"Picky Eaters are evil\" bs",
  "selftext": "I'm so tired of seeing everywhere all of these sentiments that picky eaters are selfish and childish and intentionally make things harder for people.\n\nNo, Debra, I am not intentionally making you feel bad by not eating your food, I am just terrified of eating it.\n\nIf I try to force myself to eat something that triggers me, I get nauseous and have a panic attack, but sure, it's just \"mind over matter\" and I need to \"get over myself and start being an adult\"\n\nI hate people acting like it's a choice. It's not. It's deeply linked to so many different parts of my childhood and life. \n\nIt's also just humiliating. To sit there and be on the verge of tears because the restaurant someone picked isn't a safe option for me, and there's nothing I can eat on the menu. To receive a dish that has ingredients they didn't list on the menu, and to have to sit there picking them out.\n\nWhy on earth would I choose that?",

We ate at a place called Tacozzini that has almost anything you could think of outside of Asian dishes\n\nMy wife's favorite steakhouse doesn't have fries. I just imagine the owner flipping me off knowing that.",

ARFID often comes with neurodiversity, and with that it feels like people often chose to misunderstand us and ignore the words that come out of our mouths directly. you're doing good and don't let people who chose to misunderstand your words bring you down.",

      "body": "Also i hate that when I bring this up, i get hit with \"well not you\" \"i meant people who can help it but-\" no. They're inherently biased. Most people who are \"picky\" either have some kind of diagnosis or are neurodivergent. They don't like accommodating people and their inherently ingrained ableism is showing. The entire \"conversation\" around picky eaters as if it's immoral somehow to have strong preferences about food (OBVIOUSLY outside of being an asshole about it in certain situations) is just blatant ableism at some point. \n\nSo yeah I'm right there with you, the whole \"conversation\" about how people are inconvenienced or annoyed by picky eaters is ridiculous. They claim we are the selfish ones when THEYRE the ones making what WE eat about them. Again, the whole \"no no not you, you have a condition\" thing is ridiculous. If i didnt tell them that I had ARFID they would still be judging me hard. It's only \"okay\" when they SAY it's okay for us to be different. When they give us permission because we have a \"reason\". How about just stop being judgmental and let people eat??\n\nEdit: wording/spelling",

The other day my friend offhandedly told me \" I need you to expand your palette so we can travel and eat all the local food\" and it reminded me that people really see picky eating as a choice and not a terrible damn curse. I would do anything to be able to confidently go out to any spot and buy something delicious.",
