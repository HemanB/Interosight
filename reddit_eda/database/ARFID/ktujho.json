I started off eating just the crust as it was just like bread, then I started getting pizzas with less cheese on them and built it up over time, now pizza is my favourite food! Took about a year to force my brain into thinking it was edible though haha",

They told me I know me and my issue better than a stranger.\n\nIf you're eating habits are impacting your life it's an ED no matter what the label is and you deserve to be taken seriously.\n\nThis video is great at explaining what ARFID is an how it can be triggered.
