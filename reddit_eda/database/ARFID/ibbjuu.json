  "selftext": "I\u2019ve been clinically underweight my entire life. I struggle to get through two meals a day. ARFID limits what I can eat, nausea limits how much and when. Due to this, I\u2019m very thin. You can see my ribs if I\u2019m lying down in a tight shirt. It\u2019s not remotely healthy to be this thin, but people constantly tell me that they wish they looked like me. \n\n\u201cI\u2019d kill for your body\u201d\n\nThis happens more often when I\u2019m especially struggling. It\u2019s so infuriating to struggle to drag yourself out of bed, force breakfast down your throat while feeling like you\u2019re going to vomit the whole time, go about your day feeling nauseous and dizzy and tired all the time, only to have people tell you how great you look. \n\nTo everybody who wants a body like me,\nIt isn\u2019t fun, it isn\u2019t sustainable, it\u2019s miserable. Stop telling me I look pretty when my body is shutting down. Sickness isn\u2019t beautiful.",

I\u2019ve worked in restaurants for my entire adult life (ironic because I can\u2019t eat the food at most of the places I\u2019ve worked) and I make a point to never comment on someone\u2019s order, what they want added or taken off, how much or how little they eat, etc. It\u2019s rude af. Unfortunately I\u2019ve had coworkers who make judgy comments about people who order steak well done and things like that, as if they\u2019re personally offended by what someone else is eating. ?!?!?\n\nAnd I agree, the idea that skinny = healthy hurts absolutely everyone. Weight is actually not an accurate indicator of health in either direction. And beyond that, health is a personal thing that is nobody else\u2019s business.\n\nSmfh. I\u2019m so sorry people make these inappropriate comments to you. If it were me I would probably get sassy about it and tell the waiter \u201cI have a chronic illness. Did you know it\u2019s actually really rude to comment on a stranger\u2019s weight?\u201d",
