I got anxious because no I hadn't eaten in like two days because I was so focused on my son, but I have ARFID. So I said so. I said \"Oh, thank you, but I have ARFID, so I have trouble eating quite a few foods.\" And this pediatric nurse KNEW WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT!! (I mean, if anyone is gonna know, I assume a pedi nurse will know??) Without missing a beat she said \"No problem, I'll put a parent's meal order in for you and you can order off the cafeteria menu--they have some simple things and packaged foods, if those are easier!\" WHAT A HERO! I was able to call down to the cafeteria for a free \"parent/caregiver\" meal and they brought it up so I could eat it in my son's hospital room. I felt so validated.",
