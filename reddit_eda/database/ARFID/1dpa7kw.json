      "body": "Oh man, yeah, it was a struggle. The first time I tried to go vegetarian as a teen,  I ended up cutting out like...90% of my menu. I drank a lot of protein shakes back then, lol. Eventually my parents had to put the foot down.\n\nBut!! A few years later, I managed to make the jump with a broader menu and a better game-plan.\n\n*One thing I will say is that it's not a zero-sum game. You can try cutting out more and more meats over the course of several years as your safe-menu expands.*\n\nMaybe a \"Meatless Mondays\" method, followed by \"Meatless Monday & Tuesday\" and slowly build from there.\n\nAlso, if you're concerned with texture, I will say: I LOVE the fake meat textures because they're always so consistent. I used to spend 50% of my meat-prep and meat-eating cutting out gristle and white strips and dark spots and bits with Wrong Texture, and worries about skin and bone and 9 million other things. But the veggie meats don't have ANY of that and it's SUCH a relief to my ARFID.\n\nI would suggest starting with \"Impossible\" brand chicken nuggets to start. They're so handy and yummy and they're fairly similar to normal bake-at-home nuggets. They're probably my favorite fake meat.\n\nI've also found that the joys of making veggie burgers at home (not the Beyond or Impossible, but from scratch) is that I can dial in the EXACT texture I want. A tablespoon of extra rice or a dash of tomato sauce can make a WORLD of difference for my specific texture needs.\n\n.\n\n((Also, Beyond Meat isn't lab-grown, the lab-grown stuff is still in development for commercial sale in the US (unless I missed a HUGE announcement)\n\nBeyond & Impossible are both made from plant-derived ingredients and have a different molecular makeup than meat.))\n\n.\n\nBest wishes to you!!",

And was really fussy about it before then too but my mom made me eat it and only stopped forcing me to when I was 9 lol. My reasons are not bc of ethics but solely because meat freaks me out and I gag trying to eat it. I just find it disgusting and it\u2019s solely an arfid thing probably. There\u2019s other sources of protein other than meat though, there\u2019s dairy, nuts, beans, eggs, grains, tofu, quinoa, seeds, protein shakes/bars/powder, and even some fake meats that have protein. I don\u2019t like fake meat either because it\u2019s too similar to meat but I hear it\u2019s pretty similar although some brands seem to be better than others. Honestly, be careful cutting out food groups especially if you have arfid. You could slowly try to eat less meat while incorporating some other sources of protein and weaning yourself off of it, that way you can easily stop if you get sick again. It seems much safer to do it like that with a meal plan involved and you can slowly adjust to a new diet that way that still has protein involved rather than stopping cold turkey (no pun intended lol)",

Also Beyond burgers are epic, Mcdonalds use them in their McPlant burgers which are delicious. I add a bit of butter to the Beyond Burger at the end of cooking and fry up some frozen onion pieces to go with it and I am close to the McPlant now!\n\nI didn't find any real beef or pork substitutes I like though.\n\nQuorn pieces I use in place of meat but they can be a bit bland. I do enjoy curries and asian food so can make them more interesting.\n\nSadly though my diet still isn't good, in addition to no fruit, veg, meat or milk I stuff myself with a lot of carbs, Pasta, Rice, Breads etc.\n\nIt is about 3 years now since I went Veggie and am so happy I did. I think it is highly unlikely I will become vegan though.\n\nIf you can afford to try them there are some excellent meat substitute products on the market now, we are very lucky.\n\nIf you love pasta dishes, heavily spiced or sauce dishes you will be able to substitute the meat quite easily.",

Eventually my parents had to put the foot down.\n\nBut!! A few years later, I managed to make the jump with a broader menu and a better game-plan.\n\n*One thing I will say is that it's not a zero-sum game. You can try cutting out more and more meats over the course of several years as your safe-menu expands.*\n\nMaybe a \"Meatless Mondays\" method, followed by \"Meatless Monday & Tuesday\" and slowly build from there.\n\nAlso, if you're concerned with texture, I will say: I LOVE the fake meat textures because they're always so consistent. I used to spend 50% of my meat-prep and meat-eating cutting out gristle and white strips and dark spots and bits with Wrong Texture, and worries about skin and bone and 9 million other things. But the veggie meats don't have ANY of that and it's SUCH a relief to my ARFID.\n\nI would suggest starting with \"Impossible\" brand chicken nuggets to start. They're so handy and yummy and they're fairly similar to normal bake-at-home nuggets. They're probably my favorite fake meat.\n\nI've also found that the joys of making veggie burgers at home (not the Beyond or Impossible, but from scratch) is that I can dial in the EXACT texture I want. A tablespoon of extra rice or a dash of tomato sauce can make a WORLD of difference for my specific texture needs.\n\n.\n\n((Also, Beyond Meat isn't lab-grown, the lab-grown stuff is still in development for commercial sale in the US (unless I missed a HUGE announcement)\n\nBeyond & Impossible are both made from plant-derived ingredients and have a different molecular makeup than meat.))\n\n.\n\nBest wishes to you!!",

          "body": "Oh man, yeah, it was a struggle. The first time I tried to go vegetarian as a teen,  I ended up cutting out like...90% of my menu. I drank a lot of protein shakes back then, lol. Eventually my parents had to put the foot down.\n\nBut!! A few years later, I managed to make the jump with a broader menu and a better game-plan.\n\n*One thing I will say is that it's not a zero-sum game. You can try cutting out more and more meats over the course of several years as your safe-menu expands.*\n\nMaybe a \"Meatless Mondays\" method, followed by \"Meatless Monday & Tuesday\" and slowly build from there.\n\nAlso, if you're concerned with texture, I will say: I LOVE the fake meat textures because they're always so consistent. I used to spend 50% of my meat-prep and meat-eating cutting out gristle and white strips and dark spots and bits with Wrong Texture, and worries about skin and bone and 9 million other things. But the veggie meats don't have ANY of that and it's SUCH a relief to my ARFID.\n\nI would suggest starting with \"Impossible\" brand chicken nuggets to start. They're so handy and yummy and they're fairly similar to normal bake-at-home nuggets. They're probably my favorite fake meat.\n\nI've also found that the joys of making veggie burgers at home (not the Beyond or Impossible, but from scratch) is that I can dial in the EXACT texture I want. A tablespoon of extra rice or a dash of tomato sauce can make a WORLD of difference for my specific texture needs.\n\n.\n\n((Also, Beyond Meat isn't lab-grown, the lab-grown stuff is still in development for commercial sale in the US (unless I missed a HUGE announcement)\n\nBeyond & Impossible are both made from plant-derived ingredients and have a different molecular makeup than meat.))\n\n.\n\nBest wishes to you!!",
