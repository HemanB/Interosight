  "selftext": "The other day my family was joking around about my eating habits and comparing it to meals that toddlers eat. It actually made me feel so awful. Like do you actually think I'm choosing to eat like this??? Do you think I chose to sit at that table for 40 goddamn minutes pushing my food around on the plate because I couldn't actually bring myself to eat it because of its texture?? HELL NO I JUST WANT TO BE ABLE TO EAT NORMALLY. \n\nI'm not choosing to be difficult. I really, genuinely hate being \"picky\" (in quotes, because they still seem to believe it's picky eating). I hate feeling childish and convincing myself I just never grew out of the toddler picky eating phase. But every time they seem to think I'm just choosing not to eat it because I'm picky and want to go for the unhealthy option like chips or cookies rather than the healthy options. \n\nI've tried to explain that I only go for the food like that because its texture is consistent. Foods that are crunchy like chips or cookies are safe for me. But even after explaining this it still doesn't seem to stick. I love my family, but this has just been driving me insane for the longest time.\n",

      "body": "I completely get this. I got lucky with my mom, she has seen me cry from trying to eat something. Now there's very few questions if I ask her to take a bite of something before I can eat. (and the questions are usually, \"do you not want this?\" or \"is it the wrong flavor?\") But my dad is a completely different story. He thinks I'm choosing to be \"Difficult\". There are foods that I haven't eaten in over 10 years and every time they ate it he made at least one comment. You'd think making a comment at least once every 3 months for 10 years would make him remember that I don't eat that, but nope. \nSurrounding myself with people that get it has really helped. I worry less about contamination (one of my food issues) and I worry less about judgment. \nBeing on here and seeing other people continue to live life even with limited food options has also helped. \nYou aren't difficult, you aren't picky, and you aren't alone",

You think I wanted to only be able to eat baby food and peanut butter and crackers? Like who would pick that if given a choice?\n\nIn my teens I had my work arounds which allowed me to form a good circle of friends. As an adult I met and married a man who didn\u2019t give a damn what I ate or didn\u2019t eat. With this\u2014I thrived. I wasn\u2019t being tormented or judged. I tried many, many new foods. I had 3 kids. None have ARFID. \n\nTell them too that I still have it. With love and support I was able to really expand my food choices and saved my health. To be honest I\u2019ve never once eaten meat at all. I am not on any medications for any chronic conditions. I don\u2019t know many 68 year olds not on any medicine. \n\nI have ARFID. And I\u2019m ok with that. They should be grateful to know what it is and support you in trying to manage it. Take care hun and hang in there.",
