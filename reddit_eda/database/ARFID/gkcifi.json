  "title": "my fianc\u00e9 tried a trigger food today",
  "selftext": "when my fianc\u00e9\u2019s mom made me mozzarella sticks and he came to bring them to me, he hesitated and looked at me as i ate one. he asked me what cheese tasted like and i shrugged and said, \u201ci dunno. salty. different cheeses taste different.\u201d and he watched me for a little while longer before asking me if i thought he should try a bite. i said that even though cheese is a trigger food for him, it\u2019s fried and in a texture that i think he wouldn\u2019t mind and might be able to get used to. i didn\u2019t think he was going to actually, and that\u2019s okay! i love answering his questions and reassuring him that it\u2019s okay to not want to try things just as much as it\u2019s okay to want to. but, next thing i knew, he was chewing! he took a bite of the corner and chewed slowly, but didn\u2019t spit it out after one or two chews and didn\u2019t even gag. he was actually able to confidently say that he didn\u2019t hate it, which is a huge step! because though cheese is a trigger food for him, he\u2019s able to eat it on pizza. so being able to see that he doesn\u2019t hate cheese in another form may open his mind to trying cheese of other types and forms. i\u2019ve found that the longer i\u2019m with him the more he communicates with me about his relationship with food and almost \u2018admits\u2019 that he feels as if it\u2019s almost a debilitating problem in his life, and in turn he\u2019s been trying VERY hard to be open to trying things. i wanted to post here because i want him to see that people relate to him and are proud of him. he said it was one of the hardest things he\u2019s ever done and he felt proud of himself and that made ME insanely happy.\n\ntl;dr fianc\u00e9 tried cheese for the first time not on pizza and didn\u2019t spit it out or hate it, i was very proud of him and wanted to share with all of you!",

I don\u2019t know why people can\u2019t figure out just saying \u201cit\u2019s good\u201d means nothing, even to non-ARFID people. Taste is relative and personal. I love seaweed snacks and aloe vera drinks and yet my \u201cnormal\u201d coworkers all make fun of me and say how gross that stuff is.",
