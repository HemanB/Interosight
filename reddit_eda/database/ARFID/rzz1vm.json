  "title": "Ableism against ARFID",
  "selftext": "As with a lot of us, I have a plethora of comorbidities. Autism, ADHD, generalized anxiety disorder, possibly depression...\n\nBut never, EVER, for any of those have I received the same level of vitriolic hatred I get about my ARFID.\n\nI am extremely open about all my diagnoses. They're in my bio on every website I'm on, including my Tiktok account which also has a video explaining that ovaltine chocolate milk is my most important safe-food and is basically carrying the team when it comes to getting a liveable amount of nutrients into my body. I eventually ended up privating that video. Why? Because *people were weaponizing it*. When I'd get into a disagreement with someone, they'd look through my profile, find that video, then go back to wherever I said something that pissed them off and reply along the lines of \"I hope you become allergic to chocolate milk.\"\n\n...I don't think I need to explain to other ARFID people everything that's wrong with that.\n\nMay I mention, this wasn't a one-off asshole; this happened multiple times to the point of privating the video because it just wasn't worth it anymore.\n\nBut the absolute worst tend to be the militant vegans. You know the type- meat is murder, abolish the meat industry, everyone should be vegan, all of that. Sometimes I try to educate them on why veganism isn't feasible for people like me, and today I got quite the doozy in response:\n\n>We need to continue factory farming animals because you will have panic attacks without access to cheap meat? r/unpopularopinion \\- you deserve panic attacks.\n\nI've had several other militant vegans come at me for my stances, but this is the first time I've been explicitly told I deserve the suffering. I've been overlooked as collateral damage to save the animals, I've been told \"just go get treatment it's not that hard\", but I've never had one of these people so blatantly wish harm on me. But something that is consistent with these types of people is the aforementioned viewing me as collateral damage. Not caring if I die, if it gets their goal met. I tell them I'd literally die of starvation if I cut the meat products from my diet, and I get told \"too bad\". Implying that my life is meaningless, not worth saving, because I have a crippling disorder.\n\nThere was also a post on r/unpopularopinion a while back where someone said adult picky eaters deserve to be publicly shamed. If someone said what they said in that post about people with autism or something, they would have been *crucified*. The post would have been removed and everyone would've been calling it what it is: ableism.\n\nFor all the disorders I have, ARFID is the only one I've explicitly had harm wished upon me for. People want me *dead* for my ARFID. People want me publicly shamed, people want me in pain, people want me to suffer for existing with this condition. In a way I've never experienced with any other disorder I have.\n\nSo, why does no one ever talk about that? Does mental health not matter when it's a disorder no one's heard of? Does mental health not matter when it's us?",

I don't like any seafood except for tuna (but only if its in a pasta i make- nobody else).  \ni only like beef if its cooked right through, if i see steak with any pink in it, i feel sick just looking at it. this has been used against me plenty of time because i like my meat chewy, its the only texture i like from steak. if it's 'juicy' (eww), or red juices are dripping from it, in my mind it sees it as blood. i know it isnt blood but might aswell be.   \nI also hate seasoned food. I never add salt to home cooked things, or pepper or anything else. even a tiny it of it makes the food revoulting. And yes this goes for during the cooking process and after it. I can only eat blander food because my senses just go through the roof otherwise. stronger tasting foods are to much for me. To sour, to sweet, top spicy, too salty- it has to be as little of everything as possible.\n\na lot of my ARFID is linked against interpersonal racism i go through too. 'white people cant season, white people don't know good food, oh of course you dislike this- you're white' and so on. it fucking sucks and its makes it really hard for me to talk food- probably the biggest thing humans can connect over ever- with anyone.  \n\n\nAlso the idea fat people cant have arfid. sure it might be more likely for people to be on the thinner side of things when it comes to arfid but that's because arfid was mischaracterizes as only a 'thin person thing' for ages. if your safe foods are all unhealthy foods (full os sugars, processed etc- like mine are) and its all you eat and you have no bearing on calory counting, ofc you'd be on the heavier side like i am.  \n\n\nalso body dysphoria/dysmophia- yaaaay.\n\n^((i know there might be one person who thinks 'whites cant experience racism' but i'd like to you just re consider what racism is, and that anybody can experience interpersonal racism.))",

I forgive that though, since it was just annoying and also the people asking were usually kids, who don't know better and have no filter. What bothers me is when grown adults do it.\n\nAnd I think something a lot of people don't realize with your chocolate shard situation is the obsession with \"contamination\" that some people with ARFID have. It doesn't matter if you remove the chocolate, brain will still say \"ew there's 3 molecules of chocolate left in there the whole icecream is contaminated\" and not let them eat it. Foods touching other foods used to be a HUGE no-no for me, I wouldn't eat something if I saw a non-safe food touch it. I'm a lot better with that now, but not everyone is so lucky.
