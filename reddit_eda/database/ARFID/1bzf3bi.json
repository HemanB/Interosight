Even in cultures where the brain is used in cooking, it\u2019s usually a delicacy (aka not a common dish, but something \u2018fancy\u2019 or special occasion). \n\nI am so sorry this happened to you. Take some time to process it, and hopefully you\u2019ll be able to nibble on some safe food soon.",
