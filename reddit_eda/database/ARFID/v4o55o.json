  "title": "My discomfort at going to restaurants where I can\u2019t eat has caused minor tension in a group chat with my friends",
  "selftext": "UPDATE: one of them apologised out of the blue, so I guess they realised that they went about things the wrong way. It\u2019s clear that there was no malice there or anything and they thought their comments would be helpful rather than hurtful. I\u2019m assuming here that it\u2019s a lesson learnt for this friend in particular, at least. \n\nI\u2019m in a group chat with my mates and one of them suggested going out for food and drink soon. Bearing in mind, I have recently put in the group saying I have ARFID but didn\u2019t expand further other than stating it\u2019s an ED - one of them knew this already as I had been discussing my therapy sessions with him.\n\nAnyway, it was mentioned we could go to two places, either a restaurant that has absolutely nothing on the menu for me, or a place that does - this was stated as, if I was coming then we could go to the second place. I have said I\u2019d like to go, but if they want to go to the first place then I can always meet them for drinks afterwards. \n\nMy friend who already knew about my disorder clearly wants to go to the first place and suggested I just sit with them and drink whilst they eat. I have never and will never be comfortable with this as this is something I was forced to do throughout my life and made to feel ashamed for. As a child my family would tell me i\u2019m an embarrassment because I wouldn\u2019t eat anything but fries, and continuing as an adult comments have continued to be made which makes me feel shameful and embarrassed. \n\nI said that I\u2019m not keen on this idea as it makes me uncomfortable and another friend joined in basically saying it\u2019s not a big deal and i\u2019m over thinking it. Naturally, I got frustrated and defensive and tried to explain that it\u2019s not as simple as \u201cgetting over it\u201despecially when I have anxiety alongside an ED. I stated I know they probably think it\u2019s silly and not a big deal but it is for me. \n\nMy frustration at this guy was evident, I was genuinely emotional over it anyway since it brought back some very unpleasant memories from childhood and an abusive relationship. It\u2019s absolutely caused tension in the chat and I know that they\u2019re probably messaging each other privately calling me dramatic or whatnot.\n\nIt\u2019s just so frustrating that they jump to \u201cwell it wouldn\u2019t bother me\u201d. Like\u2026ok? Good for you? It bothers me?\n\nI don\u2019t get why it can\u2019t just be left at the fact that I feel uncomfortable with the notion? Has anyone else experienced this kind of thing? How am I even supposed to approach this now?",

It\u2019s basically just 1. What is ARFID, 2. Things That Help, 3. Things That Hurt \n\nBeyond that, I agree with another comment here: at the end of the day, it\u2019s not their business and you HAVE to do what\u2019s best for you. If it were any other disorder, there wouldn\u2019t even be a question about it. More information would probably help (if they\u2019re good friends) but otherwise it\u2019s okay to shut it down and do your own thing.\n\nNot every friend is a good friend, don\u2019t be afraid to cut some of the bad fruit if they won\u2019t be supportive",

      "body": "Fuck. That. Your \"friends\" are assholes, that's not how friendships work. _Especially_ the one who knows about your therapy, knows this is not just a choice for you, and still pushes the restaurant they know you aren't comfortable with, because they like it better? What the fuck...\n\nAnd then this \"well it wouldn't bother me\" stuff... holy fuck, that's just not something you say to a person. Would they knowingly give the wrong food to people with allergies, telling people that \"well, it wouldn't kill me\"? Would they tell a depressed person that \"well, I'm not sad\"? If not, why the fuck do they think that it's okay to do this to people with ARFID? Just because it's not commonly known yet? So they can't shill themselves that \"oh my god I'm so moral\" bullshit, standing up for things people already recognize, while they act like this when they'd need to legit help but there's nothing in it for them... this whole fake friendship game hurts a lot more than it helps.\n\nI don't know how anxiety works, so feel free to ignore anything past this point, but honestly, I would recommend confronting them. If they're going to stay shitty, it's better to dodge the bullet now, break these friendships, and look for better ones, than to keep it around for years until some straw finally breaks the camel's back. And breaking the friendship is just the worst case scenario, best case, they will actually understand and stop being shitty. It's their choice at that point.\n\nARFID is not something to be ashamed of, it's not your fault that you experience food the way you do. It's on you to communicate, but once you do and they still refuse to accommodate you (as _real_ friends do) they're the problem, not you. And if you stay confrontational, double down on jokes when someone makes fun of you for it instead of shying away, and just in general hold that line firmly, people who would be assholes about food will self-select out of interacting with you, _and that's a good thing._ You don't need to appease them. There are so many people in the world who are not dicks, so why waste your time on them?\n\n(On a different note, fuck your family too, that's no way to treat a child.)",
