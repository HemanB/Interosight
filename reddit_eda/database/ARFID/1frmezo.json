  "selftext": "I'm 17, autistic and I've always really struggled with  keeping my weight up due to my extremely restricted diet & sensory aversions. It's been a cycle of being admitted and then losing the weight right when I'm back home because of my severe anxiety around food and general lack of appetite. \n\nI am now Staying at my friend's house until I'm allowed back at home, and he doesn't believe me  about my ARFID. He says that It'll get better if I challenge my fears and eat new things, which is probably true, but  he has been making me eat disgusting things, like  chicken and dog food, and not letting  me eat anything else, even If I were to buy it  myself. It's not that I'm ungrateful or anything, I  just physically can't eat  it. I cried and threw up and I feel so guilty and humiliated. He thought I was being ungrateful, But I don't know how to explain that this is  just how my brain works, and I wish soooo badly  that it wasn't this way.\n\nIt wasn't even the dog food that made me throw up, but the chicken, which makes me feel even worse about this\ud83e\udd72Feels like  there is something Wrong with me. I haven't  eaten since this happened yesterday, and I know that I will have to eat eventually, but  he is  adamant about \"Curing\" my arfid  and won't let me eat anything safe. I already struggle with eating normally, I would rather just not eat at all, but I don't want to lose anymore weight. I feel like it's hopeless no matter what I do in this situation",
