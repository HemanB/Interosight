  "selftext": "This disease is a living hell but I think I'm over it. I'm 29. I never thought it would be possible but I don't have any issue with trying new things any more. I'm starting to really look forward to it.\n\nI can't really tell you what did it exactly. Could be therapy, could be mindfulness, could be magic mushrooms. It could be that I backed myself into a corner by agreeing to go to fancy restaurant with tons of people I was embarrassed to eat in front of in my usual way so I got drunk and just bit the bullet and had easily the best meal of my entire life.\n\nThe point is just don't give up.\n\nEDIT: Mushrooms are really dangerous and potentially traumatic.  Don't get high hoping for a cure, I can't attribute my improvements to the mushrooms. If you're suffering from mental illness or in a bad place in life, it's really not worth playing around with, and I know that first hand. ",

Food didn't \"taste bad\" exactly, but was still somehow intensely disgusting, and would look as appealing to eat as excrement. I didn't like to touch food either. If I forced myself to eat something I might involuntarily puke. \n\nNow I don't have any sort of negative physical reaction to food. New stuff tastes good and interesting. I still have a sort of hangover, where I haven't quite got used to not having that reaction. I'm still a little afraid to eat in front of people in case I have a bad reaction, which hasn't happened even when I've tried stuff that wasn't to my taste. I won't instinctively reach for new food until I've had it multiple times, I still have a feeling like it'll take too much emotional energy. Which isn't the case, it's only ever been rewarding. I expect by the end of the year at the latest I'll be totally \"normal\", I want to start cooking for people in my life and develop a positive reputation around food.",
