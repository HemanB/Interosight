  "title": "I had ARFID so bad I nearly died. Now I can eat three meals a day, my muscles are coming back, my heart condition is fixed and my hair is growing back.",
  "selftext": "I\u2019ll keep this short and easy to read. I had severe PTSD. I had some really awful things done to me and was forced to throw up often. \n\nAfter a long time of getting out of this. I finally got someone in my life who truly helped. I\u2019ve been going to therapy for years, I was supposed to go to an inpatient facility for this disorder. I was hospitalized for a heart condition due to it, my hair was thinning and falling out, I couldn\u2019t walk up the stairs, and I vomited atleast ten times a week. \n\nNow, this has taken me about three consistent months to get significantly better. I do have the support here so it is different than being alone. I just want to share what\u2019s helped. I started dating someone I\u2019ve known for awhile. I am 28F and he is 32M. He\u2019s been a chef for about 15 years. He\u2019s very passionate about it. He found me when I was basically on deaths door. \n\nThese are the things that have helped: \n\n- positive reinforcement after eating ANYTHING. Even a bite of food. \n\n- constantly watching short and very aesthetic videos starting with my safe foods.\n\n- going to a restaurant and eating the yummiest foods they have\n\n- I had to be taught, \u201cyou do not need to throw up again. It is not making you feel better. It is not helping. It\u2019s literally killing you.\u201d \n\n- we processed some of my trauma in a safe place and he helped me understand what I went through as abusive and wrong\n\nTo try to help you incorporate these things into your life, I\u2019ll try to explain these things a bit. His passion for food really helped me learn to like food again. If I didn\u2019t have him but I had this information that I do now, I would try to incorporate myself into spaces where people are passionate about food. Try to make it as fun as possible. Remind yourself that not eating will only make you feel worse in the long run. Try to find people who make you feel safe when you\u2019re eating. Open up to your friends so they can help you. I can not stress this enough WATCH SHORT COOKING VIDEOS OF SAFE FOODS YOU LIKE!!!!! \n\nMind you, I do not have ARFID from Autism or ADHD, I don\u2019t believe. I had some deep really vile trauma that was forced onto me, along with previous complex-PTSD as a young adult. \n\nNone the less, I thought I was completely fucked and left for dead with this disorder. I was lucky enough to have my boyfriend literally save my life with his passion for food and his patience and love for me. I know most people aren\u2019t able to get that. But you can take the things I learned and try to apply them to your healing journey! I really hope this helps someone. Feel free to ask any questions. \n \n",

I've been recovering for over a year now, and it got worse before it got better. It's interesting how different healing can be for people. But just now, I feel my muscles coming back and I'm feeling stronger and less exhausted and I'm eating ALL the food groups finally nearly every day! \n\nIt's wonderful to feel so much healthier. I'm happy to hear you are healing so well! \n\nSometimes even a bite of food is an accomplishment! Healing is one bite at a time. \ud83d\udc99",

You are such a sweetheart! \ud83e\ude77\ud83e\ude77\ud83e\ude77\n\n- - - - -\n\nI recognize that there\u2019s no possible way I can understand what you went through (and I never encourage trauma Olympic comparisons anyways)\n\nThat said, I think it\u2019s important to recognize that I didn\u2019t experience what you did and I personally don\u2019t qualify for a BPD dx\n\n^ I\u2019m also pretty confident about that bc I PESTERED TF outta my mental health professionals when I was fixated on quiet BPD specifically!! \ud83e\udd2a\ud83d\ude05\n\nTHAT said, I can definitely still relate to your experiences on SOME level and I feel for you \ud83e\udec2\u2665\ufe0f \n\nI too have endured a fuck tonne of abuse and have big attachment trauma (which is the core essence of BPD) as part of my CPTSD and PTSD\n\n*I\u2019m SO SORRY you had to endure all that and I\u2019m SO PROUD of you for sticking around and working on yourself to build the life you want and deserve \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f*\n\nPS If you ever feel alone and are looking for someone to relate to with in regards to your \u201clearned ARFID\u201d ED, you might enjoy this book:\n\n[\u201cI\u2019m Glad My Mom Died\u201d by Jennette McCurdy AUDIO](https://www.audible.ca/pd/B09VJHT9ZR?source_code=ASSORAP0511160006&share_location=pdp)",

The problem was a could not touch or eat food without being so repulsed that I ended up vomiting. I had a deep fear of throwing up. And I lost so much weight that I did NOT want to lose. Nothing about it was me needing to be thin or needing control of my life. I desperately wanted to eat all the time. My brain wouldn\u2019t let me do it.",

Bc this sounds a lot like how my autistic side presents itself\u2026 \n\nNot trying to armchair diagnose! Just giving you a gentle nudge in a helpful direction in case you need a nudge to go down that rabbit role and investigate!\n\nOh and btw, the involuntary visceral response to food  you\u2019ve described sounds VERY similar to experiences of something called \u201csex repulsion.\u201d So if you\u2019re sad no one can relate to that lived experience, try looking for ppl who are sex-repulsed! These folx are often found in online sex-repulsion, sex-aversion, demi, and ace communities. You may find y\u2019all can relate in some surprising ways!\n\nBONUS TRIVIA FACT:\nPeople with EDs should really be automatically screened for innate neurodivergence bc there is OVERWHELMING comorbidity! I looked into it after the author briefly mentioned it in \u201cAutism in Heels\u201d and it checks out!!\n\n[Audible 2020- \u201cAutism In Heels\u201d by Jennifer Cook O\u2019Toole AUDIO](https://www.audible.ca/pd/B085WBNRHB?source_code=ASSORAP0511160006&share_location=pdp%5D)\n\n[Nature 2025- ED\u2019s and ND\u2019s Research Study WEB](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-024-02825-w#:~:text=Eating%20disorders%20(EDs)%20commonly%20co,overlap%20among%20them%20requires%20clarification.)\n\n[Nature 2025- ED\u2019s and ND\u2019s Research Study PDF](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-024-02825-w.pdf)",

          "body": "I appreciate the perspective of it possibly being autism. I do have BPD and complex-PTSD and PTSD. They do present very similar. As I said before, most of my food issues stem from a particular trauma. I have talked to my therapist about ADHD and Autism multiple times. \n\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of doctors, therapists, psychiatrists and neurologists. \n\nWhat happened to me was really honestly disgusting and not for the faint of heart to hear. \n\nMy problem with food was that I knew I\u2019d be physically forced to throw it up later so I stopped eating because it made it less gross. Therefore, I developed an aversion to it all together. That\u2019s why I tried to make it clear that my problem is trauma based and not something I was born with, so I can\u2019t speak on people who have things they were born with. \n\nEither way, I do hope some of the things I mentioned are able to help other people heal and get better. \n\nI love your curiosity and ability to relay things in such a sweet way and want to learn! I\u2019m just a small girl who\u2019s been through a lot. That\u2019s all.",
