Skinny does not equal healthy!!! I was a really strong athlete in college and I was 30lbs heavier back then! Being skinny as a result of malnutrition fucking sucks- I\u2019m cold all the time, I get out of breath cleaning my apartment, I get dizzy when I stand up. Sometimes I want to respond \u201cI wish I had your appetite bc I know I could actually moderate it and be healthy\u201d but I\u2019m not trying to lose friends lol\n\nJust a rant, I\u2019m sure you all get this all the time, it just seems that if you\u2019re physically thin people assume you\u2019re the picture of perfect health. I\u2019m the least healthy I\u2019ve ever been physically, and it has very much impacted my health mentally. Wish ppl would just mind their own business. You eat a lot, I don\u2019t. Move on.",

I literally burst into to tears and ran out of the room when she said it. We had a heart-to-heart afterward and she apologized and admitted that that comment came from a place of genuine insecurity about her own weight and told me about her past struggles with an eating disorder (not ARFID). Now whenever people make similar dumb comments to me, I do my best to empathize with them because those comments are probably coming from their own insecurities about their weight (even though the comments are incredibly tone deaf and rude). People just say things without thinking them through. It's really hard to be the bigger person sometimes and be empathetic towards someone who isn't doing the same for you but it does make it easier to hear those comments when you know that they have a lot more to do with that person's insecurities than you",

Absolutely it\u2019s so fucked up the way people genuinely seem to determine a person\u2019s value based so heavily on their weight. You have a really interesting perspective, I wonder how often the desire to be skinny is really the desire to be treated human. Thin privilege is a real thing and I\u2019ve experienced it my whole life. And anecdotally, one of my good friends lost around 100lbs in less than a year (due to illness unfortunately) and she has noticed a major difference in the way people treat her. Even though she was sick! It was still celebrated weight loss. \nThis became a small rant again haha but ARFID fucking sucks and it manifests differently for different people.

I literally burst into to tears and ran out of the room when she said it. We had a heart-to-heart afterward and she apologized and admitted that that comment came from a place of genuine insecurity about her own weight and told me about her past struggles with an eating disorder (not ARFID). Now whenever people make similar dumb comments to me, I do my best to empathize with them because those comments are probably coming from their own insecurities about their weight (even though the comments are incredibly tone deaf and rude). People just say things without thinking them through. It's really hard to be the bigger person sometimes and be empathetic towards someone who isn't doing the same for you but it does make it easier to hear those comments when you know that they have a lot more to do with that person's insecurities than you",

Being able to stomach one food item a day is so depressing and exhausting. Food is a huge part of our culture whether we care or not, and being unable to participate in food culture sucks.

Not that you said that, I\u2019m just not loving the language I used so I wanted to call it out. Absolutely it\u2019s so fucked up the way people genuinely seem to determine a person\u2019s value based so heavily on their weight. You have a really interesting perspective, I wonder how often the desire to be skinny is really the desire to be treated human. Thin privilege is a real thing and I\u2019ve experienced it my whole life. And anecdotally, one of my good friends lost around 100lbs in less than a year (due to illness unfortunately) and she has noticed a major difference in the way people treat her. Even though she was sick! It was still celebrated weight loss. \nThis became a small rant again haha but ARFID fucking sucks and it manifests differently for different people. I\u2019m so sorry people treat you differently based on your weight, I know that would fuck w my mental health. Please know that you\u2019re seen and supported in this community, and I\u2019m going to do a better job keeping in mind how diverse eating disorders can appear on the outside.",

I could eat a whole pizza (if my body let me lol) and would metabolize it fairly quickly, if she did the same she would def put on a few pounds.
