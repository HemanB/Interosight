I really didn't like the texture and I felt like I was eating raw meat (ugh sorry to be gross). But when I cooked it darker the texture was much better and the flavor was okay (I basted it while cooking and added a lot of herbs I like). I wouldn't say I'm dying to eat it again, but I feel like I COULD eat it if I had to (at a longer temp). Congrats to both of us lol :)",
