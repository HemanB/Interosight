It doesn\u2019t have to be anything too big but eating something simple in the morning like a small sandwich typically jump starts my appetite. For some reason if I don\u2019t eat in the morning, I can go all day without eating and I won\u2019t even realize I\u2019m hungry. However if I eat in the morning, it starts up my appetite and by the time lunch comes around I\u2019m feeling even hungrier and want to eat. On tough days where I can\u2019t bring myself to eat, I survive on high protein snacks like yogurt and ensure.",
