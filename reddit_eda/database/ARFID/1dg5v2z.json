  "selftext": "I\u2019m sure I\u2019m the last person to get this information or maybe I just blocked it out after hearing it but they discontinued the popcorn chicken and replaced it with these crusty looking chicken nuggets. The popcorn chicken was one of my favorite safe foods and I\u2019m so sad I could cry. I\u2019m actually distressed about it and I\u2019m scared to try the nuggets because they don\u2019t look good and it\u2019s upsetting me. I just spent an extended period of time trying to convince myself that they were probably just as good but I genuinely don\u2019t think I can eat them.",

          "body": "ooohh since you mention breading, i hope the breading on these won\u2019t be too much for you. very sensitive to textures myself. i wouldn\u2019t say i\u2019m bothered by the texture of nuggets and tenders, but i also haven\u2019t branched out when it comes to frozen ones because they just look gross to me and that\u2019s with like 80% of things i see at a grocery in general sadly. my go to tenders since 2016. the gluten free ones just have a taste to them that i\u2019ve never tasted before in tenders and i love it, so i doubt any other tenders would taste the same. \nyou\u2019ll also smell them when you\u2019re baking and the smell is pleasant to me.\ni have an oven but it takes forever to bake stuff, so i bake them for about 20-22 minutes where as the instructions say otherwise. it takes a little bit to master when it comes to baking them to my liking because l once they get dark brown, they taste overbaked to me and it takes away that crispy, yummy texture and flavor i enjoy! if you\u2019re not a fan of overbaked tenders, definitely don\u2019t leave them in your oven for too long. if you\u2019re oven isn\u2019t bad like mine, you might be able to get away with the bake time that the instructions recommend. if the instruction time isn\u2019t working out and they feel soggy, leave them in for the time i recommend and if they still feel soggy, just leave them in for like 2-3 minutes longer otherwise they will be overbaked. but that\u2019s also my personal opinion and this is just my preference for how i like to eat them. a timer is definitely needed for this. \nthe time bake time i recommend could be even too much so it may take a minute to figure out how well baked it is depending on your preference. once they get brown, that\u2019s where they taste disgusting. it\u2019s all about the golden crispy texture for me. if they\u2019re still golden and don\u2019t feel soggy, that\u2019s how you know they\u2019re done and not overbaked.\nair fryer wise, i can\u2019t be certain. there may be instructions for air fryer but i can\u2019t remember since i don\u2019t have one and i haven\u2019t had them as of recently. i assume air fryers takes less time, but i dont have one so im not sure if they would even taste the same but if thats your preference, probably best to do what the instructions say if included. they probably are since air fryers are well known today. if you do like your tenders more on the brown side, maybe you will like it but there isn\u2019t much flavor to them in my opinion:/",
