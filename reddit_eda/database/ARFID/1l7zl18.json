It's not an excuse, it's an explanation. I've only ever used it as an explanation and nothing more. I do what I need to do with the doctors I need to do it with to move towards a happier and healthier self. I'm using all of the resources available to live my life as close to normal as everybody else and at the end of the day, what I do or don't eat only affects me, not anybody else. At that point it genuinely just feels like power tripping and control freaking when people have an issue with it because they want to control every aspect of how you live your life.",

I mean, I don\u2019t know for sure it\u2019s ARFID, but it might be and for whatever reason this community helped me when I first got onto Reddit to read more about arfid. I now finally realize how others must feel when they get told something like that within other topics. But after seeing the comment section: yes, this might be just someone having rage bait going on, still mean though. \n\nI can laugh about this right now, but on other days I might have felt the same as OP. \n\nMy god, I still feel so weird in public talking about how my body thinks about food intake of certain foods.

Any medical issue can be so hard to live and deal with. I do not have Arfid but other medical issues and feel your pain. For all the happy people, we should be so lucky to be happy,obviously not about Arfid! OP should have said compassion if they had a soul. For all my gay friends out there, obviously that has no relation to a horrible medical condition. We are all worthy of \u201clove\u201d, it should be celebrated and the world needs more of it!
