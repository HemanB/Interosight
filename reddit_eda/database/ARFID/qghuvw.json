  "selftext": "You think that I want this? You think that I love the feeling of literally gagging with 60% of my food? No I don't, that I have found a name for it and a community doesn't mean I want it, it means I know I'm not the only one.\nYou don't need to \"get\" it, and I know it sounds weird how I describe foods as \"they taste too white\" and \"it's rotten piano flavor\" but that's how I interpret it.\nYou don't need to feel what I feel, just please support me and stop policing what I eat, it doesn't help, I incorporate fear foods into safe foods to ease myself into them, and it's still hard, I repeat meals a lot because they're safe, they're perfect, they have everything I need, I avoid certain things because they literally make me want to puke (that I've learned to mask it over the years doesn't magically take the feeling away)\nIt doesn't make me special, it's not a prize or a good thing, it's a horrible condition, that isn't just \"picky eating\", it's hard, and I'm fucking trying, but you make it harder for me when saying things like \"haven't you eaten a lot of spinach lately?\" yes I have and it's because I finally conquered it, because I can enjoy it because I've found a way, or \"you look tortured when you eat\" trust me, I feel so too, \"why don't you ever eat with us?\" because my eating habits to get food to get me through the day are complicated, because I feel embarrassed to eat, because it's hard.\nI am slowly but surely getting out of it, in a way that's not gonna be by masking my disgust and fear, but actually getting over it.\nSo please, from the bottom of my heart, support me, it means the world to me",

It's horrible struggling to eat and makes social gatherings (especially holidays) so frustrating and upsetting. Why the fuck would anyone do that to themselves to upset someone else? It makes no sense. After a lifetime of having ARFID it's become exhausting to try to get people to even consider that my eating disorder is a real thing that actually impacts my life in severe ways.",

I love cheese, but hate spinach, so I make a pizza with spinach cut in very small pieces so my brain doesn't notice) coach him slowly but surely, avoid forcing and if you can, consult with a nutritionist, best of luck to y'all! :)",
