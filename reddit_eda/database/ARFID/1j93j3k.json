  "selftext": "Cause the arguments against picky eaters (people with ARFID lmao) make NO sense to me.\n\n**\"I don't care if you're a picky eater, just don't be rude to ME if I want to order something adventurous.\"** When have any of us EVER been genuinely mean to someone because we don't like what they're eating? I don't feel like that happens very often, if ever. \n\n**\"I don't care if you're a picky eater, just don't make me order chicken tenders, too!\"** Again, no picky eater on Earth is doing this. None of us are gonna force you to eat something you don't want to. \n\n**\"Picky eaters are childish brats who throw tantrums when their safe foods aren't available.\"** I don't know a SINGLE person with this disorder that doesn't keep their mouth shut and go hungry when their safe foods aren't available. We shouldn't HAVE to do that, but we often do, because telling people that you can't eat 95% of the food at a buffet is embarrassing. \n\n**\"Picky eating is so embarrassing.\"** Yeah!!! It is!!! Glad you noticed!!! Imagine having to live like this!!! Do you think I'm doing this for the bit?? I think they genuinely believe I'm doing this for the bit.\n\n**\"If I take a picky eater to a restaurant and they try to order one of their safe foods when it's not listed on the menu, that's really annoying.\"** ???? WHO does this?? WHO orders things that aren't on the menu?? This sounds insane, but I saw this take MULTIPLE times the other day while browsing a Tumblr post. And it's possibly the most unhinged one, because I can't imagine trying to order something that isn't on a restaurant's menu. That doesn't even exist in my head as something I would think to do.\n\nLike....sure, maybe there's a FEW people out there who act like this. But it's not because they're picky eaters, it's because they're jerks. And ARFID is a really stupid thing to hate from an external standpoint, because YOU'RE not the one who has to deal with it. Making an accommodation for a friend at a restaurant because you care about then is not on the same level of annoying/humiliating/frustrating as living with an eating/feeding disorder for your entire life. Grow up and stop acting like a petulant baby because someone wants to eat different food than you do.",

Then I will just be honest. I said that I couldn\u2019t eat anything and you wanted to go anyway. Usually, they end up feeling terrible and it ruins their day, but they got what they wanted, to go to the place they wanted to eat. It\u2019s kind of my little way of punishing people who want to act immature, but it does require some restraint. It just really makes me mad when people don\u2019t actually care about you having a good time and all they care about is going to the place they want to go to; so I\u2019m not above, making them feel really awful for it by giving them exactly what they asked for if they are hearing my hesitancy and still responding by being demanding",
