  "selftext": "Recently on tiktok, arfid content has been flooded with a lot of hate. It\u2019s not the usual hate though (like telling us to just stop being picky) people are calling us all privileged and saying \u201cpoor people don\u2019t have this\u201d. And sure, I can somewhat understand that theoretically, ARFID can maybe be somewhat of a privilege for a select few (like being able to have access to the food that\u2019s safe), but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good one. I don\u2019t understand what privilege I get from starving and being malnourished, My body probably has had irreversible damage done to it that could lead to health issues in the future, but sure i\u2019m living the good life. I feel like those factors outweigh the possible good that I struggle to see coming from arfid. It\u2019s also just rude to poor people who do have arfid. If their lucky, their safe foods are cheap and protein rich, if they aren\u2019t, to be blunt they probably didn\u2019t make it far and that\u2019s sad, so idk why people are comfortable using them as a gotcha moment against us. It\u2019s also funny because i\u2019ve never seen people call other EDS privileged (rightfully so) so why us??\n\n(also this is an edit, Im not trying to say that there can\u2019t be any privilege people with arfid can have nor am I trying to deny any exists, im upset that people are using this in bad faith to dismiss a serious ED)",

      "body": "I've always liked this perspective for ARFID that really displays that it's NOT *just being picky*: If a picky person is starving to death and served something they don't like they'll probably eat the food eventually. If someone with ARFID is served an unsafe food many of them would still not eat it even if it meant they would die of starvation. \n\n\nThat's obviously not the case or severity for everyone with ARFID but it's a good look into how debilitating the symptoms can be. Because it's not a matter of privilege, it's a very real and genuine mental illness and eating disorder. Tbh most of the people making those comments are probably children who don't know anything about how nuanced the \"real world\" actually is.",

      "body": "I grew up poor with ARFID (didn't know what it was then). I'm still working class but my partner and I manage to afford what foods we want so we're not as poor as we both were growing up. \n\nI can tell you I struggle now, I'd struggle if I had more money tomorrow and I struggled then. It's just I struggled a LOT more then. My mum never cared about my struggles with food she always saw it ase being \"bad\" and annoying on purpose. There's a few main meals I had growing up that are to this day some of my few safe meals. Spaghetti Bolognese only with dolmio sauce. Chicken curry only with the homepride curry sauce etc. I used to beg my mum to get the smooth dolmio sauce but that was seen as a luxury because it was like 50p more expensive. So my mum would get like Asda's own make sauce with all the bits. I'd sit and pick out every single piece of onion and tomato before I ate. My dinner would be cold. And I wouldn't like it. I'd try to eat a mouthful or 2 and give up. I'd go hungry. \n\nSadly my safest foods are sweets, chocolate and fizzy drinks. I always know what I'm getting. They taste nice. They're always the same etc. Well the more I struggled with meals the more I'd sneak biscuits and whatnot (I'd still get in trouble for that). I think being poor with ARFID pushed me to have more sweets. On my break at work and don't know what to have? Scared of what they're serving in the canteen? Grab a mars bar and can of coke. Honestly sweets became like rations for me. Easy to store, easy to carry, easy to eat and safe. \n\nThe irony is now I still struggle immensely. But now I can eat proper meals. My favourite thing to eat for dinner and probably in general is chicken, rice and spinach. I can have that every day with plenty of seasonings. Or curry. Or wraps. I can have spaghetti Bolognese with the smooth sauce I like. I can have homepride curry and sieve out the bits. \n\nIf I was on a desert island tomorrow I wouldn't all of a sudden not have ARFID. I'd struggle. But I'd hopefully find something I can eat and just eat that.\n\nI lived in Japan for a year and I was terrified I wouldn't be able to eat anything. At first I didn't eat. Again I found chocolate in the convenience stores and had that. But I found things I knew I liked. They had McDonald's, dominos, even TGI Fridays where I was. But I also found at uni I liked the spaghetti Bolognese they made. Plus just rice and curry sauce. Slowly I found more foods I liked. Udon curry noodles. Ramen just not eating all the bits. \n\nThe people who say these things about ARFID no doubt don't have it. And they've probably never lived around someone who has it. ARFID has existed forever. Just people would see those who only ate X as just a bit different back in the day.",

Between food scarcity, and actual contamination issues (I once made tea with sugar that had been infested with sugar ants), I was already in a bad place. We often could only afford fruit and vegetables that were overripe or about to go bad, because they would be on clearance. I would rather die than eat an overripe banana now.

It definitely was a struggle to get any food in me as a kid. It doesn\u2019t help that my mom was okay ish financially but she was more of the \u201cjust eat what\u2019s on your plate if you\u2019re hungry\u201d kind of parent at the time (thankfully she\u2019s not like that anymore and actually validates my diagnosis) so even when I was at my moms house every other week, I was still struggling. So I sorta saw both sides of the coins in the privilege department. I also had to have free school \u201clunches\u201d most of my childhood and those were not the best. A milk carton (I\u2019m severely lactose intolerant so I couldn\u2019t have it), a \u201csandwhich\u201d (it was basically a slice of bread folded in half with a slice of cheese in the middle) which I had to force myself to eat so I would have SOMETHING in my body, and if I was lucky, a fruit I actually liked. So while some people think it\u2019s a \u201cfirst world problem\u201dit\u2019s still a problem and it\u2019s a valid real experience. Also, you can\u2019t tell me people in lesser developed countries don\u2019t have eating disorders. People are so ridiculous",
