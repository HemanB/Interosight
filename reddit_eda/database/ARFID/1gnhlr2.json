It only happens to me when something super stressful happens and then I forget to eat and then I want to eat, but feel like it\u2019s impossible to bring myself to it. It also didn\u2019t start until after I was in a situation as a teenager where I would go days at a time without eating because there was nothing there to eat, I remember one time we passed around a cup of every canned vegetable we could find mixed up with some salt and pepper and a small slice of butter we got from someone and it was honestly so good to me. I haven\u2019t had an episode in a while(until today), but I use to get them all the time. I just start with small bites and try to gradually increase as time goes on. Sometimes those first few bites are so difficult to take that I have to wash them down with some water.",
