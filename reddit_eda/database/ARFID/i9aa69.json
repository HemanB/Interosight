  "selftext": "We were ordering from a sandwich place & I (23f) asked to get a roast beef sandwich with extra cheese, take off the extra stuff. My dad said \"wow that sounds like a boring dry sandwich\" and my little sister (19) laughed at me and started reciting my order in a mocking voice. It pisses me off too because my sister acts like a humanitarian online yet makes fun of my mental illnesses CONSTANTLY, especially my arfid. She treats me like I'm a big stupid idiot who's beneath her because I'm picky. Yet if I try to tell her off, she storms off and says I bullied her for no reason.\n\nI don't get why some people are so rude over food preferences. All of my family are assholes about my eating but she's by far the worst with her laughing and throwing insults in my face. I've been treated worse over arfid than I have over any other illness I have. I don't get it. The only person who's ever tried to educate themselves and be kind to me about arfid is my boyfriend, everybody else just belittles me and says I need to just get over it. It drives me up the fucking wall.",

The one I would probably take is the hot headed one - give them an ultimatum - the next time they try something like that, you will fucking humiliate them, no matter who is there. \n\nMy mum does it sometimes with me (no malice, she just says something without thinking). Last time I got so annoyed because she wouldn\u2019t drop it with the waitress at the table that I brought up literally everything she\u2019d ever mentioned not liking - fish, sweet corn, Oreo cookies on the desserts. Just kept reaming it off and asking if she wanted them added to her meal.\n\nThe cooler approach would be to point out that if she does that in public without thinking, it might end up giving her a reputation. Like that old story of the woman who went full Karen in a Starbucks on the way to an interview, held up the whole place.\n\nWhen she got to the interview, her interviewer had been in the line behind her, and her behaviour had given a bad impression of her to the interviewer. The interviewer just went \u201cafter what I saw this morning, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll waste the time\u201d.\n\nSo if your sister doesn\u2019t learn to keep her trap shut and reel her behaviour in, she could end up doing real damage to her prospects in life.",
