I was a waitress for a few years in my 20s and remember how some staff took offense and ignored special orders. \n\nSeafood is my main gag/vomit and only junk food snacking for days. This problem started in the womb per se as I had dairy issues and had to go on soy formula which came out the year before I was born. I\u2019m not sure why my mom didn\u2019t give up dairy once it was confirmed that was the problem. As soon as solid foods were introduced if I didn\u2019t like something I refused to eat anything for hours and if they tried to reintroduce it I refused to taste it and refused to eat anything else for hours. I learned not to trust people before I was one.\n\nI also have some food sensitivities, not actual allergies, I\u2019m not going to end up in ER or die, but I\u2019ll end up with painful digestive problems, bloody noses, congestion, migraines for a few days. Not fun. \n\nHopefully some time in the future people will be respected when it comes to special requests and we won\u2019t have to lie.
