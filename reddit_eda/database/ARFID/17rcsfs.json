Sometimes I fall asleep and when I wake up, find the delivery sitting in front of my door. It can sit there for up to 10 hours. I feel extreme guilt due to this.

For the life of me, I cannot cook at home even tough I love being a cook at my little restaurant. I had nothing to eat today. I have hunger but no appetite, and tons of guilt.

They can also order the fya before so we pack them before they enter. \n\n\"so you always order a bunch of cinnamon rolls? Well turned out the delivery went wrong and only have one left for direct sell. I'm not gonna sell just one cinnamon roll, have an extra for the little one bestie\"\n\nSo conclusion if you're a regular. The staff loves you, you have a reputation, a very good one. No matter how weird your orders are. No matter how things are going in life, you can always rely on Monday Mike. And Mike is missed if he doesn't order one Monday, the crew is in panic, what if he's dead? And there's a relief if he orders again. So if you as a regular get something extra for no charge sometimes, it's probably not a coincidence, rather a huge compliment",
