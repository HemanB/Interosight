From what I've seen in this sub, a lot of people (myself included) have safe foods that are carb-heavy (bread, pasta, potatoes) and have difficulty with the textures and bitterness of fruits and veggies. Processed foods are also generally \"safer\" for some people because the flavor/texture is consistent. It's always been a challenge for me to maintain a healthy diet because most of my safe foods aren't very healthy. It's definitely still a valid diagnosis even if you're not underweight!",

If your ARFID leads you to consuming energy-dense foods and you don\u2019t use up all of that energy, it will be stored as excess weight. \n\nSome people lead less active lifestyles or have genetics and health conditions that make their bodies need less food/energy, so it\u2019s easier for them to eat more than their bodies need. If you aren\u2019t very active or are burning energy at a low rate, you could still be overweight even if you don\u2019t eat that much. \n\nOn the other hand, if your ARFID gives you a general disinterest in food or your safe foods don\u2019t have enough calories to sustain your energy needs, you\u2019ll lose weight.\n\nPeople can be malnourished at any weight if they aren\u2019t ingesting enough nutrients.
