  "selftext": "I'm 49(f) and have lived with ARFID most of my life, and have ADHD also. I really struggle with food because I have chronic gut issues and ADHD gives me food sensory issues too. Menopause isn't helping, because it's making everything taste and smell weird.\n\nI am therefore careful and controlling with food all the time. \n\nI'm so tired of fending off \"why don't you just try....?\" and \"can you not just eat a little of this?\" and \"you really need to broaden your diet\". A friend has spent most of this evening messaging me all about Huel and how I should try it.  I do so appreciate them caring, but I really don't want to try that \ud83d\ude15 ",

I work for my own money, buy my own groceries, and cook my own food. I'm not taking feedback at this time. \n\nNow, if I'm in some type of situation where it truly matters, like I don't want to hurt someone's feelings at a holiday potluck or cultural event, \"No, thank you, I'm on a diet/doctor's orders/I'm full but I'll take some home for later\" and I'll be kind.
