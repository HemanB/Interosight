I might say my arfid (not diagnosed but more than obvious) isn\u2019t as severe as other people have it but it\u2019s still pretty limited.

I was there for about a week. I needed I think 5 units of blood, three rounds of IV Iron infusions, and a platelet infusion because I basically had no blood. They had to pump me full of steroids three times per day because I was on the verge of liver, kidney, and heart failure. And (this part was kind of confusing I'm still not sure exactly what they meant, sorry I don't speak Doctor) they said my heart was mimicing all the signs of a heart attack, but that it was something not quite the same? Idk. My digestive system was in shambles since it had basically just comoletely shut off to keep from digesting itself. My muscles were wasting. They predicated the brain damage will take around a year to (hopefully) fully reverse/heal itself, assuming I maintain a healthy diet and keep up on all my supplements and stuff. I still had to be on steroids for another couple months after I was discharged just to help my organs stay on the right track of getting stronger.!<\n\nBut yeah, I think that is all. I just spoilered it in case anybody doesn't want to read about all my medical drama. \n\nVery sorry if that makes you more scared, but that was my personal experience.",

I was there for about a week. I needed I think 5 units of blood, three rounds of IV Iron infusions, and a platelet infusion because I basically had no blood. They had to pump me full of steroids three times per day because I was on the verge of liver, kidney, and heart failure. And (this part was kind of confusing I'm still not sure exactly what they meant, sorry I don't speak Doctor) they said my heart was mimicing all the signs of a heart attack, but that it was something not quite the same? Idk. My digestive system was in shambles since it had basically just comoletely shut off to keep from digesting itself. My muscles were wasting. They predicated the brain damage will take around a year to (hopefully) fully reverse/heal itself, assuming I maintain a healthy diet and keep up on all my supplements and stuff. I still had to be on steroids for another couple months after I was discharged just to help my organs stay on the right track of getting stronger.!<\n\nBut yeah, I think that is all. I just spoilered it in case anybody doesn't want to read about all my medical drama. \n\nVery sorry if that makes you more scared, but that was my personal experience.",
