I started feeling sluggish/fatigued, brain fog, dry skin, dry eyes, dermatitis, dull hair, and digestive issues. I was have constipation typically and if not that then it was diarrhea. Oh and I started getting joint pain. Started in my elbows at night, then my fingers, shoulders, hips and knees and it would last longer. I thought I was having thyroid issues and at first it looked like I was, but I think my hormones were off, because I became vitamin deficient. Omega deficiency can cause all of these problems/symptoms and it will seem similar to a thyroid problem. Also omega deficiency can cause autoimmune diseases and you can develop cancer. In fact not eating fruited and vegetables can. Supplements were no longer enough for me to get by and taking too much can be dangerous. All of my symptoms are going away since I figured it out and started eating vegetables and some fruit. My HDL was also low at 47 and for females it should not be under 50. My A1C and glucose was at the lowest level for normal as well. Fruit has sugar and I was not getting enough sugar. It\u2019s going to take some time for my skin and body to recover, but I am so thankful that I found out what it was that I was still lacking in and how diet can really affect your body over time even though I was always slim and heathy I was causing a deficit from not eating essential foods by solely relying on vitamins from supplements. I\u2019m so glad my joint pain is gone as well, that was scary and not fun.\u00a0",
