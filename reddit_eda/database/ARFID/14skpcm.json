  "selftext": "This got kinda long.. TL;DR at the end.\n\nSo I made this friend through our summer job, and just happened to tag along to his place afterwards. His dad asked if I wanted to stay over dinner \u201cif it was something that I could eat\u201d so I asked what they were having, it was something I could eat so I said I\u2019d love to (I was also pretty hungry).\n\nAs we ate, everything was divided nicely into separate bowls so it was easy to take what you wanted, and avoid the other stuff. He also brought up what my friend was gonna bring for food to work tomorrow and we informed him that since it was the last day, they\u2019re gonna give us pizza, he asked what pizzas and my friend said \u201cmargaritas, and one without tomato sauce\u201d and he replied \u201cah, for you\u201d but no, that\u2019s for me, turns out that\u2019s also how my friend prefers his pizzas.\n\nWe said no, it was for me and I added I had some \u201cstrange eating habits\u201d and he said \u201cthere\u2019s no such thing as \u2018strange\u2019 eating habits, there\u2019s just eating habits, and they\u2019re different for everyone.\u201d\n\nI have never before met someone new who has that mindset immediately. Of course, this is probably because his kid seems to also be dealing with arfid, but it meant a lot to me\u2026 I often get judged by people, especially friends parents, over my eating habits, and while they often end up respecting them, they still clearly see it as a bother. But not this guy.\n\nI know this might not be the most interesting story or anything, but I felt like sharing it anyways. Since it meant a lot to me I guess.\n\nTL;DR: friends dad said there\u2019s no such thing as strange eating habits, they\u2019re just different. Might not sound like a lot but it meant a lot to me.",
