      "body": "Trying to eat, even nibble ANYTHING that otherwise triggers all kinds of mental and physical issues is extremely impressive. Id like to encourage you to see that as a skill not everyone w ARFID/SED/Picky eating could even necessarily fathom. I personally believe that modest ability, even if youre gagging your way through it, HAS to be a powerful sign for how you might decide to work up to and perhaps even try something new on your own volition. I feel for you in every situation like what you\u2019re describing, but am also really proud of you. There are so many quiet victories to be had over more than just managing to avoid bringing up ARFID.",
