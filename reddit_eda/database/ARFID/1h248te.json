      "body": "This is super long, and I don't really know how to sum it up. I guess \"don't force particular foods, but encourage trying without any pressure.\" \n\nHelpful for me when I was young would have been my mom not trying to force me to eat things. On top of that, not being sent to the kids' table by myself at 13 (I'm the youngest on all sides) because I wouldn't eat \"like a normal person\" when what I did eat wasn't going to make anyone else not want to eat would have helped. The majority of my family *did not care* what I ate or didn't eat, but my mom seemed to find me embarrassing, and that added stress and shame that made my ARFID worse. Just letting me eat peas, corn, rolls, and mashed potatoes with only butter on them and acting like that was perfectly normal would have been great. \n\nMy son, who is 28 now, will eat anything but cake and asparagus. As soon as he started on solid foods, I introduced a lot of different foods. If he clearly disliked something, I didn't try that food again for months. I just fed him something I knew he did like. As he got old enough to be able to talk to me, I asked him to always try a bite. If he didn't like it, he was allowed to (politely) spit it out. He always knew he had that option, so he was willing to try almost anything. Some, he wouldn't even take a bite of because of the smell. That was fine as long as he told me that's why. We learned to cook things together in different ways to see if he liked them some other way, so he had a lot of control over the food he ate. I think that sense of control is why he is so willing to try new foods and has a huge variety of things he'll eat now. Honestly, he never flat out refused to at least smell something and never refused a single bite if it didn't smell bad to him, but I think I'd have just accepted his no and moved on. There were a lot of things he didn't take a second bite of, but a year or more later, he'd be willing to try again, and he'd often like them. There are so many possible foods, I really didn't care as long as he was getting enough nutrition, but I didn't want him.to be hampered by a restrictive diet like I was. \n\nHe doesn't have ARFID, to be fair, but I know this approach would have helped me a lot. I have texture issues more than anything else, and getting to have control over whether I finished chewing and swallowing it (rather than being punished when I couldn't) would have led to more foods I could eat. I know this because I finally got to do that as an adult, and it did help. My biggest problem now is that I cannot bring myself to try the foods she forced on me. I have too many bad memories attached to those foods. Some of them smell sooooo good, but when I try to eat them, I feel sick and anxious. \n\nMy grandma was totally different from my mom about food. She basically only had a rule that I had to eat something from each category - so one veggie, one meat, one fruit, one dairy. She didn't care what I chose. The only caveat was that if it wasn't what she was making for everyone else and had to be cooked, I had to help cook it - or cook it myself once I was old enough. And meat was expensive, so generally I was going to get a couple of slices of bologna (which was cheap) if I couldn't eat the meat she was already cooking. I think that was totally fair. She shouldn't have had to make something just for me on top of the meal she was making for everyone else once I could cook. She did get in a fight with my mom about this, once. \"All the kids get to choose which cereal they want or what they want in their oatmeal. Why is it different that I let her choose raw peas when everyone else is having cooked carrots?\" Mom's answer was that I needed to eat what everyone else was having. Grandma thought it was dumb to make that rule, since it meant I wouldn't eat at all when I was in the 5th percentile for weight. To her, me eating at all was much more important than what I ate. Grandma, \"so, you'd rather control her than see her healthy? What is wrong with you?\" My hero. :) All my grandparents and great grandparents were super chill about my ARFID. And you know what? I ate a lot more things at their houses - because there was no anxiety attached to food there.",

For example Aunt Shirley is loudly offended I\u2019m not having her green bean casserole, just a little taste and she\u2019s sure I\u2019ll love it. We\u2019ve had the same \u201cdiscussion\u201d for 20 years, it started when I was 5, and will continue until she dies at 80, another 40 years from now. Don\u2019t get me started on Uncle Sam and his special giblet gravy *shudders*\n* Many of us are self conscious eating around others after years and years of people commenting on what we do and don\u2019t eat. We prefer to limit who we eat around as we are ashamed of our limited safe foods \n* Depending on what\u2019s being served it might be a food that just smelling or looking at triggers our gag reflex so being around it is impossible. For example seafood smells literally make me vomit so being around my family when they are doing lobster for Christmas can be extremely difficult as sometimes I can\u2019t eat with the house smelling and I\u2019m trying very hard not to get sick at the table while looking like everything is just fine and people keep asking me what\u2019s wrong and I can\u2019t claim a migraine and upset stomach every single Christmas",

I guess \"don't force particular foods, but encourage trying without any pressure.\" \n\nHelpful for me when I was young would have been my mom not trying to force me to eat things. On top of that, not being sent to the kids' table by myself at 13 (I'm the youngest on all sides) because I wouldn't eat \"like a normal person\" when what I did eat wasn't going to make anyone else not want to eat would have helped. The majority of my family *did not care* what I ate or didn't eat, but my mom seemed to find me embarrassing, and that added stress and shame that made my ARFID worse. Just letting me eat peas, corn, rolls, and mashed potatoes with only butter on them and acting like that was perfectly normal would have been great. \n\nMy son, who is 28 now, will eat anything but cake and asparagus. As soon as he started on solid foods, I introduced a lot of different foods. If he clearly disliked something, I didn't try that food again for months. I just fed him something I knew he did like. As he got old enough to be able to talk to me, I asked him to always try a bite. If he didn't like it, he was allowed to (politely) spit it out. He always knew he had that option, so he was willing to try almost anything. Some, he wouldn't even take a bite of because of the smell. That was fine as long as he told me that's why. We learned to cook things together in different ways to see if he liked them some other way, so he had a lot of control over the food he ate. I think that sense of control is why he is so willing to try new foods and has a huge variety of things he'll eat now. Honestly, he never flat out refused to at least smell something and never refused a single bite if it didn't smell bad to him, but I think I'd have just accepted his no and moved on. There were a lot of things he didn't take a second bite of, but a year or more later, he'd be willing to try again, and he'd often like them. There are so many possible foods, I really didn't care as long as he was getting enough nutrition, but I didn't want him.to be hampered by a restrictive diet like I was. \n\nHe doesn't have ARFID, to be fair, but I know this approach would have helped me a lot. I have texture issues more than anything else, and getting to have control over whether I finished chewing and swallowing it (rather than being punished when I couldn't) would have led to more foods I could eat. I know this because I finally got to do that as an adult, and it did help. My biggest problem now is that I cannot bring myself to try the foods she forced on me. I have too many bad memories attached to those foods. Some of them smell sooooo good, but when I try to eat them, I feel sick and anxious. \n\nMy grandma was totally different from my mom about food.
