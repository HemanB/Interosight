  "selftext": "found this sub at 3am last night, I was up late on YouTube and found a vid about lesser known eating disorders. halfway through the vid he started talking about ARFID, I was so shocked, it's always been a mystery for me as to why my diet is so limited and why I get so anxious trying new foods etc. I've always been ridiculed and called childish or a spoiled brat because of my eating habits so when I finally found people I could relate to I literally sobbed. I thought I was alone and no one else was like me, it's so refreshing to finally find a community. :')",

I read  every article I could find with tears in my eyes because everything made sense. I went to my mom and showed it to her and she was in shock too. It was the most refreshing feeling knowing I wasn\u2019t alone in all of this.",

Reading your comment shocked me because I\u2019m my forties now and I\u2019ve tried most foods and built an entire healthy diet over the course of 20 plus years of combating this, but the single food I can\u2019t imagine even tasing are pickles. I still gag at the thought of tasting pickles and could not imagine dipping bread in pickle juice and eating it... yet for you it\u2019s a safe food. I think one of the main challenges with ARFID is how there are similar through lines of experience and trauma for all of us, yet the particular challenges can be so overwhelmingly different.",
