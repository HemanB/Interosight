  "selftext": "I'm on a lovely boat trip with my aunt and she pre-ordered us two lunches. The lunch has a \"sandwich of the day.\" The sandwich came and I knew immediately that I didn't want it in my body. It's got tomatoes and lettuce and mozzarella and some sort of sickly pale yellow sauce. It's a super nice sandwich, and it terrifies me. But after staring at it for 10 minutes I took a bite. I set a timer on my watch and I'm choking down another bite every three minutes. It tastes fine, but every bite puts me in fight or flight mode. But I am eating this sandwich. I AM EATING THIS SANDWICH!!!!",

The concept of sandwich of the day is terrifying!\n\nThis particular sandwich is a variation of cheese salad which is acceptable to me, but the mystery sauce would probably make me nope right out. \n\nYou are doing amazing!!",
