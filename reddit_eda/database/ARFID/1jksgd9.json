  "selftext": "I decided enough was enough and decided to go to residential treatment without telling anyone. And it was the best decision I have ever made in anything. \n\nFor more context, I was born with bad aegis for 26 years. To a point that my diet was just bacon, fries, and snacks. (I literally never used a fork) I practically had no white blood cells and my liver was dying. \n\nAfter spending six weeks and starting off with like 15-20 panic attacks my first week because how trapped I felt and knowing I was forced to eat, I now have 4 pages worth of food I have eaten. I love so many new foods now. (Especially waffles). I have made so many new friends, none with Arfid, but all have eating disorders or mental disorders. \n\nIt was so worth it, now I have no fear trying most foods. (I\u2019m still working on finishing most plates) I will say that I still have arfid and I don\u2019t eat perfect, but I\u2019m much healthier now that I\u2019ve gained 20 pounds. \n\nSo plz go to treatment y\u2019all. It\u2019s never too late. ",
