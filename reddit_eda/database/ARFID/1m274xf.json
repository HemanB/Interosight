One way I\u2019ve learned to explain it is to say look, I have an ED and I know that is perfectly good food, but to my brain it is like asking me to eat a tire. I know it doesn\u2019t make sense but that\u2019s what my brain feels like. And no matter how that tire is prepared, I still can\u2019t make myself eat it, even a little bit.",
