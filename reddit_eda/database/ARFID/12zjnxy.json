  "title": "I hate when servers won\u2019t back off",
  "selftext": "I just need to rant a little, I was out for lunch with my friend the other day, we hadn\u2019t seen each other in ages and she wanted to meet for lunch, I ordered food but couldn\u2019t eat much of it, which is standard fair for me. \n\nThe server walked by and seeing my food almost untouched asked if everything was okay with the food (which is understandable) to which I replied yes it was lovely. She then came back *three more times* to ask the same question. Then, when we were leaving she asked if I wanted it boxed up to take with me, to which I said no thank you (I can\u2019t eat reheated food) \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t listen and kept insisting I should take it with me, at this point I was really irritated and snapped \u201creally I\u2019m fine, thanks\u201d with clear irritation and she finally dropped it. \n\nIf I\u2019d been acting angry or shit talking to food or complaining I\u2019d understand her behaviour, but I was doing none of these things, and I wasn\u2019t asking to pay less or anything like that. \n\nServers are paid a living wage here, tipping isn\u2019t really a thing so it wasn\u2019t that. \n\nIdk I just wish people would would listen the first time you say no, especially with food, I hate the pressure people put on you to eat, it only makes me more anxious about it all tbh",
