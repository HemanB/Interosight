Now a year later I had pizza, onion rings and spinach bites for dinner tonight and actually enjoyed it.\nIt takes work and effort to get there, but it's worth it.\n\nAnd a good way of adding new food is to use 'bridge' food.\nFor example, say you eat strawberry flavour jam (aks jelly?) You could then try eating a strawberry fruit roll up, then from there build up to real a strawberry etc.\n\nGo at your own pace, and remember two steps forward and one step back is still a step forward. You can do it!",
