She then referred me to a place that only provides services for children. \n\nAre you kidding me? I guess I should just \u201cbe a man\u201d and just start forcing myself to eat. \n",

I was also told that I \u201ctaught him to be picky\u201d growing up because he happens to have similar safe foods even though he has a wider variety of foods!! I was literally kicked out of feeding therapy 2x because I wasn\u2019t cooperative\u2026 literally as a baby and toddler. Before I could articulate what the problem was. I was forced to get fruits and vegetables on my plate in elementary school and told to just throw them away after even if it made my entire lunch inedible. Yet my nephew was always accommodated, never forced to try new foods, was always assumed autistic until he was finally diagnosed this year. \n\nI am also autistic, and his mother told me I\u2019m not like my sister (non verbal autistic high support needs) so I\u2019m not autistic. Her son is literally a normal kid developmentally, can fully take care of himself, has critical thinking, never missed milestones (unlike me! I was late for ALL of my milestones!). \n\nSorry for the rant, the way you were treated just really hits home. I feel so much for you, no one should be  invalidated at any age or sex/gender even over a \u201cchildhood condition\u201d, it\u2019s not like we grow out of it and suddenly eat everything.  I would ask to speak to the director or head medical professional there and ask them directly why you can\u2019t be treated. Even adults can develop arfid from trauma so it\u2019s completely ridiculous to deny you. They don\u2019t know what caused it or how long you\u2019ve been struggling, not that it should even matter! It sounds like to me the receptionist was ableist and didn\u2019t feel like you needed treatment. This is literally discrimination.

Most men I know would be considered \"picky\" if they were women, but their avoidance aligns with what is socially/culturally expected of men's diets, so no one bats an eye. Men don't generally eat fruits, veggies and wholefoods in general in my culture, and it's perfectly fine for them to live off of beige foods, meats and processed foods - if you're a woman, though, it's very concerning to eat like that, so we are more likely to be diagnosed. Same goes for binge eating.\n\nBody dysmorphic eating disorders often take on different forms in male populations as well. Dietitians in my country are just starting to see the tip of the iceberg with how prevalent bulimia and orthorexia are in males within fitness/sports circles.\n\nThere are still professors who equate body dysmorphia with patients being exclusively underweight, and eating disorders with body dysmorphia (ARFID is relatively knew as a dx, but it makes no sense for DIETITIANS to not be up to date with at leaat the basics of it), so there's a long way to go.",
