Then I tried having a caesar salad, nope, too wet. Threw up. Now I'm having a plain baked potato and a mini pack of crackers with jam. I'm so ashamed of myself for being this picky and weird. I try so hard but I default right back to dry and crunchy. Stodgy things. ",

Is it a failing of yours that you can't eat something? No, it's ARFID. It can help when you start to spiral into negative self talk to say out loud, \"This isn't me, this is ARFID. I'm doing my best. I'm brave and I'm going to keep trying. This is hard, hopefully the next interaction with food will be better.\"\n\nKeep coming here for perspective and support. We've got your back!",
