It's no fun going to a restaurant with someone that gets chicken fingers every time never mind someone that won't go out to eat at all. Since eating is one of *the* major social activities, particularly as part of a date it's not something people want to deal with. They don't want to deal with it. I've seen something to the effect of \"why does it matter what I eat, they can get whatever they want\" but that's missing the point. It's like going to an amusement park and your date won't go on any of the rides with you.\n\nIt only gets worse if the relationship gets serious because now your own dinners in your own home either have to be separate (which is a hassle and an expense) or you're locked into eating whatever couple of things this other person can stomach. \n\nFood is one of the dominant factors of life, it shouldn't be surprising that it seriously effects romantic relationships.",
