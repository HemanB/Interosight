I used to think that picky eaters were just kind of immature and just need to \u201cget over it\u201d and expand their diet by forcing themselves to eat foods they don\u2019t like, until they like them.  But browsing this subreddit has really convinced me it is not that simple.  It sounds like a form of anxiety, but in a way, worse, as there aren\u2019t really any treatment options.  I just wanted to say that I really think this should be far more widely recognized as a real medical issue, and not just someone being a \u201cpicky eater\u201d.  Thanks",

          "body": "I honestly think my quality of life improved significantly when I learned it classified as an eating disorder and I wasn't just being some irrational picky eater, like a fussy child.\n\nI used to get really embarrassed and have a hard time eating away from home, and my mom was often with me laughing with everyone about how I was a silly picky eater and to just ignore me etc. People acted like I was a toddler having a tantrum, ignoring me and getting frustrated when I wouldn't just shut up and eat my food. I felt frustrated with myself too. Often times, people would take the \"force yourself to eat it\" approach and would just give me whatever and would \"helpfully\" cheer me on to try to get me to eat it. This would just send me into a panic and I'd shut down. If I ever managed to get myself to eat something, I'd just puke it back up from the stress. \n\nNow I can confidently just tell whoever I'm with \"I have an eating disorder\" and they tend to respect that A LOT more. People tend to nod knowingly and try to help instead of just letting out exasperated sighs as they roll their eyes when I say I can't eat something. Now that I can explain that it isn't just me being immature and picky and it's a legitimate mental thing, it makes me feel a lot less anxious too. People take me seriously and I rarely have to deal with a table full of people trying to encourage me to eat something anymore.",
