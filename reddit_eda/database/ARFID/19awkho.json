Where the problem comes in is because it\u2019s still such a new disorder even though it\u2019s been added to it in the last decade or so, that a lot of doctors and professionals don\u2019t yet acknowledge it or know about it. There\u2019s so many variables when it comes to ARFID that a lot of them just don\u2019t know how to treat it or handle it. Honestly the only thing that\u2019s helped me is exposure therapy, and I\u2019ve tried every therapy related to eating disorders, and ask yourself questions of the 4 senses. So what does it look like? What does it smell like? What does it feel like? And finally what it does it taste like? Describe the food as neutral as possible, and keep doing that exercise until you don\u2019t need to do it anymore and keep exposing yourself to it as often as possible. I got super lucky with my therapist and my nutritionist cause trying to find help in Quebec was damn near impossible. They either didn\u2019t know about it, or couldn\u2019t help me cause I\u2019m an adult. It\u2019s frustrating. \n\nBut stay positive, try the exposure method, you got this!",

I would encourage you to not only find a different therapist but let your state or country\u2019s licensing organization know about her conduct, as that is grossly negligible and could cause serious harm to you or another patient, ESPECIALLY regarding eating disorders, whether weight-based or not.

I\u2019m curious, if everything went your way, what would the next steps be for our discussions?\u201d\n\nShe should have accessed why this is important to you: do you want diagnosis validation and/or ARFID-based treatment help? Ultimately, gently, I do believe she is correct that the label is not as important unless it changes how she would treat you. She is not a dietician, so she can only help you with your feelings toward food. Many of these feelings are rooted in anxiety, so using anti-anxiety techniques is the answer here. \n\nDiagnoses can certainly feel validating and the help one can achieve by sharing in experiences with people with similar issues is beautiful. However, gently, I think some soul-searching here is valuable. Ask yourself what you would have wanted to go differently, make a plan, and advocate for yourself next session. [Here is a TherapistAid PDF on Assertive Communication that may be helpful for planning this out.](https://www.therapistaid.com/worksheets/assertive-communication)\n\nUltimately, this is my opinion, and we don\u2019t need to agree! What matters is that you feel that you have some control and are respected by your therapist! \n\nAdditionally, I have found radical acceptance practices to be massively helpful in times of stress and in situations when I can\u2019t make changes immediately, but need to soothe myself. [Here is a PDF worksheet on that if you are interested.](https://mhawv.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Worksheet-Practicing-Radical-Acceptance.pdf)\n\nLastly, you got this! This may be a bit of a setback, but I believe you can advocate for the changes you need!",

I am not a doctor or counselor in any way shape or form but I do see many of them due to my own mental and physical health issues. It is my understanding (in my state at least) mental health professionals are required by law to keep up with the latest DSM just like a school teacher or a nurse is required to complete a specific amount of continuing education courses throughout the year. The fact that your therapist was so quick to dismiss it by saying it doesn\u2019t exist is\u2026concerning. It would have been one thing had she said something like, \u201cI am not well versed in ARFID, let me look into it\u201d but that\u2019s not what happened. I don\u2019t expect my psychiatrist to know every single diagnosis listed in the DSM 5 off the top of his head but he has always been quick to humbly admit not being an expert on something in the moment and I respect him for it. If he doesn\u2019t feel comfortable speaking on a particular diagnosis in the moment, for example ARFID, he makes a point to do serious research on it before my next session and then we discuss further. It\u2019s a big reason why I trust him and he knows it. If it were me I\u2019d be considering filing a complaint against your therapist with your state\u2019s licensing board, but that\u2019s a very personal decision that only you can make. All she had to do was a quick google search, hell she could have cracked open a recent copy of the DSM (which she should definitely have quick access to due to her profession). A complaint of this nature wouldn\u2019t be enough for her to outright lose her license, but it may enough of a slap on the hand for her to realize she can\u2019t be talking out of her ass like that.",

Where the problem comes in is because it\u2019s still such a new disorder even though it\u2019s been added to it in the last decade or so, that a lot of doctors and professionals don\u2019t yet acknowledge it or know about it. There\u2019s so many variables when it comes to ARFID that a lot of them just don\u2019t know how to treat it or handle it. Honestly the only thing that\u2019s helped me is exposure therapy, and I\u2019ve tried every therapy related to eating disorders, and ask yourself questions of the 4 senses. So what does it look like? What does it smell like? What does it feel like? And finally what it does it taste like? Describe the food as neutral as possible, and keep doing that exercise until you don\u2019t need to do it anymore and keep exposing yourself to it as often as possible. I got super lucky with my therapist and my nutritionist cause trying to find help in Quebec was damn near impossible. They either didn\u2019t know about it, or couldn\u2019t help me cause I\u2019m an adult. It\u2019s frustrating. \n\nBut stay positive, try the exposure method, you got this!",

I\u2019m curious, if everything went your way, what would the next steps be for our discussions?\u201d\n\nShe should have accessed why this is important to you: do you want diagnosis validation and/or ARFID-based treatment help? Ultimately, gently, I do believe she is correct that the label is not as important unless it changes how she would treat you. She is not a dietician, so she can only help you with your feelings toward food. Many of these feelings are rooted in anxiety, so using anti-anxiety techniques is the answer here. \n\nDiagnoses can certainly feel validating and the help one can achieve by sharing in experiences with people with similar issues is beautiful. However, gently, I think some soul-searching here is valuable. Ask yourself what you would have wanted to go differently, make a plan, and advocate for yourself next session. [Here is a TherapistAid PDF on Assertive Communication that may be helpful for planning this out.](https://www.therapistaid.com/worksheets/assertive-communication)\n\nUltimately, this is my opinion, and we don\u2019t need to agree! What matters is that you feel that you have some control and are respected by your therapist! \n\nAdditionally, I have found radical acceptance practices to be massively helpful in times of stress and in situations when I can\u2019t make changes immediately, but need to soothe myself.

If he doesn\u2019t feel comfortable speaking on a particular diagnosis in the moment, for example ARFID, he makes a point to do serious research on it before my next session and then we discuss further. It\u2019s a big reason why I trust him and he knows it.

All she had to do was a quick google search, hell she could have cracked open a recent copy of the DSM (which she should definitely have quick access to due to her profession).

I know this may feel like a very unhelpful question, and possibly even cruel depending on how upset you are, but how would you benefit if she validated what you said? What would be different?\n\nIf it\u2019s that you wouldn\u2019t feel sad, then this could be a concern. As much as it sucks, therapists are there to teach us to self-soothe and build habits of resiliency to be able to handle difficult times like this. Of course, this can only be done once you trust your therapist has good intentions, but after the rapport is built it is time for the hard work which does involve uncomfortable feelings. Emotional regulation is a muscle you need to develop to learn to react in ways where you don\u2019t perceive danger from someone\u2019s slight. I do understand that this may feel like a betrayal from your therapist. \n\nI hope you are eventually empowered to realize that you are in the driver\u2019s seat here. How you go about your relationship with your therapist, to overcoming food aversions, to self-soothing in difficult times. CBT (more thought change based) and DBT (more recognizing physical symptoms of distress and physically enacting change) practices can be wonderful here. \n\nAs much as it is difficult, the hard work is done in the dark, not the light. Trees don\u2019t grow tall and strong without wind, they would fall over without the pressure. This isn\u2019t the bullshit toxic positivity where you need emotionally difficult experiences to be healthy, but to recognize that how you react to situations determines how you continue on in life.",

Ultimately, gently, I do believe she is correct that the label is not as important unless it changes how she would treat you. She is not a dietician, so she can only help you with your feelings toward food. Many of these feelings are rooted in anxiety, so using anti-anxiety techniques is the answer here. \n\nDiagnoses can certainly feel validating and the help one can achieve by sharing in experiences with people with similar issues is beautiful. However, gently, I think some soul-searching here is valuable. Ask yourself what you would have wanted to go differently, make a plan, and advocate for yourself next session. [Here is a TherapistAid PDF on Assertive Communication that may be helpful for planning this out.](https://www.therapistaid.com/worksheets/assertive-communication)\n\nUltimately, this is my opinion, and we don\u2019t need to agree! What matters is that you feel that you have some control and are respected by your therapist! \n\nAdditionally, I have found radical acceptance practices to be massively helpful in times of stress and in situations when I can\u2019t make changes immediately, but need to soothe myself.

If she refuses, maybe tell her that you would like to change therapists!\nBest of luck and keep us posted!",

At least it was for me. I suggest googling something like \u201cgrounds for medical complaint to [state] psychiatric board\u201d. I don\u2019t know if criteria varies from state to state but that\u2019s what I did when I was trying to figure out if I really even had legitimate grounds to file a complaint with the medical board, but researching it like that also helped me figure out the right way to word things in the event I chose to formally file. \n\nI\u2019d have to do some research to figure out the correct terminology (which I\u2019m happy to do if you\u2019d like some help! feel free to dm me if so) but I feel like she definitely screwed up from a legal standpoint by basically saying \u201cthat disorder doesn\u2019t exists\u201d when it was quite literally in black and white in a book in the room with you when she said it. Maybe I\u2019m wrong but that\u2019s what kept popping up in my head as I read your post.

It is my understanding (in my state at least) mental health professionals are required by law to keep up with the latest DSM just like a school teacher or a nurse is required to complete a specific amount of continuing education courses throughout the year. The fact that your therapist was so quick to dismiss it by saying it doesn\u2019t exist is\u2026concerning. It would have been one thing had she said something like, \u201cI am not well versed in ARFID, let me look into it\u201d but that\u2019s not what happened. I don\u2019t expect my psychiatrist to know every single diagnosis listed in the DSM 5 off the top of his head but he has always been quick to humbly admit not being an expert on something in the moment and I respect him for it. If he doesn\u2019t feel comfortable speaking on a particular diagnosis in the moment, for example ARFID, he makes a point to do serious research on it before my next session and then we discuss further. It\u2019s a big reason why I trust him and he knows it. If it were me I\u2019d be considering filing a complaint against your therapist with your state\u2019s licensing board, but that\u2019s a very personal decision that only you can make. All she had to do was a quick google search, hell she could have cracked open a recent copy of the DSM (which she should definitely have quick access to due to her profession). A complaint of this nature wouldn\u2019t be enough for her to outright lose her license, but it may enough of a slap on the hand for her to realize she can\u2019t be talking out of her ass like that.",

Describe the food as neutral as possible, and keep doing that exercise until you don\u2019t need to do it anymore and keep exposing yourself to it as often as possible. I got super lucky with my therapist and my nutritionist cause trying to find help in Quebec was damn near impossible. They either didn\u2019t know about it, or couldn\u2019t help me cause I\u2019m an adult. It\u2019s frustrating. \n\nBut stay positive, try the exposure method, you got this!",

I\u2019m curious, if everything went your way, what would the next steps be for our discussions?\u201d\n\nShe should have accessed why this is important to you: do you want diagnosis validation and/or ARFID-based treatment help? Ultimately, gently, I do believe she is correct that the label is not as important unless it changes how she would treat you. She is not a dietician, so she can only help you with your feelings toward food. Many of these feelings are rooted in anxiety, so using anti-anxiety techniques is the answer here. \n\nDiagnoses can certainly feel validating and the help one can achieve by sharing in experiences with people with similar issues is beautiful. However, gently, I think some soul-searching here is valuable. Ask yourself what you would have wanted to go differently, make a plan, and advocate for yourself next session. [Here is a TherapistAid PDF on Assertive Communication that may be helpful for planning this out.](https://www.therapistaid.com/worksheets/assertive-communication)\n\nUltimately, this is my opinion, and we don\u2019t need to agree! What matters is that you feel that you have some control and are respected by your therapist! \n\nAdditionally, I have found radical acceptance practices to be massively helpful in times of stress and in situations when I can\u2019t make changes immediately, but need to soothe myself. [Here is a PDF worksheet on that if you are interested.](https://mhawv.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Worksheet-Practicing-Radical-Acceptance.pdf)\n\nLastly, you got this!

I know this may feel like a very unhelpful question, and possibly even cruel depending on how upset you are, but how would you benefit if she validated what you said? What would be different?\n\nIf it\u2019s that you wouldn\u2019t feel sad, then this could be a concern. As much as it sucks, therapists are there to teach us to self-soothe and build habits of resiliency to be able to handle difficult times like this. Of course, this can only be done once you trust your therapist has good intentions, but after the rapport is built it is time for the hard work which does involve uncomfortable feelings. Emotional regulation is a muscle you need to develop to learn to react in ways where you don\u2019t perceive danger from someone\u2019s slight. I do understand that this may feel like a betrayal from your therapist. \n\nI hope you are eventually empowered to realize that you are in the driver\u2019s seat here. How you go about your relationship with your therapist, to overcoming food aversions, to self-soothing in difficult times. CBT (more thought change based) and DBT (more recognizing physical symptoms of distress and physically enacting change) practices can be wonderful here. \n\nAs much as it is difficult, the hard work is done in the dark, not the light. Trees don\u2019t grow tall and strong without wind, they would fall over without the pressure. This isn\u2019t the bullshit toxic positivity where you need emotionally difficult experiences to be healthy, but to recognize that how you react to situations determines how you continue on in life.",
