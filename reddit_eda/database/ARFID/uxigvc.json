So I guess to answer the Q a lot of people don\u2019t like the actual taste of those foods - me included.\n\nI personally can\u2019t stand most veggies due to taste & texture so even with a sauce the act of chewing it makes me nauseous. And green foods are especially problematic to me. I 100% get that adding flavour to food helps a lot of people to cope with ARFID (and I definitely do this with salt / pepper) but my personal take is that I find adding cheese / sauces / oil to green veg to be counterproductive (for me) if my end goal is to try and be healthier. I\u2019d rather skip those veggies and take a multivitamin vs adding a lot of additional fat / calories in order to consume it.\n\nDisclaimer that I am not underweight and a lot of my safe foods are very carb / fat heavy already so my struggle is making better choices. I can cope with eating red-yellow-orange peppers / carrots / squash though as I find those to be sweet.",
