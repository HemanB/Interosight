  "selftext": "Tw: Body image issues mentioned, restricting \n\nSometimes when I tell people I struggle with food and I restrict unintentionally due to food repulsion, some people jump to the whole \"what did you eat today?\" Or \"you're body needs food.\" Same kind of thing they'd say to those who purposefully restrict if they're having body image issues and I have no idea how to react. Like... \"Yeah I know my body needs food...\" Or I'd tell them how what I ate and they go \"that's not enough.\" no duh. I don't have body image issues. I dont have body dysmorphia, I know I'm under eating. I literally cannot help it and people doing these weird \"check ins\" are so unhelpful and just put more pressure on me. It's only happened a handful of times but each time it leaves me feeling really uncomfortable. On the other end of the spectrum once people find out I don't have body image issues they just go \"oh... So eat?\" It just shows a severe lack of understanding and I find people stop trying to understand when they realize it's not body image related, which honestly is better than unhelpful comments and \"encouragement.\" Just something I've noticed here and there. 80% of the people in my life are pretty okay just some odd comments here and there.\n\n\nEdit: I forgot about Reddit for a couple days, my bad. It was really eye opening to hear everyone's stories especially those that have been mistreated in the medical system and treatments centers. That's on a whole other level of messed up and I'm so sorry that anybody has ever had to experience that. \n\nI also wanted to clarify that this post was not meant to be bashing Anorexia or implying that it's okay to say these kinds of things to people with anorexia. It was just a frustration that I was having with people who were making assumptions with what I was struggling with and then saying very unhelpful things on top of that assumption. It's not okay to say these things to anybody with any type of eating disorder. \n\n",

I went to treatment after years of fluctuating up and down 30 pounds. It kept getting worse and worse so I had no choice. But they confused my autism for anorexia and that fucked me up for a loooooong time :) being in nonstop therapy about body image honestly created trauma around weight for me (they would hide our weights from us) when all I wanted to know is how much was an adult me supposed to weigh \ud83d\ude2d the false diagnosis led to me being on the wrong anxiety medication for months resulting in a major depressive and burnout episode. In treatment, they taught me how to be a \u201cnormal eater\u201d - well, I cannot possibly live up to those standards. So I have beat myself  up every single day for the past year that even the best I have ever done was called \u201cdisordered\u201d - Find a dietician who understand neurodivergence.
