It honestly hit me harder then I thought. Maybe I\u2019m just overly sensitive but I felt like crying reading through hundreds of comments with people saying \u2018Back in the 70s you ate what you were given\u2019 and \u2018He won\u2019t starve stop giving in to this!\u2019 \u2018You wouldn\u2019t hear this in a 3rd world country\u2019, \u2018Just starve him and he\u2019ll eat!\u2019. \u2018It\u2019s funny how they\u2019ll eat McDonalds and fast foods\u2019. \n\nDo they realise that people with ARFID WILL starve possibly to death if not given safe foods? That McDonalds he is getting is literally keeping his heart beating. I feel like crying and I\u2019m so angry about this. :( ",

With the ability to comment on anything, we wind up with a sea of crappy and unkind thoughts from people all over the world mashing up their personal experiences and knowledge with what little information has been shared in whatever the content was. It's just messy, and a newish part of social engagement that has yet to be refined. Remember that we're still in the extremely early age of online communities and honing in on what is respectful and appropriate is a bit of a game right now.
