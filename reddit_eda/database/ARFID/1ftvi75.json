  "selftext": "23F I\u2019ve been in intensive inpatient care for ARFID twice as an adult. I\u2019m currently on stint #2 and it\u2019s such a shit show not having my safe foods which are ethnic foods. I wish there were ARFID specific clinics. I feel hopeless here but I\u2019m trying to modify things best I can with the help of the care team. There are other adolescents here with ARFID but we don\u2019t interact due to the age difference. Has anyone else gone through treatment alone? Without any ARFID counterparts?\n\nHonestly just want to gain weight again and I consume most of my calories via Boost supplements because again my safe foods are ethnic and I only like it the way my mom makes it. \n\nBeen a picky eater my whole life but only got diagnosed when I went to college and realized my mom had been accommodating to my odd dietary choices my whole life. She normalized everything and never made me feel less than for deconstruction of food, not having foods touch each other, or blending/hiding of vegetables. \n\nShoutout to parents who acknowledge kids who have ARFID. You guys do a lot of heavy lifting. Would\u2019ve been diagnosed sooner if my mom didn\u2019t jumps through hoops to keep my weight normal. She always held hope I would outgrow this but here we are. She\u2019s also a first gen immigrant so she gets a lot of flack in our community for not beating me into submission as a child. \n",

I\u2019ve been to three different treatment centers and they all treated arfid, but it wasn\u2019t their main disorder they treat. The last one I went to only allowed patients one drink of water at meals. I literally boosted for all meals (even breakfast) because there is no way I could finish a meal without water even if I liked the food. And they never explained to me the reason why were only allowed one drink of water at meals. My dietician at the center told me to literally play with my food (like a child) because I got bored eating. Mind you I was 18 at the time. Part of it is boredom, part of it is literally not being able to eat foods I don\u2019t like without water. And they wondered why I wouldn\u2019t drink enough water. I mostly drink water at meals and snacks. And it\u2019s not like I was purposely restricting, I just didn\u2019t like drinking water outside of meals or snacks.",

Where I\u2019m at they don\u2019t let you use tissues during meals and i have sensory issues. When stuff is on my fingers it\u2019s so hard to continue eating other things due to \u201ccontamination\u201d. I also don\u2019t like my food touching. Everyday here is a visual, and olfactory nightmare. The only thing bringing me joy are the other patients who are so supportive and funny. I\u2019m not happy to be here but I\u2019m happy I\u2019m here with them.",

They\u2019ve been super supportive and assured me that they\u2019re focused on their on plate. It\u2019s hard though when you\u2019ve been ridiculed for odd eating habits. I constantly feel ashamed.
