  "selftext": "Undiagnosed, if I don't have ARFID it's gotta be some other disordered eating. It's been a constant battle my whole effing life.\n\nyet people who don't watch me try to force myself to eat will have the audacity to tell me to \"just eat\"\n\nYou think I don't try? Just to end up gagging on food that I usually like, making me even more turned off to eating for longer. \n\nI can put the food in my mouth, chew it, but if I don't want it, swallowing is almost impossible\n\nI want to eat, I want to be easy. \n\nI'm so tired",

      "body": "My word do I get this, I was diagnosed about 4 months ago now (I'm not sure, time boogles me) and this is beyond relatable but if you're struggling keep doing what you're doing basically like chewing a food you don't like then spitting it out or try (if you haven't already) cooking it in different ways to try it that way... By doing that sort of thing you are trying and succeeding, you probably won't realise it but these small wins of even having the food in your mouth are one of the best ways to improve because its feels less immense then sitting there saying \"I am going to eat this\" or \"just eat food\" because that's not realistic, setting smaller simple targets that you think you can mange and if you can't, it's okay, try something else. Whatever you do, don't put yourself down and don't listen to people who don't understand, go at your own pace and you can do it! \n\n\"just eat\" is a ludicrous thing to say to someone with any eating problem/disorder so ethier explain to them or just tell them to (excuse my French) bugger off.",

The most frustrating thing ever is when I\u2019m struggling to eat and a family member or friend says, \u201cur so picky omg just eat.\u201d\nNo one really understands how different ARFID is than just simple picky eating unless it\u2019s experienced. By far the most difficult thing I\u2019ve ever faced in my life. Eating is a chore, and I know it shouldn\u2019t be. I stare at my food until I have a pit in my stomach and I become all choked up and ready to start crying. And when I finally take a bite, I sit and chew and chew and chew and chew until it turns to mush. Swallowing is the most difficult part. But as time goes on it gets easier. There are still some extremely difficult and draining days, but the easier days feel so rewarding. I\u2019ve finally made a breakthrough and made it into the minimum range of my goal weight!
