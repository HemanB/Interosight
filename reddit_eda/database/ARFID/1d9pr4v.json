  "selftext": "I can eat anything except those. I absolutely hate and gag everytime I eat them. I\u2019m a 21 year old dude btw.\n\nBut I ABSOLUTELY  need fiber in my diet , especially, because if not I have horrible bathroom, skin problems, and depression. So for my replacement of fruits and veg I take Metamucil or any psyllium husk powder (make sure I hit 25g+ fiber so 3 tbsp) and a multivitamin, and a magnesium supplement because why not, and have never felt better. I also exercise a lot.\n\nThe best part is, I feel like it actually helps as a replacement and I can be CONSISTENT with it. \n\nAnyone do the same?\n",
