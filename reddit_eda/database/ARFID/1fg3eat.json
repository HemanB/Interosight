My experience trying things I'm not sure if I'm going to like always go better when I do the following things, \n\n- Have a backup safe food ready to go if I'm hungry\n- Be kind and gentle with myself\n- Parent myself in the moment the way I would parent a child if they had ARFID (It's ok you don't have to eat it all, trying things is good but if you don't like it, that's ok too, I'm still going to love you either way and you learned something new about yourself today etc.)\n- Have someone to talk to or a journal to put my feelings in so I can experience my feelings, feel my feelings, and actually express them so I can destress and be less upset if there's another food I can't eat. \n\nI'm so proud of you OP for trying new foods. If you like them, I'm so happy for you! If you don't, you learned something new about yourself, you're still an amazing person, you're still worthy of love, and you can keep trying things in the future no pressure! \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\n\nEdit to add, you've inspired me to FINALLY try the spaghetti sauce my friend made me. Now I just need to plan it for tomorrow so I can come at it from a good mental place so I don't cry too much if I'm not a fan lol.",

I put the chocolate powder in a blender with ice and peanut butter. It hid what powderyness it had pretty well. Oh, I also used almond milk or oat milk personally. Whatever works for you is fine\n\nAlso I did 1.5 times powder or less milk and ice. I liked it to be a bit more chocolatey but if you want you can add chocolate syrup to make it palatable. I found I only needed like half a tbsp of peanut butter",
