  "selftext": "Often people act like I\u2019m missing out on so much because I don\u2019t eat meat, really flavourful things, or foods with weird textures, which eliminates most \u201cmeals.\u201d But to be honest, I like the foods that I eat. They taste good to me and I enjoy them. I have no desire to force myself to eat something that I know I won\u2019t like. I would rather politely decline food than gag at a dinner party. I would much rather snack on my safe foods throughout the day than eat a giant meal and feel sick afterwards.\n\nThere\u2019s such an emphasis on \u201cgetting over\u201d eating disorders. Everyone wants me to change so that I can experience more foods, but the truth is, I don\u2019t want to. My issues are sensory so I\u2019m confident in knowing what I can and can\u2019t eat. If something has a texture that I know will bother me, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to put myself through that for the \u201cexperience.\u201d I\u2019m perfectly happy to try a new combination of safe foods, or a new food that is similar to my safe foods, or even something totally different, so long as I make the choice myself and I\u2019m not pressured into it. \n\nA lot of people view this as me \u201cgiving up on recovery,\u201d but I don\u2019t see it that way at all. I have enough foods that I like and I take vitamins to stay healthy. I\u2019m not the embodiment of health, but what 21 year old is? I just want to live my life, eating food that I like, when I like, without people making comments about my food or my body. \n\nObviously this doesn\u2019t apply to anyone and I don\u2019t want to discourage others from expanding their diet or trying new things. The point is that what you eat is your own choice!",

      "body": "There's a misconception that ARFID is mostly psychological and I believed it myslef too for most of my life. This is why people still think that it can be \"cured\" the same way you'd help people out of other more famous EDs I won't name, and this is exactly why I never dare mentioning it as an ED next to people. I know for sure that if I say it's an ED they will think I'm anorexic and have a few hollywood blockbusters running through their minds.",

      "body": "I remind people what I could be reverting to and how much progress I have actually made. \nOnce you validate yourself out loud to people you might find you start to feel more empowered. \n\nWhen people treat me similar to how you have described it is minimizing my real efforts. You don\u2019t have to move so fast that others see it as progress. Progress is slow and ARFID can\u2019t be \u201ccured\u201d only managed. \n\nI actually cut people out of my life for good who expected immediate change from me in multiple areas of my life. \n\nIt\u2019s a lengthy process and no one should dictate it. If you are currently healthier than you were, this is a step forward. You can take breaks but acknowledge that you have not regressed. \nIf you have regressed, you will know where to focus because you know yourself best. \n\nI do worry about people posting here for validation as a soft-core place to self-check because this sub is heavily focused on continuous improvement, but I like to give people the benefit of the doubt at the same time because it is tough receiving this kind of constant nagging and criticism from people who don\u2019t get it.",

It doesn't expect the child to make leaps and bounds in what they can tolerate - the goal is to target one food at a time, starting with the most minute exposure (pea sized amount on their plate, they don't even need to touch it), with veeery gradual increases in exposure (touch it with fork, touch with finger, lift it, touch to lips, taste it, put it in mouth/chew once/spit, chew thoroughly and spit, then finally eat a pea sized amount). I think there's also steps where you just play with food, with zero pressure to eat it. I'd link to a page on it, but I can't remember the exact name of the therapy - and of course, with broad searches, it comes up with references to \"picky eating.\" \ud83d\ude44",
