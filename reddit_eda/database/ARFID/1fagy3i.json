  "title": "Feeling really uneasy since the troll was exposed\u2013 Discussion",
  "selftext": "I've been feeling really uneasy and uncomfortable about the posts and comments made on this sub ever since the post regarding the troll was made yesterday. Now, every post and comment I see made by people of low account age/karma, I am skeptical. I don't like having to double check or doubt the validity of stories/comments shared. I don't like the idea of someone making hurtful comments toward people who struggle how I do, about an already difficult topic for us to discuss.\n\nTheir post on confessions was saying how because of their past with food insecurity, they have since started to hate and attack people with ARFID. It took me a while to understand the connection, probably because of my autism. But what I've concluded is I think what the troll believes is\u2013 it's almost as people with ARFID are *choosing* to \"waste\" food and be \"ungrateful\" for the food given to us. Essentially, blaming his past with food insecurity on those with this eating disorder. I know this is already a very common sentiment we often receive from outside sources whenever our disordered eating is noticed by ignorant people. I find it's especially disheartening that this has come to enter our safe space. \n\nIt's like when people blame the customer for not tipping the employee, when the bad guy is actually the company not paying the employee a livable wage. It's like when people blame global scale pollution on individuals, instead of realizing it's the businesses who are most responsible. People with ARFID are not responsible for food shortages, food scarcity/insecurity, world hunger or wasted food on a global scale. The businesses who are choosing to throw away massive amounts of food instead of giving them to those in need are responsible. The governments not funding infrastructures to alleviate world hunger are responsible. \n\nI messaged the mods to hopefully try and apply some things to deter trolls from entering this community any longer, although it might not work. If you have any ideas, I'd recommend sending it to the mods team. It's just exhausting seeing that our safe space is being tarnished by someone who thinks we're responsible for the disorder we have no control over. The mods responded to me saying they are discussing it as they are also concerned about the trolling.\n\nAnyway, I guess I wanted to start a conversation about it with you all, since I'm not sure what to do with these feelings of unease, or how we can move forward without this troll getting what they want.

For as long as I can remember I\u2019ve dealt with ARFID including before my family dealt with food insecurity so when having food was an issue it was essential that the food getting bought was food I was 100% going to eat. Also meant less food in general but bc I had ARFID I didn\u2019t like to eat much anyway. I didn\u2019t even realize the amount I was eating was much less than other kids my age until I had dinner at a friend\u2019s house (which was mostly food I couldn\u2019t eat anyway). \n\nIt\u2019s awful that there are people who have also dealt with food insecurity who now take it out on people with ARFID or other eating disorders. Like I would not be this way by choice! I really wish I could eat a normal variety of foods, I wish I had a normal appetite too. So much bonding is done through sharing meals and I often can\u2019t take part or if I do I will stand out due to what I choose to eat or how much. Sometimes coworkers bring something to share and I feel bad for saying no thank you bc sometimes it does disappoint the coworker sharing. At least they don\u2019t attack me for declining by calling me ungrateful or wasteful",

So where is the logic of trolling that?\n\nIf \"food insecurity\" made them so angry to see people have issues with food, then shouldn't they be happy? People with ARFID eat\u00a0*less*\u00a0than people without it. That means more food for everyone else, lessening said insecurity. So what is there to be upset about? Why doesn't that anger extend to anorexics and bulimics? So it's okay to refuse to eat as long as it's based only on fear of gaining weight? It's okay to binge eat huge amounts of food and then purge it?\u00a0*That's*\u00a0less offensive than someone saying \"I have a sensory issue that negatively impacts my diet\"? Where's the logic?\n\nAnd if they really suffered food insecurity and get upset when other people... don't suffer? Eat but fail to meet the troll's specific approved diet that they never clued anyone into? I don't even know. But if that's their problem, maybe they should be much more invested in corporate food waste and the capitalists who encourage things like dumping bleach on top of one-day-expired food in a dumpster, so no one else can have it. That's a logical response to being passionate about ending food insecurity.\n\nThat person is a liar who's so ashamed of their own trolling that they feel the need to make up a story about food scarcity to justify what they're doing on an anonymous forum. They can't just admit that they enjoy being a bully and an asshole who's randomly chosen a small population of people with a clinical disorder -- they\u00a0*have*\u00a0to spin a yarn to make themselves look better, even though no one knows who they are and there aren't real repercussions to their shitty behavior, because their own guilt gnaws at them when they admit they don't actually have a reason to be such a bad person.\n\nKarma's a relaxing thought\\~",

I know when I go to the store later today not everybody else there may live by the same moral values that I do, somebody may be shoplifting. The store has \"security\", but that doesn't necessarily mean that they're going to catch that.\u00a0 My best friend lives in a great neighborhood, she wasn't safe in her own home because her husband was an abuser who only showed his true colors after marriage. Sometimes bad folks can get into very secure places. It's always good to try to have a lot of things in place that make your home or your neighborhood, your relationships, or even where you go online safer. And it's good to check to see if there's something more that can be done when something happens. Seeing trolling online is hard because it reminds us of the real life intolerance in this world, the ignorance, and the hate. It may take a little while for that feeling of unease to go away, for me a little bit of self care helps. Doing something fun with people I love, especially if it involves nature, can remind me of the beauty in this world. Knowing that there's other people out there in this community that feel deeply and want the world to be better helps me personally. Hopefully hearing from this mama, helps you to know you're not alone and helps with that uneasy feeling a bit. Treat yourself well today! \ud83d\ude0a",

      "body": "I also felt that way when I found out. It\u2019s just another person who doesn\u2019t understand and takes it out on us. And it\u2019s even worse because they are using their trauma to hurt others. It makes me feel very uncomfortable and disgusted that someone could actively come here with the sole purpose of reading our posts or comments (including my own) where we are being extremely vulnerable with our struggles and they get happy over it and then actively enjoy to bullying us, especially someone who keeps getting banned and making new accounts to continue to enjoy laughing at our struggles and bully us.\n\nThey just don\u2019t get that even in times when there is food insecurity or people are starving, that doesn\u2019t change our disorder. I know I would be very ill, put on a feeding tube, or die if I was experiencing food insecurity or in an area with starvation. And people who have this disorder, including people in this sub, actually are or have previously been food insecure which sometimes even exacerbates the disorder. There are also people with this disorder in areas that have starvation. The disorder doesn\u2019t just go away because of lack of food.\n\nBut what\u2019s the most upsetting for me is that I literally hate food waste and I always feel so bad when I throw food away (and I also know a lot of others who have this disorder do as well). I\u2019ve always felt that way, but I try to remind myself that food insecurity is way bigger than me, not that I can\u2019t help or advocate to fix it, but changing the entire system isn\u2019t something I can do. It\u2019s also been something I struggled with since I\u2019ve started exposure therapy. In order to try new foods, there becomes a lot of stuff that you put to your lips/bite that you don\u2019t like at all or that take many, many tries to eventually be able to eat, and that means throwing out a lot of food. My food therapist tells me that it\u2019s not wasted if it helps me to treat my ARFID, and I try to remember that too.\n\nIt\u2019s like I\u2019m sorry you went through that trauma, but I didn\u2019t cause your food insecurity because I don\u2019t eat enough or sometimes throw parts of food out that I don\u2019t like and didn\u2019t eat (sometimes even food that I feel forced into \u201ceating\u201d because people can\u2019t take no for an answer), so don\u2019t take it out on me and somehow feel justified and vindicated when you really just actively enjoy stalking, harassing, and bullying people with eating disorders. Take it up with the government and/or entities that can actually make a significant change, donate to and/or join causes and movements, buy products that are sustainable (just one example are those companies that sell \u201cugly\u201d foods that are usually tossed instead of being put in stores) or products that use parts of foods that don\u2019t usually get used, advocate, lobby, use food products you buy in the most ways you possibly can, use apps that let you order the leftovers at food establishments at a reduced price, start a movement of your own, volunteer and/or donate at a food kitchen and/or food pantry, (if possible) try to get food establishments in your area connected to food kitchens and/or food pantries so they can give away their leftover food, (if possible) get a job at a place that helps the food insecure, (if possible) learn how to cook sustainably and teach others, (if possible) grow food yourself and sell it at an affordable price or donate it. Do literally anything else other than enjoy bullying strangers struggling with an eating disorder who literally did nothing to you and which literally does nothing to actually address or fix the problem and only hurts people in the process. But no, all that other stuff is too hard and takes time and effort, it\u2019s much easier to just sit behind a screen, on an anonymous website no less, and bully people.\n\nIt\u2019s just hurtful to feel shamed for something I already feel shameful about, which is a constant battle we endure with so many aspects of this disorder and people who feel justified to ridicule us. It\u2019s just another example in the millions of others, but it always hurts the same.",

So it was refreshing to see that total strangers agree that the trolling behavior directed at people with a medical condition is reprehensible. That gives me some hope.",
