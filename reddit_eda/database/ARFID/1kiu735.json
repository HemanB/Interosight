  "selftext": "I was at the doctors office today, possible bacterial stomach infection. There was the doctor and his supervisor. The main doctor was trying to see if cutting out foods might help me.\n\nThe supervisor said, \"No... If she has ARFID, it's not a good idea to restrict her food any further.\" \n\nI don't know why, but I felt so validated that she took ARFID seriously ",
