Perfect food for ARFID.\n\nThis was one of the foods I used to get my kids out of their ARFID spirals after my contentious divorce with their late other parent.\n\nEdit- the best foods to start with imo are salmon rolls (no veg), cucumber rolls, and shrimp and veggie tempura. Try the sauces a little bit at a time.  Then the next one to try is chicken teriyaki (the kebabs not the sushi - I forget the name! Tempanyaki maybe?) followed by unagi rolls (don't ask what they are until after you try them! Try in a sushiya so they're warm).",
