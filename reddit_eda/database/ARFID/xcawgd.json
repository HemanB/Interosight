      "body": "\u201cLunch will be provided\u201d has always been my worst nightmare especially since starting my career. Luncheons are major networking opportunities but not eating makes me come across as so weird and therefore ends up making networking harder. Navigating food in the workplace has truly been a nightmare. It\u2019s been the one biggest motivation for me to really work hard on treatment. It\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t want to get better before but with how much food has become a major part of my professional life it\u2019s not become a requirement for me to at least try and be able to eat a few more basic foods.\n\nSince starting my career I can now choke down onions, all types of peppers, and I can handle cold meat (I\u2019m a big proponent of all meat should be eaten warm not cold but at least I can eat a ham and cheese sandwich now despite not particularly enjoying it). I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be able to *enjoy* these types of foods but I\u2019m proud of the fact I can at least force myself to eat a few things that commonly popped up as problems for me in my life. Luckily at my current job my boss is super chill and knows to get me a menu well ahead of time so I can mentally prepare and figure something out.",
