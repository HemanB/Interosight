  "selftext": "It's something I've always struggled with whenever I'm in a situation where I'm encouraged to try a new food or someone questions my eating habits, so I have to inform them of my ARFID in order to get out of it. I used to say \"I'm just a really picky eater\" but that tends to lead to me minimising it, people not taking it seriously, and teasing me about it. I find saying \"I have an eating disorder\" can be a bit too abrupt and people assume that it's to do with body image like anorexia or bulimia, which I don't have, and then they either get uncomfortable or ask more questions. Recently I've said \"I have an eating disorder which makes me a really picky eater\" but that doesn't quite encompass the many other issues like fear of trying new foods, sensory issues, and the general complexity and big impact of it, so that can minimise it too.\n\nDoes anyone have like a concise way to make people understand but not have them ask more questions? Something quick to say to people I don't know well so I can get out of trying a new food, going to a restaurant I don't know, getting out of a bad sensory/smell environment, etc. I just don't want to have to explain all of ARFID every single time lol, but I also have social anxiety so it'd be nice to have a sort of script or sentence ready :) thanks!",

Some people even sympathise and try to offer me food choices I can eat. I do elaborate a bit more when people are genuinely curious and open-minded and ask questions, but still try to keep it quite \"neutral\" Only friends and family know how much of a struggle it is, other people just get the version \"this is how my body works, just like the fact that my eyes need glasses, etc. It's an inconvience for me and you can help me by being considerate, thanks!\" In a genuine tone ofcourse.

I think you could say less than that, and I don't like having to over explain my reasoning for not eating what everyone else is eating. Obviously yes it is easier not to have to ask about ingredients but I think explanations like that lead to more questions. \n\n\"I have a medical condition, so it's safer for me to bring my own food.\" There, how's that? Sorry for any confusion, I did not mean allergies are the only excuse people should use, regardless of the truth.\n\nIt's tiring enough explaining arfid to other people but honestly this is just discouraging coming from a support group. I don't feel like anyone was giving me the benefit of the doubt here, in a conversation about people asking intrusive questions and making people uncomfortable about dietary restrictions.
