  "selftext": "Life would be so much more fun and so much easier. I envy those people. The kind that, when asked what they don't like, say that they can't think of anything.\n\nIt's impossible to imagine what it's like. I guess it's just like they can't understand what it's like to have arfid. It's isolating, embarrassing, humiliating. I worry for my health. I feel hunger constantly when my safe foods aren't safe anymore. There is nothing about arfid that's fun. You disappoint the people around you when you can't try that special food they slaved over. People get to be mean to you because for some reason they think not being able to eat is an attention thing. Like, ummm, give it a shot and see how people treat you. It's awesome. /s\n\nI hope we have multiple lives and that maybe in another life I can eat normally....",

I'll try that!\"\n\nWhen i watch cooking shows or Gordon Ramsey videos, I'm just lost watching all these different ingredients, and all i can think is \"hate that, hate that, don't like that, ew that texture looks gross\"",

      "body": "Yes, my main motivation to get better is freedom and weight loss. For years ive wanted to lose weight, I'm not fat by any standard, I've just always at at the top of a healthy bmi, but because i dont have muscle I think I am probably low level obese. And at my heaviest i was only carrying around 10 kilos extra, wich isnt too obscene. But now im hitting the gym 5 times a week minimum and i have been for 2 months now, and i have failed to lose weight, i see all these 1 to 2 month transformations and people lose crazy weight, but i have found it impossible. But ive found out the hard way that you really cant out exercise a trash diet. The only time i did lose weight was over an 8 week holiday when i rode my bike for almost 4 hours a day, and obviously all the weight returned because that's not sustainable.\n\nOn top of that, i would love to try new foods, eat with friends instead of having to go and get food when im with them that i can eat. Maybe i can tour some local winerys and not have to avoid the nibbles, and im going into business, where networking is key, and i can only imagine how much more difficult not being able to eat at events is going to become.\n\nI feel your pain.",
