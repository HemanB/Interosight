  "selftext": "I recovered 100% from ARFID earlier this year, in August. Today, I went to a restaurant and realized something while making my plate. It consisted of sweet potato, chickpea, grilled fish, pepper jam and a hard boiled egg. Two years ago, I wasn't able to eat any of these things. My plate weighed 334 grams, when it would usually weigh less than 250.\n\nI almost cried after realizing this. I made such major strides. I can't believe how far I went. I feel awesome.",

The strategies we used was focusing on understanding the origins of my ARFID and why exactly I couldn't eat certain things (was it the smell? The texture? Taste? A bad memory with it?).\n\nMaybe something similar can work for her. Other ARFID patients experience positive effects from other types of therapies, like hypnotherapy or CBT - AR (a type of CBT developed specifically to treat ARFID), so there is more than one way to attack it. \n\nI wish all the best to you and your daughter; she is a fighter and I'm sure she will recover!",
