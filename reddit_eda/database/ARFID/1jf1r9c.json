  "selftext": "I've had issues with food for as long as I can remember. Im autistic and textures are meh. Growing up the dinnertable was my personal nightmare. Ive had so many fights, fits, and straight up abuse thrown at me for struggling to eat certain foods. I stumbled upon the term ARFID only a few months ago and my god...\n\nI didnt know there was a word for this, or a community, or support. If only younger me had known I wasnt alone with this.\n\nDid anyone else have a similar eureka moment? \n\n",

I am still going through an identity crisis because my entire life, I thought I was alone and just \u201cpicky\u201d or \u201cweird\u201d for my food choices and habits. Having a name to a disorder you\u2019ve had your entire life is mind boggling. The more I learn about ARFID, the more I want to recover because safe foods are feeling boring and I am tired of the criticism from friends and family. And I need to do it for my health. \n\nI am AuDHD. I\u2019ve been seeing a dietitian since the fall of last year. I feel like I have made little to no progress since then, but I have to remember, this is 25 years of limited diets we are trying to recover from. Finding new foods to eat is scary, especially when textures and tastes and temperatures are weird to us.\n\nSince I haven\u2019t seen progress really, I just started going to an adult ARFID support group. I just hope this is what jump starts my recovery. Fingers crossed.",

This is also when I asked if maybe I might be autistic, and she said she can\u2019t say, but it can\u2019t hurt to get tested (turns out I am autistic!). ARFID and autism have a high comorbidity rate (existing together).\n\nI always thought I was just a picky eater. Nope. I have a real psychological condition. It\u2019s a relief. Now, it\u2019s a matter of getting treatment for it.\n\nThe psychologist that diagnosed me with autism offers hypnosis for potential ARFID treatment. I aim to begin this later this year (I have a balance I want to pay down with the provider first).",
