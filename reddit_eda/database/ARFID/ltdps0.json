There are many regions throughout Italy with very different dishes, that having nothing to do with fruit sauce and cultured cow tit juice on boiled wheat dust paste strands. However, I do love pasta and tomato sauce with cheese, I am pretty sure Florence is the region where most of the American style Italian food came from.",
