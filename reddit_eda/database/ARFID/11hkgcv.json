  "title": "ARFID representation in Abbott Elementary",
  "selftext": "Do any of you watch Abbott Elementary? I just started and I think one of the characters was written to have ARFID! There was an episode when the characters were having a pizza contest and Gregory (who may have ARFID) tried to hide the fact that he doesn\u2019t like pizza. After prodding from his co workers, he reveals he doesn\u2019t like pizza as well as most foods, and has a list of about five foods he can eat. At one point he says \u201cI was born like this!\u201d And l immediately jumped up in my seat as I\u2019ve never seen a character with ARFID in the media. They didn\u2019t specifically say he has ARFID, but anyone from this community could relate to him. He\u2019s my favorite character now.",
