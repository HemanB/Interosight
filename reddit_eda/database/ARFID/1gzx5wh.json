In addition, it makes me especially curious about how a court may approach a lawsuit involving ARFID in general.",

Thanks for the input, (mom/dad optional)\u201d\n\nDepending on the environment, being overly sweet and apologetic to an extreme can help make them seem even more unreasonable (if that is a well-respected coworker or boss), being a bit snarky is passable and can be excused as \u201cI thought it was funny and meant as a joke\u201d bc it\u2019s so rude and out of pocket. If they are an employee at the same level, asking the boss if it there are \u201cappropriate\u201d foods so as not to offend may accomplish similar \u201cI\u2019m sorry, tf did they say/do\u201d reaction.\nFor non-confrontational people who would rather not (I get it but maybe try to work on self-advocacy in general, you don\u2019t deserve this ever): hiding the \u201cchildish\u201d foods in a bag/similar, maybe with someone else\u2019s name on it (if others do that/give permission) and some way of telling if someone opens it (strong tape with a paper bag that can\u2019t be opened without ripping) just to make sure they\u2019re not searching stuff without consent, which is not only unethical but very illegal (even for law enforcement, let alone the general public). In case they do, you need to make it known to at least coworkers, if you don\u2019t take the issue up with a boss, I\u2019m sure others will simply bc that\u2019s a huge invasion and who knows what else they\u2019re searching when others let down their guard.\n\nIt\u2019s asinine people take such an issue with it to be upset privately, but going out of their way to make such a public statement, to me, reads as such a level of entitlement and cruelty. It\u2019s an obvious attempt to shame/humiliate someone for literally nothing, tying two unrelated things (food with age/maturity) to, what, force someone to withdraw and submit, encouraging a super toxic work environment for everyone?\nIt may seem small and petty, but it\u2019s a huge red flag for how that person sees those around them.",

I can see how it\u2019s intimidating and I admit I would probably feel the same as you. \n\nI\u2019m shocked this is even a thing or that someone had the audacity to type it up, print it out, walk over to the fridge, and actually attach this. \n\nNow what I\u2019m trying to say to you OP is that, while I acknowledge ARFID as a very real and impactful thing it shouldn\u2019t matter here as this is straight up bullying. It\u2019s a \u201cbonus\u201d maybe, but you don\u2019t need a disability to eat kids cuisine (or anything else you want.) and you don\u2019t need your disability to justify your workplace lunch. Especially if there\u2019s no policy against it. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what your employee handbook says about things like lunch or workplace harassment but be sure you know the \u201crules\u201d if you decide to bring this up to anyone, especially HR. \n\nAnd OP, this person is childish, not you. Your bully is ignorant and small minded. \n\nRespectfully, it really isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s business that you deal with ARFID. And that\u2019s all my point really is. \n\nPeople like the bully just want to be bullies. They\u2019ll find anything. \u201cThis isn\u2019t Italy! Stop bringing personal pizzas!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not a bird! This isn\u2019t an aviary! You\u2019re not out on a nature hike! Stop bringing trailmix!\u201d Whatever you get it. It could be anything. \n\nreally OP I care that you\u2019re okay. I know this isn\u2019t something great to experience, but try your best not to let it get you down. I understand that ARFID may be the reason *you* eat this every day, but it isn\u2019t the reason you got the note. You got the note because its author is a jerk.",
