  "selftext": "My weird/strange/bizarre diet has always been commented on for as long as I could remember. Just now I was eating some baked beans because it's quick, easy, and something I can always tolerate. My partner came by as I was eating and sat down to watch me and comment on my weird diet and how *~cute~* he thinks it is. I reminded him again to please not comment on my eating, or at least while I am in the act of eating. This is why I prefer to eat in complete privacy.",

When I eat, I'm uncomfortable being around others because I'm always trying to calm myself down while eating (verbally telling myself that I'm okay or that I'm doing good and to keep going) since I get really anxious when I eat. If I'm around people, they look at me weird or watch me which I hate because I know they're judging me. I've gotten used to eating in my room or just completely by myself because I hate their stares and as you said, unnecessary commentary. I get what I'm doing isn't normal but at least I'm eating.",

I'm not the neatest eater, especially with sauce, so I don't want to get food on my shirt or face, which I hate when nobody will tell me about.",

My fianc\u00e9 has listened very intently to my struggles with food and has always respected when I tell him certain things make me uncomfortable or embarrassed. I really recommend you have a conversation with him about this and if he doesn\u2019t listen or respect it, you need to recognize that. If he won\u2019t respect you now, he\u2019s not going to in the future, and do you really want a family with a man who cannot respect your feelings?",

I don\u2019t even want to check my weight now that I\u2019m back home; I\u2019d finally gained like five pounds and I don\u2019t wanna see that lost, but at least my appetite has actually bounced back now that I\u2019m home. \n\nIt\u2019s ridiculous; the fact that I have such a low desire for food, and most peoples\u2019 inability to either understand or not care about that means I probably end up spending *more* time dealing with it than normal people. If this was a conversation about baseball, no one would care!!!",
