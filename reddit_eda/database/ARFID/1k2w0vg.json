  "selftext": "I was scrolling on insta reels and saw this shit, really pissed me off and I need to take yall down with me, lmao\n\nWhat if the type of person they\u2019re referring to in the post has arfid? They sound like that\u2019s what they\u2019re describing. I guarantee their struggles are much more difficult then \u201cwaaaa!!! I can\u2019t go to this restaurant because my friend has a literal eating disorder!!! This affects me somehow more than it affects them!!!\u201d Like, if you wanna go there so bad, next time, just, like, don\u2019t bring them? It\u2019s not that hard. \n\nI will say, I go to restaurants with my friends, and usually just don\u2019t eat anything if they don\u2019t have options for me, but still, what?\n\nAlso, the \u201cyour girlfriend\u2019s parents hate having you over\u201d thing is so mean?? Yeah, dude, I know they do. That\u2019s like, honestly the main reason I\u2019m scared to get a boyfriend \ud83d\ude2d my family members who know about it always stare me down during dinner, because I end up just making my own meal. I feel so rude, and I hate family dinners just in general.  Also, a real friend wouldn\u2019t care if you had an ED, they would support you and help you overcome it.\n\nBut my main thing with this is, like, why do they give a shit? It affects the person with the actual issue more than it affects you. Oh, your friend has an eating disorder that can genuinely really affect your health and social situations, and you think it\u2019s annoying to care for them? Waa waa, cry about it.\n\nSorry, I\u2019m usually not this mean, but it really pmo \ud83d\ude2d\n\n\nAlso, I left a comment saying \u201cwhat if they had Arfid? And two people replied \u201cthat\u2019s not a real disease!\u201d So, glad to see how intelligent people are on Instagram reels \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude4f",

I'm tired of being a burden to others over stuff I can't control, it's the same as my family thinking depression is sadness. I never bother going to places with other people because I know I won't be able to eat anything, and bringing food they think is rude though, so I just look for excuses to not eat, which is also rude, so there's no winning with ARFID. I should be more worried about having to eat through a tube than with other grown up people's feelings for fuck sake.\n\nI never tell people I have an ED because they not understanding would just piss me off, instead I just tell the other truth: \"I throw up everything I eat\", it rarely works either though, people just feel the right to act bitchy and judgemental.",

      "body": "I just hate that this seems to be everyone\u2019s default perception of people with ARFID. I would say MOST people with ARFID are willing to make their own accommodations, sometimes that means not eating, or sometimes it means just having bread, fries, or white rice. There are people like who the OP is talking about, and those people do suck, but they\u2019re by far not the majority, but people on Reddit seem to think they are and judge the rest of us by their actions. But what I hate even more is when you do everything you can to get out of the way and to not force other people to accommodate you, but they insist on doing it anyway because they just find it too weird for you to not eat while they\u2019re eating or not eat a real meal. So they change the restaurant so you can eat with them and then make passive aggressive comments later. Like bitch, you CHOSE to do that, I specifically told you not to, but you just couldn\u2019t handle watching someone else not eat. It\u2019s like they don\u2019t believe me when I say I\u2019ll be fine. Our ancestors fasted for days sometimes. Skipping one meal isn\u2019t gonna kill me, and I\u2019ll eat afterwards anyway. Idk why that\u2019s so hard for some people to understand. It\u2019s not my fault society has decided that meals out are a social event that everyone must partake in fully \ud83d\ude44",
