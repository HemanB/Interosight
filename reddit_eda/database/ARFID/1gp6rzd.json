  "selftext": "So awhile ago I found this app called supercook, it\u2019s supposed to help find recipes with what\u2019s in your fridge but I\u2019ve found it as a good record of what I\u2019m comfortable eating and find things to eat with such a limited diet. I thought I\u2019d share about it here since I realized it could help other people too :3 plus if you want to try a new food u can find something that\u2019s primarily safe with one new thing. ",
