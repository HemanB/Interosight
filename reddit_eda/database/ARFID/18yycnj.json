Bit of salt and pepper and you're singing. \n\nGet yourself a nice rib eye or striploin, cook til the fat is shiny golden brown. Absolutely amazing. \n\nI only started eating steak about 8 years ago (35 now.) The only other meat it eat is bacon.",

There\u2019s no weird sauces, no worry about what\u2019s in it or anything, it\u2019s just good meat. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t tried a steak just like that before, I truly do recommend it.
