I\u2019m still not 100% on what I can and can\u2019t eat, but I know eating too much at once is a huge trigger, as well as too much dairy. If I knew all the things that I could do to prevent hours in the bathroom, I\u2019d definitely do it. \n\nAlso my girlfriend for a long time couldn\u2019t eat gluten, dairy, nightshades (including potatoes, tomatoes, egg plants, bell peppers, paprika), or eggs because of a severe illness she had many years ago that destroyed her digestive tract. It wasn\u2019t technically an allergy, but they\u2019d all put her in a lot of pain. Her stomach and intestines only recently recovered (like, 8 years after the illness) and even tho she can eat most of those things again (she ate French fries for the first time in forever, like, two months ago and she was so happy) she still can\u2019t have dairy and is terrified to try ketchup. Eating restrictions without allergies are a real thing! And celiac isn\u2019t the only thing that makes you unable to eat gluten. Off the top of my head I can think of hashimoto\u2019s disease, where you shouldn\u2019t have gluten because it basically makes your immune system attack your thyroid even more than it already does, because the molecular structure of the two is very similar.\n\nThat\u2019s not even getting into neurodivergent reasons for picky eating, like ARFID and autism. Like... you don\u2019t understand why someone else\u2019s brain is the way it is in regards to food. Some people might even not eat certain foods due to trauma. For example, people who were on clear liquid diets for traumatic hospital visits for an extended period might immediately vomit when they eat (or possibly even smell) jello, popsicles, or soup broth.\n\nGah! This sort of thing is SO infuriating to me.\n\n(Copy paste of my comment on the original post)",
