  "selftext": "I hate hate hate all these New Year\u2019s resolutions that end up being about food. Eating better food, eating less, eating at different hours, eating the right food, blah blah blah. \n\nYOUR SAFE FOODS ARE SAFE AND GOOD AND NORMAL. \n\nFood has no morals! If all you can eat is chicken nuggets and cereal, or ensure shakes and plain noodles, ITS GOOD TO EAT THOSE THINGS. \n\n\u201cFed is best\u201d isn\u2019t just for formula vs breastfeeding debates. \n\nIt is literally always better to eat something than to eat nothing. \n\nYou\u2019re not a lesser person or picky eater or \u201cchildish\u201d eater because you can\u2019t eat specific things. People who call you that are projecting their own insecurities and don\u2019t know you or know how difficult ARFID is. \n\nPractice self-care this holiday season \u2764\ufe0f \n\nIf no one else says it to you, I am so proud of you for eating your safe food. It sounds delicious, I love when you feel full and not hungry, and I love seeing you eat/drink consistently because your body deserves it.",

Ask for a full metabolic blood panel, A1C check, and might be worth asking for additional nutrient-specific testing (they can give you more detailed tests for iron, calcium, potassium, etc). \n\nRe: my numbers - my blood pressure, cholesterol, A1C, and fasting blood sugars all got worse when I restricted. Even when it meant I was losing weight. I started working with an intuitive eating nutritionist who helped me identify my eating patterns more closely and I was getting approximately the calories needed to sustain a toddler (I\u2019m 28)! \n\nI also read The Fuck It Diet (GAME CHANGER of a read) and that helped a lot too. \n\nOnce I started eating every day, multiple times a day, all my numbers got better/closer to normal. My blood sugar after eating is higher (obviously) but it levels out. \n\nMy skin, nails, energy level, and even chronic migraines also improved when I started eating again. \n\nIt\u2019s hard, but don\u2019t get discouraged. You sound young (I don\u2019t mean that condescendingly, just assuming because you haven\u2019t had a bunch of blood testing done), and I promise that you eating AT ALL is the best first step you can take. Eating six bowls of sugary cereal a day is better than eating nothing in a day. \n\nOne day of not eating isn\u2019t a big deal! But if you don\u2019t eat at all for 7 days, for example, versus eating only sugary cereal for 7 days, restriction will damage your health more. I hope some of this helps!",
