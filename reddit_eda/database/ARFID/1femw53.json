  "selftext": "My ARFID is autism and sensory issue related, and lately it\u2019s escalated to the point that I have no safe foods. Chewing and swallowing ANYTHING is like torture, my body viscerally rejects it and I start gagging and heaving the moment I put food in my mouth. Sometimes even just upon smelling it, or *thinking* about it. I have no appetite, I\u2019m repulsed by the thought of every single food item, but I feel sick and tired all the time and I *want* to be fed, I just physically cannot do it. It\u2019s so difficult trying to explain to others that this ED has nothing to do with body image or anxiety for me, it\u2019s not something I can \u201cmind over matter\u201d, because it\u2019s a sensory issue at its core and my body physically does not let me eat. No matter how determined I am, or how sick I feel, I cannot make it through the process of chewing and swallowing and smelling and tasting food without becoming sick with nausea, gagging, heaving, or throwing it right back up. \nThey should like\u2026 invent a food you don\u2019t have to eat\nI get zero joy out of eating and if I could just take a pill, or open up some magical door to my stomach and just toss in whatever sustenance I need to live comfortably\u2026 I\u2019d chose that over eating 9.9/10 times. Blegh. This is miserable and I\u2019m tired of feeling so sick and looking so sick. \nWhat does one even do at this point ",

Sensory if you will!!\n\nLike to be unable to put food in mouth because sensory, is lack of appetite, and to have appetite be switched on, is for your mouth to physically be priming its senses to be receptive to and wanting to take in food and enjoy it.\n\nIt couldnt cure my arfid completely, but for the first time in my life i ate so so much more than i ever have before. I woke up excited to eat. I kept eating at 3am, 5am, so many gingerbread men, just because i could and wanted to and it felt amazing.\n\nI couldnt stay on mirtazapine, the rest of the medicines effects just did not work with what i was actually taking it for at ALL, but thats really a matter of RNG whether one person feels it good and one person feels it make them bad as an antidepressant thingy. Id def recommend it to try out for the appetite stimulant sake of it, it was insanely helpful like u dont think it could actually work and then it somehow does",

When someone tube feeding at home (ie, not just during a hospital stay), this is referred to as Home Enteral Nutrition (HEN). \n\nNG and NJ tubes (nasogastric and nasojejunal \u2014 the ones that go through the nose, to the stomach and the second section of the small intestine, respectively) are generally only recommended for very short-term use \u2014 like, up to three weeks. Most frequently only for use while someone is inpatient in the hospital, though very occasionally folks will go home for some period with an NG or NJ. Extended use of NG and NJ tubes is disrecommended due to potential for irritation and even ulceration of the esophagus (an ulcer is an open sore), and also because it fully precludes any oral feeding (the latter may be less of an issue for you given the total disinclination to eat anything by mouth). \n\nFor tubes that are inserted through a stoma (hole into the abdomen), there are three options. If your issues are exclusively oral and/or esophageal, you\u2019ll probably be looking at a gastrostomy/G-tube, which goes into the stomach. There\u2019s also the option for folks who need it of a jejunostomy (J-tube) which goes into the second portion of the small intestine (the jejunum; the duodenum is the first section of small intestine, and connects the stomach to the jejunum), or a gastrostomy-jejunostomy which goes through a hole in the same location as a gastrostomy tube, but has ports for putting things into both the stomach (typically used for medications) and the jejunum (for feeding). J and GJ tubes are usually used for folks with significant stomach issues, eg very severe GERD, stomach blockages, and gastroparesis. Nutritional absorbance is pretty equivalent between G vs GJ/J, because that happens in the small intestine anyway, but it has much less flexibility in feeding methods due to intestines not being stretchy. \n\nFor a G-tube, your options for feeding method are bolus (most similar to eating meals \u2014 syringe pur\u00e9es or formula into the tube multiple times a day), gravity feed (hang a bag of formula or pur\u00e9e on an IV pole or similar, feed for longer than bolus but not continuous, also a multiple times per day thing), or pump feed (requires a thin liquid, so if you\u2019re going for a pur\u00e9ed food diet there can be challenges in getting enough calories in a day \u2014 my friend with a GJ tube feeds 24/7 and gets about 2000 calories/day through her tube). Though these challenges will probably be less with a G-tube than a GJ- or J-tube. \n\nWith a portable enteral nutrition pump, you can put the pump and your bag of formula/pur\u00e9e into a knapsack/bag of your choice and take it with you to feed whenever and wherever you are. If you\u2019re doing 24-hour continuous feeding, this bag will be your constant companion. I\u2019m not entirely sure how often you need to put in a fresh bag of pur\u00e9e/formula \u2014 it likely also depends on what formulation you\u2019re using, whether you\u2019re feeding continuously, etc. \n\nIf you go the formula route, you\u2019ll get prescribed an enteral nutrition formula. These are technically balanced as far as macronutrients and micronutrients, and some people do thrive on them, but others find they do better with blended foods. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking at blended foods, there\u2019s the option of buying pre-made blends (I believe that you generally need a prescription for most of them), or there\u2019s the blend-at-home option which is likely cheaper in the long run unless your health benefits happen to cover formula for enteral feeding for people in your circumstances. If you\u2019re home blending for pump feeding (or probably gravity feeding; not sure how much of an issues it is for bolus feeding), you\u2019ll need to get a good high-speed blender \u2014 a vitamix or a blendtech \u2014 or do multiple rounds of straining to make sure there aren\u2019t any lumps that could clog the tubing. \n\nThe stoma insertion itself is a minimally-invasive procedure that can be done in an Interventional Radiology Department using imaging to tell them where to make the incision. It doesn\u2019t need to be done by a surgeon unless there\u2019s additional medical factors that make it more complex. Healing is pretty straight-forward generally, though if for any reason the tube falls out within the first 6\u20138 weeks it is a medical emergency to get it replaced before the hole closes up. After that point it generally becomes less urgent \u2014 kind of like how piercings close up easily at first, but then eventually form scar tissue around the hole. \n\nCare is relatively simple \u2014 wash the site with soap and water daily, optionally apply a barrier cream (there\u2019s often a little bit of leakage around the tube, and the barrier cream protects your skin from it), and then a dressing \u2014 which can be a reusable cloth dressing, or a disposable dressing. \n\nI think that\u2019s\u2026 at least most of what I know? If you have further questions, I can see if I can answer them, or you could ask them over in r/feedingtubes (though a heads-up \u2014 a lot of the posts over there are from parents managing their kids\u2019 tubes, which can be lightly alienating when you\u2019re looking for information for yourself as an adult. Or at least, that\u2019s my experience).",
