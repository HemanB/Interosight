  "title": "mind-blowing revelation: if there are aspects of food I can\u2019t eat, but those foods are things I WANT to eat, I can take away the obstacles holding me back",
  "selftext": "These are such small things and I feel silly for not realizing it sooner. Here\u2019s some examples: \n\nStrawberries: seeds are bad, and I can\u2019t handle them even in smoothies or anything BUT I cut off the outside of strawberries yesterday to get rid of all the seeds and I ATE THEM and they were DELICIOUS \n\nPasta salad: there\u2019s just a bunch of textures I hate, but it\u2019s so easy to eat and I don\u2019t have to heat/cook it. I made it yesterday and just DIDN\u2019T put the things that are \u201csupposed\u201d to be in it. It\u2019s just the dressing, cheese, and some scoops of a completely tasteless and texture-free protein powder - filling and nutritious, all one texture! \n\nSpaghetti sauce: I just BLENDED that shit to get rid of all textures, added that same protein powder, but no meat at all \n\nGranola bars/easy grabbable snacks for when I don\u2019t feel like I can eat: a lot of times, the texture or the different nuts are too much, so I made peanut butter balls - chopped the nuts up super fine and then ran them through a food processor until they were powdered, added protein powder, peanut butter, and chocolate chips, added flaxseed meal with zero texture, and SO FILLING AND TASTY. \n\nAnother safe food is grilled cheeses and soup, but when I just can\u2019t cook, I take tortillas and cheese, flatten them like a quesadilla, microwave it, and dip it in ketchup. Also delicious, tastes enough like tomatoes and puts food in my body \n\nAnother soup thing: I will buy soups and bisques (with no noodles or anything in it, but I supposed you could do that too) and I put it in a travel mug, it stays warm and I can easily take it with me without being embarrassed. \n\nThere are more things like this, I\u2019m sure,  it I\u2019m just realizing now how much of my ARFID is related to how I\u2019m \u201csupposed\u201d to eat things!",

      "body": "Bread is often on my avoidant list, so I do deconstructed sandwiches a lot.  I can eat sandwiches sometimes if I toast the bread.\n\nI absolutely cannot eat soggy bread. So, when I was younger, if I *had* to pack lunch, I had to pack my sandwich as parts in separate bags. So I'd toast the bread and that went in one baggie. Then the slightly wets (meat, lettuce, cheese) in another baggie. Fully wets (tomatoes, any sauces) each get their own baggie. For sauces I make a little icing style baggie and squeeze it onto the sandwich later.\n\nI always keep a napkin nearby when eating in case I have to spit out a bite. Once a food has changed from safe to not safe, I start eating it as separate ingredients.\n\nSo if I have to spit out a bite of pizza, I'll take the toppings off and try eating those (or set them aside if that's the issue), then repeat with the cheese, and finally the bread.\n\nI never know what's going to set off an \"avoid\" alarm while eating. I can generally be sure that *temperature* will always be an issue. So if I'm eating with people and talking I know I won't be able to finish, because the food will get too cold at some point. Gotta have that napkin on hand \ud83d\ude01",

Sometimes I slice them into little moons and fry them that way but I prefer the cube shape personally. \nThen I put them on buttered French toast / crisp bread and sprinkle on a pinch of salt. Voila they go from creamy mush to hot crispy crunch.",
