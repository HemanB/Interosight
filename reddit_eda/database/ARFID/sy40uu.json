My mom went away one time for like a week and whenever I would tell my dad that I was hungry the first thing he offered me was a hotdog. The day my mom came back I was so excited. She asked me if I was hungry and I said I was. She then offered me (you guessed it) a hotdog. I just about cried, there was definitely tears in my eyes.\n\nI haven't had a hotdog since. I had enough in that week to last me a lifetime.",
