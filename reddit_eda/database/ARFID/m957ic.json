My mom actually had a bad aversion to meat when she was pregnant with me. I liked chicken nuggets and a couple other things, then when I was 9 I realized I didn\u2019t even like them anymore so I went vegetarian. And I apparently had qualms with eating animals as a little kid, I\u2019d ask questions like \u201cwait, this came from a real live chicken? Like the animal on the farm? How did the chicken die?\u201d so that might\u2019ve led me to dislike meat or something, but it can\u2019t just be that bc I also dislike fake meat. I also get those comments of \u201cwhat?! you never liked bacon/hamburgers/etc??\u201d I even had a girl ask me \u201cwould you eat chicken if god told you to?\u201d Since it\u2019s socially acceptable to be a vegetarian and I can also still be healthy that way I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m just not going to try to like meat, and instead focus my efforts on other things (like veggies, lol). \n\nThat\u2019s great that you like apples now, even if it\u2019s only one kind of peeled apple. Maybe you\u2019d like golden delicious apples (the yellow ones), they are also pretty sweet!",
