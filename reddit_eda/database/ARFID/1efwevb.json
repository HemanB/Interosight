I wonder if ARFID or other sensory issues might be related. BJs are a very \"sensory\" experience and not for everyone. And that's okay. That said, now that you know this, you need to make it clear that you can't do oral for such reasons. The right person will understand. And if they don't, do you really want someone who will sacrifice your well-being for their own pleasure?",

We both keep a travel mouthwash-toothpaste-toothbrush on us, and swallowing doesn\u2019t bother me much anymore cause I know that icky taste is VERY temporary. \n\nI\u2019ve only been with one person so I can\u2019t really compare how people taste but encourage your partner to drink a lot of water and avoid energy drinks. \n\nAlso be open with your partner about your aversion to certain textures and tastes, if vomiting bothers him then don\u2019t pressure him and maybe find someone else. If you really like him and this isn\u2019t just a situationship try to make it work!!
