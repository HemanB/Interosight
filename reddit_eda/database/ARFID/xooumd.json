I shred up and mutilate chicken breast with my fingers as I\u2019m eating it to make sure there\u2019s no noticeable fat, I shred ALL the fat off of bacon down to the last bit that hangs on (both only feasible while I\u2019m alone, for the embarrassment factor) I can scarf down a cheeseburger if I\u2019m sufficiently distracted enough to not think about what I\u2019m eating actually used to be\u2026. \n\nNo bones, and no fat - only then can I pretend that it\u2019s not what I know it actually is. And it\u2019s like my body REJOICES in the nutrition when I do eat it. Which is maybe a couple times a week. \n\nI know it\u2019s not the most responsible way to consume meat - you should be mindful of the sacrifice that was made to get that food to you! But if I think too hard about it I won\u2019t eat it, and if I don\u2019t eat it, I\u2019d honestly probably die of malnutrition cause I hate most other protein sources",
