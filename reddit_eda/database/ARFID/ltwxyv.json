  "title": "Air Fryers are Awesome",
  "selftext": "Last week I realized some air fryers have a bake function. My son\u2019s (6) primary safe food is a baked good so, we bought one. After extensively testing times and temperatures, we\u2019ve now got the process down. PLUS it bakes faster and more consistently than in a conventional oven. \n\nI\u2019m excited to give the conventional oven a rest BUT above all else, his food is portable now! I will happily lug a countertop appliance anywhere / everywhere to give him a break from stressing about food availability. \n\nAnyway, just had to share with people who might be able to understand how exciting this is.",
