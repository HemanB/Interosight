      "body": "I've been thinking about this recently and come up with a few categories of people's reactions to food preferences. Let me know if you can think of others.\n\n1. Snobbery and traditionalism -- this is not at all isolated to ARFID, but the assumption that things need to be done a certain way or else it is \"less\", and it's very common in enthusiast communities, ie, you can't be a \"real\" whiskey drinker if it isn't neat. For ARFID, it's people using this reflexive mentality to say you can't really enjoy that burger if there is no bun, in fact it's not really a hamburger. \n\nWhich leads me to,\n\n2. Making in-groups and out-groups based on food is much like that whiskey snob, except it's an ancient mentality thats been going on forever. Italian immigrants were called 'garlic eaters'. Anecdotally, my German immigrant dad was teased for eating catfood sandwiches (liverwurst) at school, and my Asian roommates were mocked for eating smelly food in residences when I was at school. \n\nWe are all kind of used to, subconsciously I think, defining ourselves and others by what we consume be it food, drugs, booze, cigarettes, etc. It's weird if you think about it, but I think it's true. Just look at the hatred some people have of vegans.\n\n3. The idea of hospitality -- society teaches us that it is polite to accept gifts, and appreciate other people's hard work (in this case, cooking) by accepting it as it is. I think part of people's reaction to picking through a dish to remove something is one of \"they must not think it's good enough for them, that's rude\"\n\nWhich leads me to my final category,\n\n4. Perceived selfishness: most people if they don't enjoy a food don't have the same physical and psychological reaction to it. They just eat it, shrug, and move on. To somebody with no experience with ARFID, the lengths people go to feel safe when eating seem ridiculous, and selfish (whether that's because it's seen as wasteful, or disruptive, or merely just self-centered). \n\nI know that was a wall of text, but I always try to break things down into categories to help me understand behaviours. I don't want to justify people's behaviour, or excuse it.\n\nWhat do you think?",

Someone mentioned it though and it led to the condescending, \u201cOh, you must have a favorite something!\u201d I paused, then stared into my webcam and more or less said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t have a favorite of anything.

I only said it is disappointing not to be able to experience new things together, or to have to worry about every meal you either make or that you might order in. \n\nI guarantee your partner has gone through the same worry of whether or not something will be enjoyable for you (as all supportive partners should). We've had this same experience many times because gosh, they just didn't list onions on the menu, and now we need to find an entirely new dinner (for the person with ARFID) besides what we ordered, wasting both money and ruining the experience for your partner in the first place, because 1. They were triggered and are now upset because of that and 2. They just wanted to sit down and enjoy their meal and now it's a whole ordeal (wherein the person suffering both feels guilty/ashamed and angry and the entire situation). \n\nI did state there were things I don't indulge in often anymore because my partner can't enjoy them. You reading into this saying I am guilt-tripping has more to say about your experiences than mine. I'm not saying your relationship has to be dependent upon what the other person eats, but if you have someone supportive in your life, they will likely make sacrifices for you and your ARFID, at *least* some of the time, and if you say otherwise then you're either very fortunate, or dead wrong. \n\nI'm glad you and your SO can handle making two different meals a lot of the time. I can not. We don't have the unlimited budget to do so, nor the time, and honestly, I do not feel bad to admit that I hate the constant worry that I'm doing something wrong and now my partner won't eat dinner. \n\nI offer the perspective of mealtimes with our children in an ARFID household. I like veggies in lots of dishes. I would like our children to eat lots of veggies too. So where does that leave us? When I make dinner, I have to make 2, one for myself and the kids, one for my husband. Or if my husband makes dinner, I still have to come cook because he doesn't eat the stuff, so why would he know how to make them? What about when my children refuse their vegetables because their defiant (and 2 years old) and ask me \"daddy doesn't eat them, so why should I?\" Again, this is not written to guilt-trip like might be your gut reaction, but instead to offer an outsiders perspective of how ARFID can affect those around you, and why they may act the way they do. \n\nI will fully admit there have been times I have not been supportive, and thought to myself \"just eat the damn x\" but these times are short-lived, and while I am very sorry for many with ARFID that this is not the case, I am telling you that is not the case with everyone, again, which is why I offered my perspective in the first place, because all other comments that had been offered were incredibly dehumanizing and alienating. \n\n\nAgain, I will reiterate what I said previously, which does not include \"you guys suck the life out of food.\" Instead, I said that I understand how hard it is for you, and simply offered another perspective that would maybe make you less quick to alienate those around you. *Not everyone understands ARFID, nor takes the time to even learn about it or work around it.* I *understand* the struggle, *to a certain level.* I am constantly defending my husband from family members that are like the ones mentioned in the other comments. Which is why I didn't make the blanket statement that \"you guys just don't understand how we feel about it.\" Instead, I pointed out my own experience, and offered that instead of shaming and making generalizations like you are so quick to do to me. \n\nAgain, I did not once have any intention (nor do I think I did) guilt-trip about food. I stated my own, and what I'm sure is the experience of many supportive partners of those with ARFID. If you are taking it that way, I think it has more to say about the regular reactions to ARFID in your own life than anything I said.\n\nEdit: I would also like to add something I forgot to touch on.  While I understand \"it's just food\" to a certain degree,  I don't think it is fair or right of you to be making that judgement in all cases. Food is a *huge* part of culture and sharing it. Many holidays and such are shared over meals. To be missing that element of your life with the person you love most is incredibly difficult, and you can call it stupid if you'd like, but yes, I think it is hard. I want to travel and experience new cultures with my husband.  Part of that is food. When you basically have to rule out entire experiences because the experience would just be miserable for your partner with ARFID, yes, it is difficult, and it's not as easy to just let it go as you say. Sure, I could go to Italy with a friend I guess, but I think you'd be lying if you say it's just as good or the same as experiencing it with the person you love most in the world and want to share your life and experiences with.",

Just make sure to check the menu before going to a new restaurant to make sure there is something he can have. \n\nI understand this is much harder to implement at home though, cooking different meals is extra work. Me and my boyfriend usually pick something similar that we can tweak to suit our needs. Tonight we shared a large pizza, he put olives on his side and I left my side plain. We were both happy with it!",

In my own experience, not being able to share food is very difficult, especially in instances of going new places and wanting to try new things with someone you love. It definitely takes it out of you when you feel restricted because you feel like you can't do anything without worrying about whether it is okay or enjoyable for the other person. In our relationship I have given up a lot of things because my husband can't enjoy them, and it completely takes the pleasure out of them for me as well. \n\nNow let me clarify,  I know ARFID is harder on the person who has it than those around them. I am commenting only to offer another perspective not already seen in your other comments. While I can completely understand the other comments have great validity and are truths to many, they do not represent every case.",
