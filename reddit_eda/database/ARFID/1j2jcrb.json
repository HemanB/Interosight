I said that is fine and just ordered a dessert instead. Suddenly it was possible to get the food I wanted :).\nI don't know why they always assume that it is about cost. Charge me more for the kids food and everybody would be happy.",

I\u2019m also not a great lover of steaks & am allergic to salmon. So at many restaurants, even chains like Applebees & Chili\u2019s the choices are limited. On vacation two years ago, I asked at an Applebees if I could order the chicken Cobb without the chicken & extra vegetables. Answer, no.\nTheir pasta came with chicken, all the wraps had chicken or turkey. \nAll the salads had chicken.\n\nSeriously,  be more conscious & have some options.",
