It is now to the point that my son won\u2019t go see his dad anymore because he just can\u2019t trust him. \n\nThat\u2019s a horrible thing to do someone, even just someone that doesn\u2019t like a certain food, let alone someone with an eating disorder affecting how they eat. \n\nI apologized to my son this week about the trauma I put him through when he was younger and I didn\u2019t understand - and even then it was never about tricking him, I just pressured him more than I should have. I cannot imagine doing something like this and feeling victorious about it. \n\nI\u2019m sorry.",

Obviously if she has always been a great mother and this is a one time incident then maybe it was an odd out of character mistake on her part.  Maybe she deserves another chance.  However if this is a common occurrence (not spoiling food but just doing extreme things such as this) I can see ignoring her until I can move out as a good idea.  Just because someone is your family doesn't mean they deserve respect from you.  Raising a child is your responsibility as a mother.  If you do it in an abusive manner the child has every right to cut communication when they are old enough.  Although it may seem the child owes the mother because the mother still fed and housed and maybe even cared for them, they really don't.\n\nI personally love my mother.  I know how hard she worked to support me and I appreciate it and definitely treat her with respect because of it.  She's made mistakes and we got through them.  But she didn't do something that hurt me and then turn around and do it a second time on purpose.  Obviously OPs mom has not done it a second time yet and I again don't know this particular persons mother.  I definitely think it's over dramatic a bit but I still feel if the mom saw how upset their kid got the first time and did it a second time all bets are off at that point.\n\nSide note: the throwing up on her bed part is of course a real dramatic and petty part to this.  I don't think I would threaten my mom with this.  If we had a conversation and I trusted her again and she decided to spoil my food again and I felt I was gonna throw up...it's possible I may be petty enough to do it somewhere she wouldn't want me to.  Probably not really but it sounds like a good petty revenge that is fun to think of in your head.",

Do you know how many times it's actually solved anything? On a Venn diagram, it's two circles with zero intersection.\n\nAll taking the high road means is that you act like it never happened, and if you act like it never happened, then it comes across as \"it was OK, not a big issue\".\n\nYou take the high road on minor disagreements like getting into a row over decorating or going or spending too much on a hobby. Not on someone putting expired milk into the safe food of someone with ARFID, then smugly announcing it to them. OP literally said they've now lost an entire *category* of safe foods.\n\nIf you've got ARFID or live with someone who has, you know the impact that losing a safe food can have.\n\n>That seems a bit over the top and dramatic over an easily fixable situation. Just move on and take the steps to ensure your food is prepared the way you like it. No need to snub your Mom.\n\nWhat planet do you live on?\n\nEasily fixable? Unless you've got a time machine in your back yard, it's happened, it's not happening. The mother has violated trust, damaged her childs already limited diet and actually thinks they did the right thing.\n\nSnubbing her is the *absolute bare minimum* she deserves - it shows her that her actions have consequences. Honestly, I wouldn't blame OP if they moved out and went no contact permanently.\n\nAnd it's not a case of \"make sure the food is prepared the way you like it\". The mother *knows* how to prepare it. She just doesn't give a shit and decided to violate trust to prove that a mental illness is all in the head. No shit. That's why its called a MENTAL ILLNESS.",

Cook everything yourself, eat away from her, if you can, keep your ingredients in a locked cupboard in your room.\n\nThen tell her that if you ever catch her doing anything like that again, you're upending it on her bed. The next time and every time after that, it's over her head, regardless of how hot it might be. Then treat her like she's dead for a couple of weeks. If she speaks, ignore her, if practical, leave any room she enters and block your door so she can't get in.\n\nI usually try to be measured in my responses, but this one is *unforgivable*.",
