I know that logically I can eat it and I will stay alive, but I can\u2019t make myself FEEL like it is. Even if I did eat it it\u2019s possible I would end up puking it back up or getting sick from it anyway\n\nDoes anyone else feel like this?

      "body": "When I was younger, sometime around 12, my mom and I talked to my pediatrician about me being underweight and a \u201cpicky eater.\u201d My doctor explained what \u201cselective eating\u201d is. Her explanation was something like this:\n\nIn some cultures, eating monkey brains is considered normal, or at least not completely unheard of. In my culture, however, I\u2019ve never heard of anyone eating that or even thinking that monkey brains are even edible. If I were to go somewhere where that was normal and I was served monkey brains, I couldn\u2019t see them as food. Everyone else at the table wouldn\u2019t understand why I would be weirded out, but I just couldn\u2019t eat it because it\u2019s not normal to me.\n\nFor me (and other selective eaters), food that is considered \u201cnormal\u201d to people around you is just like monkey brains. When I\u2019m served something like steamed vegetables, everyone else at the table just thinks it\u2019s normal and even enjoyable. I, however, see monkey brains. No matter how hungry I am or how much I want to like it, I just can\u2019t see the vegetables as edible. \n\nThat\u2019s one of the struggles of being a selective eater. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m too good for the food, it\u2019s that I literally can\u2019t eat it. I\u2019ve gone hungry so many times because I simply can\u2019t eat the food that\u2019s available.\n\n(I also don\u2019t know if I have ARFID. Never been diagnosed.)",
