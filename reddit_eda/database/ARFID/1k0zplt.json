We moved from California to Canada and she lost all of her safe foods except the almighty McD chicken nuggie. I've had friends send food up but \"it's not the same\". She's surviving right now on: nugs, nutella&peanut butter sandwiches, chocolate chip waffles, and garlic noodles. \n\nWhat I'm here to ask for advice on: She flips her shit if McD isn't an option once a day. She will argue, refuse to eat anything the whole day, just act an asshole. With fights we are looking at 4-5x a week. I feel like the worlds shittiest parent and I'm enabling her, like the answer is \"Quit buying it\" but I don't feel like saying \"Go hungry!\" helps her in any way. We've talked about the expense and math of it all.\n\nI don't really know what else I should be doing but I'm so lost. I'm at a point where I don't want to fight and strain our relationship any further.",

I am healthy, financially stable, work full time, am happily married, etc. \n\nWhen I\u2019m stressed, I can basically only eat 5 minute rice with margarine. There are weeks when that and Diet Coke and Starbucks baked goods are all I\u2019m ingesting. My Starbucks spending is probably my #1 vice. It\u2019s a comfort thing. I\u2019ve had full-on panic attacks over leftovers my husband has in the fridge before. \n\nIf someone took away my safe meal and comfort snacks I wouldn\u2019t eat better, I would just be hungry and even more stressed. When I\u2019m going through it, the source(s) of stress and anxiety needs to be attacked first \u2014 I need to be able to manage and navigate those things, and then I can work on reintegrating healthier and more varied foods. I only know this because I\u2019ve been me for 35 years, at some point I clued in to just how abnormal I am, and I have gotten really good at managing myself. \n\nSo from my perspective you are not enabling or doing anything wrong. You\u2019re making sure your child gets fed which is absolutely paramount. It is a bit unhelpful to bring up the economics of eating mostly McDonalds, because this might contribute to her guilt/stress. I\u2019d support her in eating what she will temporarily, if you can swing it, without making it \u201ca thing\u201d \u2014 while working toward the goal of healthier and more economical eating habits by minimizing/managing other sources of stress and anxiety first. \n\nARFID is *not* a junk food addiction. It is an anxiety condition. So \u201cenabling\u201d isn\u2019t really a thing. You are in a position to genuinely help your child\u2019s life be more manageable for them, but it is definitely not a straight line to force-feeding better meal options.",

An international move is a huge adjustment, and I think a lot of people on the autism spectrum struggle with big changes, heck I think even NT people struggle with big changes/transitions. Not to mention the fact that she\u2019s a 16 year old girl, which is a hard time in life for anyone. From this post, I view you as a loving parent that is doing what is right for her child. The rest of the world might not see it that way, but what matters more is a) that your daughter is eating something, even if it isn\u2019t nutritious; and b) you\u2019re supporting your daughter. \n\nMy parents tried telling me \u201cif you\u2019re hungry you\u2019ll eat fruit\u201d as a child. As a result I was malnourished. My diet at the moment consists primarily of chips and chocolate as I\u2019m not doing well right now. My Mum helps me out by cooking the 2 meals I do like every few days, and that means the world to me. The teenage years are so difficult to survive, and I understand your frustration (and guilt) I hope you can one day see that you\u2019re providing her with the food she can and will eat, while preserving your relationship with her.",

If she likes nutella/peanut butter try to introduce her to peanuts or jelly (healthy type but jelly might be too much of a texture change).\n\nTry to ask her if there is some food that she wants to try but dont overdo it. My mom used to ask me everyday multiple times a day if I want to try eating some food that she was currently eating. Ive never tried anything like that because it was food that was nowhere my safe foods and it only caused frustration.\n\nAnd in terms of going hungry - it doesnt work.

Any type of anxiety or adjustments can cause my ARFID symptoms to spiral. The best thing you can do for her is to acknowledge this isn't something she's choosing. She has no control over it in her current state and is wanting more than anything to have a normal relationship with food right now. I would look into getting her a therapist and a dietitian who specializes in ARFID. I'd also recommend trying to have fun with finding her new safe foods. You can get her nuggies and make a deal with her to try one bite of a new food to get them. Shell gain more confidence over time and be more willing to try new things. Also look into doing cooking exercises with her. Give her a timeframe to Google and find recipes she thinks could be safe. You can teach her to cook them with you making trying new things more about bonding than a battle. \n\nPlease please please understand she is feeling so out of control of this situation and doesn't want it to be like this either.

      "body": "I can't say any of this will work if she has any sort of PDA, but sit her down and try to figure out WHY those things are safe foods for her. Is it texture, smell, color, taste, familiarity, temperature? Also ask what she feels like when she eats \"unsafe\" foods. There is a difference between feeling unwell while eating something, and just not liking it, and this will affect how she handles new foods. This can be a delicate process since it can be very hard for even an adult to articulate their reactions and reasoning, and being unable to communicate can be distressing. This could happen even while eating safe foods. Fights will decrease if you open up to each other about this and can empathize.\n\nAsk her if she would be okay with you attempting to \"trick\" her. (Things like keeping packaging out of sight so she can't see the brand, blending veggies into a dish like cookies or pasta sauce, etc.) A lot of ARFID can be all in your head, especially when it comes to familiarity and anxiety based forms. If they don't have access to food they feel safe eating, they will not eat, and tricking them without their knowledge can result in them losing all trust in even their safe foods, which will almost always mean they'll eat nothing at all. Ask to try preparing the safe foods differently. Cutting up chicken nuggets, serving them with different sides or sauces as an option, etc. can help with texture issues. This may not work, of course! But asking is important. She needs to feel as though she has input into this. \n\nAlso ask her if there is any food she's wanted to try. I find that foreign foods can and have helped me because they make me feel adventurous, but other people prefer trying out yogurts, different protein bars, new fruits/veggies, etc. KEEP ASKING about this. Ask at every shopping trip, which you should insist she attend for a bit, ask every time you think about going to a restaurant. Don't be pushy about it, but rather keep the option open. Knowing she can try something new the second she asks to will mean that whenever she has the courage to, she will ask instead of sitting on that courage until it dissipates. The willpower to eat something can dissipate in mere hours for people with ARFID.\n\nFast and easy foods are also key. Find a cereal she likes, find a \"raw\" food item she enjoys whether it's fruit cups, apple sauce, juice, olives or tomatoes, pepperoni, etc. Having something \"snackable\" means less reliance on sweet foods. I found that much of my affinity for sweets was actually me having nothing else to fall back on that was easy to prep when I was feeling particularly low. I don't actually want to reach for sweets.\n\nLastly, my father liked to say that I shouldn't be having a can of soup every day because too much salt was unhealthy, but on the days I ate a can of soup, I often didn't even eat anything else. Those cans didn't have more than the daily recommended amount of salt, just a lot for the volume. \"Unhealthy\" is relative, and any food is better than none. Changing ARFID habits takes time and courage, and worrying about health can make any setback all the more discouraging. Health worries are for people who can eat a variety of things. You can let her in on the money struggles, but my advice is not to worry about health yet.",

Being 16 is hard enough without also being autistic, having ARFID, and having a huge move. \n\nI myself am almost 28, autistic, and have ARFID. I\u2019m lucky that *now* my brain is fully developed so I can *reason* and try new foods \u2014 like this week I cooked ground beef and roasted broccoli for the first time ever! I felt like such a proper adult! BUT I ate so much fast food in my adolescence because it was so consistent. In my adolescence I thought it was anorexia, not even knowing about ARFID, nor knowing I had autism & adhd \u2014 and none of my mental health issues were being addressed so I was fully on the struggle bus. \n\nYour kiddo is going through a major stressor event by 1- moving & having their schedules/ routines completely thrown off & 2- losing the majority of their safe foods. While *you* as an adult also have major stressors (like being the one financially responsible for everything), you have to recognize that their stress feels just as significant & insurmountable as yours because they are *their* stressors (hoping that makes sense). \n\nIf you\u2019re not autistic you won\u2019t know how serious something not being the same is. We crave what is predictable & when it\u2019s not then we can become unregulated& stressed out, especially at 16. Self-regulation is one of those higher-level cognitive skills that we develop as we age, but we also need to be shown *how* to self regulate. I highly, HIGHLY recommend professional help with that, but also with the ARFID. You & your kiddo will be better off once they\u2019re getting the professional help they need to 1- learn how to self regulate as an autistic & 2- be more accepting of variance in their food taste, smell, appearance, temperature, etc. \n\nSome associates professionals may be a registered dietitian who specializes in ARFID, a speech-language pathologist that specializes in pediatric feeding disorders, and a therapist that works with pediatric autistics. I seriously wish y\u2019all the best. In the mean time please be patient with yourself and your kiddo, and know that allowing her *any food she will eat* is the best food for her.\n\n\nEdit: I also just want to add that it\u2019s clear to me how much you care for your child \u2014 the fact that you\u2019re concerned for their nutrition. You are *not* a shitty parent. It\u2019s OKAY that you are struggling too. But you\u2019re not shitty. My one tip if your child is willing to try it, is to cook the garlic noodles in bone broth instead of regular water as that will add a little extra nutrition\u2014 it will also change the flavor so she would need to be fully on board.",

When your kid is getting snappy about food, it isn\u2019t your kid, it\u2019s the eating disorder talking. I am currently waiting to meet with my new therapist for this purpose because I\u2019m having the same issue that your child seems to be right now. \n\nSince I haven\u2019t been able to get in touch with that therapist since its hard to access, I\u2019ve seen my psychiatrist and she\u2019s prescribed me both a benzodiazepine for my anxiety around eating and also an antipsychotic that stimulates an appetite, this has been one of the only effective things for me right now that even gets me to eat my required 3 meals and select snacks. \n\nIf your kid isn\u2019t meeting dietary needs which it sounds like they aren\u2019t (which I\u2019m not blaming you or your child, I get the struggle.) I recommend starting nutritional supplements, I absolutely cannot stand any of the milkshake drinks made by ensure or boost, but I can tolerate the non creamy boosts which are essentially just a juice packed with vitamins - though I completely hate all the flavours so what I do is mix orange flavoured non creamy boost with actual orange juice, I\u2019ve been doing this daily for 2 months now and have seen real improvement in my bowel movements, I\u2019m not throwing up every day from my overproduction of bile, and life feels somewhat liveable again. If this isn\u2019t something that ends up working out, at least find some sort of gummy vitamin or capsule that your kiddo is willing to take to make sure they\u2019re getting at least SOME of the nutrients they need. \n\nI hope you\u2019re able to get something from this that actually helps you guys out, it\u2019s a really tough place to be in",

I\u2019m relating to a lot of this post so just wanted to mention a few things that may be worth considering moving forward. \n\n1. I\u2019d encourage you to be cautious with your words when arguing with her. You mention the financial aspect does make her feel guilty. Please remember that our brains can latch onto these things and they may follow her into adulthood and be detrimental to her progress even though you\u2019re well intentioned. \n\n(In my case, that financial guilt has transformed into anxiety in adulthood over trying new foods because if I struggle to eat them I\u2019m \u201cwasting money.\u201d)\n\n2. When you start to feel like others are viewing you as a bad parent, I encourage you to take a step back and reevaluate. My family often chose looking like a good parent over actually being a good parent. It would be a shame to prioritize appearances over your daughter\u2019s well being. \n\n3. When it\u2019s frustrating and sad for you, remember it\u2019s even harder for her! No one wants to struggle with ARFID and eating difficulties. It may feel like she\u2019s intentionally defying you or working against you but in reality her mind and body are working against her. Please seek professional help if possible to help you maintain empathy when approaching the situation. \n\nWishing you the best of luck tackling this issue together \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb",

She became very limited in diet but it was a variety of your basic kid-friendly foods I could make at home. Mac n cheese, quesadillas, scrambled eggs, ham.. but her diet became more and more limited as she got older. \n\nI've worked with children with high support needs for a while now, namely autism and comorbidities, but ARFID only crossed my radar about a year ago as things got harder and harder for her.

I am healthy, financially stable, work full time, am happily married, etc. \n\nWhen I\u2019m stressed, I can basically only eat 5 minute rice with margarine. There are weeks when that and Diet Coke and Starbucks baked goods are all I\u2019m ingesting. My Starbucks spending is probably my #1 vice. It\u2019s a comfort thing. I\u2019ve had full-on panic attacks over leftovers my husband has in the fridge before. \n\nIf someone took away my safe meal and comfort snacks I wouldn\u2019t eat better, I would just be hungry and even more stressed. When I\u2019m going through it, the source(s) of stress and anxiety needs to be attacked first \u2014 I need to be able to manage and navigate those things, and then I can work on reintegrating healthier and more varied foods. I only know this because I\u2019ve been me for 35 years, at some point I clued in to just how abnormal I am, and I have gotten really good at managing myself. \n\nSo from my perspective you are not enabling or doing anything wrong. You\u2019re making sure your child gets fed which is absolutely paramount. It is a bit unhelpful to bring up the economics of eating mostly McDonalds, because this might contribute to her guilt/stress. I\u2019d support her in eating what she will temporarily, if you can swing it, without making it \u201ca thing\u201d \u2014 while working toward the goal of healthier and more economical eating habits by minimizing/managing other sources of stress and anxiety first. \n\nARFID is *not* a junk food addiction. It is an anxiety condition. So \u201cenabling\u201d isn\u2019t really a thing. You are in a position to genuinely help your child\u2019s life be more manageable for them, but it is definitely not a straight line to force-feeding better meal options.",
