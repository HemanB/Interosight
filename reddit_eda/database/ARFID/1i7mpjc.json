As such, we do not tolerate hate speech, including, but not limited to: race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity/expression. We also don\u2019t condone showing support of, or advocating for genocides or any minority group\u2019s oppression. \n\nWith this in mind, we would also like to state that we are standing in solidarity with many other subreddits and no longer allowing X/Twitter links in light of recent events pertaining to the owner of X/Twitter. \n\nWe sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but community has always been at the core of what we do. \n\nAny questions, please feel free to email or use ModMail.\n\nSincerely, \n\nYour Mod Team",
