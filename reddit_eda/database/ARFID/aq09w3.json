Not many have seen me melt down over unwanted butter\u2014but I know this is a sub with people who \u201cget it.\u201d\n\nI willingly put butter to bread and toasted it in the oven, and ate it like it was the only thing I ever wanted. \n\nIt was uncomfortable. But I did it!!!!!!!!!!! \n\n\n...and I loved it. ;_;\n\nThanks for reading! \n\n",
