But it doesn\u2019t make it any less frustrating and annoying. \n\nA coworker today: \u201citmeonetwothree what are you four?\u201d \nMe: \u201cMy appetite sure is\u201d \nCoworker: \u201cyeah looks like a lunch I\u2019d pack my kids\u201d\nMe: \u201cthen your kids get yummy lunches\u201d \n\nCAN WE ALL JUST STOP GIVING UNSOLICITED COMMENTS ABOUT OTHERS FOOD??! \n\nNothing compared to that kids cuisine post. That was whack as fuckkkk. \n\nEdit: not that it matters but it was a chobani smoothie, uncrustable (didn\u2019t end up eating and feeling frustrated w myself tbh), and peach mango applesauce. It was yummy. \n\nEdit: I love y\u2019all ",
