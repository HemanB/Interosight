Granted, I have a gluten intolerance of some sort and that gives me an exit strategy to eat something different. A lot of foods have gluten and eating something different is part of that territory. This means I can have safe foods that are gluten free and ARFID friendly and no one will care. They'll just view it as a medical issue and not think twice about ARFID. However, I do wish I could eat what everyone else is eating regardless if it's gluten or ARFID. Also, there are safe foods that I do miss that have gluten...\n\nI did early intervention and learned how to cope and get through meals. That was prior to the intolerance but the intolerance and GI symptoms is what caused the ARFID to develop. Now, I'm shoved back into that same position for both medical reasons and ARFID. \n\n\"Why aren't you eating?\" Well, I have an intolerance and eating gluten makes me feel sick.
