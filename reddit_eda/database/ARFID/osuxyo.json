So when i ate a ripped pair for the first time i despised it because it was different in texture and slightly in taste. my friend figured out why told me and never touched a pear again because 'i don't want to eat neer rotting food, tf?!' but i was only use to that 'good sensation' of thattype of air that if i try and eat a ripped one, its different in texture/flavor and just a put off :/",

That being said, it's like having a good cheerleader who celebrates every victory even the snallest ones I don't really consider a victory. \n\nIt's someone who will listen to me talk about all of my issues with foods without any judgements and she helps me try new foods at my own pace. I'm the one who gets to make all of the decisions with my goals and id they're too much we change them so they're attainable. And we always celebrate what I can do and if I didn't meet a goal I either add it onto next week or change it or postpone it! I think this is super important bc if I felt a bunch of pressure I wouldn't be able to make progress. Exposure therapy didn't work for me in the past either it was actually quite traumatic.\n\nIt also helps to get nutritional info without all of that diet culture crap that comes up sometimes in web searches. I'm motivated to think about foods that already work for me and combine them to make a more complex meal that I still enjoy! Making food is also really difficult for me, I have low energy and high anxiety a lot, and my dietitian works with me on that, too! I pick a recipe I want to try that feels safe and not too tough and we have a zoom call and she answers any questions and talks to me while I cook it! I've only made two things so far but the feeling of accomplishment is the best.\n\nMy dietitian I love had some issues last month where I was unable to work with her for three ish weeks and the dietitian I worked with in the meantime was so wrong for me it was bad. She didn't really listen much, didn't support me even close to the same, she gave advice I already know, and she was inconsistent with appointment times and didn't communicate with me about it. SO I realized how important it is to find the right dietitian for you!\n\nMake sure you look for a dietitian and not a nutrionist as I believe we need the most informed help we can find. If you can find a dietitian/practice specialized in eating disorders that helps a lot as well. Bonus if it's ARFID specific or has ARFID programs!\n\nI know things can be difficult to afford but if it's accessible and you're not already in therapy, a good therapist is vital in this process. Bonus if they're ED specialized as well.\n\nAlso maybe see if there are any support groups in your area or online? I did one before we couldn't meet anymore and it was incredible relating to everyone. We had so much in common even though I was the only one with ARFID. Someone gave me info for one a few days ago if I find the note I'll post the link as a reply here!\n\nGood luck, friend. I hope people support you in your life and at home but if not know you'll always have support here! I hope you can find the right help. I know it's scary, but the other side of the fear is where you want to be \u2764\ufe0f Stay firm in your boundaries and if you have an appt or two with someone and it doesn't feel good/right for you then they aren't the right fit and trust me it's better to leave at the beginning than stay somewhere that isn't working. If you ever want to talk about boundaries or scripts or anything ARFID or whatever my DMs are always open and you can always reply to this thread. I'm rooting for you!!\n\nTL;DR Find someone who's compassionate and goes at your own pace and you'll feel right at home! Therapy is vital and support groups are super helpful! I'm always here for support and so are the rest of us :)",

I pick a recipe I want to try that feels safe and not too tough and we have a zoom call and she answers any questions and talks to me while I cook it! I've only made two things so far but the feeling of accomplishment is the best.\n\nMy dietitian I love had some issues last month where I was unable to work with her for three ish weeks and the dietitian I worked with in the meantime was so wrong for me it was bad. She didn't really listen much, didn't support me even close to the same, she gave advice I already know, and she was inconsistent with appointment times and didn't communicate with me about it. SO I realized how important it is to find the right dietitian for you!\n\nMake sure you look for a dietitian and not a nutrionist as I believe we need the most informed help we can find. If you can find a dietitian/practice specialized in eating disorders that helps a lot as well. Bonus if it's ARFID specific or has ARFID programs!\n\nI know things can be difficult to afford but if it's accessible and you're not already in therapy, a good therapist is vital in this process. Bonus if they're ED specialized as well.\n\nAlso maybe see if there are any support groups in your area or online? I did one before we couldn't meet anymore and it was incredible relating to everyone. We had so much in common even though I was the only one with ARFID. Someone gave me info for one a few days ago if I find the note I'll post the link as a reply here!\n\nGood luck, friend. I hope people support you in your life and at home but if not know you'll always have support here! I hope you can find the right help. I know it's scary, but the other side of the fear is where you want to be \u2764\ufe0f Stay firm in your boundaries and if you have an appt or two with someone and it doesn't feel good/right for you then they aren't the right fit and trust me it's better to leave at the beginning than stay somewhere that isn't working. If you ever want to talk about boundaries or scripts or anything ARFID or whatever my DMs are always open and you can always reply to this thread. I'm rooting for you!!\n\nTL;DR Find someone who's compassionate and goes at your own pace and you'll feel right at home! Therapy is vital and support groups are super helpful! I'm always here for support and so are the rest of us :)",
