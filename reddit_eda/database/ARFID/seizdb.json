My freezer is currently full of various pizza meals: bagel bites, little personal pizzas, full pizzas... haven't got the energy to make my favourite meal even though it takes roughly the same amount of time to cook.\n\nA good motivator for me is having something nice to drink that isn't just water.  I figure if I'll go out of my way to buy and pour a tall glass of iced tea, I might as well make a meal to go with it!",

I still struggle with eating enough and regularly, and I found out that when my depression decides it hates me it makes it a lot worse unfortunately.\n\nA friend gave me the advice to just go ahead and make something; if the smell of the food doesn\u2019t make me want to eat it, then surely the first few forced bites will? The idea is that once I get started with baby steps, then I\u2019ll have an easier time actually completing the task. This helps me sometimes. Saying \u201cJust eat, you\u2019ll feel better\u201d sounds kind of like dismissing the problem, but it helps me to tell myself that anyway.\n\nIt also helps to have small replacements for chocolate/sweets. I buy yogurt cups and when I have no appetite but need to eat, I try to go for those regardless if it\u2019s breakfast, lunch, or dinner time haha. They\u2019re pretty effortless and safe for me. I also love baking, so having something semi-healthy like banana bread for the next few days helps too.",
