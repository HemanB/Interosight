  "selftext": "Hey everyone!!! With your guy\u2019s help I got the courage to tell him! We were working out and he had offered me food, that\u2019s when I told him. I sat him down and explained very thoroughly what ARFID was and how I\u2019m struggling with it. Y\u2019now what he says? \u201cOh that\u2019s okay, so what other set do you want to do?\u201d I was like \u201cwhATt??! Y-you\u2019re not bothered by it?\u201d He simply gave me a hug and a kiss and called me silly for over reacting. Crazy! Anyways thank you to everyone that helped me and supported me!! \u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udd70\n\n\nY\u2019all if I don\u2019t marry this man, I swear to god-",

I started dating a guy at the beginning of November and I was initially very hesitant to eat around him or discuss food (y\u2019all know how it goes), especially because he\u2019s kind of a foodie, but when we finally discussed it head-on and he was so kind about it! Basically just told me \u201cI\u2019d love to work on this with you, but if all you ever eat around me is chicken tenders and fries, that\u2019s okay too.\u201d So glad to see your similar experience!",

My GF (hi, honey, you lurker!) just moved in with me, and she just last night was fine with me getting my own food while she heated up leftovers (a huge problem for me). We both know it\u2019s going to be a slog where food is concerned; but she loves me enough to put in the effort, so I\u2019d be a fool not to do the same.\n\nI wish you and your fella as much luck and success as I feel I\u2019ve had, with more to come for all of us.",
