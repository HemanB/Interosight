  "title": "finally found a way to eat salad!",
  "selftext": "hi all, this is my first post here. i struggle with arfid a lot and have never EVER been able to eat salad. i worked at a fancy salad restaurant for a few months in high school and tried all of the dressings but they all tasted so gross to me. just the smell of ranch makes me nauseous. i thought i would never be able to eat salad, but i finally learned how to make a salad that i like! i thought i would share it in case any of you might wanna try out this \u201crecipe.\u201d \n\nmy major safe foods are pizza and pasta. i crave pizza everyday and honestly tend to order pizza multiple times a week. usually just cheese with light sauce and baked well done. (it has to be well done or else i can\u2019t eat it, but that\u2019s another story) \n\ni have been trying to eat healthier in order to lose some weight, and i wanted to try approaching salad again. i tried to think of what my favorite flavors are, and by doing so, i came up with the perfect \u201cdressing\u201d to put on greens. (i\u2019ve been trying different greens and so far romaine has been the easiest for me to eat)\n\nso basically i just mix a bit of olive oil, grated parmesan cheese, garlic powder, salt, and rosemary in a bowl and then pour it over the greens! and then i sprinkle a lot of parmesan because it\u2019s my number one safe food. and then the salad just tastes like parmesan and garlic! yum!! \n\ni still end up with uneaten leaves that look too suspicious to eat... especially any brown pieces or anything that looks \u201coff\u201d but i guess that\u2019s just arfid for ya!\n\ni\u2019m really proud to say that i haven\u2019t had pizza in over a week. i have been making this salad for lunch everyday! the flavors are similar enough to pizza/pasta that it satisfies the craving!",
