Dude yelled in fear when he heard the word \u201ctuna\u201d and almost started tearing up at the sight of butter noodles. \ud83d\ude2d Like me, He takes issues with things like food touching and multiple different textures or flavors at once which is so relatable for me.

      "body": "I agree I\u2019d LOVE that arc! But I do wanna add some context to what barb said a little bit cuz I feel like while her comment was insensitive, the context makes it less bad kinda. Gregory in this episode was struggling with his ARFID a lot. He was looking for help to expand his tastes bc his gf was really excited about this fine dining course and he wanted to share that experience with her. The root of his ARFID was caused by growing up in a military family where they only ate specific meals that provided necessary sustenance and never expanded beyond that. Being a product of strict tough love parenting is a big part of his character. So a motherly figure like barb implementing that kinda\u2026harsh tough love approach in order to HELP him to try new things, even if she was kinda insensitive about it, I feel was effective and rly helped him ease his anxieties a bit. There\u2019s a scene where Barbara sneaks truffle into butter noodles\u2026which could\u2019ve gone very poorly I admit but it was actually a really sweet encounter. After realizing he tried something new and didn\u2019t hate it, he smiles and says \u201cit\u2019s nice\u2026to feel hope\u201d. I thought it was really cute cuz although barb didn\u2019t understand it, she saw it was weighing on him and causing him stress and tried her best to help him yk?\n\nEdit: also wanna add on that they didn\u2019t make it seem like trying something new just magically relieved him of his ARFID haha which i loved cuz that\u2019s where it seemed like the episode was going. But if u watch the ending scene they clear that up! I\u2019d tell you about it but this comment is long enough and I\u2019m off my adhd meds so I\u2019m rambling.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k1ymsqyzdlge1.jpeg?width=5498&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0b1cda3940ba91ffdb7a089c7c2afc8bb3593b0e",
