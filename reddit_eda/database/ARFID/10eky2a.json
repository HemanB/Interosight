  "selftext": "Hey fellow ARFID sufferers. \n\nJust wanted to let y'all know that I have spent the past few months directing an ARFID documentary. We wrap on it later this month and hope to have a premiere sometime in upcoming months as it goes to the festival circuit. \n\nI made this to help raise awareness to ARFID as so many people have no idea it even exists. \n\nCheck out the trailer below for \"Not Just a Picky Eater\"!\n\n[https://youtu.be/bpVL4P8CqL8](https://youtu.be/bpVL4P8CqL8)",
