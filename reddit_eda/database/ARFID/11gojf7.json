  "selftext": "I started seeing a new dietician who explicitly told me that he was experienced with ARFID. Turns out, he thinks ARFID is \u201cjust\u201d severe picky eating (I am diagnosed with a predominant \u201clack of interest\u201d subtype) and not only told me that 1. my ARFID was actually anorexia but also 2. that the solution to my intense lack of interest in food and food aversions is to \u201cjust eat\u201d. \n\nNeedless to say, I ended things. I wish there was better representation for how diverse ARFID can be.\n\nEdit: grammar",

The 'advice' I received ranged from \"just eat more\", \"just eat a wider variety of food\", \"she's not losing lots of weight so she's fine\", and \"if this was my daughter, I'd have a go at her for trying to skive off school and send her right back in\".\n\nit was only after it morphed into anorexia that my mum did a 'carers course' where they discussed other EDs, and she rushed up tome afterwards going \"I've found it! I've found out what was wrong with you!\"\n\nI sincerely hope you find more helpful, supportive and compassionate care.",
