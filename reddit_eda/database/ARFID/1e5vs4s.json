  "selftext": "I have been eating the Zone Perfect cookie dough bars for a few years as part of my breakfast. I recently found out that they discontinued the whole line of Zone Perfect bars. Has anyone found a suitable replacement in the form of a protein bar? It seems like every single one I find is going to end up with me having issues with the texture.\n\n\nEdit: Thank you all for all the help and suggestions! I thought I would add some ones that I have tried.\n\n\nQuest Bars: I didn\u2019t really like these. They are dry and kinda chalky. Also gave me a headache on days I ate them.\n\n\nOne Bars: These are decent, but expensive. I have been buying them on Amazon and they sustained me well. I tried both the chocolate chip and the Hersheys cookies and cream. They were both fairly good.\n\n\nPure Protein: I like these ones. I got the comic chocolate brownie and the lemon cake. Both are good and the texture is good and has a little crunch to it.\n\n\nI hope everyone is doing well in their search to find new protein bars!!",

      "body": "Same here! I called the company earlier this week after finding my local supermarket shelves empty in the space where my beloved Zone Perfect bars had been. The rep confirmed the discontinuation, but wouldn't say why (of course), and suggested that I \"stock up\" from the remaining supply. She pointed me to the abbottlabs store (abbottstore.com), but said that other retailers would probably have more stock and greater selection--which I found to be true.\n\nIt was today when my Amazon order of 6 x 20-bar boxes was delivered. I'd have bought more, but the price + storage space required prohibits it. At least this supply will give me an off-ramp and some time to find a replacement.\n\nIt took a long time to come upon ZonePerfect, though, and these bars have been part of my morning routine for years now--at home and while traveling, so I am bracing my palate, taste buds, and wallet for the inevitable dreaded search for a replacement.  : (",

I don't care for the chewiness of granola or oatmeal and was very happy with the satisfying crunch of these ZonePerfect bars.\n\nI'm trying out alternatives and haven't found anything close to the chocolate crunch of ZonePerfect. It seems nearly everything else is based on nuts, granola, or oatmeal... making them chewy.\n\nI tried a **think! brownie crunch** bar (I was hopeful, since it has \"crunch\" in the name)... boy was that was a mistake. Beyond chewy. I'm not sure those are food. It felt like I was chewing on a stage prop. Yuck!\n\nI tried a **chocolate brownie Clif Bar**. The think! bar experience set a very low \"bar\", so I found the Clif Bar at least edible. But still, much chewier than a ZonePerfect Double Dark Chocolate bar.\n\nOthers I l plan to try (though not optimistically):\n\n* **Clif Bar Crunchy Peanut Butter** - I prefer chocolate, but could compromise if these are crunchier\n* **Nature Valley Protein Chewy Bars** - not hopeful based on the name\n* **RXBAR Chocolate Sea Salt**\n* **Power Crunch Protein Bars**\n\nIf anybody finds something close to resembling ZonePerfect Double Dark Chocolate bars in taste & crunchiness, please share!",

The texture is very similar and the strawberry tastes like strawberry yogurt zone bars. They also have a chocolate peanut butter flavor I haven't tried. 12g protein and 9g fiber in each bar.\n\n[https://www.kroger.com/p/kellogg-s-special-k-bar-strawberry-protein-meal-bars/](https://www.kroger.com/p/kellogg-s-special-k-bar-strawberry-protein-meal-bars/)\n\nI also like the taste/texture of Z bars, especially the cookies and cream, but these bars have lower protein content (5g/bar). Still better than the 2g you get from regular granola bars. (2g fiber).\n\n[https://www.kroger.com/p/zbar-protein-cookies-n-creme-snack-bars/](https://www.kroger.com/p/zbar-protein-cookies-n-creme-snack-bars/) \n\nThis is not a bar, but I have mainly replaced my morning Zone bar for breakfast with these Mush brand pre-made \"overnight\" oats (overnight in quotations because they are pre-hydrated so can be eaten at any time). They come in regular and protein options, and the protein oats have 15g of protein. They are sold in the yogurt section at Kroger.\n\n[https://www.kroger.com/p/mush-protein-peanut-butter-overnight-oats-cup](https://www.kroger.com/p/mush-protein-peanut-butter-overnight-oats-cup)\n\nOvernight protein oats are also very easy to make yourself with some whole oats,  protein in the form of Greek yogurt, protein powder, or peanut butter (regular or powdered), any type of milk (or coffee) to hydrate the mix overnight, and lots of options for flavoring (bananas, berries, cinnamon, nuts, vanilla). It took me a while to get over the texture, but I like that these are less processed than store-bought protein bars. Its also easy to add fiber in the form of chia or flax seeds or psyllium husks. \n\n [https://feelgoodfoodie.net/recipe/overnight-oats/](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/recipe/overnight-oats/)\n\nAnyway, good luck to anyone else  out there still trying to replace the zone bar shaped hole in their lives :')",

David Cinnamon Roll bar/ 150 calories\u00a0\n\nProtein Crispnis the closest in consistency and flavor. It is not as sweet as the Zone was but it is as close as I\u2019ve found. Quest is a close consistency but it is a little more sweet than Zone was. The David bar has a good flavor. It has a similar consistency in the middle once you bite through the coating.

I\u2019ve tried Quest, but that literally tastes like eating a spoonful of protein powder it\u2019s so bad.

I don't care for the chewiness of granola or oatmeal and was very happy with the satisfying crunch of these ZonePerfect bars.\n\nI'm trying out alternatives and haven't found anything close to the chocolate crunch of ZonePerfect. It seems nearly everything else is based on nuts, granola, or oatmeal... making them chewy.\n\nI tried a **think! brownie crunch** bar (I was hopeful, since it has \"crunch\" in the name)... boy was that was a mistake. Beyond chewy. I'm not sure those are food. It felt like I was chewing on a stage prop. Yuck!\n\nI tried a **chocolate brownie Clif Bar**. The think! bar experience set a very low \"bar\", so I found the Clif Bar at least edible. But still, much chewier than a ZonePerfect Double Dark Chocolate bar.\n\nOthers I l plan to try (though not optimistically):\n\n* **Clif Bar Crunchy Peanut Butter** - I prefer chocolate, but could compromise if these are crunchier\n* **Nature Valley Protein Chewy Bars** - not hopeful based on the name\n* **RXBAR Chocolate Sea Salt**\n* **Power Crunch Protein Bars**\n\nIf anybody finds something close to resembling ZonePerfect Double Dark Chocolate bars in taste & crunchiness, please share!",
