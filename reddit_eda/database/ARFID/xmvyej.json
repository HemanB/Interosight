For those with high numbers, a word of encouragement\u2026 There are categories on here, such as pork, that are very broad. My child will not eat any sort of pork, except bacon, which she loves. She likes pitted black olives, but no other kind of olive. If you may think you have ruled out a category, there might be yet some item that in the future you can add to your list. She has yet to find ANY condiment she likes, but does like salt/savory taste, cinnamon flavor, and will tolerate some garlic salt so that has been her way into some foods she didn\u2019t eat before. At one time she did not like butter on anything, but has learned to like it, because she gradually let us add some on plain spaghetti noodles with salt.",

I've tried others but they just don't work.",
