My nurse practitioner that treats my depression says I need to eat certain things for my PMS issues. She tells me \"just eat it\". My homework was to eat spinach. I never did and I'm going to have to tell her I never did at my appointment today.\n\nWhy isn't this taken seriously like anorexia, bulimia and binge eating? It impacts our lives and is very hard to deal with. We don't WANT to be this way.",

It causes me a lot of physical distress being physically incapable of swallowing certain foods and unlike normal people I can't just \"choke it down\" as my body will go into full rejection mode and I'll likely get sick on the spot.\n\nPressing the fact that my physical response to the food was not voluntary was what got me diagnosed, and it might be time to ask for another therapist if they're refusing to listen. Even if you get treatment through a very specific place you should be able to ask to schedule with a different person. If asked why, tell them it's because you don't think their treatment style is right for you and you didn't feel listened to. If they press further, you should explain this exact situation and the reactions to your potential issues they have. Getting better is about what works for the patient, so forcing you to stay with healthcare professionals who aren't giving you what you need, you can leave them.",

      "body": "Building off this: if your therapist puts expectations on you, including giving you homework that they hassle you about, they are not trying to help you; they are trying to *fix* you. There is a HUGE difference. I went through ABA (Applied Behavioral Analysis)-based therapy for my ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) and my therapists were not trying to accommodate my needs to make my life better; they were examining my behavior and using punishments (mostly tacit disappointment) and rewards to make me comply with their standards of what a \"normal\" teenager should be like. Including having me put a textural desensitization \"toothbrush\" in my mouth to try to force me to overcome my textural food aversions, because the range of foods I ate was not \"normal.\"\n\nThis attitude that we need to \"fix\" people in these ways is toxic. It breeds self-shaming and a people-pleasing attitude in patients. Conditional praise feels like conditional love, and it fucks with your head. It's toxic to pressure people into putting things in their mouth they're not comfortable with. It's toxic to chide them for not eating certain things. It's toxic to withhold praise until they do so. We don't need to be fixed; we need to have our physical *and psychological* needs met. And psychologically, it's very, *very* unhealthy to be told, even implicitly, that you have to be fixed. Especially when it's something inherent to you that most likely *can't* be fixed.\n\nWhen I left for college and stopped getting that horrible toxic \"therapy,\" I eventually started opening up to new foods and trying them, not because anyone told me to but because my friends were eating and cooking them and I was curious. I discovered a lot of things that I liked, and a lot of things that I didn't. In fact, it was such a positive experience for me that I then went to culinary school and worked in multiple restaurants! To this day I'm particular about the foods I eat, but I grew and learned more than ever when I was not told I had to try things or made to feel ashamed for not liking things. People like us may be more hesitant to try new foods for whatever reasons we have, but that doesn't mean we aren't curious or that we don't want to grow. It just means we want to do it at our own pace, on our own terms. And that is what's best for us.",
