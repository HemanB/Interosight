  "title": "Warning: If you have ARFID, make sure you monitor your health",
  "selftext": "I'm 53 years old, and have had sensory/sensitive ARFID my entire life. My diet has always been heavily into things like pizza, fries, burgers, bread, and pasta--no fruits or vegetables (I find even looking at them revolting). I have a very limited diet. I don't eat many sugary things though--knowing that I have an unhealthy diet, I've tried my best to avoid problems from drinking soda pop and having tons of ice cream and things like that. I drink water and try to use low-fat cheese where I can, etc.\n\nAlthough I'm not obese, I've always had high triglycerides, despite being fairly active and doing lots of sports things. I've just kind of ignored it and said \"whatever is going to happen will happen, it's all due to my ARFID and there's nothing I can do about it.\" Well, it turns out this has finally come to bite me. After a month of feeling progressively vaguely worse and worse, with bowel habits changing, I finally had an \"attack\" on September 25. Turns out, this was acute pancreatitis brought on by the high triglycerides. I was lucky--pancreatitis can be quite severe and even fatal. My case was mild, but I'm still in recovery mode. It's been a very, very rough ride these past couple of months. (Make sure you go to your doctor if you notice your bowel habits changing, folks. I ignored it and it cost me bigtime.) The scary thing about pancreatitis, too, is that it can recur worse each time, and eventually become chronic, at which point you have a major permanent health problem on your hands. A bad fatty diet can also lead to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which is insidious because it often has no symptoms until you have cirrhosis of the liver (permanent scarring/damage).\n\nI'm writing this not to scare anyone, but simply to caution you--if you have an unhealthy diet due to ARFID, make sure you at least monitor your health, speak to a doctor, get regular blood work checkups, and try to do something about any high cholesterol or triglycerides you may have. For example, I've managed to modify my diet entirely by at least having fish and chicken as protein sources at mealtime (leaner meat) rather than burgers. An air fryer has been a GODSEND for this--I used to hate fish because it tasted \"fishy\", but baking the fish in the air fryer and sprinkling some cayenne pepper/paprika mix I made onto the fish once it's done has turned it into delicious-tasting meat--no more \"fishy taste\"!\n\nI've cut out pizza and have instead found some high-fiber bagels I like and I coat those in a bit of tomato sauce and just a TINY bit of low-fat cheese, and I also get some chia and sesame seeds on the bagels for more healthy fat/fiber. Instead of white rice, I trained myself to eat brown rice (I never was able to before, but this was a small and easy step I was able to make--and honestly, now I'm almost embarrassed at how long it took me, because brown rice tastes almost exactly like white rice).\n\nI'm going to have to try to do some ARFID treatment to be able to eat at least SOME fruits and vegetables--I'm sure I won't get to the point of being freely able to eat anything like most people, but as long as I can focus on a very small number of them and start with that, maybe that will at least be enough to keep me healthy. *Don't worry about making big changes--just focus on multiple small, incremental steps over time.* It's something I'm hoping I can do, and I hope you can all too. Stay healthy everyone!",

      "body": "This is a very tricky question. There are some supplements that *may* help with certain things--for instance, turmeric/curcumin may have some anti-inflammatory effects. But I would caution you against just popping a bunch of supplements without medical advice to do so. Maybe just look into the subject and bring some ideas to your doctor and ask if they think it'd be a good idea.\n\nBut definitely, definitely get that blood work done. Ever since I was a kid I used to be scared of needles, I would faint. And now I just go \"ho hum, another day at the office\"--just look away, close my eyes, and it's over and done with in 20 seconds with only the most miniscule childish pinprick kind of discomfort (sometimes not even that). The blood work is what will save you from a lot of things. Check it regularly. In my case it showed my lipase levels indicated pancreatitis, which was subsequently confirmed via a CT scan of my abdomen.\n\nAnd as for making changes--believe me, *you can*. If I can, anyone can. Again--don't try to make a huge change. Take a couple of hours one weekend and make a list of all the bad things you eat or do in one column. Then, next to that, in the right column, write in any small changes you can make. So for instance, one of my things was \"I only eat white rice, which can raise triglycerides.\" It turns out brown rice doesn't have the same effect, so I said \"maybe I can make this small change and switch from white rice to being able to eat brown rice.\" I then had a single grain of brown rice. It tasted almost exactly like white rice. I had a little more. Same thing. Then I smacked myself in the head with my hand for being this stupid for this long--they taste almost exactly the same.\n\nAnother example--I wasn't a huge fan of fish, and in particular salmon, which is very healthy. I wanted to eat salmon, but every time I did, it just tasted so...salmony and fishy. So I hardly ate it, ever. After my pancreatitis hit, I learned my trick of using the air fryer to get rid of the salmony/fishy taste, and then sprinkling my cayenne pepper/paprika spice mix on it. I also now break up the salmon into chunks and put them on taco shells, and eat them as fish tacos (I love beef tacos!). Total gamechanger--now I LOVE salmon, particular when eaten in fish tacos, and I eat it all the time--so yummy. Old me would NEVER have eaten that.\n\nDo small things like that, incrementally, over time, and it will eventually add up to making a positive change. Don't think to yourself \"I have to make all these massive changes and there's no way I can do that!\" You're right--you likely can't. But the small changes will make a difference.",

      "body": "First step: Forget food for a minute. Put that aside. \n\nNext: Go to a doctor, explain your situation and concerns, and get blood work. That will establish where you're at as a \"baseline\". It will identify any health problems you may be at risk for--make sure at the very least the blood work looks at markers for potential diabetes, liver disease, cholesterol levels, and triglycerides. \n\nOnce you have your blood work done, face the results. Take a step back and look at the results closely, carefully. If you don't understand them, ask your doctor.\n\nOnce you know what the results indicate in terms of risks, then look at ways you can make SMALL changes. For example--you said you eat pasta. I take it that's regular pasta. Do you eat brown rice pasta? If not, maybe that's something you can try (I've eaten both--they taste almost identical). Brown rice pasta maybe then gets you able to eat brown rice, which is a healthier food than regular pasta. It doesn't mean you can never eat regular pasta again--just trying to expand things even slightly.\n\nLook at simple things you can substitute. For example--you said you eat pizza. How about a pizza bagel? I love both. If you can stomach a pizza bagel (pretty much a pizza except with bagel bread under it instead of pizza bread, which is almost identical), then maybe you can try a pizza bagel with some chia seeds on it (chia seeds are tasteless and can be good for health). If you can do that, then maybe some time later you can keep the chia seeds, ditch the pizza topping on the bagel, and put something else on it.\n\nIf you do crisps, then maybe you can make your own healthier version instead of store-bought. Look up recipes for \"homemade healthier crisps\" on youtube.\n\nAs I said--these are all small steps. Don't look at it as \"I have so much I have to change in big ways, I'll never be able to.\" You're right. Instead of doing that, do much much smaller incremental steps. Tiny steps. Make 100 of those tiny steps add up to one big step instead of trying to do the one big step all at once.",

          "body": "First step: Forget food for a minute. Put that aside. \n\nNext: Go to a doctor, explain your situation and concerns, and get blood work. That will establish where you're at as a \"baseline\". It will identify any health problems you may be at risk for--make sure at the very least the blood work looks at markers for potential diabetes, liver disease, cholesterol levels, and triglycerides. \n\nOnce you have your blood work done, face the results. Take a step back and look at the results closely, carefully. If you don't understand them, ask your doctor.\n\nOnce you know what the results indicate in terms of risks, then look at ways you can make SMALL changes. For example--you said you eat pasta. I take it that's regular pasta. Do you eat brown rice pasta? If not, maybe that's something you can try (I've eaten both--they taste almost identical). Brown rice pasta maybe then gets you able to eat brown rice, which is a healthier food than regular pasta. It doesn't mean you can never eat regular pasta again--just trying to expand things even slightly.\n\nLook at simple things you can substitute. For example--you said you eat pizza. How about a pizza bagel? I love both. If you can stomach a pizza bagel (pretty much a pizza except with bagel bread under it instead of pizza bread, which is almost identical), then maybe you can try a pizza bagel with some chia seeds on it (chia seeds are tasteless and can be good for health). If you can do that, then maybe some time later you can keep the chia seeds, ditch the pizza topping on the bagel, and put something else on it.\n\nIf you do crisps, then maybe you can make your own healthier version instead of store-bought. Look up recipes for \"homemade healthier crisps\" on youtube.\n\nAs I said--these are all small steps. Don't look at it as \"I have so much I have to change in big ways, I'll never be able to.\" You're right. Instead of doing that, do much much smaller incremental steps. Tiny steps. Make 100 of those tiny steps add up to one big step instead of trying to do the one big step all at once.",

We may gag, retch, vomit, whatever, but we'd find a way. So by definition that means there's always \"room for improvement.\" The real question is how to improve in a way that works sustainably for each of us, doesn't make us want to vomit, etc.\n\nFor some it's harder than others. I've never eaten vegetables in my life before and the mere idea makes me want to vomit. I can't imagine anyone being worse than that. My plan is to try to find some ways to eat tiny, tiny amounts--like crumb-sized--to start with, and go from there. I also plan to try to drench the vegetables in some kind of spice mix I like, to try to overwhelm the taste. There are always things to try. This group itself has some very helpful suggestions. Again--small steps, not big ones. I wound up being able to eat brown rice after not being able to for some time, because I could only stomach white rice. Brown rice was at least close enough that I could make the incremental step of trying to expand by diet by that tiny small amount.\n\nSomeone also recommended the Picky Eater's Recovery Book (https://www.amazon.ca/Picky-Eaters-Recovery-Book-Restrictive/dp/1108796176), which is written by clinicians and seems to have some great advice that I haven't fully delved into yet.",
