By 57 I\u2019ve gotten used to being the major problem when it comes to meal time. A few months ago when I learned about ARFID it was a relief to know I have an ED. \n\nI\u2019ve always been the pickiest eater anyone knows. As a kid I learned to bring food for myself any time we went anywhere. I learned to cook at an early age and took over cooking for the family as a preteen including doing menu planning and grocery shopping with mom. I\u2019m the one who makes other people feel better about their picky eating kids. Typical \u201cpicky eaters\u201d feel so much better after meeting me because they aren\u2019t \u201cthat bad.\u201d \n\nHaving lived with this for so long I\u2019ve learned how to deal with family, friends, restaurants, bosses, and explaining why I probably won\u2019t be able to eat food cooked at peoples houses. For many years I had a handy list of safe foods and at the top it stated only specific brands, cooked exactly right so better to let me cook it there or bring to reheat, and a number of other factors so no food was a a given until right before it was time to eat although certain packaged snacks and cheese (unless I was having dairy issues which come and go) were safer than anything cooked. \n\nThe foods I can eat have expanded over the years. Some of my safe foods are the same from childhood. Other safe foods from childhood no longer are safe. \n\nI hope you all find ways to get over your sense of shame as well as add additional foods to your safe list.",

I'm definitely better and have less aversion than people here who might be younger than me (I'm 34. So been working on including more in my diet to be healthier  for the last 15 years.) My biggest problems are snacking and soda. I am quitting smoking too. I have 2 kids now and I want to be there and I'm like 280lbs at 5'1\". So I need to work on my health so I can watch my kids grow up. (I am the non birth mom in a lesbian relationship so they aren't related to me genetically, so they don't have autism or arfid like me). It's been a slow and arduous journey but I am able to eat A LOT more than most people here probably. Lately we tried Every Plate meal kit and that helped because I could pick a handful of stuff I wanted to eat from a menu and then be able to cook it up ourselves has been a huge help in prep and shop time too.\n\nI always just told people I was picky. If people can't accept that then I don't really care for outside opinions lol.",
