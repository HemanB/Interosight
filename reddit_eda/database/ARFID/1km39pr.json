      "body": "FWIW, my ARFID kid THINKS this way, but when we get it together and do blind taste tests with subtly different ingredients to things like his Mac & Cheese or nuggets, he will just as often prefer the \"misprepared\" version. Then, when we tell him which was prepared in the familiar way, he will refuse to eat the differently prepared one even though he preferred it moments earlier. \n\nFor him at least, it seems to me that his ARFID is deeply linked to the feeling that his life is out of control, likely as a consequence of being a child of divorce and having a workaholic tough it out dad and a mom with medical issues and a tendency to get overstimulated and retreat in the face of typical kid chaos (I'm the stepdad). \n\nI also think that as a kid, there's a fear of \"give an inch, take a mile\". If he accepts for instance that he likes mac and cheese prepared in various ways from various brands, that invites discussions about other ways he might be surprisingly flexible, which leads ot discussions about trying other new foods. This issue crops up with most exposures that succeed. He will happily try and sometimes enjoy a food and eat it a few times, but when it comes to normalizing it, he shuts down because I think there's an anticipation that comes with that of being asked to try something new, which his ARFID brain tells him will be repulsive even though he has no idea.",

Not that he's passing messages between parents... it's more like just inconsistencies about so many rules. \n\nI think in the big picture though he has sort of taken on this diplomat position where he's so worried about keeping his parents in the right mindset (his dad's temper, his mom's anxiety) that he silence's his own emotions. For whatever reason, food has become his unconscious way of fighting back for control... at least that's my theory.\n\nI would agree that if he is ever able to get to a place where he feels more in control of the other aspects of his life, it would help him also feel more willing to try new foods.",

Then, when we tell him which was prepared in the familiar way, he will refuse to eat the differently prepared one even though he preferred it moments earlier. \n\nFor him at least, it seems to me that his ARFID is deeply linked to the feeling that his life is out of control, likely as a consequence of being a child of divorce and having a workaholic tough it out dad and a mom with medical issues and a tendency to get overstimulated and retreat in the face of typical kid chaos (I'm the stepdad). \n\nI also think that as a kid, there's a fear of \"give an inch, take a mile\". If he accepts for instance that he likes mac and cheese prepared in various ways from various brands, that invites discussions about other ways he might be surprisingly flexible, which leads ot discussions about trying other new foods. This issue crops up with most exposures that succeed. He will happily try and sometimes enjoy a food and eat it a few times, but when it comes to normalizing it, he shuts down because I think there's an anticipation that comes with that of being asked to try something new, which his ARFID brain tells him will be repulsive even though he has no idea.",
