I can register that a dish made with certain foods looks good! I would love to eat a Krabby Patty if I could but the lettuce, tomatoes, and pickles would be too moist and crunchy and soft and sour and the bread would be soggy... I hate it so much because something looks so good but I know that it just won't be. I know that certain foods in certain ways just won't do well with any of my texture issues, and I HATE bitter foods and can not stand them. \n\nA lot of the time people will go \"oh but you liked this food that had this\" and the reason why is that the food wasn't made to where the ingredient goes against all of my texture and taste issues. I have no reason to hate something that has cooked onions and celery because I built up the courage over a decade and a half to finally try them and found out I can eat them if they're cooked to softness. If the food isn't a texture tornado and isn't bitter, but I don't like it, I just won't eat a lot either. The social pressure sucks because sure I can eat pad thai or my dad's porkchops, but I don't like either. So I just take a few bites until I'm \"full\" and then leave. There are just so many people who think they know more than you about what you like and so many people think that because you're \"a bit picky\", you're just being a jerk to everyone around you. They don't understand that being unable to eat certain foods physically and mentally without getting sick or vomiting is a genuine issue for you.",

I won't make myself food because if I throw it out I feel super guilty for wasting food, my parents always made a big deal out of it. \n\nTbf, they are also boomers and both of them grew up poor af in the 1940s and 50s, so they havent had a lot. My dad's family had 7 kids and both parents were immigrants and barely spoke English, and my mom's family was single mom for most of her life, so they grew up POOR. You ate what was there or nothing at all. \n\nUnfortunately this is one of those times where their insecurities made issues in my head down the line on top of the ARFID because now I hear in my head that Im an awful person leaving food behind - it took their food control and insecurity issues and made them a whole new level in my head. \n\nIf you can, its been a big help for me having someone willing to make food for me and help me find ways to feel its not wasted. My husband is happy to make things during flare ups, like the last few months have been hard... so he gets home from work, Ive been feeding the toddler all day and he asks if I ate. No... so he kinda just steps in and makes food after naming things he could make and if I don't finish it, or can't even start it, he helps me through the mental issues of wasting it. \"It's not wasted, it's just not being eaten by you.\" If it's something that can have the bitten parts cut off, he trims it up and if my toddler was trying to steal it he'll cut it up for her so I don't feel guilty. Sometimes he just cuts it up smaller to begin with so I dont even need to think to bite it - i can do \"mindless snack\" style eating and split it with her from the start, so it comes across as \"i can have what i can, and the rest is hers\" and I'm not as stressed. If I cant cut it up or the toddler doesnt want it, and it's dog friendly? My dog has a great snack!\n\nYou deserve to eat. Your body deserves it. Its been through so much already <3 try and find a \"food buddy\", any friends or family members that are willing to just have a meal with you and help with talking through it. Its hard, I know it is. I have 2 friends that are on board too - and it turns out they are willing to help just as much as I would be for them :)\n\nYou've got this. Try and have an extra snack today, and I'll try too. Ok?",

I can register that a dish made with certain foods looks good! I would love to eat a Krabby Patty if I could but the lettuce, tomatoes, and pickles would be too moist and crunchy and soft and sour and the bread would be soggy... I hate it so much because something looks so good but I know that it just won't be. I know that certain foods in certain ways just won't do well with any of my texture issues, and I HATE bitter foods and can not stand them. \n\nA lot of the time people will go \"oh but you liked this food that had this\" and the reason why is that the food wasn't made to where the ingredient goes against all of my texture and taste issues. I have no reason to hate something that has cooked onions and celery because I built up the courage over a decade and a half to finally try them and found out I can eat them if they're cooked to softness. If the food isn't a texture tornado and isn't bitter, but I don't like it, I just won't eat a lot either. The social pressure sucks because sure I can eat pad thai or my dad's porkchops, but I don't like either. So I just take a few bites until I'm \"full\" and then leave. There are just so many people who think they know more than you about what you like and so many people think that because you're \"a bit picky\", you're just being a jerk to everyone around you. They don't understand that being unable to eat certain foods physically and mentally without getting sick or vomiting is a genuine issue for you.",
