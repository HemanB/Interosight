  "selftext": "ive lived with the lack of interest subtype my whole life and tbh it seems to be pretty uncommon in people with arfid. i feel like even though im in a community with people who understand its also not the same experience you know?? i don't fear contamination or choking or vomiting or any of that. i just don't like food and it makes me feel lazy or like im just finding reasons to complain. \n\nim physically never hungry, and i can go without eating until i start to physically shake. i hate eating. it feels like a chore to me. ill eat the foods i like where i can because at least then it's halfway of an enjoyable experience. there's more foods i CAN eat but usually don't bc i just... don't want them and im not interested in them. \n\nim also willing to try SOME things, but if i don't like it immediately then im out. some foods still make me gag though. can't stand smelling or seeing them or being around them. i feel like the only foods i actually WANT all the time and would like to try are sweets, bc candy is usually always safe for me. it sucks!! i know trying food won't kill me, but im afraid of wasting money or having a bad experience or hating food even more. but i feel like if i don't expand my diet, it makes me lazy. after all, im not AFRAID of dying or anything...ugh :(",

Constantly spending all day in the kitchen, wasting money on food that goes bad, needing to plan meals ahead of time, planning to make sure food doesn't go bad, cleaning the dishes, drying the dishes, putting away the dishes, touching dirty dishes, smelling rotten food, seeing rotten food, chopping up food, washing food, calculating nutrition to make sure you get all that the nutrients you need. Just food and everything that comes with it, I hate it. I'm chronically malnourished and this will definitely be my cause of death/fatal illness.\n\nI remember once seeing a screenshot of someone say \"I'm a foodie\" on a dating site, and all the comments were like \"we're all foodies, that's what it means to be alive, you're not special\" and I could not disagree more. \n\nI hate food so much. Food is the bane of my existence. There are so few foods I can actually tolerate and they're not always affordable or accessible and it's so boring eating the same thing until I get sick of it and don't even get me started on the effort and energy needed for actually cooking and preparing food. OMG. \n\nAnyway. I relate. But you're right, it's not something I see often discussed on this subreddit, but it does exist. Glad you posted about it today.",
