  "title": "I am really terrified of rotten/moldy food",
  "selftext": "I, ever since I can remember, have always been afraid of rotten food. Milk expires in a day? Trash it its already bad. That chicken/beef have been sitting for a second day in the fridge uncooked? Spoiled. It has been cooked? No matter too bad I didn't eat it. Cheese has a moldy dot? That's been contaminated. Raw eggs? It's all mold on the inside after 5 days. That mentality kind of got me into my ed's I would either overeat so that I don't throw away, or I wouldn't eat until it was brought new.\nI once let a glass with a bit of juice in it and it had grown mold, I threw that glass away. Even thinking about it sends shivers. I would at times only eat fresh veggies and fruits because I am afraid that when I open my fridge it would just have mold in it.\n\nMy childhood was fine, nothing bad concerning food. My mam always provided at least something for us. Didn't have filled fridge but there was always something to eat.\n\nSomeone else experienced that? My heart is pounding even by thinking about it.",

Unless you leave milk sitting at room temperature it isn\u2019t going to make you sick despite what the date on the carton says. An astonishing amount of good food is wasted every day just because some companies wanted to avoid legal trouble.",

I still eat the bread after a while of working on those fears but there is still alot of picking and prodding and I think seeing actual mold on bread would horrify me out of eating it again, but moldy bread is super common and happens all the time so idk what I\u2019d do when I encounter that. I wish I could accurately smell and taste things so I could just trust my sences",

Looking at it sends me into a coughing fit, and I almost end up vomiting every time.\n\nI have a bad habit of leaving coffee mugs around the house, I don't know why. Maybe it's pure laziness, or I just forget. My husband usually takes care of my coffee cup conundrum, I don't leave them out all the time, I'm usually aware and take them straight to the sink/dishwasher, but on occasion there'll be a loose coffee cup hiding somewhere. \n\nToday, I found said hidden coffee cup. It had mold in it, and as hard as I tried not to gag or look at it, I still ended up in a coughing fit, tears running down my face and feeling the need to vomit. Luckily, I got it to the kitchen and poured it out and put it away, but I couldn't help but cry after. \n\nI can't stand the sight of mold on food or in drinks, if I see something has mold in it, I feel the need to put gloves on, even though it most likely wouldn't get on me in the first place. \n\nI'm ok with leftovers depending on what it is, after 2days in the fridge I don't want to look at it or touch it, the thought of cleaning the pot, bowl or plate that had food in it/on it makes me want to throw up. I can't help but gag and have to leave the room. \n\nThese things have caused me great distress in my life, and sometimes, it causes problems between me and my husband.\n\nToday was a huge accomplishment for me though, even though I gagged and cried, I managed to put the coffee cup away in the dishwasher. I usually wouldn't be able to do that much, but I'm proud of myself.",
