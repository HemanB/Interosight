It takes me at least 5 minutes to inspect & choose the \"best\" watermelon at the store. \n\nIf I'm honest, sometimes, I don't even cut it open right away because the fear it's going to be \"bad\" is overwhelming. It's like schroedinger's watermelon: as long as I don't cut it, it could still be \"good\"   Of course, then the anxiety makes me wait too long and by then it's gone bad and I end up throwing it in the compost.\n\nARFID problems....am I right??",

I love lots of fruits, but I can be very picky about the quality, and can\u2019t stand it if they\u2019ve gone mushy. I\u2019m personally a big fan of oranges, but I rarely eat them these days because when a orange isn\u2019t good it\u2019s really just *not good*. Also have problems with watermelon\u2014when the watermelon is a great ripeness I love the taste, but it seems that with most watermelon (with some exceptions), no matter what you do, there\u2019s going to be some sort of mush in there. And even when they don\u2019t have the black seeds, I still don\u2019t like the smaller brown seeds. Accidentally bought some seeded grapes that weren\u2019t even that great, they were soft\u2014didn\u2019t want to eat them, so now they\u2019re in my freezer until I figure out what to do with them.",
