  "selftext": "I love pizza and it is one of my favorite foods. I even work at a Dominos. I\u2019ve always been used to only regular cheese pizzas, but last night I made a barbecue chicken pizza and I have to say that I like it. Call it what you want. That\u2019s a victory for me.\n\nAnother reason why this is big. I absolutely hate trying new foods. I hate vegetables and fruits (but I\u2019ve never tried them).\n\nI wonder if this is a step in the right direction.",
