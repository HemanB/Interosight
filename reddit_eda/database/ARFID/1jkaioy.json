      "body": "So, I'll preface this with the fact that it was patience on both our parts more than anything. She didn't try to force or embarrass me about it, but continually suggested veggies. And I had to be patient and insistent with myself and my own gag reflex reactions. You know how it is with ARFID, I'm sure. I kept introducing the textures to my body and over time got used to them.\n\nWith broccoli, the key was cooking it properly. Boiled. Not underdone, not overdone. A little bit of salt and I think a very light amount of salad dressing for some flavor.\n\nBut the cauliflower she makes is absolutely divine. Roasts it in the oven, with a sprinkling of olive oil, crumbled bacon, home grown herbs, a very light sprinkling of pepper. She's asleep now and I didn't want to forget to answer, but I'll ask for more details later. It's a little different every time because it's not a recipe, she just knows how to cook.\n\nThe real key to working on my ARFID was to marry a cajun woman tbh. Her mission in life is to fatten me up.",
