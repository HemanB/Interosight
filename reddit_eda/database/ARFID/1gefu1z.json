Basically, the vagina has a natural balance of fungi and bacteria, which can get thrown out of whack in either direction for any number of reasons (douching, soap, sex, wiping improperly). A yeast \u201cinfection\u201d is an excess of the primary fungus in the vagina, which happens to be a species of yeast, closely related to species used in baking bread. *Bacterial vaginosis* is an overgrowth of bacteria in the vagina, and that\u2019s what smells like fish (and this is also not wholly a coincidence, because decaying fish contain lots of stinky bacteria).\n\nIt\u2019s a critical distinction, because they\u2019re treated in opposite ways (using antifungals to decrease yeast and promote bacteria, vs decreasing bacteria with antibiotics to promote yeast). The same mechanics make penicillin an effective antibiotic: penicillium (a fungus in the \u201cmold\u201d category) counteracts many species of bacteria that make us sick.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nFish smell = bacterial vaginosis\n\nBread smell = yeast infection\n\nThese infections are biological opposites and treating one as the other will make it much worse :(",
