They aren\u2019t trained on this and not one doctor in my entire city is trained in treating this and 2. Treatments are only available for children because once you become an adult it\u2019s very unlikely that anything will help you so they said I was a hopeless case. They see how bad my health has gotten and still don\u2019t wish to help or offer me any advice.
