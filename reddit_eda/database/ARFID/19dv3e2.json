And when you try to order it, they say you can\u2019t. Like why?? I got into a fight with a server because I just wanted a grilled cheese and it was kids menu only. I told him to charge me an adult meal then if that was the issue and he said \u201cthe issue is that ADULTS shouldn\u2019t need to eat the same thing as an 8 year old\u201d.",
