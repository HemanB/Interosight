  "selftext": "So I was at my best friend's house for a sleepover. For breakfast her mom made waffles (which I love) but they had blueberries in them \ud83e\udd22 when she saw I wasn't eating them she knew I was embarrassed and wouldn't want her mom to see so she took them from my plate and ate them. Doesn't sound like a lot but I REALLY appreciated that. So nice to have people support you",
