  "selftext": "I definitely have ARFID. When I was younger I was always super skinny because schools controlled the menu and I only ate on grilled cheese and chicken nugget day. Now that I\u2019m grown and bring my own lunch to work and choose what to get from the grocery store, it\u2019s like I\u2019ve been making up for lost time, and sometimes I just keep on eating. I am no longer skinny or even normal weight.\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve read, everyone here is skinny. Is that true?\n\nAlso, a big victory I\u2019ve had over the past year is adding tomatoes. If they\u2019re thinly sliced, I can eat them on a ham sub or on burgers. Haven\u2019t been able to share with people what a big deal this is because they don\u2019t understand.\n\nNext goal is either beans, corn, tomatoes in salads, or bananas.\n\nCheers",

Also after not getting to have safe foods and being forced to eat foods that made me puke a lot when I still lived with my parents lead to me 'shoveling' my safe foods in every day when I moved out and got to decide everything on my own. I couldn't get my mind to change from 'eat as much as you can, you might not get safe food for the next week' to 'it's fine, you can have this every day now, a normal portion is enough' for a long time.\n\nCongrats on your victory with the tomatoes!",
