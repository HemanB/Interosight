  "selftext": "Now I am in no way diminishing how incredibly deadly or important these eating disorders are or saying that the media shouldn\u2019t talk about them, because they should. Even now, eating disorders are still frowned upon and don\u2019t have enough awareness, whichever one they are. But sometimes I feel like the media only portrays eating disorders as people with body image issues or weight problems. And a majority of eating disorders are this way! But there are other ones, such as this one, ARFID. We don\u2019t have body image issues like Anorexia or Bulimia. (at least i don\u2019t think, i\u2019m not trying to assume everyone\u2019s issues or struggles). Whenever i tell someone I have an eating disorder, they think I have Anorexia or am disgusted by my body so they try to say \u201cyou\u2019re so pretty though! you aren\u2019t over weight at all\u201d or something like that, so I tell them about ARFID. I get that the media focuses on the more common and deadly eating disorders, but sometimes I just feel that ARFID or other ones should also have awareness. Maybe it\u2019s just because it is newer than the others. Maybe i\u2019m just being selfish. Who knows. Am I the only one who feels this way? An again im in no way saying that Anorexia or Bulimia SHOULDN\u2019T get awareness because they SHOULD.",

      "body": "I have felt this way for a long time! It\u2019s so incredibly frustrating how eating disorder professionals all over social media preach \u201cinclusivity\u201d and yet they rarely acknowledge or advocate for ARFID - it\u2019s so incredibly exclusive. Most advocacy and awareness for eating disorders centers on body image issue and/or diet culture, which definitely needs advocating for. I am not saying they don\u2019t deserve that but again, it\u2019s so exclusive. When I say eating disorder, people just assume I am restricting due to fear of weight gain or calories and that couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth. ARFID is so under-represented and I think what\u2019s especially frustrating is that the willingness of others to advocate and learn about it, isn\u2019t there.  Also, the media that does surround ARFID (although minimal) focuses on children. \n\nAnorexia and bulimia aside, even orthorexia gets more attention and advocacy in the media and it isn\u2019t even an actual diagnosable eating disorders (it\u2019s not in the DSM). And again, I\u2019m not saying it doesn\u2019t deserve to be advocated for but the lack of representation of ARFID from professionals, the media, etc., is so disheartening and frustrating.\n\nAnd, ARFID might be \u201cnew\u201d but only in the DSM - it\u2019s actually been around for so long but most just end up being misdiagnosed with anorexia.",

      "body": "It definitely isn't good cause there are some misconceptions that make it more difficult for an ARFID person to be understood. \nIt's not about just \"picky eating\", it's not just about not \"wanting\" to eat it and that we \"could if we just tried\" - and many of us I guess want to gain weight and feel bad, avoid social situations that include eating, cause you don't know what will be available, what might seem weird etc.; you are ashamed cause people wouldn't understand. \n\nAll these things are so important and often you only know about it if you're concerned yourself, someone you know or you're interested in mental illnesses and this kind of stuff. It's not taken seriously enough. It took me 22 years to find out that I have ARFID. It was never a topic. AT LEAST people who might have it should find out about it.",

I think it's kinda up to people with arfid to offer their story to the media if they want more awareness because you cant really expect the media to run stories on things they don't know exist.   \nAlso, I don't personally think it's helpful at this point in time to frame it as a eating disorder when talking about it casually, I just say I have food issues and no one bothers me about it. Anyone who wants to know more I just tell them my specific problem, which is tasting things too strongly.",

An eating disorder typically does require that additional aspect of body image related issues. Unfortunately, the two get conflated because they are all grouped together in the DSM but yeah, the body image related stuff is a significant point of difference between eating and feeding disorders.\n\nI also have an eating disorder so if I'm going to talk to someone specifically about ARFID, I would tell them I have a feeding disorder specifically so they are less likely to assume I'm talking about EDs like AN, BN and BED.",

      "body": "It is theorized that there are about the same amount of adults who suffer from ARFID as there are adults who suffer from anorexia. The percentage of children who have it is way higher. The issue is that the majority of medical professionals have never heard of the disorder so a huge portion of people with ARFID go undiagnosed. It does not make sense to me that it is misrepresented in the media because it IS just as prevalent as other eating disorders, just mostly undiagnosed due to lack of information. I feel like if it was represented more in the media, more people who have it could get treatment for it. I respect your opinion and feelings about it though.",
