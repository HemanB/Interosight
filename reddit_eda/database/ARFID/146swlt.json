      "body": "I've slowly developed IBS symptoms over years and years, and has gotten to the point of having to go to a doctor about it. Of course, big thing is avoiding trigger foods and eliminating them and all that. Problem is, if I did that, I'd probably starve to death. But now every meal feels like spinning a roulette wheel of either it following up with little to no pain, or excruciating cramps that come in waves. Doctor said that worse case scenario, it's a gallbladder issue.\n\nEven though I've just started to get medical help, I'm still a young adult, and have experienced gastrointestinal issues since middle school. I've had ARFID since day 1, I'm not sure what kind I have, but the health problems are catching up to me fast (other stuff besides this but I digress), and am most likely going to have to take a grocery list of medications/vitamins/supplements to be able to manage through life physically, because this condition has so much control over my every day life",
