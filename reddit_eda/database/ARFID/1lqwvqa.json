  "selftext": "So I once went to a restaurant for breakfast and they served me bread with white cheese, my arfid is based on brand and environment so I just tasted it and IT WAS AMAZING AND I CRAVED FOR MORE. Problem is that i cannot eat it until it\u2019s from a restaurant or that it\u2019s made locally. Same thing with cheeses like brie. Tasted it, was good but never find a way to eat it because I don\u2019t eat industrial cheeses even if the one i tasted was industrial.",

Well, I presume arfid since it's the texture of certain foods as well as the texture of any food that has been chewed. All food feels the same once it's chewed, before swallowing. Starting texture doesn't matter. Focusing on the feeling of the food in my mouth? Repulsive. I also ironically had binge eating tendancies. Focusing on the food super hard is what that condition needs. \n\nI tend to disassociate while I eat due to stomach pain and sensory discomfort. This is what caused the binge eating\n I prefer to eat only snacks and not meals, things just got out of proportion. Literally. \n\nI have a LOT of food allergies and only recently discovered celery isn't supposed to make your tongue numb and oranges aren't supposed to make your mouth spikey. \n\nSo I wonder how much of my avoidance is my body desperate to not be given a food I am intolerant or allergic to (I also can't have lactose, gluten, soy, beans, meat, raw veggies, red dye, fiber, or any alternative sugar (cane sugar and honey are ok but stevia isn't).",

I can\u2019t usually manage cheap chicken nuggets or other \u201cprocessed\u201d chicken (patties and such), I can\u2019t do woody or rubbery chicken or stringy slow-cooker chicken. I can usually manage do Taco Bell chicken nuggets (the texture actually feels like meat) or similar, fried chicken, rotisserie chicken and the like. Canned chicken (where it\u2019s in chunks like canned tuna) is only acceptable in chicken salad sandwiches or soups with a lot of other stuff to mask the texture. \n\nIf I cook with raw meat, it sometimes (but not always) makes it impossible to eat what I\u2019ve prepared. \n\nI seem to have most success and consistency with ham and other pork products. (The exception is of course bacon and the many ways that can be made \u201cwrong\u201d for me.) \n\nShrimp are something I crave regularly, but sometimes I just can\u2019t. They\u2019re ocean bugs and that\u2019s all I can think of in that moment.\n\nI crave beef pretty much 3-5 days a month. Most hamburgers are safe. Broccoli beef can sometimes have beef that\u2019s too chewy, but broccoli beef done correctly is the ultimate once a month meal (preferably with brown rice). Steak is real easy to mess up and turn inedible for me. \n\nMost of my safe foods are only safe if prepared \u201ccorrectly.\u201d I\u2019m using quotes because I know what\u2019s correct for me isn\u2019t correct for everyone.  \n\nSorry if I let this reply get too long, I just got out of a session with my dietician.",

You could even mix it in with your yoghurt. I understand you prefer solid food but you could definitely make a smoothie bowl with yoghurt and at least oe of the supplement powders mentioned\n\nIf you can do curry/stew like texture over solid food (even if the solid food is roasted potatoes, that would help with several vitamins.\n\nOMG I had the exact same thing about rice!! I'll only rarely eat basmati (with butter chicken \\[mushrooms pick out of course\\]) because it's too skinny to look like maggots. I prefer it with rice noodles though, I basically lived at the beach growing up and the big seaweed leaves touching you in the surf was so gross and scary cause you didn't know if it was a creature or seaweed lol. Some day the shore would be chock full of it so maybe that's part of my aversion? Thanks for the recommendation! Flakes in a soup or something sounds like a good way to get acclimated with the taste.\n\nHave you heard of the app Pitaya? Here's a [recent thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ARFID/comments/1ircnkz/arfid_app_3/) about it. It helps you track foods that you like or don't like and foods that you want to try. You can then track the times you've tried it. When you have a clear verdict, you can vote like, dislike, uncertain, or tolerable. I've found it quite helpful personally. This is my current dashboard, I had way more on my old phone but had to restart because I got a new phone and the data wouldn't transfer.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zg7rfsoq5zaf1.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7cda6fcc7962f094e3120666ce040e0ca952f6d\n\nThe most important thing is that you're getting a lot of nutrients with what you eat and compared to a lot of diets here (mine included), yours is pretty healthy. Definitely better than the standard AUKUS diet of oven chips. chicken tenders, plain or jarred sauce pasta, CHEESE, and fish sticks cause you gotta get those omega 3s in lmao. It's important to keep trying new foods even if it is only once of twice. I mean, some things I tried as a child but that doesn't exactly mean we won't like them as adults or that we can't grow to like certain foods later in life. I was 18 or 19 when I first tried peanut butter. No joke. Now I love it with apple slices. The PB2 is good for bananas because you can add water, mix and then drizzle it on.\n\nAre you East Asian by any chance? I only ask as a lot of the food you've talked about steers more into that cuisine vs typical western foods.",

I'm desperate to do the same but I'm not sure where to begin.\n\nI too was raised on similar processed/ultra processed foods. My mum, bless her heart, is absolutely the boiled/roasted with no seasoning besides salt and pepper type of cook. My brother was exactly like you. Every dinner was smilies/chips and chicken or fish fingers, lunch was a sausage roll with tomato sauce, vegemite toast for breakfast if he even ate it. Only nuggets and chips even when at Maccas. He got more adventurous in his late teens when he'd go out and eat with friends and he saw a food therapist in his early 20s which seemed to help quite a bit too but still to this day goes towards processed food like me and have a hard time with fruits and veg.\n\nRecovery is never linear but you HAVE made a lot of progress regardless. Even if they are processed, it doesn't necessarily mean it's completely awful for you like many frozen foods do have vegetables in them and that's a start! The food chaining method sounds very promising for me and hopefully you too.  I've been trying to do that steadily with the Pitaya app and I think it's help me a lot! Give it a few weeks and see how you go with it.  Don't make too many goals, just one or two that you can focus on adding to you diet, :)",

What are your safe foods?\n\nMy teeth are garbage so all my safe foods are soft/easy to eat foods. Have you ever had just straight diluted chicken or beef broth? Chicken is probably more widely palatable. Nothing else, just the broth. Bone broth is really good for you and gives you a protein boost. Blended soup is literally the only way I can get \"difficult\" veggies down because it removes the texture problem. Do you prefer more solid foods in general?",

I can sit and eat a pint happily with barely anything added although I usually add peanut butter and sugar free syrup. \n\nThe way I get veggies in me is through sausages, patties, and mentioning the cheap frozen food again - mini spring rolls (not the American kind - the uk kind is different) and mini samosas. I also eat mushrooms and seaweed for more plant intake.",

Used to be always be stocked with party pies (mini meat pies) but my consumption was ridiculous so I cut back.\n\nYoghurt is great for you! Plus you can add anything to it! Have you heard of PB2? I've loved that in banana yoghurt for years and you need very little. Zero effect on the yoghurt texture. I like peanut butter but hate it on bread. Somehow it's *too* soft LOL.\n\nI had to look up the spring roll thing because I'm Aussie and didn't know there was a difference. Sounds like we have the same spring rolls you're talking about and \"egg rolls\" (US) but we call them chiko rolls. Either way, I love those mini spring rolls! And the samosas by the same brand I get. I have a kg box of the spring rolls in my freezer rn \ud83d\ude2d I'm kinda jealous that you actually like seaweed lol. I tried and just couldn't. Maybe if it was flavoured? I never liked sushi and now I can't digest rice so it out of the question. I do like tuna and salmon though! So I got that going for me!\n\nSpeaking of how are you with rice? Oh, and eggs!? I can't live without them but I know lots of people don't like them.\n\nWhat about tofu? You can season and/or marinade it so many ways it's insane. Throw it on the fry pan for a bit---Delicious!\n\nHave you ever looked into flavourless protein or fibre? You can add to any drink, yoghurt, soup, or sauce. I get mine from [this brand](https://costpricesupplements.com.au/?orderby=popularity&paged=1&s=Feel+Good+Protein&post_type=product) but you probably have a cheaper alternative where you are. I can never taste them and they doesn't change the texture at all. If you really need help, Movicol is a great option too btw. I was prescribed it years ago and it helped me out a lot. Just one sachet a day.",

Egg yolk has good fats but you can get that elsewhere.\n\nOn the topic of powders, have you ever tried any green powders? That's an easy way to get in more greens. You could even mix it in with your yoghurt. I understand you prefer solid food but you could definitely make a smoothie bowl with yoghurt and at least oe of the supplement powders mentioned\n\nIf you can do curry/stew like texture over solid food (even if the solid food is roasted potatoes, that would help with several vitamins.\n\nOMG I had the exact same thing about rice!! I'll only rarely eat basmati (with butter chicken \\[mushrooms pick out of course\\]) because it's too skinny to look like maggots. I prefer it with rice noodles though, I basically lived at the beach growing up and the big seaweed leaves touching you in the surf was so gross and scary cause you didn't know if it was a creature or seaweed lol. Some day the shore would be chock full of it so maybe that's part of my aversion? Thanks for the recommendation! Flakes in a soup or something sounds like a good way to get acclimated with the taste.\n\nHave you heard of the app Pitaya? Here's a [recent thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ARFID/comments/1ircnkz/arfid_app_3/) about it. It helps you track foods that you like or don't like and foods that you want to try. You can then track the times you've tried it. When you have a clear verdict, you can vote like, dislike, uncertain, or tolerable. I've found it quite helpful personally. This is my current dashboard, I had way more on my old phone but had to restart because I got a new phone and the data wouldn't transfer.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zg7rfsoq5zaf1.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7cda6fcc7962f094e3120666ce040e0ca952f6d\n\nThe most important thing is that you're getting a lot of nutrients with what you eat and compared to a lot of diets here (mine included), yours is pretty healthy. Definitely better than the standard AUKUS diet of oven chips. chicken tenders, plain or jarred sauce pasta, CHEESE, and fish sticks cause you gotta get those omega 3s in lmao. It's important to keep trying new foods even if it is only once of twice. I mean, some things I tried as a child but that doesn't exactly mean we won't like them as adults or that we can't grow to like certain foods later in life. I was 18 or 19 when I first tried peanut butter. No joke. Now I love it with apple slices. The PB2 is good for bananas because you can add water, mix and then drizzle it on.\n\nAre you East Asian by any chance? I only ask as a lot of the food you've talked about steers more into that cuisine vs typical western foods.",

I'm desperate to do the same but I'm not sure where to begin.\n\nI too was raised on similar processed/ultra processed foods. My mum, bless her heart, is absolutely the boiled/roasted with no seasoning besides salt and pepper type of cook. My brother was exactly like you. Every dinner was smilies/chips and chicken or fish fingers, lunch was a sausage roll with tomato sauce, vegemite toast for breakfast if he even ate it. Only nuggets and chips even when at Maccas. He got more adventurous in his late teens when he'd go out and eat with friends and he saw a food therapist in his early 20s which seemed to help quite a bit too but still to this day goes towards processed food like me and have a hard time with fruits and veg.\n\nRecovery is never linear but you HAVE made a lot of progress regardless. Even if they are processed, it doesn't necessarily mean it's completely awful for you like many frozen foods do have vegetables in them and that's a start! The food chaining method sounds very promising for me and hopefully you too.  I've been trying to do that steadily with the Pitaya app and I think it's help me a lot! Give it a few weeks and see how you go with it.  Don't make too many goals, just one or two that you can focus on adding to you diet, :)",
