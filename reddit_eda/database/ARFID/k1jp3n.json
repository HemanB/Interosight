      "body": "We don\u2019t have Thanksgiving here in Australia but we don\u2019t do anything for any special occasions anyway. \n\nWe are no contact with my family and the kids father so we have no one to spend it with. I used to invite friends over for Christmas Day but my kids couldn\u2019t cope with it. \n\nThey both have ASD and can\u2019t cope with people being in the house. So it\u2019s just me and my 2 boys. I make pancakes for breakfast and they are happy they can eat in their room. I make a few of their favourite dishes and we just reheat when we\u2019re hungry. It\u2019s so peaceful, quiet and relaxed. We love it. So no issues for my son with ARFID at all. \n\nI\u2019m really sorry for the people who struggle with the holidays and have to suffer through it.",
