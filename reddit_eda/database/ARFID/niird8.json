  "selftext": "Now that I\u2019ve moved out of my mom\u2019s and in with my friends, I cook all the time. My one friend hates cooking and the other works constantly, so having me around to cook and clean has been pretty great. I\u2019ve been so bold in trying new foods and recipes, and it\u2019s always went well. I\u2019m starting to believe that preparing the food MYSELF is what makes it okay- I know how it\u2019s cooked and I know what\u2019s in it, so I feel like I have control and power over it. I wondered if anyone else did too.",

I advise them that doing so would be a poor choice. At the bare minimum I will never trust nor eat anything they make ever again. I have enough food issues as it is without someone adding to it.",

MY friends have become very cognizant of that and now whenever they cook for me, they tell me exactly what's in the thing they're making and ask me if each thing is OK. It also helps, I think, to make sure that I am only eating around people who are not going to judge me if I try something and it doesn't work for me and who are willing to accommodate my anxieties about food and eating. Honestly the worst thing for me is eating around strangers and eating around relatives that are very judging and like making jokes at my expense over it.",
