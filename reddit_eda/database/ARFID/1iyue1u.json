He's rather not eat than eat shit.\u00a0\n\n\nThat seemed to do it. Took them a good couple of minutes to process that was the case. They kept asking... Wait, like it really tastes like shit to him..?\n\n\nThey are big into lifting weights and putting on as much mass as possible, and they talk about it a lot. So when the little guy said he wants to put on weight, they were all about it. Then they didn't understand why he still only eats processed foods and junk food. Such a little amount of meat. (He'll eat chicken nuggets and hot dogs, that's about it.)\n\n\nAnyways, the idea of tasting shit seems to make sense to me that is why he refuses most foods. (Even if I s not actually shit taste/texture he is sensing, it's something along those lines.)",
