  "selftext": "yesterday for my sisters birthday she wanted to go to a vegan place, which was my nightmare but i decided to go and try my best anyway. i tried the beyond burger completely plain (with steakhouse sauce, because i thought it would be like A1, which i love, but it ended up being more like ketchup, which is not a safe food) and some vegan mac n cheese and i think i finally experienced what normal people feel like when they try a food they don\u2019t like. i was able to eat it and not enjoy it without having an anxiety attack. the best part is my mom tried the steakhouse sauce and confirmed that it was basically just ketchup, which means i ate an unsafe food without gagging. it\u2019s little, but i\u2019m proud of myself for stepping out of my comfort zone a little",
