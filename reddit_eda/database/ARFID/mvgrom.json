      "body": "While I of course understand this one of the main points of my therapy was that texture and flavor can\u2019t necessarily be predicted by appearance. Getting past appearance was very hard at first but it was the biggest breakthroughs to getting more foods on my safe list. Foods that look very similar can have such different textures and even food that I don\u2019t usually like can become safe if it\u2019s prepared a certain way. \n\nHowever, the issue with people who ask questions like this isn\u2019t that they don\u2019t have a point- it\u2019s like they\u2019re already expecting that someone will, someone must like what they\u2019re asking them to try and then gets even more hurt and offended when one does try it and then doesn\u2019t like it. For that reason I make sure never to try a new thing that someone else has made if I can help it. When it comes to my husband sometimes I\u2019ll try something he\u2019s made and say \u201cI think I would love this if it didn\u2019t have (unsafe foods) in it\u201d which makes it about certain foods and not about his cooking.",
