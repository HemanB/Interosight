  "selftext": "I hate it. I hate that we have to eat, I hate that we have to shit, I hate that sometimes we have to vomit. My (undiagnosed) ARFID comes from my emetophobia and the fear of eating specific things because they have made me sick and might make me sick. If we didn\u2019t have to eat I\u2019d never have nausea/stomach cramps. The second I feel any sense of pain or uncomfort in my abdomen a wave of dread and anxiety rises over me. When I feel sick after eating my safe foods it\u2019s even worse because I don\u2019t have any other options. I wish there was some kind of fool proof or sick proof shake or smoothie or SOMETHING I could take/drink that would give me all the nutrients I need so I don\u2019t have to eat anything else ever again. I\u2019m 30 in December and I can\u2019t stand the fact that I have to deal with this for the rest of my life. Sorry for the rant! Just really frustrated.",
