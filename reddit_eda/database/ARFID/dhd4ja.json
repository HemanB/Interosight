      "body": "That is just blowing my mind.  I am so so so happy for you.  Therapy is the bomb.  I'm going to look into it for me.  I have had it in the past for other things (grew up in an alcoholic home, gravitated towards addicts etc.) and it's been amazingly helpful.  I always refer to myself as a therapy success story.  HA!  Seriously though, when you make up your mind to fix the thing that's broken, that's half the battle.  Speaking of which, my dishwasher is still in four pieces in my kitchen.  I should finish that up. Deciding to fix it also involves putting it back together.  ROFL  \nAll that being said, you reminded me a lot of me... on the video you came off as very smart, self-assured, self-aware.  You aren't DAMAGED perse, just \"quirky\" and I can see how ARFID just slips through the cracks, because if you are like me and able to confidently fluff off the stupid comments people make and/or avoid eating in social situations, you really aren't all that weird.  You (and me) don't appear to have problems to the outside world.  But yeah.  This major thing that just hangs over our dinner plate.  Or pot, as it were.    \nI just got off the phone with my dad and I was telling him about you, the condition and the video.  I'm 47.  He's 78.  I said remember how when I was a kid I just wouldn't eat anything and he said, OH YEAH.\"  We were talking about how my mom has MAJOR texture issues and frequently was known to spit her food out grotesquely, later in life, knowing at least to put it into a napkin.  She has \"atrocious table manners\" in that she's super picky, super texture sensitive and very vocal about what she doesn't like or can't eat.  And the whole damn family going back generations has gastrointestinal issues.  I wonder if there is a genetic component?  I said to dad you know how me and mom have about 20 things we'll eat?  He said yep (since she's been in a walker, he does the grocery shopping now and if he buys the wrong brand there is hell to pay).  I said you know how my sister has about 20 foods she WON'T eat? We were both marvelling at how we'd never thought of it that way before.  So thanks for not only me, but the whole family is getting educated on this.  Like your grandparents, I was blessed to have a family that never forced me to eat what I couldn't/wouldn't.  My heart breaks for those don't have that luxury.",

I would have seen her so much more but I've had a lot of issues with my insurance unfortunately :( \n\nBut in that short time she's already taught me so much. Just 3 days ago I ate a chicken breast that had all kinds of special seasoning on it and even spinach inside of it. I couldnt finish it but still even getting some down is a huge step. I'm set up to see her again next Friday and I'm so excited!",
