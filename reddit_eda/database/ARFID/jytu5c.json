  "selftext": "You\u2019re not irrational for not wanting to eat something that you know is going to trigger you. Avoiding extreme discomfort is something that literally everyone does. You\u2019re reacting naturally to a biological disgust response that evolved to protect us. You are literally fighting thousands of years of evolution. You are so strong. One day you will be understood and your struggle will be respected. Until then, keep fighting. I see you. You\u2019re not weird or immature. You\u2019re a fighter. It\u2019s going to be okay.",
