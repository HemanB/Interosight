  "selftext": "28,M here\n\nI've been talking to this girl for about 2 months. We went on a few dates and things really seemed to be going great.\nShe was nerdy like me, and seemed to really vibe with me and ease my anxiety.\nAfter we started dating, she asked if we could go to an Italian restaurant for Valentine's Day. \nI regretfully admitted that I wasnt going to be able to eat there, due to my eating disorder.\nI explained briefly what it is and stressed how I hate having it and am actively trying to improve upon it and expand my pallet\n\nWell she did not like this.. She ended up saying that this was a deal breaker, and that is would inevitably lead to issues and she just preferred to end it there..\n\nI tried to explain I couldn't control it, and asked her is she really wanted to end this over food.. Well I got my answer\n\nI feel so unwanted, I feel like I'm never going to be able to find someone if food is such a big deal with people. How am I supposed to find someone?\n\nFeeling really down and hopeless.\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for the wonderful and thoughtful responses; it does hurt, but it is what it is.\n\nAnd to clarify, i didn't straight up refuse the Italian restaurant (bad choice of words on my part), I simply said \"it may be hard for me to find something there, but maybe if you send me the menu i can check it out\" and that's what kicked off the whole conversation.\n\nYes she's a little younger than me (23), but everything else she had done/said up to this point didnt phase me one bit, she seemed like a really solid match. \n\nIt took me 4 years to get to the point i was ready to date again, and this just felt like a big strikeout..\nThanks again everyone for your comments, nice to have support on this <3",

      "body": "The fact is that there will always be people who see food as a different part of identity than ours \u2014 instead of seeing food with anxiety and pain, they see food as something to explore and share with loved ones and need a partner that has their same approach to new/different foods. There\u2019s nothing wrong with either sides, they\u2019re just different and aren\u2019t compatible with each other. \n\nI\u2019ve met a lot of people who had a personal problem with my eating struggles, and many weren\u2019t too nice about it calling me anorexic, picky, difficult etc. (even though I always look after myself to make sure no one is bending to my weird habits). My partner now LOVES food and will eat pretty much anything put in front of him, and there were definitely some growing pains in the start. But he doesn\u2019t make me feel bad for feeling nauseous and not physically being able to eat many things. I end up getting myself a lot of sides and kid\u2019s meals when possible when we go out so he\u2019s not limited and can still eat the cuisines and dishes he wants. I think there has to be some compromise ultimately and to be honest, she might\u2019ve just thought that your outright refusal to even visit certain places was indicative of inflexibility in general down the road. I totally get the struggle of finding things to eat that won\u2019t make you sick, but you also have to understand how that makes partners feel to get better about your approach to this situation and find a way forward over time.",

      "body": "Here are my thoughts.  This connection was very very new, it's possible she didn't know you well enough to be motivated to make what could be some major lifestyle adjustments for her.  Maybe she's a foodie and Italian is her favorite cuisine and you just straight up refuse to go to the restaurant with her.  Perhaps in your explanation, you made it sound like you'd refuse to go to any restaurant that wasn't of your choosing.  Then she got to thinking how she'd feel never getting a say in where you went out to eat.  Then she got to thinking how one sided your relationship might be if you were like this in other areas.  Maybe she likes to cook and you'd refuse to let her cook for you.  Maybe she likes to travel and you'd refuse to go anywhere with her if you didn't like the cuisine.  Maybe she thought she'd have a huge hassle just trying to share a meal with you.  It may not be that she broke up with you because of the ARFID, but because of the uncompromising way you explained it.  She may have wanted to break up before she invested too far emotionally in a relationship that would make her unhappy, and that's fair.  \n\nNow, I don't know what exactly you said, and I'm not assuming anything, just giving a possible scenario.  When I hang out with foodies I don't refuse to go to restaurants just because I can't eat the main food items, I usually find at least an appetizer that I can have or sometimes I just eat beforehand so I'm not hungry and have a drink and dessert.  Maybe you can try that if you don't already.  Maybe you can adjust the way you explain ARFID to people if it's coming across badly.  I wouldn't want to date anyone if I couldn't eat what I liked around them, so I try not to do that to other people.  It is for sure a difficult task though, and I am still single so I am definitely not an expert.",

I tend to avoid social situations involving food completely because I both don\u2019t want to \u201cget caught\u201d not being able to find something I like and I don\u2019t feel comfortable eating in front of others, especially people I may become romantically interested in. I think part of that fear is rooted in anxiety over being judged for what I choose to eat. I\u2019ve always told myself that this anxiety is illogical and not based in reality but, after reading this, I guess I\u2019ve learned that food really is a dealbreaker for some people. You deserve someone better than this girl. People need to understand that ARFID is not a choice. If she were to break up with you because you had a condition that manifests itself physically like, say, psoriasis, everyone would immediately come to the conclusion that she\u2019s not a good person. I don\u2019t think people view ARFID in the same way\u2026 yet. I hope that changes. Sending you love! A better person will come your way!",

It\u2019s like someone who values a bottle of wine with dinner not wanting a teetotaler \n\nI\u2019m picky as hell but luckily can find at least one dish at any restaurant so it\u2019s much less of an issue.  I may not share apps with them but at least I can go and eat something",

Which is not a bad thing on its own, but she definitely could have been politer about it. \n\nI dated someone who didn\u2019t start having a problem with my eating until 2 years in \u2026. Suddenly he realized that when I said it wasn\u2019t going to change \u2026 I wasn\u2019t being dramatic lmao \n\nI\u2019m now engaged to someone who doesn\u2019t give a shit what I like to eat. He\u2019ll eat pretty much anything if it\u2019s offered but is content to keep a simple diet at home with me. When he wants food I don\u2019t like, he makes plans with a friend to go get some! Great way to keep in touch with his friends, and not make me feel shitty. \n\nI recommend being open and honest about it upfront. Weed out those who are incompatible right away. There is someone out there who will not run away from your eating, and instead help you thrive as you are. Lift you up. As a good partnership should.",

Just always choose yourself and stand by yourself and you\u2019ll do fine. Sometimes that\u2019s a skill that takes awhile to learn. For me it took awhile. But with time, you learn who you are and what you can offer and what you can reasonably expect of people and then it\u2019s like the universe magically starts filtering the people it sends to you. Doesn\u2019t mean you find your person straight away but it ends up being more fun to date.",
