  "selftext": "Annie\u2019s Mac and cheese has been a staple of my diet for YEARS. Recently they changed their recipe and it\u2019s \u201cnow cheesier\u201d. I was willing to give it a shot but OH MY GOSH!! This new Mac and cheese is awful. I could SMELL a difference when making it. And the taste was terrible because it was so bland. It seems like they didn\u2019t even try to make it taste similar. I was so upset that I left a review on their website, as many people did once they changed their recipe. What\u2019s upsetting me even more now is that it seems like they\u2019ve partnered with influenster so that people are leaving incentivized reviews in order to boost their ratings online instead of making their loyal customers happy again. Sorry for the rant, I\u2019m just frustrated\u2026",

I remember how confused I was when I got a container of my favorite salsa that had a new & \u201cimproved\u201d recipe and it was so much worse that I couldn\u2019t finish it. Blech! I hate it when they change a proven formula. \n\nI know this doesn\u2019t solve the issue with Annie\u2019s, but have you ever tried making your own mac and cheese before? It\u2019s actually super easy and sooo much better than anything you can buy in a box. The great thing is that you can use just about any cheese or noodles and tailor it to what you already like. \n\nHere\u2019s my recipe:\n\n\n-1 tablespoon butter, melted on low in pan used for noodles \n\n-1 tablespoon flour, mixed into melted butter until paste like\n\n-1/2 cup milk, add slowly and mix into roux (flour/butter mixture), make sure to stir regularly and keep from sticking to pan\n\n-1 cup cheese, whatever kind you like (I use regular cheddar but white cheddar is great too), added to b\u00e9chamel sauce (butter, flour, milk mixture) until melted. Add noodles & salt and enjoy! \n\nThis is enough for about 8 oz of pasta, so you can tweak the ratios as needed. Just a warning, though, once you try home made it\u2019s hard to go back. \n\nI hope you find something that can replace Annie\u2019s for you, I know how hard it can be to feel like a safe food has been taken away!",

Anyone I know who wants it to be cheesier just adds some grated parmesan on top if they feel like it. \n\nWhenever I see a company change recipes for seemingly no reason, I just suspect they\u2019re cutting costs somewhere. In this economy, no company is improving their product just for the sake of it. In this economy, no company would ever INCREASE costs to make their product taste better unless they\u2019re planning a reason for an even bigger price jump. There\u2019s always money involved. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you lost your safe food, OP. Annie\u2019s is a big one for me too and this is so disappointing to see :(",
