  "selftext": "ARFID is a really new disorder, only being introduced in the DSM-5 in 2013. 12 years later I see so much research and awareness being done that I never couldve imagined.  \nUnfortunately I had this disorder since I was 2 years old. My parents sought a lot of help but ARFID wasn't even a thing until I was 12. The best thing the doctors could do at the time was to prescribe me a feeding tube and pills. My growth stagnated and my education was affected due to my brain not getting enough nutrients.  \nWhen the diagnosis was added in 2013 I was part of a research study on it at Boston Children's hospital and that's when I got an diagnosis but still little treatment for years.  \nWhat followed since its addition to the DSM-5 was a book, documentary, news stories, and influencers finally coming out to talk about this terrible eating disorder. Now there's even subcategories of ARFID that go into more detail on its condition. Researchers have already begun to make theories on its cause and cure. And they also showed correlated disorders. (In my case Autism & ADHD being a huge corporate)  \nIn 2025 I recently saw an influencer named Hannah spreading ARFID awareness and some studies being done in the middle east.  \nWe went from \"just being a picky eater & spoiled brat\" to \"this is a serious eating disorder that needs treatment\" in less than 15 years!  \nI can't wait to see more clinics and research being done so we can help all those who suffer from ARFID.",

I couldn't find a single sucess story, or any treatment options that had even a hint of evidence of working.

In the end, I still won; I eventually recovered and I'm so much healthier and happier now. But the road was way, way longer and darker than it had to be. I want nothing more than for every child, teenager and adult who has ARFID to have access to reliable information and proper treatment. I want it to be discussed in social media, in university campi, schools, clinics, everywhere.

As I desperately scoured for info back in 2016, I found two YouTube vlogs of a woman talking about her experience with \"SED\". That was pretty much all I could find, but it felt like lighting a giant flashlight after being stuck in the darkness for years. I rewatched them so many times and they gave me so much hope. I want to be that for people. Knowing there was someone out there who felt the same literally saved me, and I want that for every child in the world.",
