  "selftext": "I\u2019ve been having these thoughts for awhile, because you know people with severely picky eating like us have been shamed and guilt tripped since childhood. \n\nDo you think ARFID existed amongst cavemen in the stone age? Do you think it existed within people during the Great Depression? I often wonder if I was presented absolutely no other choice, if I would eat things I usually would not. \n\nI WANT THIS TO BE STUDIED MORE. I\u2019m so happy this disorder is getting recognized but there\u2019s still so much that can be done to understand it. I just want to understand this problem fully so we can help ourselves. :\u2019(",

      "body": "Just think about the evolutionary purpose it provides. Ultimately its a response meant to serve you in some way. Our bodies are constantly trying to find solutions for survival, even if theyre not \u2018healthy\u2019. When i get frustrated with how i react to certain textures i think of how my body is just telling me it thinks the food is unsafe and that i shouldnt eat it to prevent illness, realistically i know that the food is safe but if we imagine ourselves as monkeys eating fruit in the wild, that fruit could be bad same as any food that expires. Could be moldy or infested and the texture, smell, or taste of it would be indicators of rot. Naturally if you ate something rotten the texture would make you stop and not want to eat it, it would make you sick and purge the bad food out. And sometimes you cant tell if something is totally bad until its in your mouth! Our bodies are simply wired to protect us and can\u2019t distinguish our current hyper processed foods as actual food sometimes, so it makes perfect sense to me that ARFID is coming to light more. My issues with texture can be really on and off. Sometimes just the temperature of something is enough to change whether or not i can eat it. Then i think, well, foods that stayed out like meat were more likely to go bad and cause sickness if eaten so it makes sense i feel ill and cant eat certain things or textures. Chicken salad is a good example. It\u2019s perfectly fine cold, but once its room temp i cant imagine putting it in my mouth. My body doesnt know how long that food has been out for, so it has to assume the food is bad so i dont make the mistake of eating it and getting ill even though i know better. Just a perspective i thought might be interesting to others haha.",

In the movie, there is a scene that shows the slaves being given that... whatever-they-*called*-it-but-it-LOOKED-LIKE-vomit, scooped right out of the pot and into their hands. \n\nI thought of the \"salted pork\" that was depicted in the movie \"[Andersonville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andersonville_(film)),\" which was loosely based on the diary of John Ransom, a Union soldier imprisoned at [Andersonville Prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andersonville_Prison)\n\nI thought of the members of the [Donner Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donner_Party), who, among other horrible things (see below), were forced to engage in cannibalism of other members of their party who had already died.\n\nI thought of the Uruguayan rugby team whose plane crashed in the Andes Mountains that came to be known as the Andes flight disaster and the [Miracle of the Andes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguayan_Air_Force_Flight_571). (The movie [Alive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alive_(1993_film)) is based on this true story.) They, too, ended up having to cannibalize others who had died in order to survive.\n\nAnd we're all well aware that these are one of a few instances where people have been forced to eat something that they didn't want to. And these are all - I'm assuming - people *without* ARFID. \n\nWhile I'm sure that you didn't mean what you said *quite* to the extent that I laid it out here, I would think that yes, if we had to choose between a food that repulses us and going (a significant level of) hungry, and with no knowledge of when more food will be offered, I think most of us would be able to force down enough to at least tide us over for a while. And I think if it was literally between life and death, eating something *even worse,* while it might involve more strength and self-talk than others, I think most of us could do it. \n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n[10 Things You Should Know About the Donner Party](https://www.history.com/news/10-things-you-should-know-about-the-donner-party)\n> As their supplies dwindled, the Donner emigrants stranded at Truckee Lake resorted to eating increasingly grotesque meals. They slaughtered their pack animals, cooked their dogs, gnawed on leftover bones and even boiled the animal hide roofs of their cabins into a foul paste. Several people died from malnutrition, but the rest managed to subsist on morsels of boiled leather and tree bark until rescue parties arrived in February and March 1847. Not all of the settlers were strong enough to escape, however, and those left behind were forced to cannibalize the frozen corpses of their comrades while waiting for further help. All told, roughly half of the Donner Party\u2019s survivors eventually resorted to eating human flesh.",
