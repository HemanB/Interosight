So the first third of the day is spent there (outside, southern USA). Thanksgiving dinner was an unexpected meltdown (versus his normal just eat a few crackers and bolt from the table)  last year, and after having a few heart to heart discussions he let me in to all the big feelings!! You see folks, it wasn't just that sit down dinner, with the big smells and the gross food, it was everything that had been leading up to it over the course of the previous few days. It was the writing about Thanksgiving at school, the reading about Thanksgiving books at school, everybody talking about food, all the TV commercials (sooo many), etc!! This kiddo was bombarded with food that he didn't want to eat and he certainly didn't want to be pressured about. \n\nBut the startling and the most brutal for this mama's heart was hearing him talk about the feelings that it gave him. My kid experienced shame and failure for not being able to eat the food. He felt left out for not being able to participate. For all the world that he wants to be able he just simply can't. \n\nSo this year we are completely revamping thanksgiving, will totally attend the Turkey Trot because that's a favorite for everyone involved.  And we are going to serve what he chooses for everyone (so there will be Dino nuggets, Cheeto Mac and cheese, and Cool ranch Doritos on the main platters.) I'm getting his input on everything that he's willing to talk to me about!  \nAnyone out there has any suggestions on how to make the holiday easier for him or to help shift the focus from food to giving thanks, I certainly would appreciate it!\n\nEdited for TL;DR\nYes my kid hates thanksgiving, he likes running a Turkey Trot race. This year we're going to do things differently and I'll take anybody's suggestions for making it better.",

So the first third of the day is spent there (outside, southern USA). Thanksgiving dinner was an unexpected meltdown (versus his normal just eat a few crackers and bolt from the table)  last year, and after having a few heart to heart discussions he let me in to all the big feelings!! You see folks, it wasn't just that sit down dinner, with the big smells and the gross food, it was everything that had been leading up to it over the course of the previous few days. It was the writing about Thanksgiving at school, the reading about Thanksgiving books at school, everybody talking about food, all the TV commercials (sooo many), etc!! This kiddo was bombarded with food that he didn't want to eat and he certainly didn't want to be pressured about. \n\nBut the startling and the most brutal for this mama's heart was hearing him talk about the feelings that it gave him. My kid experienced shame and failure for not being able to eat the food. He felt left out for not being able to participate. For all the world that he wants to be able he just simply can't. \n\nSo this year we are completely revamping thanksgiving, will totally attend the Turkey Trot because that's a favorite for everyone involved.  And we are going to serve what he chooses for everyone (so there will be Dino nuggets, Cheeto Mac and cheese, and Cool ranch Doritos on the main platters.) I'm getting his input on everything that he's willing to talk to me about!  \nAnyone out there has any suggestions on how to make the holiday easier for him or to help shift the focus from food to giving thanks, I certainly would appreciate it!\n\nEdited for TL;DR\nYes my kid hates thanksgiving, he likes running a Turkey Trot race. This year we're going to do things differently and I'll take anybody's suggestions for making it better.",

And while we do encourage trying food and exposing him to food in non-eating ways (think sensory bins, or helping with the shopping, or helping make foods if he enjoys it), holidays aren't meant for that they're meant for enjoying time with family. So my mom for the past two years has made chicken nuggets and cheese sticks as part of the meal course for everyone to have. Like she full on gets the jumbo bags of them, cooks the nuggets the way he likes and everyone is welcome to them, and she unwraps the cheesesticks and puts them on a platter just like any other side. My moms husband, he's literally the best I swear, will make his freezer corn weeks ahead of time just to make sure it's available and always sets some aside for my son just to make sure he has it and it doesn't get eaten all up on Thanksgiving.",

          "body": "Yes!!! My kiddo, age 7,  hates Thanksgiving. He loooooves the \"Turkey Trot\" that our family runs on Thanksgiving morning. So the first third of the day is spent there (outside, southern USA). Thanksgiving dinner was an unexpected meltdown (versus his normal just eat a few crackers and bolt from the table)  last year, and after having a few heart to heart discussions he let me in to all the big feelings!! You see folks, it wasn't just that sit down dinner, with the big smells and the gross food, it was everything that had been leading up to it over the course of the previous few days. It was the writing about Thanksgiving at school, the reading about Thanksgiving books at school, everybody talking about food, all the TV commercials (sooo many), etc!! This kiddo was bombarded with food that he didn't want to eat and he certainly didn't want to be pressured about. \n\nBut the startling and the most brutal for this mama's heart was hearing him talk about the feelings that it gave him. My kid experienced shame and failure for not being able to eat the food. He felt left out for not being able to participate. For all the world that he wants to be able he just simply can't. \n\nSo this year we are completely revamping thanksgiving, will totally attend the Turkey Trot because that's a favorite for everyone involved.  And we are going to serve what he chooses for everyone (so there will be Dino nuggets, Cheeto Mac and cheese, and Cool ranch Doritos on the main platters.) I'm getting his input on everything that he's willing to talk to me about!  \nAnyone out there has any suggestions on how to make the holiday easier for him or to help shift the focus from food to giving thanks, I certainly would appreciate it!\n\nEdited for TL;DR\nYes my kid hates thanksgiving, he likes running a Turkey Trot race. This year we're going to do things differently and I'll take anybody's suggestions for making it better.",
