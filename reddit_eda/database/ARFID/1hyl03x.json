  "selftext": "I\u2019m listening to Whoopi Goldberg\u2019s audiobook called Bits and Pieces. This is a great book overall, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that Whoopi sounds very much like she has ARFID! She doesn\u2019t use the term but talks about her lifelong history with picky eating, her disinterest in food, her dislike for vegetables, and how she navigated this with her mother. Makes me feel so seen! Highly recommend! \n\nP.S. Whoopi clearly turned out just fine at age 69 despite her eating choices, so that\u2019s also a hopeful anecdote \u263a\ufe0f ",
