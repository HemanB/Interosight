Plus I don't feel bad just chugging it, when a more interesting beer would be a waste not to sip and enjoy. No flavor to enjoy to begin with, so why not hurry it up and get it down the hole?\n\nGive me a nice German Hefeweizen to sip along as I play pool with friends, it'll last longer, not get me drunk quick, and it's delicious so I can enjoy a good sip while the other team is playing. But if I'm just gonna do a fun gaming night at home, a case of whatever beer is cheap (but not too cheap) will do the trick. Take a few gulps between rounds and then when everybody's done with the games I'll sleep like a baby :) A drunk baby that won't wake up screaming.",
