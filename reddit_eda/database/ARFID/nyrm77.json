I sort of imagine a thread where people can comment with whats helpful for them like 'slushies are easy to consume' or 'consistant textures are better' to create a bit of a reasource for people coming on here for the first time to look through. \nI'm guessing mose upvoted comments would be wjat helped most people, so are a good idea to try first? \n\nIt can also come to be some interesting data to look at at some point? \n\nI know 'helpful tips' is a flair weve got, but i still thought that could be good for people too when theyre looking for advice...",
