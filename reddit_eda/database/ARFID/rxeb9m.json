  "selftext": "So, I've been having a problem recently. My partner really likes to go to restaurants with me, but I've been eating less and less each time because I'm going through a weird time where a lot of my previous safe foods aren't safe anymore. We'll go to cheddars and olive garden a lot, but nothing remaining on the menu is something I'm capable of eating anymore, so we'll just order a sprite for me, and I'll eat a breadstick/croissant. The only things on the menu that I'm able to eat are things on the kid's menu: Mac and cheese, grilled cheese, etc. Only problem is that the menu clearly states that if you're over 12, you can't order from the kids menu. I usually end up feeling really bad when I get home after experiences like this because I feel like all eyes were on me, and people noticed that I didn't eat anything, or the server was irritated with me for having not ordered anything, and that feeds into my restrictive tendencies and I just don't end up eating anything when I get home or sometimes the next day because it feels gross. I'm not sure what to do about this? I don't want to stop going out to eat with my partner, but it ends up being a really stressful experience for me sometimes",

It makes sense that kids meals are safer, as they tend to have less seasoning and textures to ensure the kids will like it since they tend to have picky sensory and taste issues at a younger age. I've never judged an adult for ordering a kids size. Also, if you ever see something that's a larger portion but you could tolerate, there's nothing wrong with bringing leftovers home! Also, some places offer \"health\" portions or something (the name and availability depends on the restaurant) but they'll sometimes have smaller portions for \"healthy\" people. While I don't agree with it's promotion of diet culture, it can still be helpful for those with smaller appetites! Hope this helps!",

I\u2019d don\u2019t think the server would get in trouble for getting the customer the meal off the menu they asked for, they\u2019d be asking to lose business punishing servers for that!Now, lol, mid-twenties and I still usually prefer the kids menu. More often than not, my husband will take over ordering for me, so that if for some reason if they say no or are confused, I\u2019m not the one dealing with the confrontation. Maybe try planning what you want beforehand with your partner and he handle the ordering for the two of you?
