  "selftext": "I try as much as I can to not tell people about my Arfid for this reason. It\u2019s happened since I was a kid, before my diagnosis. Kids at the lunch table would say things like, \u201cokay, but if you were on a stranded island with nothing else, would you eat a carrot?\u201d \nWith my friends, they would constantly tell me how much I was missing out, and try to get me to eat certain food items. They have this obsession with getting me to eat food I don\u2019t like. The most recent person I told went down a list of foods asking if I ate them, and then told me I need to try all of them. I know they mean well but it gets very annoying when everyones reaction is, \u201cyou don\u2019t eat this? Okay, you HAVE to!\u201d Or \u201cI\u2019m going to give you a blueberry, and you have to touch it!\u201d \nIt\u2019s like some sort of novelty to them.",
