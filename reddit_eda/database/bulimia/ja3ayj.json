  "selftext": "I've had this disorder for almost 15 years. I've never been able to shake it. The only time I stopped was pregnancy and even then, there were some times I purged but called it morning sickness. \n\nAs I purged again tonight after dinner for the 4th day in a row, I realized this disorder will kill me. Nothing has helped. Not treatment, not counseling,  not the tears of my husband,  not even having a child. I still feel the need to go back to this over and over again. \n\nI can feel the stress on my body.  My chest hurts after purging.  My gag reflex is ruined and it's harder to purge.  I'm destroying my teeth. \n\nBut I don't know how to stop.",

Diseases attack the body, mental health issues are in the brain and can be medicated or dismantled by therapy and doctors. Please get help, for yourself and your family. I restricted food for around 13 years or so and then I began purging after a tough and traumatic event. Now, I don\u2019t think about purging and I eat well enough to feel good about myself and fight the urge to purge. It didn\u2019t happen until I broke down and opened up about my issues to friends and my doctor. The weight of having an ED can weigh you down and make you feel worse about yourself, which further leads you to continue.",
