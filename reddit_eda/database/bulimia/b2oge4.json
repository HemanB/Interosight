  "selftext": "Hi everyone. I\u2019ve never been to this sub before as I was afraid of being triggered but I feel like I\u2019m ok enough to talk about this now. I know \u201cscare tactics\u201d don\u2019t work. Even stories about people dying from this horrible disease... it wasn\u2019t enough for *me* to stop and I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be enough for you either. But I wanted to share my story anyway, just to give you guys some insight from someone who has been battling this literally half their life. \n\nAnyway, I am 28 and just a few months ago I started my treatment for bulimia, I opted for partial inpatient. The group changed as time went on as nobody started at the same time. For two months I was there for six hours a day. We basically had to learn to eat all over again, took medication and nutrition classes, did cognitive behavioral therapy (which I think helped me the most), etc. It was one of the most difficult, heart wrenching, significant two months of my life. I have not purged since November 2nd 2018, my longest streak since the first time I did it.\n\nUnfortunately, I\u2019ve been left with scars. And extremely broke from medical bills. \n\nAbout a year ago, I started to have intense, burning pain whenever I eat. I know to people really deep in the disease this sounds like a good thing - an excuse to not eat. But it was **not** fun. I got to the point I couldn\u2019t even drink water without wanting to scream. I got an endoscopy and it turns out I have a permanent [hiatal hernia](https://i.imgur.com/eRyulqD.jpg). This means my stomach is popping up through my diaphragm. I am in intense pain when I eat certain things, or even a little too much. It will never go away on its own. It\u2019s there forever unless I get surgery where I go under general anesthesia and I\u2019ve had anesthesia awareness so I\u2019m not doing that. I have to take pantoprazole 40mg every single day or I won\u2019t even be able to go to work. \n\nSpeaking of work, I made $20,000 less than last year due to missing work because of my illness (lupus) and my eating disorder. I\u2019d stay home, smoke weed, and engage in behaviors all day when my boyfriend was at the office and lie and say I just didn\u2019t feel well. I lied to everyone. And I always considered myself an honest person but I guess when it came to my eating disorder, I\u2019m not.\n\nI caused this. I did this to myself. I never thought I\u2019d have a permanent health problem because of my disease. There is a chance I could actually die from this. If I start purging again, if I get a stomach bug, anything that could make me vomit... my stomach could get stuck, it could lose blood supply and die, and then I\u2019d die soon after. \n\nI have been brushing my teeth twice a day and flossing my whole life. [Here is an x-ray of my front teeth](https://i.imgur.com/GnZRh26.jpg). [Here\u2019s an actual picture I just took](https://i.imgur.com/vqapTDb.jpg). This is from fourteen years of vomiting multiple times a day. To fix these three teeth alone, I am quoted at $6,990. For these THREE. In total, I need **seven** root canals, **seven** fillings, and one tooth pulled. This is literally going to cost me over $14,000* (turns out 12k was wrong lol) and I have insurance. I am a full time [redacted] employee with the \u201cbest insurance in the country\u201d. Well, apparently that doesn\u2019t extend to my dental insurance. I found out this total at once btw, I\u2019m not adding up quotes I\u2019ve heard in the past. I\u2019ve been to scared to go to the dentist the last six years because I knew I\u2019d need some fillings. I had no idea I\u2019d need root canals, posts, crowns, fillings, teeth pulled, etc.\n\nI already have almost $25,000 in debt from college. This is going to increase my debt by 50% or else I\u2019ll lose my teeth, one by one, and eventually be essentially toothless. I can\u2019t take out a loan because my credit dropped 96 points in three months because I couldn\u2019t pay my bills due to chronic illness and being out of work/in the hospital. I tried to get my aunt to co-sign and she couldn\u2019t, and we both knew I couldn\u2019t afford an extra $520/mo.\n\nI have so much tooth pain that comes and goes that sometimes I can\u2019t eat anything I actually have to chew. I\u2019m 28, not 78. This problem is freaking me out so much at at the dentist last week that I stopped breathing and literally passed out for a minute. I feel sick to my stomach every day thinking about what I did to myself. How I am left picking up the pieces after the fucking hurricane that is my mental illness. I feel like this disease has ruined my life, and I\u2019m so depressed about it that it\u2019s difficult to make an action plan to turn everything around.\n\nI wish I could go back to being 14. To say this isn\u2019t the way to cope. I wish I could embrace every fourteen year old girl suffering from this and hold her and tell her that she needs to see someone and get help. That bulimia isn\u2019t her friend. That these images she saves of her \u201cgoals\u201d are poison to her mind. That I understand and know what she\u2019s went through. That I know it\u2019s an addiction I will be fighting the rest of my life. And that I\u2019ll fight with her, holding her hand, her with the sword and me with the shield. I know boys and nb people get bulimia as well, but it\u2019s just an example of how I feel.\n\nI\u2019m not going to get into why I think I have an ED as that\u2019s another post for another time. I know it won\u2019t cure you. I know it won\u2019t make you enter treatment, that isn\u2019t my goal here. I\u2019m not your life coach. But I hope you see that even if this disease doesn\u2019t kill you, it can make you physically miserable for the rest of your life. It can rack up debt. I\u2019ll probably never be able to own a home, get a new car, and my boyfriend will probably never want to marry me because of my debt becoming his. Everything hurts all the time, even if I\u2019m not purging anymore. Inside and out, everything hurts all the time. \n\n*edited to fix a link",

I haven't b/p since August and I admire your recovery efforts because I know that it's really fucking hard. I am SO PROUD OF YOU for going to the dentist, even if your teeth can't be addressed immediately. I had 8 cavities filled in January, and it was about 8 months between my first time back to the dentist and when I was able to have them filled.\n\nThat 14 year old girl is still there, and you're taking care of her with everything you have. You're doin it dude! Even if it takes years. Every day you add to your recovery adds days or month and eventually years to your life. \n\nThis might sound silly, and idk if it would help you at all, but the ED voice in my head is named Jerry. Jerry is an old white man with very unrealistic body standards. And I can tell Jerry to shut the fuck up. If you think it might help, give your ED/intrusive thoughts a name so you can call it on it's bullshit. \n\nWould you be willing to share any of the things you've been taught in treatment? Also, if you want to share your story of how you developed your ED, we are here to listen.\n\nIf you need ANYTHING, don't hesitate to ask.",

Despite hearing all the warnings about the consequences of this disease like a ruptured esophagus or heart failure, I\u2019ve never really taken them seriously or have never truly considered that they might happen to me. I recently have turned to this community on reddit in hopes of finding support since I am too ashamed to tell any of my loved ones. The crazy thing is, I am very fortunate to have people in my life who care about me and one of my best friends has even struggled with anorexia and bulimia and has gotten treatment/is in recovery, but I am so scared to talk about it to her or anyone else. As much as the fear comes from anticipating how they will react, I think I am more scared about opening up and being so vulnerable and sharing a deep dark secret I\u2019ve hidden for so long. A couple friends know that I have struggled with this in the past, but I\u2019ve always minimized the severity and have really never been honest about my behaviors with another human being. \n\nSince I joined this community and have read about other people\u2019s experiences and engaged with other users, I am making plans to contact an ED therapist that has been recommended to me by someone on this site. Unfortunately, the job I am starting next week working for an early stage startup won\u2019t provide any health insurance or benefits whatsoever, so I\u2019m worried that I may talk myself out of seeing a therapist to help me for financial reasons. I have recently felt now more than ever that this is a wake up call and I need to actually confront this disease and try to beat this thing. \n\nYour post really moved me, thanks again for sharing. If you don\u2019t mind me asking, what was your experience when you finally told someone? How did you bring yourself to do it?\n\nThank you again. Sending love.",

      "body": "Wow, that was an incredibly moving read that really hit me hard. I\u2019ve just turned 31, which means I\u2019ve officially battled my ED for 18 years now. I\u2019ve cycled back and forth between anorexia and bulimia pretty regularly. I think realistically I probably fit into the EDNOS category, as I don\u2019t restrict enough to be classed as anorexic, and I don\u2019t regularly binge as such, just throw up the little that I have eaten, so I don\u2019t really fit the bulimia model either. \n\nThe last 2? 3? years I\u2019ve been pretty solidly purging, to start with around 5 days a week, which worked it\u2019s way up to 7, currently I\u2019m down to about once every two weeks as I\u2019ve really been working hard on recovery and I have a new, utterly amazing partner who knows and tries to understand my illness. I desperately don\u2019t want to disappoint him, but weirdly enough that has lead me to being really honest with him about when I\u2019ve purged, rather than desperately hiding it. \n\nI\u2019m clearly blessed with good genetics teeth wise - despite my history I\u2019ve never had an adult filling or a root canal. Lately though I\u2019ve felt they are becoming more and more brittle, and they feel thinner than they used to. I\u2019ve been putting off going to the dentist since I regularly got back into the b/p cycle I\u2019ve been riding out for the past few years. Thank you so much for sharing your story. I\u2019m going to suck it up and book myself into the dentist tomorrow, and work even harder on sticking to my recovery plan. I wish you the absolute best and I can only hope that you find some way to get your teeth fixed and that if you can\u2019t get your hernia corrected, it at least does start to cause you less pain and discomfort as you continue your recovery journey and keep establishing and repeating good habits and a healthier diet.\n\nDentally - have you considered surgical tourism as an option? I know a few people who\u2019ve had major reconstructive dental work done in Thailand for a fraction of the price you\u2019d pay in most westernised countries. There are of course risks involved, but if you do your research there are amazing medical/dental facilities in that part of the world that are run by highly skilled medical professionals. I don\u2019t know any resources to suggest personally, but this could be something you might want to look into if it\u2019s just not possible for you to afford to get the work done in your home country.

It was the one thing I hesitated talking about. I feel that my disease is rooted in guilt, and for me guilt is a very difficult thing to cope with. I\u2019d tell my boyfriend and my best friend most of it... but not my mother. I am very close to my mother. Always have been. I\u2019ve told her everything, but I just couldn\u2019t talk to her about my eating disorder. \n\nShe knew I had it when I was a teenager, but I played it off and kept it a secret much easier as I got older and everyone in the house was on different schedules. Then when I got my own apartment it was very easy to engage in behaviors. I\u2019m not underweight and haven\u2019t been in a very long time so bulimia isn\u2019t very obvious. I always felt ill but I blamed that on the lupus and fibromyalgia.\n\nI wasn\u2019t making a lot of progress in treatment for a few weeks. Soon, I had a meeting with my therapist at the program, my mother, and myself. I told her what I always felt deep in my heart and saying it out loud was this freeing feeling I\u2019ve never had in my life, and I\u2019m a sensitive individual.\n\nThis is something I thought to myself in treatment - learning to allow yourself to be 100% vulnerable is a learned skill. It takes practice, it\u2019s a muscle that needs to be worked out. And after training making yourself vulnerable, having conversations, exploring yourself and your intentions*, you might feel exhausted. Literally every single day for two months I had a one hour drive to get to program for six hours, then drive to work for a half hour, then work for four hours, then drive home a half hour. I was so fucking exhausted every day, mentally, physically, emotionally. I\u2019d lay my head on the steering wheel and ask him, \u201cDo I really have to do this again tomorrow?\u201d And he\u2019d say \u201cYes, you do.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s so so exhausting, whether you opt for partial outpatient, partial inpatient, full inpatient. You need to learn how to let go of control in order to gain control back if makes any sense. I\u2019m a peaceful person and sometimes I felt myself get very angry. I\u2019d want to just not show up every day. But I showed up. I\u2019m the kind of person to pick up a new hobby and drop it. Dropped out of college. Walked out on fine relationships. I\u2019m a flake. But I showed up and I worked that god damn muscle until I couldn\u2019t anymore.\n\nSorry for writing another essay! I just don\u2019t get to talk about this experience very much. I wish you the absolute best of luck. Remember that there are real support networks out there, ones that truly want recovery. Confide in a friend or two if you haven\u2019t already, educate them on what this disease means to you. A lot of people I know don\u2019t understand bulimia and think it\u2019s simply an issue of vanity.\n\nIf you need some advice on looking into a partial inpatient centre and you\u2019re in the US feel free to pm me.",

I\u2019m so happy to hear that. Its important to remember to give ourselves a pat on the back every day we don\u2019t engage in behaviors. I\u2019m one of those people who can\u2019t handle compliments so *that* was a difficult lesson lol.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re interested, I\u2019d be happy to take a look at my recovery folder this week and share some info with you and everyone else on some important stuff we learned. Of course I am not a licensed therapist so I can\u2019t suggest anyone take any sort of action, but they\u2019re mostly useful exercises found in academic books. They\u2019re very moving forward oriented, specific goal oriented. Not so much talking about specific behaviors, food hang ups, etc. That kind of thing was reserved for your private therapist and nutritionist.",

I haven't b/p since August and I admire your recovery efforts because I know that it's really fucking hard. I am SO PROUD OF YOU for going to the dentist, even if your teeth can't be addressed immediately. I had 8 cavities filled in January, and it was about 8 months between my first time back to the dentist and when I was able to have them filled.\n\nThat 14 year old girl is still there, and you're taking care of her with everything you have. You're doin it dude! Even if it takes years. Every day you add to your recovery adds days or month and eventually years to your life. \n\nThis might sound silly, and idk if it would help you at all, but the ED voice in my head is named Jerry. Jerry is an old white man with very unrealistic body standards. And I can tell Jerry to shut the fuck up. If you think it might help, give your ED/intrusive thoughts a name so you can call it on it's bullshit. \n\nWould you be willing to share any of the things you've been taught in treatment? Also, if you want to share your story of how you developed your ED, we are here to listen.\n\nIf you need ANYTHING, don't hesitate to ask.",

It\u2019s a very serious illness that causes permanent, painful, lifelong health problems. Other stuff can happen from bulimia as well besides your teeth rotting out of your mouth and a hiatal hernia. You can develop gastroparesis, ulcers, a ripped esophagus, constipation leading to impaction, permanent hair loss, bone density loss (a 34 year old woman there with me had advanced osteoporosis), GERD (which you can get from the hiatal hernia and I have as well)... and stomach rupture, kidney failure, heart failure which are life threatening and kill bulimic people, including young ones, all the time. These are very real and I\u2019m living proof of it and I\u2019m lucky I got treatment now and not when I\u2019m knocking on deaths door. \n\n*edit: oh and I just remembered, a girl I was in treatment with had muscles that wasted away so bad that she had a vaginal prolapse!\n\nConsider talking to your psych if you have one, PCP, and insurance company.

      "body": "Hi! Sorry for taking so long to reply, this is my alt account for illness/addiction related stuff and I have bipolar disorder so I disappear from social media sometimes. \n\nI\u2019m sorry to hear you\u2019ve been fighting this for so long. I too didn\u2019t think anything major would happen, as I wasn\u2019t \u201csick\u201d enough. Throughout my fourteen year journey with my ED, I\u2019ve never been underweight. There\u2019s this weird stigma that you need to be severely underweight in order for your disease to be legitimate. I literally had a doctor (primary care medical intern) laugh in my face when I told him that I\u2019m bulimic and need help. I feel that bulimia, in a lot of cases, can be linked to feelings of guilt and shame, but I\u2019m not a psychologist.\n\nAs I\u2019ve said in other comments, vulnerability is a muscle. You need to keep working it out, it\u2019s ok to take days off to recover (it can be very emotionally exhausting) but then you need to get back into it. I would go to IOP 1pm to 7pm, then directly to work 7:30pm - 11:30 pm. I was exhausted, both physically and emotionally, every day. I work with my boyfriend. Every night we\u2019d drive home and I would lay my head on the steering wheel as soon as we pulled into the driveway. I\u2019d ask him \u201cDo I have to do this all again tomorrow?\u201d And he would say \u201cYes.\u201d Maybe consider talking to that friend of yours. You may be really surprised by their response and they can become a part of your support network. \n\nIt\u2019s important to have a network of support, whether it\u2019s two people or ten. Most people in my life ended up finding out because I went part time at work. I posted a card from the recovery center and shared some thoughts. I normally don\u2019t post very personal stuff, but it was the first time in my life that I\u2019ve *followed through with something* since high school and I\u2019m 28. It\u2019s not for everyone, but I was totally ok with educating others about the disease when possible, hoping to end some of the stigma. I have mental illnesses, but feel like this is one area of my life where I have control for once, but I\u2019m not sure yet if that\u2019s a good or bad thing yet\n\nI\u2019m sorry to hear you\u2019re dealing with insurance issues. Are you American? Maybe you can get some kind of temporary Medicare? If not, you have to weigh your options. How much is your psychical and well-being worth? You said you\u2019ve been struggling for ten years, that\u2019s a long time. Do you think you can continue to live this way? I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. \n\nWhile I may no longer be purging, I still have a lot of issues with mental illness and my journey is far from over. I wish my life was perfect and productive now but sadly it isn\u2019t. You know what though? Some people make an incredible recovery and it kick starts their lives. Mine didn\u2019t, but damn, it beats living like I was *plus* the bulimia.\n\nI really hope you consider seeing a professional, even if it\u2019s just to start planning and nudge you in the right direction. You deserve more out of life, I feel like bulimia is trying to swim upstream. You might make it but you\u2019ll be damn tired when you\u2019re done, or get swept away. There aren\u2019t many cases of people with  bulimia, dying at 93 in bed, due to natural causes, surrounded by friends and family. Something to consider. I don\u2019t mean to frighten you, but this is real shit time. \n\nMy bulimia morphed throughout the years, the first people I told were my middle school friends who didn\u2019t really get it and I was too embarrassed to bring it up again. Every boyfriend I\u2019ve had has known, and my current one has been very understanding. My parents have known on and off throughout the years, I lied a lot, hid it well. When I brought up that I was getting treatment they both said \u201cI thought you dropped that years ago\u201d. I figured fuck it, I need to explain why my schedule has changed so much, they already partially know. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s much more challenging if your legal guardians don\u2019t know, I would not be a good person to ask about that. There may be concern and tears, but there\u2019s not much you can do to stop that.\n\nSorry for an essay. I hope this helped answer some stuff. I hope you are doing well. <3",

I can\u2019t say that I can fully understand the pain you\u2019re going through both physically and emotionally, but I am so grateful you\u2019ve chosen use your pain and share your experience in order to help others. \n\nI\u2019ve been battling bulimia for almost 10 years, and have also had 2 root canals and some issues with teeth sensitivity as well. Despite hearing all the warnings about the consequences of this disease like a ruptured esophagus or heart failure, I\u2019ve never really taken them seriously or have never truly considered that they might happen to me. I recently have turned to this community on reddit in hopes of finding support since I am too ashamed to tell any of my loved ones. The crazy thing is, I am very fortunate to have people in my life who care about me and one of my best friends has even struggled with anorexia and bulimia and has gotten treatment/is in recovery, but I am so scared to talk about it to her or anyone else. As much as the fear comes from anticipating how they will react, I think I am more scared about opening up and being so vulnerable and sharing a deep dark secret I\u2019ve hidden for so long. A couple friends know that I have struggled with this in the past, but I\u2019ve always minimized the severity and have really never been honest about my behaviors with another human being. \n\nSince I joined this community and have read about other people\u2019s experiences and engaged with other users, I am making plans to contact an ED therapist that has been recommended to me by someone on this site. Unfortunately, the job I am starting next week working for an early stage startup won\u2019t provide any health insurance or benefits whatsoever, so I\u2019m worried that I may talk myself out of seeing a therapist to help me for financial reasons. I have recently felt now more than ever that this is a wake up call and I need to actually confront this disease and try to beat this thing. \n\nYour post really moved me, thanks again for sharing. If you don\u2019t mind me asking, what was your experience when you finally told someone? How did you bring yourself to do it?\n\nThank you again. Sending love.",

I\u2019ve cycled back and forth between anorexia and bulimia pretty regularly. I think realistically I probably fit into the EDNOS category, as I don\u2019t restrict enough to be classed as anorexic, and I don\u2019t regularly binge as such, just throw up the little that I have eaten, so I don\u2019t really fit the bulimia model either. \n\nThe last 2? 3? years I\u2019ve been pretty solidly purging, to start with around 5 days a week, which worked it\u2019s way up to 7, currently I\u2019m down to about once every two weeks as I\u2019ve really been working hard on recovery and I have a new, utterly amazing partner who knows and tries to understand my illness. I desperately don\u2019t want to disappoint him, but weirdly enough that has lead me to being really honest with him about when I\u2019ve purged, rather than desperately hiding it. \n\nI\u2019m clearly blessed with good genetics teeth wise - despite my history I\u2019ve never had an adult filling or a root canal. Lately though I\u2019ve felt they are becoming more and more brittle, and they feel thinner than they used to. I\u2019ve been putting off going to the dentist since I regularly got back into the b/p cycle I\u2019ve been riding out for the past few years. Thank you so much for sharing your story. I\u2019m going to suck it up and book myself into the dentist tomorrow, and work even harder on sticking to my recovery plan. I wish you the absolute best and I can only hope that you find some way to get your teeth fixed and that if you can\u2019t get your hernia corrected, it at least does start to cause you less pain and discomfort as you continue your recovery journey and keep establishing and repeating good habits and a healthier diet.\n\nDentally - have you considered surgical tourism as an option? I know a few people who\u2019ve had major reconstructive dental work done in Thailand for a fraction of the price you\u2019d pay in most westernised countries. There are of course risks involved, but if you do your research there are amazing medical/dental facilities in that part of the world that are run by highly skilled medical professionals. I don\u2019t know any resources to suggest personally, but this could be something you might want to look into if it\u2019s just not possible for you to afford to get the work done in your home country.

It was the one thing I hesitated talking about. I feel that my disease is rooted in guilt, and for me guilt is a very difficult thing to cope with. I\u2019d tell my boyfriend and my best friend most of it... but not my mother. I am very close to my mother. Always have been. I\u2019ve told her everything, but I just couldn\u2019t talk to her about my eating disorder. \n\nShe knew I had it when I was a teenager, but I played it off and kept it a secret much easier as I got older and everyone in the house was on different schedules. Then when I got my own apartment it was very easy to engage in behaviors. I\u2019m not underweight and haven\u2019t been in a very long time so bulimia isn\u2019t very obvious. I always felt ill but I blamed that on the lupus and fibromyalgia.\n\nI wasn\u2019t making a lot of progress in treatment for a few weeks. Soon, I had a meeting with my therapist at the program, my mother, and myself. I told her what I always felt deep in my heart and saying it out loud was this freeing feeling I\u2019ve never had in my life, and I\u2019m a sensitive individual.\n\nThis is something I thought to myself in treatment - learning to allow yourself to be 100% vulnerable is a learned skill. It takes practice, it\u2019s a muscle that needs to be worked out. And after training making yourself vulnerable, having conversations, exploring yourself and your intentions*, you might feel exhausted. Literally every single day for two months I had a one hour drive to get to program for six hours, then drive to work for a half hour, then work for four hours, then drive home a half hour. I was so fucking exhausted every day, mentally, physically, emotionally. I\u2019d lay my head on the steering wheel and ask him, \u201cDo I really have to do this again tomorrow?\u201d And he\u2019d say \u201cYes, you do.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s so so exhausting, whether you opt for partial outpatient, partial inpatient, full inpatient. You need to learn how to let go of control in order to gain control back if makes any sense. I\u2019m a peaceful person and sometimes I felt myself get very angry. I\u2019d want to just not show up every day. But I showed up. I\u2019m the kind of person to pick up a new hobby and drop it. Dropped out of college. Walked out on fine relationships. I\u2019m a flake. But I showed up and I worked that god damn muscle until I couldn\u2019t anymore.\n\nSorry for writing another essay! I just don\u2019t get to talk about this experience very much. I wish you the absolute best of luck. Remember that there are real support networks out there, ones that truly want recovery. Confide in a friend or two if you haven\u2019t already, educate them on what this disease means to you. A lot of people I know don\u2019t understand bulimia and think it\u2019s simply an issue of vanity.\n\nIf you need some advice on looking into a partial inpatient centre and you\u2019re in the US feel free to pm me.",

Contact a friend, read and make some tea, meditate, an artistic endeavor - something that makes you feel comfortable and safe. \n\nI had a lot of social anxiety until I started to work a retail job, that helped so much because I was forced to deal with the public daily. As happy as I am that I\u2019m no longer in retail, the social experience I gained made it worth it. Do you have a job? If so, ask a coworker you jive with if they\u2019d like to meet up sometime. Especially now that the weather is getting nicer (assuming you\u2019re in the northern hemisphere that is) there are a lot of cool outdoor things to do. Also, maybe check out Groupon! Hanging out doesn\u2019t have to revolve around eating and obsessing about food when you\u2019re just trying to have fun.\n\nThat even applies if you\u2019re just in school. Do you live on campus? Consider joining a club. I know it feels weird putting yourself out there, but if you can find a group that represents a cause you believe in or a hobby you enjoy, consider signing up. You\u2019re basically going to be forced to meet people who have at least one similar interest to you. I just try to think of it as \u201cfuck it, I cannot control the thoughts of others. They probably don\u2019t notice my flaws. And if they do, there\u2019s nothing I can do to stop them so there\u2019s no point in worrying about it\u201d. Most other people are concerned about their own shit and aren\u2019t focusing on you, just like how you aren\u2019t focused on them.\n\nI\u2019m really proud of you. Avoiding the exhaustion binge is hard. It\u2019s comforting. Sadly it\u2019s a slow acting poison and while it feels good now, it\u2019ll inevitably lead to a boiling point. For some it\u2019s loss of loved ones. Permanent health problems. Financial strain. Loss of your own life. Just saying, unfortunately you don\u2019t see many old bulimics. There\u2019s a reason for that.",

It was the one thing I hesitated talking about. I feel that my disease is rooted in guilt, and for me guilt is a very difficult thing to cope with. I\u2019d tell my boyfriend and my best friend most of it... but not my mother. I am very close to my mother. Always have been. I\u2019ve told her everything, but I just couldn\u2019t talk to her about my eating disorder. \n\nShe knew I had it when I was a teenager, but I played it off and kept it a secret much easier as I got older and everyone in the house was on different schedules. Then when I got my own apartment it was very easy to engage in behaviors. I\u2019m not underweight and haven\u2019t been in a very long time so bulimia isn\u2019t very obvious. I always felt ill but I blamed that on the lupus and fibromyalgia.\n\nI wasn\u2019t making a lot of progress in treatment for a few weeks. Soon, I had a meeting with my therapist at the program, my mother, and myself. I told her what I always felt deep in my heart and saying it out loud was this freeing feeling I\u2019ve never had in my life, and I\u2019m a sensitive individual.\n\nThis is something I thought to myself in treatment - learning to allow yourself to be 100% vulnerable is a learned skill. It takes practice, it\u2019s a muscle that needs to be worked out. And after training making yourself vulnerable, having conversations, exploring yourself and your intentions*, you might feel exhausted.
