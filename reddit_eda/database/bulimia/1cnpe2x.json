  "selftext": "I had 2 teeth extracted today that weren't my wisdom teeth. They were removed due to decay from purging... I cried during the procedure \ud83d\ude22 It was all just so overwhelming for me to lose my teeth, and the sights/sounds during the procedure were horrific!! \n\nAnyway, I didn't purge today because I'm terrified of getting dry sockets. My grandma's friend said the pain is worse than childbirth. I don't know if I'll be as strong tomorrow, though... 2 days in a row just sounds impossible. I can't remember the last time I kept a meal down and went an entire day without purging, so I guess that's my win for the day. Thanks for reading.",
