Vomiting, especially frequently, causes rapid depletion of potassium \u2014 and low potassium can be life-threatening (like heart rhythm issues mentioned by others). If someone\u2019s purging, they may need medical supervision and prescription potassium to restore safe levels, and once purging has stopped, they no longer need potassium supplemented. Please don\u2019t rely on food alone if you're struggling \u2014 it's serious and absolutely worth getting checked out by a doctor.\n\n- currently recovering from 20 years of anoxeria and bulimia, 5 years sober from alcohol.",
