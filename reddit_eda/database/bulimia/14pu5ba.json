          "body": "This! When I got pregnant (planned) I had been in recovery for 3yrs. I was upfront with my midwife (who I actually knew outside of baby things) and told her about my anxiety, depression and ED in our first meeting. I said that while I felt good in my recovery, I didn't know if the pregnancy would trigger anything and wanted her to also be prepared if it did.\nI can honestly say that I have NEVER felt as calm and collected about everything, my body and mind. As I have since being pregnant. I am now 11mths postpartum and I don't really care about what my body looks like. Could I be thinner? Sure! But my body provides for my child. They are happy and healthy and that is what matters. They need a mum who is here and attentive to their needs, not hyperforcused on her own shit. I have never been more confident and content as I have during this pregnancy and postpartum process.\nEdit to add. The one thing I was terrified of throughout being sick was causing infertility. It only took me a month to get pregnant.",
