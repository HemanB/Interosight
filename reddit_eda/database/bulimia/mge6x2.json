It\u2019s wild, I\u2019ve only recently started binge/ purging daily And I\u2019m already in a toxic cycle.  once again I\u2019m going big tonight and quitting tomorrow... sure",

I found it especially addictive when I was ritualizing the behavior and going out to buy binge food, which is usually highly palatable, salty, sugary, fatty foods that give you a big dopamine hit. I've heard other people talk about having addictions and Eds and in a lot of cases ED's can be harder to treat because you can't abstain from food. I'm sorry you're struggling and I hope you can get some help and break out of this cycle soon \u2764\ufe0f",

Where hard to come by since they are very very dangerous, i believe they\u2019re link to heart attacks and lastly I\u2019m kickings bulimia that\u2019s probably the hardest one , hang in there our brains might be wired differently but it\u2019s possible to quit",
