I purged in the restaurant but it took no time at all and he didn't know. Went out for coffee this afternoon and same thing, purged in a shop. No one knows, no one can tell. I'm maintaining a healthy bmi. I feel fine so am I fine? What damage does bulimia actually do? \n\nWhen I was uw, I felt a lot sicker and it was harder for my body to recover from a purge. I gained a few lbs and now it's like I'm not sick at all ",

Face/cheeks swelled, didn\u2019t even realize it until I looked at older pictures of me and realized I used to have a chiseled\nJaw line pre-bulimia, digestion is so fucked, takes forever to digest food I actually want to keep down, constipation is common, GERD SUCKS! Especially when trying to sleep and u have no tums/rolaids, throat was always sensitive, belly would be bloated as hell day after purges and I\u2019d actually try to keep food down when I\u2019d acknowledge BULIMIA IS NOT NORMAL AND ITS A FUCKING MENTAL DISORDER.\nAbout $12,000 in dentist bills for root canals, new teeth and prescription tooth paste to slow down the gum decay that\u2019s happened from consistent purging. \n\nOh my Favorite: filing bankruptcy for the massive credit card debt I let get outta control & couldn\u2019t get back on track from all the binge food I was buying- after working hard to get to an 830 FICO score where I literally had the best rates on anything I wanted & almost $270,000 in credit card funds. \n\nYes u are sick. Ur eating disorder is running the show  for u when u start to consider that binging and then throwing it up regularly isn\u2019t a problem. Especially normalizing it in a public setting. \nI\u2019m not attacking u! I struggled SEVERELY & shamefully.\nBeing caught, lying about it, barrowing money to pay bills cuz I binge ate my paycheck\u2026 then went and B/P\u2019d the money I barrowed for bills, binging on my girlfriends 4 year olds snacks (probably did him a favor tbh lol kids shouldn\u2019t be eating chemical ass sweets),\nCalling off work/blowing through PTO/Vac time from feeling way too weak and shitty from being up all night B/P\u2019ing, passing out in a Starbucks bathroom from\nElectrolyte depletion then being woken up by paramedics & questioned by police & being \u201cforced\u201d to  prove I wasn\u2019t intoxicated or shooting up/doing drugs & also now banned from that Starbucks (the police were going to give me a public intoxication citation if I refused to take a breathalyzer test) I flat Out told them I have an eating order and was purging & for fucks sake they didn\u2019t even believe me lol, puking in public bathrooms and not realizing it splashed all Over my shoes and pants and returning to work meetings, dates, dinners, corporate events etc smelling like puke. We don\u2019t realize it but others definitely smell it on us \u2026there\u2019s even Worse shit than that I\u2019ve done but I\u2019ve rambled enough.\n\nBottom line is this is not normal and it\u2019s not Ok.\nFar fucking from.\nU don\u2019t realize the trail of chaos it leaves around you and what it physically does to ur body and also ur mind and thought process until it\u2019s too late.\n\nPlease don\u2019t get comfortable with this sickness. It\u2019s happy to make a home inside your head and take over ur life and eventually take ur life. \n\nThrowing up ur food intentionally out of fear of gaining weight is mental sickness.\n\nEating is normal- keeping it down and digesting it and using the nutrients vitamins minerals and macros in the food for fuel, body regeneration, healing, hormonal support, cellular growth and overall health is NORMAL.\n\nI hope u get on well and can beat this shit.\nIt\u2019s hard buts it\u2019s possible. I didn\u2019t think it was after so many failed attempts but I finally feel like I got this recovery attempt working. I still have urges but I\u2019m realizing it\u2019s just that: an urge.\nI\u2019m in control. No one or no thing actually makes me do it. I chose to do it. What\u2019s even worse is choosing to do despite knowing how terrible it is and the side consequences\u2014- that\u2019s just more proof of a mental issue.\n \nI hope u find ur way out of it sooner than later & never have to deal with the ugly painful side of it.",

Barrett\u2019s esophagus. Gerd. Digestion crap. Oh more! Hearing loss! Yep. Deaf in one ear. The other was going when I stopped cold turkey. Arthritis. Heart irregularities. Miscarriages. I could write a book. The shit just hits you. I have 11 dental implants. Three teeth hurt now that I\u2019m losing. Did I say I rinse? Yes. But it does not stop the decay. I never thought it would hurt me either. I loved being able to eat and drink then purge and dance and be thin. It eats you up from inside. It\u2019s a mental disorder. It\u2019s cruel. It\u2019s hard to kick. Really hard. But one day I realized it would not kill me but instead disable the crap out of me while everyone around me is fine. Wondering what\u2019s wrong with her. Get in touch with your inner self and understand why you do this. To be thin?  Being thin won\u2019t help if your body is decayed. I\u2019ve gained 7 pounds since I\u2019ve stopped. Big deal. I\u2019m getting healthy again piece by piece. It takes a lot of will power but you are worth it. I had to see myself in a whole new light of catching up to heal. You don\u2019t want that! I send you hugs and hope you will recover before that day hits. It comes out of nowhere. But it\u2019s coming. (PS. I had surgery recently and the anesthesia made me sick but I could not vomit!
