And only then i realise that i have slipped on this again. \n\n\u2022 Even after \u201cthe walk\u201d (or other distractions) when i was about to binge, i still want it. The urge doesn\u2019t go away \n\n\u2022 Actually i do get pleasure from b&p/ing. Sometimes i think maybe that\u2019s just my hobby and i need to stop going to ED therapy.\n\n\u2022 I do not have a meal count. Usually it\u2019s just a never ending one the whole day with the purges in between.\n\n\u2022 Antidepressants just boosted my mood. I still want to binge every singe day.\n\n\u2022 Most probably I would not binge if i was poor. Well i\u2019m a student living at her mum\u2019s so i\u2019m not anywhere near being wealthy but i mean if i was actually poor, i would appreciate food and would never just waste it. \n\nWrite some of yours :)\n\n\nedit: wow thanks for such a lot of upvotes. I\u2019m glad to show you\u2019re not alone in that mess.",

It's like advertising cocaine on a silver platter. World is just so triggering, because the main targets of consumerism revolve around food and looks. \n\nWaiting in line at the grocery store, wondering how many people are judging what I'm buying.\n\nBingeing on literally anything I can find. If it's a can of beans, I don't care, if it's sour cresm on it's own, half cooked colf rice, food I don't even like, food that should be thrown away, food that's been thrown away... Anything just to stuff my face with something. This is way EDs should not be glamorized, because they are ugly as shit. I'm a mess, but I manage to put a mask on and all people see is ...

It\u2019s like an addiction- I plan my entire life around when, what and how I\u2019ll bp. And just like any drug nothing will stop me. Money or not if I can\u2019t afford the whole bag of chicken nuggets I\u2019ll find a way to pay for ramen noodles and if I can\u2019t pay there\u2019s a local food pantry. I\u2019ve looked in garbage bins. It\u2019s such a constant part of my life and from everyone else\u2019s perspective I\u2019m just the small skinny guy who\u2019s a picky eater. I\u2019ve spent well over a hundred thousand dollars in my lifetime on bp food. It\u2019s a disorder just like an addiction and I hope one day to be rid of it but I also get the enjoyment out of it, therapists call it the control I just don\u2019t know what else I\u2019d do with the time I spend bp everyday. It\u2019s like a stalker who\u2019s always knocking on the door, ringing your phone and checking the windows to see if you\u2019re home. I really wish there was more places available for help.
