These are just my teeth now. It took some mental training at first, allowing myself to smile after hiding it for so long. Then having this done, I became so self conscious that everyone would notice I had \u201cfake teeth\u201d. I only told the closest to me. They were supportive and honestly didn\u2019t treat me any different or make much comment. So wild what we can do to ourselves in our heads. No one has ever noticed. Other then on occasion someone is kind and says I have a pretty smile. \n\nI\u2019m super excited for you and your future freedom. It really was a huge milestone for me in my journey of self care and acceptance. This is HUGE. What some people do as a simple cosmetic procedure-some of us are doing for much deeper reasons. The fears that comes along with that, facing your demons, owning our shit\u2026is so hard. I commend you. You are BRAVE. Hopefully soon you\u2019ll be smiling all the time and never thinking twice about it again. \n\nI say I appreciate this, because if I am being transparent like I was when I posted this\u2026..this last week is the first time I have purged in years. I feel low and icky. I won\u2019t allow myself to fall back into the depths of this horrid addiction and disease, but it\u2019s a wake up call for me and where I am at in my life at the moment. So thank you for saying this. It\u2019s hard to even allow ourselves to think we could inspire someone for the better. But that\u2019s why I wanted to share this at that time. To speak to a women, girl, man, boy, whoever\u2026..Right now to my past self..just wanting to be that person for others to find hope in. \n\nFor your questions\u2026I took tons of pictures for myself during the process. You will go through stages with it, as I hope they have explained to you. (The temporaries.) These pictures were actually pictures my dentist took and gave me. I was blessed with a beyond supportive dentist, who gifted me these photos. She actually took a lot of professional photos. (With my consent.) for her to use and share as well. I did not provide any pictures of my teeth before the damage. This was all her work. I\u2019d have faith in whoever your seeing. Dentist know what there doing when it comes to jaw+teeth shape, our bites/alignments. I think sharing your fears, wants, etc. are going to be important. I did ask for a more natural look when they asked me questions\u2026I didn\u2019t do any teeth whitening, and asked that they just match the rest of my teeth. I don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with bringing in a former picture of your teeth tho. You are your only advocate. Your investing your time, money, and spirit into this.\n\nLastly, yes it has helped with sensitivity immensely. That was 50% of the reason I went in to do this. Eating, and more so drinking liquids was becoming unbearable. My teeth and mouth would throb all day long. I don\u2019t have any of those sensations/pain anymore. Sometimes I question now if I have cavities in my back molars but that\u2019s just from my own personal neglect \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n \nThanks again! Sorry for the story book response.

Lots of fillings etc. The crowns on my four front teeth took about 2.5 weeks. It sounds super scary, but they file your teeth down and place porcelain caps (crowns) over what's left of your teeth. The first appointment where they intially file down your teeth, they put temporary teeth on and you wait 2 weeks for a lab to make your porcelain set. The temporary teeth look super natural and you honestly can't tell. I had so much fear of the whole process. I think it's super important to find a dentist you feel comfortable with.",

I needed a good cry and being filled with hope brought it out! \n\nI\u2019m so proud of you for responding to a relapse with determination to not fall back into the old ways. It\u2019s the harder path to take, and I commend you for your commitment to your health! Seeing it as a wake up call is the best way to look at it, I think. It\u2019s a hard thing to put words to, but I feel that if something makes you feel icky it means that it doesn\u2019t align with your truth/the path you want in life; so the ick to me means that you truly know in your soul that you deserve health. I\u2019m hoping you aren\u2019t beating yourself up, I know relapses can feel so devastating. A day doesn\u2019t negate all the progress made. You\u2019re doing great. \n\nI appreciate you saying to trust the dentist. They\u2019ve got such a wide range of knowledge that is so far out of my wheelhouse that I didn\u2019t consider that, like\u2026 they know what they\u2019re doing. I will be bringing up a more \u201cnatural look\u201d and inquiring about some whitening options. (I\u2019m realizing my brain shuts off when I go to healthcare professionals so I\u2019ve got a list made preemptively so I don\u2019t forget anything!) \n\nI cannot wait to smile again. I\u2019m so glad that you are, too. And you\u2019re right, it ain\u2019t just cosmetic. My teeth are a daily reminder of what I put myself through. I need this to heal in a way I haven\u2019t been able to thus far. It\u2019s amazing what our brains can do, and I know that seeing the damage I\u2019ve caused isn\u2019t serving me in any fashion (I\u2019d say it\u2019s rather damaging). I\u2019d done intensive therapy two years ago, and since then I\u2019ve had b/p incidents, and it\u2019s still absolutely a daily battle. But I\u2019ve proved to myself that each day I have the potential to impress myself, and seizing that feels so so so much better than the old habits. The hope comes with the knowledge that I\u2019ll be able to smile without shame, without wondering what strangers think my back story is, just the possibility of a shameless smile is so exciting! \n\nI\u2019m once again going to shout out your bravery on helping absolutely strangers see what\u2019s possible. You\u2019ve contributed something invaluable to humankind by sharing your story (I\u2019m not exaggerating, that\u2019s what you\u2019ve done!). And thank you for calling me brave!

So maybe I can help someone like you\u2019ve helped me. \n \nI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re still responding to comments, but did you provide your dentist with photos of what your teeth used to look like? (Anything will be better than what I have left, just wondering because I used to have quite long front teeth and was actually fond of their former shape.)\n\nAlso, did your front teeth have sensitivity from the enamel erosion? If so, do the crowns help cut down that sensitivity?",

          "body": "I appreciate this. Ya know\u2026.it\u2019s crazy to think about how I never allowed myself to smile. Not something I ever think about anymore. It becomes your normal so fast. These are just my teeth now. It took some mental training at first, allowing myself to smile after hiding it for so long. Then having this done, I became so self conscious that everyone would notice I had \u201cfake teeth\u201d. I only told the closest to me. They were supportive and honestly didn\u2019t treat me any different or make much comment. So wild what we can do to ourselves in our heads. No one has ever noticed. Other then on occasion someone is kind and says I have a pretty smile. \n\nI\u2019m super excited for you and your future freedom. It really was a huge milestone for me in my journey of self care and acceptance. This is HUGE. What some people do as a simple cosmetic procedure-some of us are doing for much deeper reasons. The fears that comes along with that, facing your demons, owning our shit\u2026is so hard. I commend you. You are BRAVE. Hopefully soon you\u2019ll be smiling all the time and never thinking twice about it again. \n\nI say I appreciate this, because if I am being transparent like I was when I posted this\u2026..this last week is the first time I have purged in years. I feel low and icky. I won\u2019t allow myself to fall back into the depths of this horrid addiction and disease, but it\u2019s a wake up call for me and where I am at in my life at the moment. So thank you for saying this. It\u2019s hard to even allow ourselves to think we could inspire someone for the better. But that\u2019s why I wanted to share this at that time. To speak to a women, girl, man, boy, whoever\u2026..Right now to my past self..just wanting to be that person for others to find hope in. \n\nFor your questions\u2026I took tons of pictures for myself during the process. You will go through stages with it, as I hope they have explained to you. (The temporaries.) These pictures were actually pictures my dentist took and gave me. I was blessed with a beyond supportive dentist, who gifted me these photos. She actually took a lot of professional photos. (With my consent.) for her to use and share as well. I did not provide any pictures of my teeth before the damage. This was all her work. I\u2019d have faith in whoever your seeing. Dentist know what there doing when it comes to jaw+teeth shape, our bites/alignments. I think sharing your fears, wants, etc. are going to be important. I did ask for a more natural look when they asked me questions\u2026I didn\u2019t do any teeth whitening, and asked that they just match the rest of my teeth. I don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with bringing in a former picture of your teeth tho. You are your only advocate. Your investing your time, money, and spirit into this.\n\nLastly, yes it has helped with sensitivity immensely. That was 50% of the reason I went in to do this. Eating, and more so drinking liquids was becoming unbearable. My teeth and mouth would throb all day long. I don\u2019t have any of those sensations/pain anymore. Sometimes I question now if I have cavities in my back molars but that\u2019s just from my own personal neglect \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n \nThanks again! Sorry for the story book response.

A community of people who understand what it's like to go through this is such a gift to find. Thanks for sharing also! \n\nI totally can relate to those feelings. When I would try substaine from the pinge-burge cycle my skin would litterly crawl and itch. I think there is a lot of similarly to it and the brain of an addict. \n\nI think it's important to give yourself a lot of grace. If you can make it 24hrs that is something to be proud of in itself. Try to identify your triggers and if you can break through to yourself in the moments when the urge is taking over - ask yourself what is the reason behind this urge, in this moment. Try to distract yourself, leave where your at, go for a walk, take a drive and listen to some music. I could never trust myself to be alone, so I had to make a point to be around people or else I would engage in the cycle. \n\nI don't know how you feel about medications (took me a long time to accept I needed them) or if you struggle with depression, but something that has helped immensely is switching over to an SNRI as apposed to an SSRI. I didn't realize how severely my anxiety effected my life until I got on the medication I'm on now. SNRI's help balance people with Anxiety disorders as well as depression. You can go to a general practitioner and tell them what you are mentally experiencing ( you don't have to share your struggle with eating if your not ready) and they can help you or refer you out. \n\nAs I mentioned, I think Bulimia has a lot of associate with addiction. You litterly have to rewire your brain, break your patterns. They say it takes about 2 months for a behavior to become automatic. Don't beat yourself up if you go a couple days and then give in. Every moment you give yourself the care you deserve is a victory. Lots of love and lots of grace. \u2764\ufe0f",
