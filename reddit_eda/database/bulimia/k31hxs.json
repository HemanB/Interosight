It was weird explaining to my team when I was in recovery that \"literally being able to feel anything in my stomach at all sends me into a [dissociative state of anxiety]\" and even weirder having to explain that to a blessedly supportive friend when I came home. I wish I could offer some advice, but hopefully knowing you're not alone can offer some solace. People have gotten past this before, so there is hope for us yet.",
