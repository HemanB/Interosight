  "selftext": "I am now almost 40. From my early teens I was trying to diet despite not being overweight. This was mainly due to being told over and over by my mother that I was fat. In truth I just was taller and had a larger frame than my mother or my sister. My mother has terrible body image herself and I think projected this onto me. \nAs the diet didn't work because I didn't understand nutrition or have any support and didn't really need to loose weight a spiral of eating and vomiting began. This was from about she 13/14. \nI would look in the mirror and be horrified by my reflection. Now when I look at photos from that time I'm taken aback by how beautiful I really looked but all I saw at the time was fat and ugly.\nI have had a completely unhealthy relationship with food for my whole adult life and pre adult life. \nI kept it a secret not even my best friend or husband really knew about. Sometimes I would starve myself sometimes I would binge and purge. Every night I would think tomorrow will be better but it was always the same.\nIn the last two years I have sought proper help. This was only after I saw my toddler daughter pretend to vomit into the toilet after seeing me do it. I realised how wrong and abnormal it was and just how very long it had gone on. It's time to lay this heavy burden down. \nPlease, please do not follow my example, if you are reading this seek help now. Do not let this illness overshadowed your life like it did me. I am so glad I got treatment and can live largely free from these behaviours. I don't think they will go away on their own, you need to accept it's a problem and to accept help. \nLay this burden down, it does not bring value to anything in your life.",

I was telling lies to my husband all the time and felt so deceitful. \nI truth I found talking and acknowledging it really helped but accepting my body as imperfect just like everyone's body is made the biggest change. You need to accept yourself for who you are. If I slip up I don't make it into a catastrophe I just say to myself I will start again. Sometimes I have to force myself to sit and not make myself sick. You need to realise the feeling of feeling disgust passes. Distract yourself when that horrible feeling starts and try to do something else. I also find not bingeing help you stop purging and I just don't buy my binge foods anymore. That helps alot because I don't have that horrible overfull disgusting feeling so feel less need to vomit. I also never buy laxatives any more it's just too dangerous to have them in the house.",
