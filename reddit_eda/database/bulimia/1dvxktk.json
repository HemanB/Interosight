  "selftext": "For the first time in FIVE years, I DIDN\u2019T BP!\n\nI ate 3 full meals,and 3 snacks in between and kept them all down. DOWN. \n\nI didn\u2019t go to the bathroom purge, nor bent down to make myself throw up. \n\nI\u2019m just so happy but I have no one to share this to.\n\nYes, there were urges telling me to bp. But I fought against them. \ud83d\ude2d it was tough but I\u2019m just so happy I made it at least ONE DAY not to bp in five goddamn years \n",
