      "body": "Princess Diana is one of my biggest role models. There\u2019s the fact she suffered through and conquered bulimia herself, but then also the fact she 1) wrote this letter of support 2) to a MAN!!! with bulimia really really hits close to home as I\u2019m a guy recovering from bulimia and it\u2019s very much seen as a \u201cgirl\u2019s thing\u201d like most EDs. \n\nI have Princess Diana plates I eat off of when I\u2019m really struggling\u2026 lol. My mom went a little crazy on a Shutterfly deal. \n\nSeason 4 of *The Crown* on Netflix does an amazing job portraying Diana\u2019s bulimia. It is obviously triggering, but so good. I\u2019m not a fan of how they showed it in *Spencer* but it is better bulimia portrayal in the media than we usually get.",
