I do think anyone else vomiting is disgusting, which it is, but it\u2019s also triggering for my ED because I\u2019m like, how come they can do it and I can\u2019t.",

I\u2019m okay with me throwing up, I do cry and get all panicky. I prefer not to and will try not to. but when someone else throws up my flight (there is no fight because I ain\u2019t sticking around) response kicks in and my heart races and my hands get all shaky. It makes no sense to me either. For me, I absolutely do not like other people\u2019s germs. So that could be a possibility, esp if you also don\u2019t like blood, spit, urine, etc.",
