  "selftext": "I try to be healthy. Oops, orthorexia. So I\u2019ll let go. Oops, BED. So I\u2019ll stop eating. Oops, anorexia. So I\u2019ll try to eat again but I\u2019ll be so scared of gaining. Oops, bulimia. \n\nIs anyone else stuck in this cycle? It\u2019s been like this since I was 13. Constantly cycling through different eating disorders through out my life and never being \u2018close to recovery\u2019, instead I fall from one unhealthy pattern or habit to another no matter what I do even when I go to therapy or take meds :/ \n\nI just turned 20 a few months ago and I\u2019m so fucking angry I\u2019m entering my 20s still carrying with me my teenage problems. Idk. I\u2019m upset and tired and I\u2019m getting sick both physically and mentally the longer I\u2019m in this cycle. I\u2019m fatigued and malnourished and I don\u2019t have energy for anything + I\u2019m isolating myself from everyone and idk what to do anymore. Just venting bc I have nowhere else to write this at.",

It\u2019s been 19 years of my life wasted with an awful relationship with myself and food.\n\nIt\u2019s been hellish with the pandemic my mental health has been torn into pieces and now I\u2019m just waiting for death to kick me.\n\nSend you a hug OP, it\u2019s rough dealing with all this crap.",

      "body": "Hi. \n\nThis has been my life for the last 40 years. I\u2019m 53 now. My biggest problem was with bulimia I suppose. Never had a stable weight. I used to SH as well. \n\nIn the last 18 months I eat pretty healthily though and I really feel that I will never be troubled by bulimia again. I\u2019m not happy with my weight (overweight) but don\u2019t want to reduce intake as this is a slippery slope. The major factor in my eating better/more regularly etc is that I no longer life alone. \n\nI\u2019ve had a lot of therapy,taken a lot of meds. I currently take an AD only. \n\nI honestly don\u2019t know if therapy helped me see things any more clearly. It kept me alive though, having someone who was there to listen. Still have so mush self doubt and hatred. \n\nPlease try and \u2018tackle\u2019 this NOW. The longer you have these behaviours, the harder it is to stop. Have you tried therapy?\n\nYou\u2019re not alone OP. It really is a horrible way to live. I don\u2019t know what else to say but if you want to pm me please feel free.",
