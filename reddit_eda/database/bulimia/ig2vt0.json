  "selftext": "Hey guys! First time posting here. BUT I HAVE TRULY RECOVERED FROM BULIMIA AFTER 7 LONG YEARS AND IVE NEVER FELT PROUDER!! I\u2019m so happy but at the same time I\u2019m filled with dread. I haven\u2019t gone to the dentist in 4 years and yesterday I felt pain in one of my tooth and took a look and wondered how I didn\u2019t see it before. I\u2019m almost positive I have 4 cavities and it breaks my heart. My teeth are slightly yellow, worn down, and just.... I\u2019m not confident because of this. How do you guys deal with this? This feeling of dread because of your teeth? It honestly sucks. I\u2019m going to the emergency dental place Wednesday bc have school tomorrow and will hopefully get fillings ASAP. But I really want to restore my teeth and  future of teeth restoration through porcelain crowns is what I think will truly make me happy and save my remaining teeth. Has or is anyone going through this?? I just need to hear words from ppl would had/have what I\u2019m going thro.",
