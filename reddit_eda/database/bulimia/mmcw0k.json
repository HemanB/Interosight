But feel like it's the thing that's been letting the team down.\n\nIt's me though.\n\nMy body isn't letting the team down.\n\nI am.\n\nBy doing what I do.\n\nAnyway we are going to work on connecting with my body again in the coming weeks. I'm trying to find love for curvier bodies and hope I can work on bringing some love to mine.\n\nI just wondered if anyone else saw their body as a separate thing too",

The point is to have compassion for yourself and your body. They are two separate things, but that body is your vessel and its yours to love and take care of all the little cells and organs and everything that makes up your body. Its your responsibility to look after it like a mothers would look after her baby. It\u2019ll take time, but I am rooting for you, you got this.",
