  "selftext": "I'm a senior in high school and currently struggling with bulimia. I denied the possibility of having a issue because I have never been considered thin. \n\nI'm a curvy girl, I used to be over 200lb but have dropped at least 40 in the last 6 months. I binge and purge often, but when I have tried to talk about my bulimia to some close friends/family they don't believe me. \n\nAt all. \n\nI've been trying diets all my life and generally I'm really sensitive about my appearance, \n\nI get shit because others claim I'm doing/saying things for attention and I can't have a disorder because I'm fat. Yeah thanks that doesn't help. \n\nI shouldn't be denied support simply based on my looks. It hurts even more when I get compliments on how I've lost weight. My self image is so skewed I can't even tell. And it just makes me want to push more and more. Just so people believe and stop calling me a liar. \n\nI'm sorry this is kinda ranty but I'm pissed off. I guess I'm just looking too see if anyone else has had this experience.\n\nAn eating disorder is an eating disorder regardless of what the person looks like.\n\nEdit: holy moly the interaction I've gotten on this is amazing! I'm very touched by all the warm words. Thank you kind strangers.",
