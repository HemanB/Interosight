I\u2019ve just spent over $2000 on the spot for the fix up for the three teeth where i already had root canals done earlier in my life because of my bloody eating disorders!!! And it just adds up to the amount which I roughly assume to be about 50 grand counting from my teen age period and i swear to God my family is poor and every time my parents save up some money they just end up spending it all on my dental bills. I feel really helpless and feel indescribably terrible for them for having an only child like me. I\u2019m 22 I\u2019ve had eating disorders since i was 15 went from anorexic to bulimic all the way to the point where i would purge EVERY SINGLE DAY since I\u2019ve started purging. It just can\u2019t get any worse because when you\u2019re purging every day it\u2019s unavoidable to have your teeth slowly dissolve in time which leads to an insane amount of cost for dental care. I come from a country where openly talking abouy eating disorder is really uncommon and people still feel uncomfortable about it so I\u2019ve never really had the opportunity to talk about it. I gotta say it feels liberating to confess what\u2019s it like to have eating disorders for such a long time. I just desperately want to be able to love my body and who I am.",
