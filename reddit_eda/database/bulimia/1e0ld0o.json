  "selftext": "   Honestly I'm just curious as to what other people have to deal with that isn't that well known like the teeth side of things.\n   Literally can be anything, even if it is a rant about your dental issues.\n\n   Right now I'm dealing with;\n-   The occasional very painful heartburn that can happen every time I lay down. (Depending on how bad I b/p recently.)\n-   Needing to vomit after I eat, if I don't it either comes back up as painful bile/heartburn or I quite literally projectile vomit some of it which has happened through my mouth and nose.\n-    The constant crushing guilt and shame I feel.\n-    Not caring about much else, alongside a messy room which most likely smells horrid.\n -   Disposing of the vomit and trash.\n -   A very painful sore onto of my mouth which I assume is from the vomitting yet I have still been doing it.\n-   Constant worry of rotting teeth and panicking if they hurt yet I hardly can bring myself to brush them because I will most likely b/p soon anyways\n-   Worry about the fact I'll smell like vomit\n",

I was in the hospital November 2023 for hypokalemia (severely low potassium) and I could have dropped dead at any moment. I lied to them and said I wasn\u2019t sure what the cause was, that maybe I was working too much (true) and I wasn\u2019t eating very much (also true). They also asked if I took any laxatives and I denied it. I was at a 1.2 when I should\u2019ve been at 3.5. I stayed for 3 days and left. \n\nFast forward to this past January. I weighed 135. Wasn\u2019t happy. I\u2019m 5\u20192 so I always feel huge because of how short I am. I restricted, increased my laxative intake back up to 100 pills per day, and occasionally drank coconut water and ate some cheese. Dropped down to 120. Work was a pain in my ass and decided to take a weekend to spend with my ex/good friend of mine (bad idea? mayyyybe). No regrets and it was great. A week later, double vision, almost fainted and had to go to the ER. I\u2019m back at a 1.1 and it\u2019s being discussed that I should be transferred to \u201cDenver Acute\u201d. As in Denver, CO - meaning, only the most severe cases of eating disorders with the highest risk of death. I\u2019ll be honest, yes of course it scared me - I have two kids, I\u2019m still young, I can\u2019t keep doing this. But I also thought, I can just get my potassium up, keep it up and just occasionally take laxatives. \n\nI\u2019m not going to tell you what to do, or that it gets better. All of that shit is obviously up to you. I am doing much better now. Yes, I\u2019m still taking laxatives. Not *as* much, but I am working on it - every single day. There are days where I overload and I\u2019m throwing up into my trash can while on the toilet. I get it. It\u2019s an ongoing battle and idk when it\u2019ll end. But you\u2019re not alone and I\u2019m here if you need someone to listen.\u2763\ufe0f oh and get your blood work done every now and then. \ud83e\udef6",

I was in the hospital November 2023 for hypokalemia (severely low potassium) and I could have dropped dead at any moment. I lied to them and said I wasn\u2019t sure what the cause was, that maybe I was working too much (true) and I wasn\u2019t eating very much (also true). They also asked if I took any laxatives and I denied it. I was at a 1.2 when I should\u2019ve been at 3.5. I stayed for 3 days and left. \n\nFast forward to this past January. I weighed 135. Wasn\u2019t happy. I\u2019m 5\u20192 so I always feel huge because of how short I am. I restricted, increased my laxative intake back up to 100 pills per day, and occasionally drank coconut water and ate some cheese. Dropped down to 120. Work was a pain in my ass and decided to take a weekend to spend with my ex/good friend of mine (bad idea? mayyyybe). No regrets and it was great. A week later, double vision, almost fainted and had to go to the ER. I\u2019m back at a 1.1 and it\u2019s being discussed that I should be transferred to \u201cDenver Acute\u201d. As in Denver, CO - meaning, only the most severe cases of eating disorders with the highest risk of death. I\u2019ll be honest, yes of course it scared me - I have two kids, I\u2019m still young, I can\u2019t keep doing this. But I also thought, I can just get my potassium up, keep it up and just occasionally take laxatives. \n\nI\u2019m not going to tell you what to do, or that it gets better. All of that shit is obviously up to you. I am doing much better now. Yes, I\u2019m still taking laxatives. Not *as* much, but I am working on it - every single day.

          "body": "Hi. :) So I\u2019ve been addicted to laxatives since I was 15/16 years old, on and off; I turn 31 in two months and I have two young children ages 4 and 6. I was in the hospital November 2023 for hypokalemia (severely low potassium) and I could have dropped dead at any moment. I lied to them and said I wasn\u2019t sure what the cause was, that maybe I was working too much (true) and I wasn\u2019t eating very much (also true). They also asked if I took any laxatives and I denied it. I was at a 1.2 when I should\u2019ve been at 3.5. I stayed for 3 days and left. \n\nFast forward to this past January. I weighed 135. Wasn\u2019t happy. I\u2019m 5\u20192 so I always feel huge because of how short I am. I restricted, increased my laxative intake back up to 100 pills per day, and occasionally drank coconut water and ate some cheese. Dropped down to 120. Work was a pain in my ass and decided to take a weekend to spend with my ex/good friend of mine (bad idea? mayyyybe). No regrets and it was great. A week later, double vision, almost fainted and had to go to the ER. I\u2019m back at a 1.1 and it\u2019s being discussed that I should be transferred to \u201cDenver Acute\u201d. As in Denver, CO - meaning, only the most severe cases of eating disorders with the highest risk of death. I\u2019ll be honest, yes of course it scared me - I have two kids, I\u2019m still young, I can\u2019t keep doing this. But I also thought, I can just get my potassium up, keep it up and just occasionally take laxatives. \n\nI\u2019m not going to tell you what to do, or that it gets better. All of that shit is obviously up to you. I am doing much better now. Yes, I\u2019m still taking laxatives. Not *as* much, but I am working on it - every single day. There are days where I overload and I\u2019m throwing up into my trash can while on the toilet. I get it. It\u2019s an ongoing battle and idk when it\u2019ll end. But you\u2019re not alone and I\u2019m here if you need someone to listen.\u2763\ufe0f oh and get your blood work done every now and then. \ud83e\udef6",

And you should rinse well with plain water after a purge, drink about 1/2 liter of water, and chew a calcium tums to protect the teeth. It\u2019s not the flush of stomach acid eroding them as much as sitting around letting it eat ch the teeth after you are done.",
