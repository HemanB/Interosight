  "selftext": "I bought the food, all the usual suspects, got home and started.. I ate one candy bar, one cookie, and conveniently about one serving of ice cream before I decided I really didnt feel like it and put all that shit away. I've never been able to do that! For those out there struggling, recovery feels amazing and it is worth the pain and strain. I wish you all the best because you deserve it. Stay safe!!",
