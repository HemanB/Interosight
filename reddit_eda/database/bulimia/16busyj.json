Unfortunately it was a hard pill to swallow. I myself have had many eating issues which led to body image issues  when I was younger so in ways I could relate. He denied and denied which I knew was coming. There were times I was so afraid to bring it up in conversation about his disorder because I knew he would deny it and I\u2019d feel weird bringing it up. Over time I tried to slowly pry and help out. He wouldn\u2019t let me to be honest there were so many times I felt so broken and let down and I didn\u2019t want to be with him because I knew dating him I was also living with his disorder because it consumes you wholly. Which breaks my heart. It took so much time and so much conversation and conviction to have him open up. Over time with patience he started to let me in and we would discuss on how he would find help mostly for him to better him and I I was guiding him in a healthy direction. Because I care and I love him so very much I knew it would be hard letting him go because I know I went through struggles and no one helped me in turn I can help him even though at times is challenging he\u2019s in the beginning stages of recovering and learning to unlearn behaviors I want to and will stand by him thick and thin I know he\u2019s the man I want to marry so we must overcome it together. If the guy you were dating love you he would have fought! Relationship is a all in or not. You deserve to be loved and cared for and shown how to become healthy it\u2019s so possible!

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to set boundaries and decide that a relationship with someone who has an ED is too much for them. I will say that the way this guy went about it was completely wrong. They should try to support you in whatever way they can while being able to set boundaries for their own well being. He did none of that. It\u2019s a very complex situation so to just drop someone like this is messed up.",
