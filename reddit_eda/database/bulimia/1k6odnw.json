She\u2019s hidden it very well, but in the last couple of weeks, I\u2019ve noticed a few signs.  I\u2019m taking her to the GP next week and we\u2019ll be asking for a referral to SEDS (Australian Service). But I\u2019m wondering if anyone is able to tell me what we\u2019re in for.

      "body": "It's a great sign that she's opened up to you. Keep being there for her and check in with her \u2764\ufe0f\n\nBulimia is not the problem, just the coping mechanism. There is something going on underneath this that is causing her pain. She likely is not aware of what is truly wrong or why she is doing this. Therapy should be able to help. Is she having problems at school, with friendships, any family problems?\n\nYou can help her with meals and stay with her afterwards to avoid purging if she would like you to. You could try distraction activities together for half an hour after meals or just stay with her and hug her/talk to her/hold her hand. It's best to ask her how you can help so she's comfortable or suggests things and ask her if that would be okay. But it's important to not be too controlling or force her to stop the bulimic behaviours. The most important thing is letting her know she is loved by you no matter what and that you'll always be there for her. \n\nIf you can get to the root of the psychological wound that is causing the eating disorder and heal it, she will be able to stop the behaviours. That's why I believe eating disorder relapse is so common because treatment tends to focus on stopping the behaviours without treating the underlying causes. If you take away someone's coping mechanism but not the cause of it, it won't be sustainable long term.\n\nBut please try not to worry, the fact you're here asking and trying to help her means she is already at a huge advantage to make a full recovery \u2764\ufe0f\n\nEdit: I was 14 when I became bulimic. I'm 25 and recovered now.",

Regarding counseling, her perspectives, the way she hears things, and her information processing is different than ours. The counselor lead in my area sets it up this way- you and or /partner/sibling get a counselor and she gets a counselor and a third counselor is assigned for the other 2 counselors to cross talk with and compare notes (3 sides to every story).

From personal experience I\u2019ve found that shame and secrecy are bulimia\u2019s best friends, but having a safe person to open up to is step one on the road to recovery. You\u2019re the safe person. You\u2019ve done step one. Please give yourself some kudos for that!\nNow, onto what to expect from here. I\u2019m in NZ, so similar-but-also-very-different to you in Aussie. In my experience, the specialised eating disorder services were useless, since I wasn\u2019t clinically underweight, so they basically wouldn\u2019t take me as a patient. However, they did refer me to the general mental health services, where I was able to have free weekly meetings with a therapist to unpack the underlying issues I had. Bulimia doesn\u2019t just pop up out of nowhere, there are always underlying things going on, could be depression, anxiety, ocd, or in my case, ptsd. Whatever is going on with your daughter, it seems like she\u2019s ready to talk about it and unpack it, so finding a therapist that she \u2018clicks\u2019 with is very important. Once you find that therapist, they may not be willing to share the details of what was discussed in the therapy session, and that\u2019s ok! I know that as a loving parent you\u2019ll want to know every bit of whatever has caused your daughter to develop this disorder, but you gotta push that aside. For now, she needs a space that\u2019s fully confidential, not a space where she\u2019s worrying if what she says will be told to mum/dad.\nSorry for throwing a wall of text at you, but as a 28 year old gal who went down the bulimia route at about the same age as your daughter and wishes her parents were half as good as you\u2026 I just wanted to add my experience in case it\u2019s helpful. Wishing nothing but the best for you and your daughter. If it\u2019s ok with you, I\u2019ll add you, your daughter, and your family to my daily prayers. Go well, stranger. You got this",

As someone who was \"sick\" during puberty, it made it so much worse that my parents didn't take it seriously. Didn't take ME seriously. Name it. Call it bulimia. Don't try to give it a cute nickname or beat around the bush. It made me want to \"try harder\" to \"be sicker\". That if I was sicker they would care. If you take her to therapy, commit to taking her... Don't take her and expect a couple sessions to do it. Don't insists she tells you what she is talking about in the sessions. Trust a therapist to do their job, and commit to taking her... For a prolonged period of time. Having her open up to a therapist then not following through on taking her, even if she down plays it, is ultimately really harmful.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAlso know at a very deep core level.... It's all about control. Feeling out of control in some way. Maybe how she is feeling at home, at school, on her social group, but if she can just control how she looks and/or the food that's in her body, she has control over something.\u00a0\n\n\nAlso...Very hard truth and VERY ASSUMPTIVE.. hear me when I say not this is not every one... But there is research to suggest that a decent percentage of girls/women who develop consistent or prolonged bulimia were sexually abused. At her age..... In my absolute uninformed, unprofessional, just-a-person-on-reddit..... Know there's a chance. About 50% of sexual abuse happens before the age of 12.\u00a0\n*It also could have nothing to do with that*.\u00a0",

There may be issues at school or with friendships that she's not willing to confide as she may feel embarrassed. A therapist may be a good idea to try if she's comfortable with it as sometimes confiding in a stranger can be easier. I used to say I was 'fine' too when I was her age as I didn't want to be a burden or I felt like the problems I was having were my fault. Children have a tendency to blame themselves and the eating disorder could be her way of expressing pain, hurting herself or crying for help. At her age, I didn't have insight into what was causing my behaviour. I just knew something was wrong and I was bulimic but didn't understand why or what I needed so she might not either.\n\nAll you can do is be there for her like you are and make sure she knows you love her and always have time for her. Maybe think about organising some time where you two do something together that she enjoys (shopping, cinema, bowling, anything non-food related) to hopefully give her a little break from her problems and make her smile. She might not feel up to it if she's really struggling but you can always ask and let her know you want to do something together. If you can, try to do it in a casual way and not an 'I'm offering because I'm worried about you' way. \n\nI just want you to know too that I'd have loved my mom to care as much as you do about your daughter and I'm sure she'll recover with time, help and support \u2764\ufe0f",
