  "selftext": "I started purging food in my 20s, but I realized that bulimia is a symptom of depression and anxiety and that I coped with it using food all my life. \n\nMy mother fat shamed me as I started to gain weight quickly in middle school. I would hide in the closet after our fights and eat in secret, sometimes steal money from her wallet to buy snacks. I remember she stopped cooking dinners because she knew I was going to eat alone anyways. If she caught me eating junk she would dump the food in water and throw it in the trash- I remember eating the food out of the trash. \n\nI thought I was a pig. I wasn\u2019t a pig, I was just scared. \n\nToday is my 10th day purge free which is the longest I\u2019ve lasted in years. Bulimia is anything but superficial.",

Since then I\u2019ve gained back about 30lbs as I\u2019m less afraid to eat since I know I can purge it (which I do after almost every meal)\u2026\n\nSo mine is a little bit different bc it\u2019s not about body image, which is surprising bc I\u2019ve been bodybuilding since I was 15 lol.
