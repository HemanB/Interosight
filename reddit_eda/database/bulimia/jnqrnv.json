  "selftext": "Since everything else fails to prevent me from b/p (like, knowing its severe effects on both my mental and physical health, but who cares about that), let's write a list of petty reasons not to do that.  \n\n\n1. I can ride the bus without everyone thinking I have the Corona (it's only a sore throat from yesterday's purge, I swear guys).\n2. I can stop being hyper aware on everyone's use of the bathroom. \n3. I can stop worrying about the toilet pipe eventually clogging and revealing myself.\n4. I can stop worrying that the quantity of food that I eat and my weight  don't add up, and my mom will eventually get suspicious. \n5. No more crumbs in my bed.\n6. No more hiding food packaging in my purse and throwing it in public places. \n7. I can accept a compliment on my physical appearance without feeling like a fraud.\n8. I can think \"well, at least I'm leaner than my brother and SIL\", withouth feeling like a fraud (this is nasty, I know). \n9. The \"you should eat more\" advices from friends and colleagues won't make me want to bury myself from embarassment. \n10. More cash.\n\nPlease feel free to add you own!",
