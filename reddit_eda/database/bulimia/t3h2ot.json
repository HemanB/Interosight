Maybe i can do this\u201d \n\nMy brain was so messed up, i truly believed sometimes that my stomach could not process food. The idea of eating food made me thing \u201cthis will be in me forever if i don\u2019t puke right now\u201d when in reality, there\u2019s a good old thing called poop, and if you\u2019re not constantly throwing everything up, you can actually poop 2-3 times a day instead of once a week (and yes i do mean once a week, i think my record of no poop was 9 days, absolutely terrifying). I will say there are also 2 days stints where i won\u2019t have any bowel movement, but i have to trust that my body is processing as best as it can, especially with my fucked up digestion biome. I also drink kombucha for this reason in an attempt to help my gut!\n\ni will say my weight has increased a bit, 2-3 lbs since entering this recovery period, but i think that\u2019s actually just having food in my body and being hydrated instead of being hollow. last week my weight was the highest it\u2019s been, but i was on my period and it has since gone down (water weight). It\u2019s been 4.5 years for me since this ED started, and I\u2019ve just gotten so tired of it/from it. \n\nI got my first cavity in my life last October, and i cried for hours. The idea that I\u2019m the reason my body is physically deteriorating broke me. \n\nI try to rationalize with myself. I\u2019ve never tried drugs, I\u2019ve only been drunk 4 times in my life, i don\u2019t smoke, and that\u2019s all for self preservation, for making sure I\u2019m good to my body, but then i was also throwing up at some points 15+ times/day? What kind of logic is that? I tried to align my brain with my values, and it started to become more logical to stop than to continue.\n\nI didn\u2019t let myself work out until i hit the 3 month mark because i was terrified of feeling guilty if i miss a day. I try to listen to my body, and not my mind. It\u2019s really hard, and just last week i laid in bed and cried myself to sleep because i felt so uncomfortable in my body. \n\nNow, i eat when i feel hunger, even if i look at the time and think \u201cwhy are you hungry right now? You should wait another hour until it\u2019s more reasonable\u201d because intuitive eating is important for me to eradicate my food fear. I\u2019ve tried to slow down how quickly i eat my meals and judge my hunger level that way. \n\nIt\u2019s not easy, but if you start reasoning with yourself, maybe even just an \u201cI\u2019ll keep this meal down\u201d once a week to start, then slowly hopefully you can start to feel less urges to binge, and heal your body and mind.\n\nObviously these are all super personal claims for me, but i hope maybe some of this might help. I\u2019m rooting for all of you on here, i firmly believe there\u2019s something better for all of us out there in life, we just have to believe that we\u2019re strong enough and we deserve it",
