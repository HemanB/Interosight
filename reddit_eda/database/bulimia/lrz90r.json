  "selftext": "(i've never been into poetry but i felt really strongly about this \u2013 hope it's okay to post.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nturns out getting rid of parts of myself,  \nwon\u2019t make someone else want me more.  \nand there\u2019s still no one to pull my hair into a braid at the nape of my neck,  \nor hand me the bottle of Advil on the top shelf.\n\nturns out I don\u2019t admire my own reflection anymore than I did before,  \nbefore I got to know what it looked like, hunched over the toilet,  \neyes bloodshot, hands like a vice-grip around my own death.   \nif this is victory then I guess I never understood the cost of war. \n\nturns out those pangs I felt in my stomach weren\u2019t feelings of regret,  \nmaking my whole body run cold, my temper run a short fuse,  \nthey\u2019re easy to confuse when your body is begging for something you\u2019re tossing aside,  \nuntil you\u2019re nothing more than a shapeless, nameless silhouette.\n\ni gather my hair in my hands and my love-handles at my sides,  \nthey both pool at my feet in the shower.  \nthere\u2019s a coldness in my bones that no amount of fire can fix,  \nbecause I\u2019m pulling the trigger on the heat I feel licking at my insides.  \n\nthere\u2019s a heaviness in my throat that feels like a teardrop,   \nit\u2019s dense and it hurts and it might never go away,  \nlodged there like all the words that will never come up,  \nunless they stumble out, drunk, making up for the pain I\u2019ve felt all all year long.",
