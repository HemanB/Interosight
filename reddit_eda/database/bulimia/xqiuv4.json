Week 1 I wrote down all the foods I ate without counting calories, Week 2 I decided to track calories to see what amount my body feels satisfied with and I wrote the foods I ate as well, and Week 3 I only wrote down the calories. I noticed that my appetite decreased significantly and I didn\u2019t need as much calories as I had in week 2 but I had 2 days where I allowed myself to not count calories and just eat whatever I want to make it more \u201cfun\u201d lol. Everyone\u2019s different but this is what\u2019s working for me personally :)",
