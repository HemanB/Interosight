The tower its hit by lightning (an act of god /the divine) and the tower falls, giving the card the meaning of collapse, and things/ structures that can no longer hold falling apart. Symbolically I see the tower as false, outdated or harmful ideological structures that need to be cleared for something new and better to take their place. In relation to eating disorders I think our physiology is at a point it\u2019s so stressed it is collapsing and not functioning properly anymore (including the mind). Because the card is reversed I would say you\u2019re having a \u201cmini tower moment\u201d meaning this is temporary rather than a bigger collapse in your life. \n\nI asked for a next step for you, because the tower doesn\u2019t exactly tell you what to do next, and got the 8 of swords reversed. 8 of swords is all about feeling trapped and stuck in your own head / with your thoughts. I think it means if there\u2019s any way to connect with other humans (your post here is a great start) so you feel less secret and alone that\u2019s a good first step. So if there are any groups in person or online or counseling or ED orgs in your area, or mental health lines etc. Or, animals, nature, bodies of water, the sky - anything that you can interact with so you can build some moments in relation to other beings or phenomena.  Again, if you\u2019re comfortable sharing some of your location maybe we can help connect you. Praying for you to get the care you deserve \ud83d\udc9b",

And of course changing behaviours into ones that could be more helpful is not something that feels accessible when we\u2019re super low. I know care is really hard to find, and the obliviousness of doctors is something I relate to as well.  If you share what country you\u2019re in maybe we could try to find some free things to connect you with? Starting on an anti depressant made a big difference for me, and helped lift me out of the darkest ideation.",

          "body": "I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re into tarot, but I pulled a card for you - the Tower reversed. The tower its hit by lightning (an act of god /the divine) and the tower falls, giving the card the meaning of collapse, and things/ structures that can no longer hold falling apart. Symbolically I see the tower as false, outdated or harmful ideological structures that need to be cleared for something new and better to take their place. In relation to eating disorders I think our physiology is at a point it\u2019s so stressed it is collapsing and not functioning properly anymore (including the mind). Because the card is reversed I would say you\u2019re having a \u201cmini tower moment\u201d meaning this is temporary rather than a bigger collapse in your life. \n\nI asked for a next step for you, because the tower doesn\u2019t exactly tell you what to do next, and got the 8 of swords reversed. 8 of swords is all about feeling trapped and stuck in your own head / with your thoughts. I think it means if there\u2019s any way to connect with other humans (your post here is a great start) so you feel less secret and alone that\u2019s a good first step. So if there are any groups in person or online or counseling or ED orgs in your area, or mental health lines etc. Or, animals, nature, bodies of water, the sky - anything that you can interact with so you can build some moments in relation to other beings or phenomena.  Again, if you\u2019re comfortable sharing some of your location maybe we can help connect you. Praying for you to get the care you deserve \ud83d\udc9b",

      "body": "of course! \n     I struggled with bulimia (as well as anorexia) for about 8 years or so, starting when I was 12 or 13. I will start this off by saying I still have bad days where I\u2019m self conscious about my body and I have an intrusive though telling me I should purge.\n     I had a lot of bad experiences trying to get help. I went to an out-patient clinic in hopes they could help me lose weight in a safe and healthy way\u2014the doctors were idiots and didn\u2019t understand that not every person with an ED is overweight, so they would congratulate me on gaining weight and it made me feel SO much worse. I had a nutritionist help me to stop restricting just so I was eating enough calories before we even discussed exercise but it was so tedious and talking about food was so triggering I stopped going. \n     I would talk about body image with my therapist, who is no expert in EDs but she helped me process WHY I felt the way I did about my body. Understanding the root of your insecurities is a big first step. I also learned over time how to set boundaries with my parents. My dad is always dieting and my mom is an anxious eater so I slowly began telling them when they would say something that\u2019s harmful (i.e. wow, filling up our plate are we?/I could never eat that much/etc.) They didn\u2019t realize this language was harmful and so having a therapist to help me build the courage to say something to them made a world of a difference. When your environment is judgement free and neutral, it becomes a lot easier to not criticize yourself for what/how much you\u2019re eating.\n     When I got to college, I was surrounded by people who did not worry about what they ate, and never commented on what others put on their plate. This made it easier for me to think less about food. *The key is to find a way to not think about food when you\u2019re eating it.* You aren\u2019t thinking about what you\u2019re eating or how soon you need to purge, you\u2019re simply sharing a meal with people you trust and it doesn\u2019t even cross your mind.\n     Environment changes a lot in the long run. Be where you feel safe and with people who will have a conversation over lunch about something unrelated to food. Have dinner with a friend and talk about something interesting and distract yourself from your food. What you want to do is eat without thinking about the \u201cconsequences\u201d.\n     I am also a vocalist and recognizing how damaging it was to purge, I had to quickly force myself to stop. This was not an easy feat. I knew that my career was centered around my ability to produce sound and damaging my esophagus could destroy my only instrument. You only get one voice. There is no cure or way to replace it. I emphasized vocal health concerns and used them to inspire me to stop purging. If I wanted to binge but knew i would purge after, I would chug some water or a Gatorade. This also helped me feel full before meals so I did not feel like I was taking too much food.\n      I slipped back into depression during my freshman fall in college and began binging again when no one was around. I was too scared to purge because I knew I would be hurting my esophagus and therefore my voice, so I would cry hysterically about not being able to purge. The best way I learned to avoid this was to get tf out of where I was. If I stayed in my room for a whole week (which I often did), I had access to my mini fridge and would just sit on the floor crying and eating. If I made myself get out of my dorm, I could keep myself busy. I could go somewhere to do homework (and if I was genuinely hungry, take a snack with me) and study in a public space so I felt inclined to stay there working instead of getting up to purge a small snack. \n     I cannot express enough how much I can relate and I feel your pain. I was constantly in a state of wanting to unalive myself because I couldn\u2019t stand being in this body anymore, but I could t bring myself to do it.\n     It\u2019s also important to talk to a professional about how and why you started binging and/or purging in the first place. Were you rewarded with food as a child for good behavior? Did you have a close relative that would purge? Did you consume media showing bulimia when you were at a vulnerable and young age? Do you use binging/purging as a form of SH? There are so many possibilities and it\u2019s crucial to unveil what started these tendencies to better understand yourself and then you can use that knowledge to take back your life. For me, I would binge as a form of self punishment and then purge out of necessity or SH. This was able to be resolved by recognizing when I wanted to punish myself and why, thinking through the reasons I felt I needed to do so, and find something else to do. That\u2019s where hobbies come in.\n     Distractions are perfect for people beginning to phase out of their ED. Having a hobby keeps you occupied and instead of using that time to binge, you can work on your new skill. Alternatively, you can utilize those skills when you feel the urge to purge after eating. A healthy distraction keeps you from thinking about your body and food and focuses on you as an individual. Maybe you pick up rock climbing and your focus is centered on keeping a good grip. Maybe you decide you want to learn a new instrument and use your time practicing. \n     Overall I can say that I am able to eat now without immediately thinking I need to purge. I can just eat like a normal person, and that sense of normalcy is the most relieving thing in the world. There is nothing more liberating than being free from your mind. \n\nTL;DR  Be around people who have a good relationship with food and won\u2019t talk about it, put yourself in an environment that you feel safe in, talk to a professional about your self image and why you see yourself that way, and use healthy distractions to keep binging/purging at bay.\n\nPlease reach out with questions if you have any! I am wishing you so much luck and I am so beyond happy to hear that you\u2019re pursuing recovery \u2764\ufe0f",
