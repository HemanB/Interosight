      "body": "Okay so I know some these people use scare tactics to talk about them but I\u2019m going to be 100% honest. I started taking laxatives a little over 2 years ago and became really obsessed. I went off to college and at the time I was taking around 8 per day. Beyond suffering from anorexia, my roommates were god awful and made me out to be like some heroine addict and accused me of doing something illegal and tried to get me kicked out of my apartment (which didn\u2019t work, cause they were like.. um these are just poo pills from CVS). Anyways I became more addicted and weaker, eventually not being able to do much without worrying about my GI tract. I threw up during a final once (I do not force myself to vomit. Laxatives have ruined the lining of my esophagus leaving me with severe GERD and Barrett\u2019s esophagus) so I vomit unintentionally. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night, vomiting in my sleep, choking. The other night I took some laxatives and thought nothing of it. Than, I spent 30 + hours vomiting and having diarrhea. There was blood in my diarrhea and esophagus. I called myself an ambulance and my blood pressure was 64/50 which is DEADLY. I was also so dehydrated that in a 2 day hospital stay I had to get over 40 needles because my veins kept bursting snd collapsing which is excruciating and my mom couldn\u2019t visit me because of COVID. On top of that, not having access to laxatives meant I gained 5 lbs of water weight due to intense swelling in my ankles, and swelling in my arms. Luckily, I am able to have bowel movements without them which I am very lucky. But this is because the GI was kind enough to understand and provided me with SAFE GI medications that could help my stomach properly empty to avoid more buildup which could hurt my esophagus more. Because of laxatives, I have colitis which doesn\u2019t go away and means I get ulcers on my colon. I have a tear in my esophagus and am at increased risk for esophageal cancer. I\u2019m 21 years old. I\u2019ve barely lived. My GI system is a mess and they only make you feel empty. They\u2019re an illusion. Don\u2019t let them fool you, please",
