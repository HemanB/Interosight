But she thinks that that was just something i made up in my head? It felt really shitty and i got all defensive. But people did genuinely treat me better, it was so much easier to talk to others and make friends when i was thinner. Maybe she doesnt think its real because she hasn't experienced it?\n\n Do you guys think thin privilege is real? Or is it something we make up in our minds?",

Once they lose the weight, they change their self-perception and start seeing themselves as more \u201cattractive\u201d, \u201cdesirable\u201d,  \u201coutgoing\u201d and this reflects in their personality and behaviour. So yes there are people who are shallow and will treat you differently simply because you\u2019re thin vs fat, however most people are simply reacting to how you present yourself in your actions, speech, and behaviour. \nKeep in mind there are fat people who have lots of friends and people love being around them, and there are thin people who no one wants to be around because their attitude is trash",
