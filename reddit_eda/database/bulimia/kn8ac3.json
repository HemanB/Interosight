I work a professional job with a mid-level title (it\u2019s my dream job with the dream company etc) and I just literally shit my pants at work. I was on a phone call. I didn\u2019t even realize it was happening; my digestive system is absolutely WRECKED due to years of lax abuse. My stomach did the \u201coh someone is literally squeezing my insides\u201d, burrrrrrrr, and then it just happened in a matter of MAYBE 5 seconds. \nI have taken more lax in the past 3 days (because the Christmas binge cycle has gone on well past Christmas \ud83e\udd21) than I ever have. Well, that paired with this morning Starbucks with an ~extra shot~ just snuck up on me out of nowhere. Fuck this ED. Fuck everything about this. Maybe it\u2019s time to actually get help.",
