  "selftext": "Title pretty much sums it up. I wanted to binge badly, I was alone and had the opportunity to do so. In the past it wouldn\u2019t have been a question, so many times when traveling for work, away from my significant other I\u2019ll get a hotel room and order junk food and just spend my whole evening binging and purging. But this time I took my dog for a walk and ate a sandwich instead. And after a few hours the urge passed. I\u2019m super Fucking proud. I still have some unhealthy outlets (ie smoking cigarettes) but I\u2019ll work on that one later. There is hope! There is a light at the end of the tunnel guys, if you put in the work and don\u2019t give up I truly think getting ahead of this disease is a real thing. I\u2019m on day 153, more than five months!!",
