I can\u2019t believe it. \n\nI took a laxative a couple hours ago and it just kicked in. I had a big meal before this happened, but what I was trying to purge was a bunch of sushi I ate last night. The bathroom I usually use was occupied, there are people over by the other one and I didn\u2019t know what to do. \n\nI feel like my dog when he has an accident indoors. Some of it didn\u2019t make it in the bin (which has a bag, fortunately) but I cleaned it up really quickly with a wipe. I need to put it in another bag and take it out. \n\nI\u2019ve shat myself before, but never in a bin. I cannot believe this just happened to me. ",
