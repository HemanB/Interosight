  "selftext": "Yesterday, I ate a full day of meals since December 2022, and I didn\u2019t purge. \n\nI gave in and got that second helping. \nI felt comfortably full. \n\nI had to do a short, simple workout to silence my mind a little. Not ideal, but I probably wouldn\u2019t have made it otherwise. \n\nI also did eat at 1am because I couldn\u2019t sleep but it was watermelon and I actually stopped when I was full. \n\nIt\u2019s just one day, but the first has always been the hardest whenever it came to recovery of any ED. It\u2019s a start. \n\nI can\u2019t share this anyone else, so I wanted to do it here. \n",

So many free resources where you can share or just sit back and listen to others. seeing the disease from an outside perspective can be jarring. \u201cdo i want to be like this 40/50/60 year old woman still trying to hate herself into a body she loves?\u201d \n\nall the love!",
