  "title": "After 8 years of hiding my ED, turns out my parents don't care",
  "selftext": "Full disclosure, I really am just looking for comfort and support here. \n\nAt the beginning of 2021, due to some persistent support from my SO and hitting a mental breaking point, I realized I needed to address my ED properly. I spoke to my parents, and, long-story-short, I have started therapy and am busy trying to feel less like garbage all the time. Since bringing it up and being officially diagnosed with bulimia, I have had a total of 2 conversations with my parents about this. You'd think it was a nonexistent issue. Yesterday I had a therapy session with them there and it was a disaster. They acted as if I was attacking them, and got incredibly defensive. I sort of gave up halfway through, because they basically said they had done all they could and if I was struggling, the bulk of treatment was up to me. \n\nMy parents have always been bad with mental and emotional issues, but this takes it to another level. Even though I am nearly 20, there is still a big part of me hoping that this will be the thing to make them step up and just act like parents for once- taking the time to be there for me, and actually look after me, because they never really have. \n\nI feel invalidated and angry and so disappointed. It makes me think I should've just kept going on the way I was because this has changed nothing for the better. Even after that, we have gone back to acting like nothing is wrong in the family, and it's extremely upsetting.",

You deserve so much better in life than some childish parents who don't want to take responsibility for the ways that they may have traumatized and wronged their own child.",

I very much understand your anger and disappointment and your experience really reminds me a lot of something similar I went through.\n\nMy parents are like yours: they don't deal well with mental health, and don't speak about emotions. At around your age, I shared with my parents that I was abused by a family member and kept it a secret for ten years, during which I was depressed & suicidal. They were horrified and empathetic when I confessed, but I distinctly remember two things that made me realize they couldn't be part of my recovery.\n\n1) One of the first questions my dad asked is if I wanted a therapist and I said maybe. He made a face and said, \"But then a stranger will know about this bad thing that happened in our family.\"\n\n2) A few days afterwards, I visited the tombstone of my abuser and shouted, screamed, cried, and said everything that I couldn't say as a young victim. I felt vindicated and shared my emotional accomplishment with my mom, who frowned and said, \"Don't do things like that, it's bad. You have to move on.\"\n\nAnd then same: they just acted like everything was normal and didn't bring it up ever again.\n\nA few years later -- after I came out of my depression and was thriving as an adult -- my mom broke down and said she felt like she failed me because she couldn't protect me as a child. I didn't feel that way at all and assured her so, but I saw that even though I had recovered, my mom quietly carried the torture of my trauma for years afterwards.\n\nThat's my experience. I guess all I'm really saying is that I agree with the notion of mourning what you don't have now, and then making peace with it and finding your way forward. Maybe your parents won't be part of your support system on your road to recovery, but that just means you find a different way that works. Please take care; I hope that you can keep us updated on how things are going.",

You\u2019re kinda setting yourself for failure when you expect a certain thing from them.\nIt\u2019s sad and it sucks, believe me.\nThe best thing you can do at the end of the day is to take care of you. You are your own best friend and know yourself best. Really try to be your own parent, get some help from professions, find a good support group with friends or whoever, go to the doctor, go wherever to make sure you are healthy and happy. It\u2019s a life long journey. \nI have had similar problems with my parents in different ways, but the same thing, and once I gave up the need and started to take myself into my own arms I have found more healing than I have ever before. \nI wish you lots of love and healing! Love and take care of your body, for you! It\u2019s easy to give up on ourselves and punish it.",
