I\u2019ve been stealing food from stores (probably about $30 worth of food/day) so I can binge & purge. I can hardly afford rent so there is no way I can afford to be symptomatic at the same time. I\u2019m scared I\u2019m going to be caught & arrested. I\u2019m scared I\u2019m going to be homeless. I\u2019m scared my family & friends will cut me out of their lives. I\u2019m at a complete loss & I\u2019m only 21. I\u2019m scared of myself & who I have become.",

      "body": "Hey OP, I will just say that more b/p sufferers steal than you know. There\u2019s actually a few studies linking EDs and kleptomania. I think it\u2019s important to remember that b/p ED is an addiction and like most addicts you will do almost anything to get what you are addicted to, in this case food. However, the risk of getting caught is high and you could potentially ruin your future by stealing from stores. It\u2019s important that you figure out a way to either cut the binging, or binge food that you can afford in your budget if you have to binge. If you want to chat more feel free to send me a message. I\u2019m wishing I lots of luck, don\u2019t hate yourself, the fact that you are aware of this is huge. You need to make a change with the stealing because it\u2019s something that could ruin your future, it\u2019s hard but I have faith you can do it.",

      "body": "Wow. This is really honest. I haven\u2019t seen anything this real since I stopped going to 12 step meetings.\n\nYou remind me of my old sponsor. She was originally supposed to help me cut down on alcohol. But naturally, we ended up touching on some of my other compulsions and the ED stuff was bound to come up eventually. \n\nShe shared a bit of her story with me and she actually was arrested for shoplifting. She was stealing food since she too couldn\u2019t really afford it at the time. It\u2019s crazy because looking at her, no one would expect her to struggle with such a thing. She looked like she belonged on TV, not behind bars. But that\u2019s where the craziness lies. No one really gets what goes on inside our minds.\n\nI wish I had a practical solution for you. It\u2019s hardest when entering a binge cycle while not being able to afford it. Like any other addict, you will do whatever it takes to get your fix.\n\nI try to surround myself with people who I know will get me. It\u2019s enough effort to be fighting back thoughts I\u2019ve had since I was literally a child. So i try to give my self a pat on the back whenever I get the chance to as a reminder that I\u2019m doing the best I can. It may be hard to do this for yourself right now. But you\u2019re doing the best you can, and we\u2019re proud of you. We\u2019re here for you, and we\u2019ve got your back",

It makes sense if you look at maslows higherarchy of needs, food is the base of the pyramid and if u have a disorder in which food is never satiated, you will likely pick that over anything else.
