  "selftext": "I get MAD when offered or given food I didn\u2019t ask for. I can\u2019t figure out how to say no without sounding like a complete and total bitch. I work in a restaurant and the owner is always trying to feed us. Lately I\u2019ve been just taking the food and bringing it home to my boyfriend and his father to try and pawn off on them. If they don\u2019t take it, I stare at it and get so upset. There are some days I\u2019m freaking starving because I have been restricting so I binge out on this food I never even asked for. Freaking aggravating. Vent over \ud83d\ude14",

      "body": "I rarely get angry per se, but definitely frustrated. I currently live with my dad and he frequently brings home bad food, especially if he thinks I'm in a bad mood or upset. It's alwats really nice to know he's trying to make me feel better, but oh my god I want to scream sometimes. It's so frustrating when you've been restricting or counting calories and then you feel forced to eat bad food, or even just more than you feel you should,  for the sake of being polite. I know this sounds really terrible, but it's definitely been a big motivator for me to move out.",

Since I don\u2019t eat on break I usually make a sandwich to take home for dinner after work instead of cake but on my last shift she said I\u2019m not allowed to do that anymore and I have to eat my sandwich on break otherwise I can\u2019t have anything :/ My ED brain\u2019s like, \u201cCool, then you can stick to your coffee on break and have no food all day just to show her who\u2019s boss.\u201d Stupid but it properly upset me aha",
