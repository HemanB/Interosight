  "selftext": "I JUST OVERATE (binge like but not to the usual extent my binges are) AND I FEEL NO GUILT, NO URGE TO PURGE OR OVERDO EXERCISE. IN FACT IM CONTENT AND HAPPY. Never would I have thought that I would get to this point, to overeat/binge on very unhealthy treat food and still be happy and not care about how much weight I will gain tomorrow! This gives me hope that I am going to recover eventually and be happy with myself!",

I'm breaking this cycle today, I don't care how fat and bloated I feel from this past month, I'm eating what I need today and starting fresh and this post helped me feel better about it!
