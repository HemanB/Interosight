Of course, both mental illnesses suck but I hate myself for having the loser-version of Anorexia. Bulimics and anorexics both have an ilness but at least the anorexics have something to  be proud of when they lost weight, rigt? Like I said I feel really bad about thinking this way but are there any people out there who feel the same?",

      "body": "I used to think this before I really started researching recovery. There are theories that suggest that they are not two separate, distinct disorders, but one disorder operating along a continuum. This makes sense in my experience, and I think most people with bulimia, because it starts as a diet that gets more and more restrictive, i.e. anorexia. However, we get to a point where we cannot starve anymore and start to binge, which leads to feeling of shame, which leads to purging, and the cycle continues day after day.\n\nYou might want to read the following post, which might help you understand how this could be [https://edinstitute.org/blog/2013/4/11/bulimia-yes-you-too](https://edinstitute.org/blog/2013/4/11/bulimia-yes-you-too)",

See the problem is I was restricting type anorexic a year and a half ago, but midway through treatment I became bulimic instead. \n\nLooking back at how on top of things I was when I was anorexic and how much self control I had is still painful. I keep saying to myself that if I could eat as controlled as I did then, I would be able to feel emotionally stable rather than feel proud of myself for fasting or eating healthy for 3 days straight and then wanting to die after anxiously binging at 4 AM.\n\nBut at the same time, I never want to get to that point ever again. Quality of life was at an all time low: I couldn\u2019t hang out with friends because of fear of eating and exhaustion, couldn\u2019t even exercise after a certain point, and was constantly irritated and depressed.
