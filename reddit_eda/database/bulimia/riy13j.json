  "selftext": "People who make jokes about how how \"pizza is better than sex\" and shit like that can go fuck themselves. \\*Everything\\* is better than food. Absolutely \\*NOTHING\\* tastes as good as happiness feels. Nothing tastes as good as laughter with friends feels. Nothing tastes as good as great sex feels. Nothing tastes as good as self confidence feels. Nothing tastes as good as the absence of crippling loneliness feels. Nothing tastes as good as hopefulness and motivation feels. Nothing tastes as good as emotional stability feels. Nothing tastes as good as going to bed and not dreading waking up the next day feels. People who think that food tastes better than life itself have never lived. I would trade  in my tastebuds to be normal and human and happy in a heartbeat.\n\nApologies if this is incomprehensive-able , I have ingested a strong cocktail of emotional instability, mental breakdown, and vodka **\u270c**",
