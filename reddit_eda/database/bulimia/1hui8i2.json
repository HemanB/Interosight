      "body": "thank you so much <3 and congrats for the 5 days! Even 1 day is so hard, 5 days is amazing! For me once it was clear that years of eating disorders were destroying my life I was determined to stop for good and gave up on my \"\"ideal looking self\"\" but I was still hopeless and didn't know what to do. I thought I had already tried everything over the years, dietitians, theraphy, medications like topiramate, etc. At the end I came to the realization my ED was mostly caused by poor eating habits because whenever my life was impossible all alone I went to live with my mother and I would improve thin a week because I ate thrice a day. Back alone at home I forced myself to eat four \"normal\" (no diet products, no deprivation) meals at fixed times. It was so horrible at first, I felt like I was eating all the whole day and struggled to keep it down but after some days of not even having urges to binge I realized that was it. Books like brain over binge, even if helpful for some, really hampered my view of eating disorder recovery. I thought once I stopped bingeing everything would be over but that is so distant from the reality. I am 50 days off and still check my body (though much less) every day, I still struggle so much with hunger cues. Let alone the physical effects. My teeth are not sensitive anymore but the mere thought of coffee hurts my stomach. I don't even need SSRI's anymore because without bulimia I'm not depressed. Without bulimia, I want to live and finally have a life. Wish you the best in your journey, we can do it so we should never give up! <3",
