I understand how it feels for the eating disorder to win most of the battles but it does get better",

I was always the sensible one, and I\u2019d try drugs & drink but I never ever had the compulsion to keep doing it. I\u2019m pretty much the only person I know who doesn\u2019t smoke. I always just viewed it like I just don\u2019t have some kind of gene, the addict gene, or whatever. \n\nThen ED came along (less than a year ago for me) and suddenly it\u2019s like I can relate 100% to these drug addiction podcasts. I have to re-assess how I always viewed myself. It\u2019s crazy. \n\nBut I am only just experimenting with talking to other people who are going through the same thing (on here, etc). So maybe that can help? Let me know if you find something else lol.",
