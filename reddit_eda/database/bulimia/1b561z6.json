Otherwise, unless I\u2019ve been super skinny (like when I was getting married and lost a lot of weight between the last fitting and the big day \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f), nobody notices much. I\u2019ve lost my teeth to bulimia, to show you the damage it does.\n\nI have found in my 30 years of eating disorders that many truly don\u2019t comprehend eating disorders, especially if purging is involved. Many don\u2019t know what to say, their brains literally don\u2019t seem able to comprehend.. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I\u2019m slowly coming to terms with that.",
