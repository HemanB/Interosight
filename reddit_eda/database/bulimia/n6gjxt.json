  "selftext": "I always complain about my body image and weight issues to my boyfriend, as I feel extremely insecure in the way I look and feel about myself. I have struggled with bulimia and my weight for the past 2 years, and only recently started to get help for it. I have gained some weight which has made me feel really uncomfortable in my body and hate my appearance. \nYesterday I had my stomach out to which my boyfriend called me his \u2018chubby\u2019 baby. He regretted it straight away and apologised, but I just cant seem to let it go. I can see myself spiralling back into my old habits. I feel like his words have just confirmed all the horrible things i think about my body and weight gain. \nI feel so ugly and disgusting that I dont think I can continue in a inimate relationship with him until I get back down to my ideal weight again. \nHow do I stop myself, help :(",

You can blame it on him all you want, but this is your ED trying to control you and keep you sick. You are stronger than this. This could happen again with someone making a comment abt looking \u201chealthy\u201d or whatever tf people comment. But practicing your resilience muscle to these comments will help you so much in recovery, and you\u2019ll show yourself that you are stronger than this. \n\nI don\u2019t want to sound insensitive with this comment, I hope it didn\u2019t come across that way, and you have a right to be upset about this. But don\u2019t use it as an excuse! You chose recovery! You got this!!",

I made so much progress and this is what I get? Luckily, I told him to F off when we got home and didn\u2019t relapse. Over all, stick to yourself and love yourself.
