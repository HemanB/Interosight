  "selftext": "Does anybody else feel like if purging improves their mood?\n\nI'm realizing that negative thoughts make me depressed but as soon as I purge I get some sort of relief and feel better/happier (at least momentarily).\n\nThis is a bit scary because this makes purging a liberating way to cope with negative thoughts, and if I'm in a situation where I can't purge I just feel much worse.",

If you know that if you are feeling in a bad mood and purging makes it better for a while, but doesn't last explore other things to do instead of purging that make you feel better and are kind to your body and soul.\n\nPurging provides a temporary relief from anxiety, depression, sadness etc... When you can't do it, all that pain is still there. So what are some things you could try instead that will give a similar result?\n\nMaybe try going on a walk and moving your body, listen to an encouraging podcast or music that makes you feel good, move your body through stretching and relieve some tension, practice deep breathing and breath work, pray, draw, journal , snuggle with your pet. Allow yourself to cry and feel your feelings, they won't kill you but bulimia can.\n\nFor myself I typically HAVE to move my body by going outside on a walk or doing some type of physical stuff. Sometimes I just need to lay on my bed and have a good cry. It is not easy to change behavior, but even one success is a start <3",
