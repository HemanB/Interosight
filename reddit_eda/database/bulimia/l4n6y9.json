  "selftext": "I think bulimia definitely BEGAN with me as a result of over-restricting, but over time it's become an addiction. It doesn't matter if I restrict or eat 2000 kcal a day, it's like I can't get through the day without it. Even if I'm not hungry - hell, even if I'm not even in the mood for eating, I have to b/p or else I'll feel restless and irritable and depressed. Honestly I don't even know how to recover at this point. I've gained loads of weight (I'm now on the higher end of the healthy BMI spectrum) and that doesn't even bother me anymore. It's not about my appearance, it's about the act of b/p-ing itself. I just don't even remember how I used to function before this all began 3 years ago. My problem with all the advice people give me is that it doesn't really apply to me; people assume that I'm restricting, or that i have bad body image, or that i feel guilty after eating. But really, while maybe that used to be the case, at this point none of those things apply. I don't feel food guilt, I really am just addicted to the act itself. :( If I just have a 'normal' sized meal and feel physically full, mentally I feel completely dissatisfied and restless. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for this post; I just don't have anyone to talk about this to IRL and needed to offload.  :(",

I freaked out and started to live a healthy life and weight has started to decrease, slowly.\n\nI should be happy and healthy, no?\n\nAlthough my current state of being may be due to other host of issues, I can't help but want to binge and purge so I can feel like everything will be OK.\n\nThe act of purging to me is calming. I usually sleep so well after purging. The anxiety is building up and I'm quite sure something will happen and I'll snap back.\n\nAs is, I'm looking for excuses to purge. Not losing weight in itself is an excuse. Looking ugly as someone who has no idea I exist is beautiful, is an excuse. My family commented I lost weight is an excuse. It is frustrating that I feel inadequate without purging as if I'm slightly but constantly unhinged.",

      "body": "Something that doesn't get mentioned that much and definitely needs to be mentioned more is that constant bulimia can actually deform your face. Your parotid glands will get enlarged from the over stimulation caused by bulimia and you will end up with chipmunk cheeks. Next time you purge, look in the mirror and see how much wider your face has become. In most cases, it will shrink in a few days/weeks if you are lucky and don't purge.\n\nSome unlucky people will have to undergo surgery to get rid of the chipmunk cheeks. This will run you about 60k as its doubtful insurance will pay for it. Please keep this in mind each time you purge. Many people think it's harmless and will keep your weight down, however you may end up having a skinny body but a fat face.\n\nThis is an awful awful condition and I hope this shocks people enough to think twice about purging. Good luck to you.\n\n[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1288/00005537-198505000-00015](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1288/00005537-198505000-00015)\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5878158/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5878158/)\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2397568/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2397568/)",

The weed helped me neglect just how bad my ED had gotten. It\u2019s the ritual around food that is addicting.

When I started recovery, I also became a lot more emotionally unstable and am still working on figuring out how to regulate myself properly, because b/p was like my fix for so long.\n\nThis is just my experience and I'm sure others have had better ones, but all of the ED therapists I tried were extremely resistant to looking at b/p as an addiction and would always correct me by saying \"you can't be addicted to food.\" I understood why they said that but it made me feel really invalidated. This was actually one of the big reasons I found more success with conventional therapy--I think my relationship to bulimia might have been so influenced by other stuff I needed to work out that I got more help there. \n\nAlso, on the addiction note, Topamax was a key part in helping me recover. At higher doses it can have unpleasant side effects, but I don't even notice it at a low dose and still take it even now.",
