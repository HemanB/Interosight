  "selftext": "I\u2019m so sick and tired of normal people acting like they understand how it is to binge to the point where you physically can\u2019t stand, and then purge afterwards.\n\nMy aunt said \u201cI went to the bakery and I got a bear claw and cannoli dip, and I ate the bear claw in one day!! And then the cannoli dip was gone in two days.\u201d Or \u201cI ate an entire bag of chips!\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not trying to say that may not be a binge for some people, but they have no idea what its like to battle with your mind. Every. Single. Day. Every. Waking. Moment.\n\nSo many of my friends have told me to just \u201ceat better, man, you won\u2019t want to binge.\u201d I don\u2019t expect anyone to understand what I\u2019m going through, how could they when they have no idea what its like? But everyone just chalks my issues down to something as simple as \u201cyou need to eat better and you won\u2019t binge.\u201d\n\nI eat clean. I binge. \nI incorporate unhealthy foods. I binge. \nI don\u2019t count calories. I still binge.\nI\u2019m home alone. Have to eat the whole house and purge.\n\nThey have NO IDEA. I would give anything to live as someone who doesn\u2019t struggle with an eating disorder. I feel like I\u2019m just going through the motions of life constantly focused on food.",
