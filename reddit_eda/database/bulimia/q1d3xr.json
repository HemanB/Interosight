Now I\u2019m through the worst (I think) of it, I\u2019m 100% sure anyone can get better. I don\u2019t want to trivialise it as it\u2019s by no means easy but I had recovered before, but I was still purging or binging , I guess I was just lying to myself about wanting recovery back then. Now it\u2019s like a switch has been pushed and wanted this, REALLY wanted it. Though I don\u2019t see those previous times as failures, they paved the way to get me here, along with my therapy. I also lost my nephew suddenly at New Years, 2 weeks before his 22nd. I think that too made me realise the fragility and preciousness of life and while as I say I\u2019m doing it for me as the primary, I\u2019m also wanting to make sure I\u2019m alive to live life to the fullest. When I was younger I felt like there wasn\u2019t much consequence but once I hit 40 I could feel myself dying, blackouts / palpitations / racing heart. My resting heart rate was in the 40s at one point, now I\u2019m back to normal. I also want to get better for exactly that reason HOPE\u2026 I want to recover to show others it\u2019s possible, and also to speak out that, especially for guys, there is no shame here, and we CAN get better \ud83d\udc9c",
