  "title": "I haven\u2019t purged in 6 years",
  "selftext": "I was reflecting today and realized it\u2019s been 6 years since I purged. I had a 7 year long battle with eating disorders and I just wanted to let y\u2019all know that it\u2019s possible. You can overcome this. I believe in every one of you.\n\nEdit: Some of y\u2019all have asked how I\u2019ve stayed binge and purge free for so long. Here are some tips I\u2019ve gone by. \n\n1. Get the mirror out of your room. I can\u2019t stress this enough. Looking at yourself in the mirror multiple times a day causes you to pick yourself apart. You look at all your flaws and start seeing issues with yourself that aren\u2019t there. Removing the mirror from my bedroom changed my life. I only look at myself now when I do my makeup or I need to check my outfit. Overcoming body dysmorphia is a huge part of overcoming an eating disorder. Choose to love yourself and your body.\n2. Get busy. I used to fill my extra time with binging and purging. It\u2019s all I wanted to do\u2026 it\u2019s all I felt like I needed to do. Being busy and away from home helps you to not think about food as much. It helps occupy all the space in your brain so you don\u2019t think about binging. Get out and go places that have public bathrooms so you\u2019re less likely to purge. \n3. Get a hobby. Find something you enjoy, like a sport or a project. Find a hobby you can have some control over- crocheting, paper machete, soccer, piano, etc. Work towards a goal. Eating disorders are rooted in a need for control over your life. It\u2019ll help to have a hobby you can control. \n4. Share a bathroom if you can. Part of the reason I stopped purging was because I went off to college. I shared a room with another girl. This room was connected to a bathroom which we shared with two other girls in another room. The bathroom also didn\u2019t have any locks. I had so much fear that someone was going to walk in on me purging, so I only ever did it when I knew for a fact no one was in their room, which was VERY rare. I wasn\u2019t purging as much and this helped me gain control of my eating disorder.\n5. Get rid of your scale. I used to weigh myself all the time looking to drop even a pound of weight, and I used to beat myself up for gaining a pound of weight. I stopped weighing myself and I would panic because I didn\u2019t know if I was gaining weight. I had so much stress and anxiety about it, but I didn\u2019t give in. I think I only weighed myself once in 4 months.\n6. DON\u2019T go to the restroom after dinner. Sit with your family or friends and talk for a while after you eat. Fight against that nagging voice telling you to purge. \n7. If you\u2019re trying to recover, DON\u2019T tell yourself \u201cthis is the last time\u201d when binging and purging. Giving in this time will lead to giving in next time. Stop now.\n8. Stop counting calories. You don\u2019t need to only eat 500 calories. You need nourishment. It\u2019s normal and healthy to eat 2,000 + calories. Your body will thank you.\n9. Exercise, even if it\u2019s a short walk around the block. It\u2019ll help you feel good and give you happy endorphins. Exercise is great, but don\u2019t overdo it. Create a limit for yourself- an hour of exercise max.\n10. Make sure you have something to sip on. I always felt the need to eat something, so I would drink something instead. I liked Diet Coke because there weren\u2019t any calories and I didn\u2019t have any guilt about it. This will keep your mouth busy throughout the day.\n11. Buy snacks that are in individual packages. Don\u2019t buy a whole box of crackers- you know you\u2019re going to eat that whole box in 10 minutes. Only get snacks that come in serving sizes. \n12. Plan your meals. This helps you have control over your eating. Eat the same thing every day and the same amount every day. Changing it up creates unnecessary stress. Get comfortable with certain foods. It doesn\u2019t have to be all foods at one time. Baby steps are okay.\n13. This one isn\u2019t really a tip, but having faith and praying and believing that God can get me through this gave me strength. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way I could\u2019ve done this without my faith.\n\nI hope this helps. One day you won\u2019t have the urge to binge and purge. One day you\u2019ll finally see how amazing and beautiful you really are. You\u2019ll see what everyone else sees when they look at you. One day you\u2019ll love your body. One day you\u2019ll have a healthy relationship with food. Take it day by day. You can do this.\n\nI also want to add that I didn\u2019t stop in one day. I fell many times, but I got back up. At one point I was a year into my recovery when I purged. It doesn\u2019t mean all is lost. Get back up and remind yourself why you\u2019re recovering.",

      "body": "I just read this verse yesterday ll Corinthians 10:5-6 and I ate a lot after dinner and kept it all down, even with some candy before bed too. But this morning I made a pretty big meal and focused way too much on the calories even though it was healthy and really high protein, and ended up b/ping. Not only did I waste the good big meal, but I feel like i can\u2019t get ahold of myself. I hope I can look back and be proud of myself like you can. I literally layed down and listened to the Bible after I ate the meal but I still ended up binging anyway. My flesh haunts me!! God please help me, I know this phone is stupid and I should be in your word but Lord I need you to guide me and be my strength because I am not strong right now. I\u2019m sorry that I waste food and am selfish with your blessings, please hold my hand and help me rip this off of my soul once and for all, amen amen amen.",
