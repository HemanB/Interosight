  "selftext": "Not gonna lie, I did purge once yesterday, and I wanted to quit doing that altogether this year. Ive been purging almost everything I eat for well over a year so my digestion is completely fucked, even a tiny salad makes me feel too full. BUT! I ate a small meal after that and kept it down even though I felt full. I really wanna try to keep this going even if I have to eat tiny amounts at first!",
