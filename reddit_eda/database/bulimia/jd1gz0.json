  "selftext": "I\u2019ve been 3 days binge and purge free! I know it\u2019s not much but it\u2019s been so long since the last time I had gone this long without doing it. I managed to even stop myself from binging even though the family sized bag of cookies with literally in my hands. I was able to put them down and go back to my room and not binge. This was so hard for me because I usually give in and grab every snack I can see and run to my room to binge in secret in the middle of the night. I know I still have a long way to go but I\u2019m hoping to keep my streak going.",
