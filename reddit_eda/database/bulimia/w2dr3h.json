  "selftext": "It has been a long, hard road. I never thought that I would have the strength to come this far. Literally never, I remember times when I would sit by the toilet covered in my own puke sobbing and wishing it would all just end because I just couldn\u2019t do it anymore. I was so deep in the hole I thought that I would never climb my way out. \n\nThrowing up 3-7 times a day or not eating at all. Isolating myself, pushing everyone away. Not living, just surviving until the next meal. Dropping out of college. Severe anxiety and depression. Celibacy for seven years because the thought of someone seeing me naked or touching me gave me panic attacks. Getting close or letting someone know my secret. No period for nearly a decade, still unaware if there are consequences from that and I\u2019m still too scared to go to the doctor and find out. Uncontrolled type one diabetes as a result from uncontrolled binging and not taking insulin. Having my left pinky toe amputated bc of complications from the uncontrolled diabetes. Having several teeth pulled and several chipped. Going into cardiac arrest twice and being in a coma for a week. \nLiterally all a result from my eating disorder. \n\nPlease for the love of God get help. I am only 24 years old, I don\u2019t know how many years I\u2019ve taken off my life, I don\u2019t know the full extent of damage I\u2019ve already done, I don\u2019t know if I can have children. The long term effects are real. I know it\u2019s hard, believe me I know. It is literally the hardest thing I\u2019ve had to over come in my life and I\u2019m still struggling. Some days are easier than others, there have been moments when I almost gave in. But let me tell you, on the other side, it\u2019s fucking rainbows and sunshine. Not having to spend two hours in the bathroom after meals is glorious. Opening up, letting people in, having support, it\u2019s amazing. Maybe you think you can\u2019t tell anyone, maybe you feel like you have to carry this burden all alone. Don\u2019t. Ask for help, save your own life. You deserve a life without b/p, you deserve to feel beautiful in your own skin, you deserve to grow old and experience life, not just survive it.",

      "body": "Congrats that is an amazing accomplishment! I felt exactly the same way as you when I finally decided to stop. It\u2019ll be 11 years since I last purged in January. I remember crying thinking I would never be at a place I am today. The biggest I\u2019ve ever been and I love my little belly. I used to stare at my thighs and wish I could cut them off and now I love my big thighs and butt! \n\nThe first year is the hardest, it gets easier from here. If your reading this you can stop too and life is so much better on the other side! If I was you I would see a therapist. I wish I did when I quit because the mental aspect is the hardest to get rid of. I still have days where my body dysmorphia is bad and I feel \u201cfat\u201d but I don\u2019t let that destroy my day. \n\nI\u2019ve had 5 teeth pulled and 10 fillings. Basically my teeth are so disintegrated I\u2019ll need dentures/implants in a couple years. Every single tooth has a chip in it as well. Luckily my period came back right always and I wasn\u2019t sure if I could get pregnant but I did(I had an abortion). One of my friends was hospitalized many times as a teen and she just had a baby at 35! Don\u2019t be scared if you can go to the doctor and get checked out! Honestly if I would have gone to the dentist sooner I probably could have saved some teeth. \n\nI am so so proud of you! If I can make it ten years you can too! I was 23 when I quit you have an amazing life ahead of you!",
