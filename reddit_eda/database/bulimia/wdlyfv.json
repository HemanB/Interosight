I have gone years having hair falling out and bad teeth, but it got so much worst in the last year. It\u2019s hard to even care about how bad it\u2019s affecting you physically, but after 5 years of this cycle it\u2019s like I had something click in place in my head. It\u2019s not an instant recovery click, but it just made me care more about what it\u2019s doing to my body, rather than disregarding my body all together, which is what I was doing before. All I can say is talk to people wether that be strangers like me on Reddit or anyone you trust and if it\u2019s available get some professional help. And just know that recovery is not a million miles away though it may feel like it. If you ever need a chat my inbox is always open and I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t help anymore ! \u2764\ufe0f",
