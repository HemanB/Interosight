      "body": "Yup this is precisely what triggered my bulimia relapse. Counted calories, did the weight loss the \u201cright\u201d way without purging, got to a \u201cgood weight\u201d but still wasn\u2019t satisfied, was insanely unhappy, and still hated myself. Everyone told me all my problems would be solved by weight loss \u2014 they weren\u2019t. They couldn\u2019t fix the major I hated, people I hated, a society I hated, the suicidal thoughts and depression I felt. Thinness was never the solution and so now I\u2019m stuck in bingeing and purging inadequately, gaining back the weight. I hate it but I never want to stop.",

      "body": "THIS!!  This is why I finally chose Recovery for the 2nd time.  March 2022.  I had been at that magical low weight, and was still miserable.   So miserable,  but now also had full blown ED and bad labs. Hair falling out, skin drooping.  Ugly.  I made a list of why I was feeling so shitty, and saw my problems could NOT be fixed by my ED.  So I said \"well hell, if I feel this bad now, I might as well be healthy and recovered,  and feel bad.\"  LOL!  That's how I chose Recovery again,  and am still holding steady.  There are difficulties and emotional pain on both sides of either ED or Recovery.   But at least one is \"normal\" and healthy.  Now I gotta figure out how to fix ME: low self-esteem, Shame, past trauma, mistakes,  dissapointments, etc.   Life is hard, but it is HARDER with an ED, just like any addiction.",

I had very low self esteem that I'd tied to me being big but, in reality, the number on the scale ticking down didn't make me love myself any more. I had low self esteem and was a normal weight.\n\nTreat the ED. It's a mental illness and a bad coping mechanism. :/ ultimately it brings no joy, it just removes the sadness it brings. \"I feel fat from eating so I purge and I no longer feel fat.\" ... but what if the ED was in remission and you didn't feel big just for eating?\n\nT_T Its not about the weight. We make it about the weight as a distraction from the real problem, the sadness and problematic relationship with food.",
