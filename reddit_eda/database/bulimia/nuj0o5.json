I must have tried to record it over 15 times with different lighting and angles. Nothing worked . I became more and more discouraged every time I watched each video. I tried to cover my chin, or parts of my face with my hair or clothes. I couldn\u2019t stand seeing my chin and nose and it disgusted me. I couldn\u2019t bare watching myself and was in tears by the end. I eventually replaced myself with a turtle puppet . \nI\u2019m no help. I\u2019m sorry. I understand your pain though.",
