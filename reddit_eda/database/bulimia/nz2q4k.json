  "selftext": "when youre eating but youre not hungry its because youre hungry for something other than food (e.g some kind of emotion)\n\nall i seem to want is to be skinny... so then why? \n\n1. so i look good\n2. therefore people will like me \n3. therefore people will want to be my friend/date me/i will get attention\n4. there will be one less thing to criticise me about\n\nso basically... i want validation. i want love.... **i just want love and acceptance. i dont want to get hurt, thats it.** and i project all of that onto being skinny or being 'perfect' in other ways too. but all i really want is to be loved...\n\nso then i guess the real solution is to be content with the love i have? not everyone is going to love me. i will get hurt by strangers as well as people who love me. but that doesnt mean theres no love in my life. because people can hurt me and still love me (if they dont mean it/apologise) or, theres other people who do love me... and also theres me.\n\n**if i just loved myself enough maybe i wouldnt need to be skinny because id have all the validation id need.** \n\ninteresting.",

There is this projection that being skinny makes you bulletproof and invulnerable to pain. It just isn't true. I think working towards self love is a great goal to have. I'm sure there are so many things about you that you can be proud of. Gratitude goes a long way in helping us realize that we are enough and worthy of love. Excellent realization!",

So not only do I feel rejected, but it somehow turned into a weight issue. Its a never ending cycle for me... losing weight to feel accepted, not getting that acceptance, losing more weight. I know just how you feel.",

Like learn how to accept validation and love from others, learn how to reach out and connect and believe it when a friend tells you how much they appreciate you. Or learn how to do nice things for ourselves and not ruin it with our own self hatred.",
