  "selftext": "Before my disordered eating habits developed I really loved potatoes, but last year as they became one of my fear foods, I started really hating them (both mentally and taste-wise) which was of course quite sad and distressing.\n\nAnyway I ate a whole potato today with my dinner and didn't get upset! Not a very big one but not a tiny one either. I even really liked the taste again and started to think about how I might incorporate them into more meals.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for the kind words, the upvotes, the hugz award, just everything. I'm gonna eat another potato today :)",
