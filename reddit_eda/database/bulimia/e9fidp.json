You are so lovely.\n\nI\u2019m coming off a straight week of binging with almost no purging and have been restricting again over the last few days. \n\nIt feels so good until I stand up too quickly, until I remember that my body does have limits\u2014and there are tiny humans who need me, who didn\u2019t ask to be brought into this world.\n\nI\u2019m also pretty sure I have *serious* digestive issues at this point that I\u2019ve been scared to look into properly, but I\u2019m going to. My own mom died when I was ten, and I can\u2019t leave my kids motherless with all this fuckery.\n\nAnyway...fuck. :/ I wish I could give you a hug if you\u2019re cool with hugs, or maybe serve you a soothing cup of tea or just cry with you for a while. \n\nYou are one year older than me. *Fuck.* \n\nAlso, I love your Kurt Vonnegut shirt! And something about your face here really speaks to me, thinned hair that looks damaged like mine. Those familiar skin crinkles. The dark circles sitting beneath big eyes. And still a quiet, dignified sort of radiance that shines through so genuinely, so powerfully.\n\nI wish you all the best. I wish you could pull through this somehow, but I respect your decision nonetheless. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019ve gotten donations for potential funeral costs and hope you find nothing but endless comfort in the coming days. \n\nI\u2019ll be thinking of you (and your partner).
