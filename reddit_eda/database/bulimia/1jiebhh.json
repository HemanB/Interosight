We got this! honestly for me as superficial as it might seem I mainly think about how good i\u2019ll look when i recover. My teeth won\u2019t be as gross & my face won\u2019t be as swollen. Also i try and occupy my time with things i enjoy. Say I have a really bad urge to binge and purge i hyper focus on sketching or watching a show. Last but not least this has helped me and it might not for you but just knowing time is gonna pass and i\u2019m not gonna feel how i\u2019m in the present all the time.",
