We want it to stay so badly, everything about us is right, but the bulimia degrades the future of it, just like our health. the lyrics remind me of the sad smile the guy you\u2019ve dated for months gives you once they find out. Or the employer seeing you decline or cease in performance because of health, mental and physical. The friends who won\u2019t want to be around anymore because they\u2019ve picked up on the inability to connect with you like everyone else does: food. \u201cOnly you, only you\u201d\u2026. Reminds me that with bulimia, we only have bulimia. No one else accepts it but us.",
