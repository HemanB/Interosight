  "selftext": "Wanna know what\u2019s SO frustrating? Binging, then going to the bathroom to purge. You get ready, and when you go to do it nothing comes out. I literally just sat there trying and trying but nothing\u2026 then sat there crying because I was SO frustrated. It feels like I\u2019ve lost my one thing I usually have control over. The second day in a row this happened. This last week has been so horrible and it makes the binge feel 10X more awful when I can\u2019t get it out of me after. Maybe I\u2019m waiting too long after the binge? Not drinking enough water? It\u2019s driving me insane because (shamefully) I almost look forward to my purge after a binge. It gives me a tiny bit of control over my life. It scares me so much; makes me fear any little thing I put in my mouth because what if my body rejects me the sweetness of getting taking it right back out?",

      "body": "Hii. This happened to me when i was purging to frequently, or if i didn\u2019t have enough water. Sometimes you\u2019re so stressed that your body just refuses to follow your instructions (for good reason though). I know it feels awful, you feel bloated and like you will gain 10kg for that one binge, but you know i feel like bulimia is more mental than physical, you FEEL like it\u2019s literally the end but it is actually not. The next day you\u2019ll feel awful sure, the next one probably the same. But if you just handle this suffering for a bit more (trying to break this never ending cycle) im sure it can get better. \n\nA few things that helped me so far is trying to be more religious, i know this sounds strange but believing that there is a higher power that wants you here, that made you exactly this way and that loves you unconditionally can be very strengthening for our hearts. I for example believe in God but am actually a Buddhist (those things aren\u2019t incompatible by the way) and there is a lot of accepting suffering to be liberated and the sacredness of food in this eastern religions. It\u2019s beautiful really, and make us see food in this whole other way. \nThis is a more superficial advice, but when the binge was really bad i just repeated to myself/almost gaslighting me \u201cso what, this just means i have one more week in my health/fitness journey\u201d.\nThis is a controversial subject, but i am trying to loose weight IN recovery. And i don\u2019t feel like this is a bad thing, knowing how much it matters to me i know myself enough to recognize that it doesn\u2019t feel good when i say \u201clet\u2019s just eat whatever i want because i can be an intuitive eater\u201d the thing is intuitive eating is really fucking hard for bulimics and can be a trap. I for instance binged A LOT of times trying this. So i am honest to myself. It\u2019s okay really to like yourself skinnier. it\u2019s okay. you\u2019re not superficial and insecure and disgusting because of that. the problem is when you hate yourself now so much you never allow yourself to change. To be at peace with yourself. It is essential to remember though that loosing fat is the consequence (and NOT the cause) of being healthy and well. Focus on living everyday and every minute for those causes (and that means more than food, it means relationships, family, study/work, hobbies, exercise etc). A good tip to start is to fix one filling breakfast you\u2019ll have everyday. This one thing felt really safe for me because i could just rely on that one meal to not binge when everything else felt so overwhelming. I like to do banana oatmeal with nuts. It\u2019s warm and sweet and comforting. \nSo having said that. I send my love to you. you\u2019re not alone. we\u2019re not alone. Stay true to yourself. Practice awareness in every bite. Make food sacred and it will heal you, not poison you.\n\nAnother thing is that i would love to have a partner/friend to share my struggles and help each other figuring this out. Im looking for a reliable and committed relationship to help recovery. kinda like a sponsor things (but more horizontal since we\u2019ll be helping each other out) they have in the 12 steps. If anyone is interested dm me please\ud83d\ude0aA bit more about me: Im from Brazil, S\u00e3o Paulo. I have 19 and am currently in med school.",
