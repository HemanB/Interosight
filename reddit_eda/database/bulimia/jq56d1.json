  "selftext": "(tw, idk what for it's just fucked up lol)\n\nReally stupid thought I know, but I can't help but feel like this after I b/p. I feel like a fat hog because I don't have any self control and I'm fat. I'm flabby. If I did have self control I wouldn't have eaten an entire loaf of bread in one sitting, I would be starving instead. It feels like if I were anorexic, my struggles would be more valid because I would be sick enough to deny my body fuel. But I'm stuffing my face like a fatty.",

I've been diagnosed with AN-B/P and then AN-R. \nThere hasn't been a moment that I didn't feel I could've written your post, OP. \n\nAlso, I've been in treatment with a LOT of people with bulimia who were definitely worse of physically and mentally than me. \n\nUnfortunately public perception and medical perspective how narrow views of what an ED is supposed to look like. \n\nMany people care about you and would talk your situation seriously \u2661",

Bulimia is rough shit ain't no breeze, more like a cough and a gag lol. But I know what your getting at it's like ooooo I get to enjoy all this food and just puke it out. Its what comes with bulimia, it's never just bulimia. Depression, anxiety, insecurities its definitely a whole package. I wish I could just stick to exercise and a healthy diet. But I'm so damn depressed my rooms gone to shit and I just sleep all day. I ain't got the energy to do shit. It's like to the point I'd rather be asleep because my dreams are better than my actual life. I got one thing in my life that keeps my head up and is keeping me motivated to breath, that's my significant other. My soul mate, and guess what she has fucking multiple sclerosis. I worry about her DAILY, high volume of stress life let's go!!! Man im gonna age like a crackhead with all the stress and cigarettes in my future lol\ud83d\ude42Your feelings are valid, as are mine.",

Doctors don't care, family don't support, therapy is too expensive for something long term, and I can't get medical attention because I'm not skinny and I'm physically OK.\n\nNo one is winning here, but I struggled with anorexia for about a year and it's a different struggle. Ana was more intense, a daily suffering, but there had to be an end for it because it was so unsustainable. Bulimia has literally screwed up my mental health slowly over time and I would say its ruining my life, there's no end in sight, it won't kill me or hospitalise me, its just a never ending cycle.",
