  "selftext": "Do you sometimes have the desire to tell someone about your eating problems? But not just a little, but exactly everything. I would really like to just tell someone everything, all my feelings and thoughts, that I regularly b/p, that I starve myself for days and then eat a lot and puke it out, why I do it, how i feel with it, \u2026 I want to tell all this and if it's with detail. I don't want to be alone with it anymore. At the moment, when i sit in a completely normal conversation, i think about just spilling all of it. telling it all to the person i\u2019m speaking with. But i don\u2019t trust anyone with this and i\u2019m also not brave enough tbh. I currently write a diary every night, but it's not the same as talking to a real person. But I have no one I could tell that to. I'm 15, almost 16, but my parents wouldn't understand it, my mom herself is depressed and barely able to deal with my feelings To deal with, my dad is always at work. I only have a few friends, I don't want to tell them. The best would be therapy, but I can't get there without my parents. Does anyone feel the same?",
