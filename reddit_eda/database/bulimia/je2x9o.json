These are my top 6 which seem surprisingly common in men and could be indicative of something deeper.\n\nDo you do any of them?\n\n1. lots of zero calorie foods e.g. sugar-free jelly, celery, gum\n2. extreme restriction e.g. keto, intense daily fasting\n3. stealing food from others\n4. eating from bins\n5. hiding food wrapping\n6. regular body checking e.g. pinching stomach\n\nI talk about them in more detail here: [https://youtu.be/9-X4TgaTG0E](https://youtu.be/9-X4TgaTG0E)\n\nI've done all 6 a lot \ud83d\udc40\n\nThese are obviously only potential quirky warning signs: they are not related to the clinical definition of any eating disorders.  \nThat said, they could be a flag to gently check-in with someone if you notice these behaviours.\n\nSending love & support to you all \ud83d\udcaa",
