There is like this off time in recovery where you feel like you can't tell ppl what's actually going on if you've slipped, especially if you've come right off the rails. \n\nIn my experience, people want to know. Some might be unhelpful and invalidating but you might tell someone who can will have what it takes to keep you going.\n\nThanks for posting this, it's given me a point to reflect on \ud83d\udc90\ud83c\udf3c\ud83c\udf3b\ud83e\udde1",

It\u2019s so sad for her that we can\u2019t help/encourage her. She chooses to keep everything t herself and tbh it\u2019s frustrating ... she is so alone with her disorder and it is SO hard it is for me just to watch. I would love her to open up so I could love on her and help.\n\nAlso, for friends that may not have experience with dealing with an ED. It\u2019s important to know that it\u2019s a learning experience for them too. They may not say the perfectly right things at first, but let it sink in and let them maybe research it. They\u2019re your friends, they\u2019ll want the best for you",
