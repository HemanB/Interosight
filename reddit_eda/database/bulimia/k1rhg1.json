I ate An amazing meal with people I love and I deserve better than to spend the night over the toilet. I hope you all are having An amazing holiday, and getting through this. I know thanksgiving is one of the hardest days for me, and last year I snuck upstairs and threw it all up. Stay safe everyone!",
