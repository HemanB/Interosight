  "selftext": "I feel so trapped in it. It\u2019s like a legit addiction, every time I binge I say this is finally going to be the last time, spoiler it never is. Then to me the purge is my \u201cpunishment\u201d after I do it as a way of self harm and me going \u201cwell this is what you get for eating so much\u201d. I feel like a legitimate zombie when I binge. Just eating to eat shit even if it\u2019s not that good. Why am I like this \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\nThen comes the immense relief, knowing you got all of it back out or almost all of it. And if it isn\u2019t possible for me to get everything out I just panic and have anxiety over it and am filled with self hatred. \n\nI mean what\u2019s the actual science behind bulimia because I swear this is a legitimate addiction. Doing it in secrecy, the shame, the guilt, the relief afterwards. ",

It is addictive because we\u2019re so overwhelmed by life that we do things we regret (binge) and then we found a superficial solution (purge). We do not loose fat by it, we keep from gaining as much as we would yes, but if we had a healthy relationship with food (and by that i mean eating whole foods that satisfy and makes us feel good) we wouldn\u2019t be gaining weight either. \n\nThis disorder never made me better, truly it made my health worse, my mental and social health inexistent. I was depressed. I was suicidal. When i was at my lowest (47kg) i felt awful and my body fat % was really high (i went to the doctor to do a body scan). After purging i feel bloated and the ugliest person in the world. I feel ashamed. It feels better than gaining weight? yes. But it is still terribly horrible. It\u2019s impossible to live at peace with this.\n\nAbout the addictive aspect, it is true. I read lots of articles about chemical changes in the brain since im a med student and interested in the subject (i strongly encourage you to read it to better understand yourself!! that are are a lot of free scientific material available). And we literally teach out brains to binge because we overload our receptors with dopamine, which makes then less sensitive since they are \u201cokay, i receive huge amounts of dopamine so i don\u2019t need to work well\u201d. This makes us feel miserable outside of our binges which triggers the cravings and the whole cycle we\u2019re all too familiar with. \nKnowing that we shouldn\u2019t feel hopeless, but we should understand that this is serious and that we must get help to end this.",
