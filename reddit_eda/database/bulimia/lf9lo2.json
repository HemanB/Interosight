  "selftext": "I remember blowing out the candles to my 4th birthday cake wishing for weight loss and smaller arms. Being 6 in the shower wondering if rubbing conditioner on my stomach would get rid of my fat cells the way it got rid of tangles in my hair. Finding the MPA community at 8, tumblr at 10 and I\u2019d never even thought my restriction and weird eating behaviors would evolve into spending hours of my day wasted on b/p sessions back to back til my mouth starts to peel and erode and bleed and going to bed at 4 am praying to gods i never believed in that this would finally be the night i fail to wake up in the morning. \n\nI\u2019m turning 20 this year and I feel like I have no purpose. I\u2019m not even in college because I took a few years off to go into several treatment stints but ultimately would end up being told they couldn\u2019t help me anymore? I feel like everyone and everything else is continuing to move and grow with the world and I\u2019m just floating through time and space existing. My whole youth has been wasted on mental illness and I\u2019m so fucking exhausted. \nBut simultaneously I just can\u2019t imagine a life without binging and purging. I feel so averse to relationships, friendships, intimacy, sex, connections, just because I fear being ripped away from my ability to binge and purge. If you ask me about my dream life, without a doubt the first thing I\u2019d end up fantasizing about would be relocating far, far away from everyone I know and having the finances to spend the rest of my life binging and purging until I die. I can\u2019t find the mental space for anything else and i feel so close to not even wanting to try anymore. \n\nBut I don\u2019t want to be like this. For the first time in like ever, I\u2019ve recently just found reasons to live, motivation to succeed, people to make proud and a willingness to fulfill my purpose to heal and listen and speak. \nBut I can\u2019t. For the fucking life of me. Break out of this toxic ass relationship with bulimia and I don\u2019t even know if I care. I want to fulfill the higher purpose and potential I KNOW I am capable of achieving but at the same time: binging and purging. That\u2019s all I need or want and I do not give a fuck. About all else.\n\nI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s been almost two decades and I\u2019m so. Exhausted",

This time last year I was about to turn twenty, flunked out of uni so moved home and the relationship ending because we were both consumed in our eating disorders.\n\nI'm about to turn twenty one now and my life has never been better and I have so much more control in my life. I'm working nights in a fish factory with my sister and dad, making pretty good money too actually. But that's beside the point, I'm just wanting to say that you're finally at the stage where you can recognise it and help yourself! Find something that gives you control somewhere else",

I have now gotten comments about my weight from everyone I ever see (I\u2019ve been at this long enough that I have very few people I see regularly.). I have no idea what I\u2019m going to do about that. I feel like the obvious answer is stop, but I can\u2019t. If I told someone (or admitted to these people who probably know already) what I\u2019m doing, then I would need to get help.  If I got help it would just be forcing me to stop doing this, but my mind will never be ok with me unless I look like I\u2019m dying apparently..  so that means that I will obsess over other ways to be rail thin. And if I lose that I\u2019m sure I will go back to either alcohol to forget/not care or drugs to get it back.  I am in so deep. I can\u2019t think about anything else.  I lose hours every day between shopping for, preparing, cleaning up, hiding, and executing all this bullshit.  I am so tired. My life isn\u2019t moving forward. I don\u2019t even want it to anymore.  I\u2019ve been committed, institutionalized, and hospitalized 4 times for suicide/addiction issues in the last 2 years.  I feel like all of these things are going to come to a head and if I don\u2019t die because of one of these addictions I will just spontaneously combust.",

You\u2019re on your way there. Your mind is expanding and you have purpose. Sometimes our mental illness becomes our life mission and soul purpose. You deserve treatment that works but it starts with you and your mindset and it sounds like you\u2019re on the path to reclaiming yourself and your life. Sending love to you xo",
