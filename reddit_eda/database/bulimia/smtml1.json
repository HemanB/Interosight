After doing so fucking well on my diet, finally getting to become somewhat attractive from low bodyfat levels i fucked it up again and am in for yet another week of hellish starving. I compulsively punched myself in the face so hard so many times afterward out of sheer self-hatred i badly hurt my neck and jaw like a fucking crazy person. Now im getting ready for a 15000 step walk and a sleepless night. Epic.",
