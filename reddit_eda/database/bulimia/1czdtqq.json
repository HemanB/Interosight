  "selftext": "I believe everyone's body is different I cannot speak for all bulimic sufferers as there is a spectrum. I am a long time sufferer of bulimia from 2014. I managed to recover during covid, gained alot of weight during this period but I managed to have control over my thoughts. After covid I have fully repleased. I have tried to go cold turkey, myself without therapy. Tried and failed. I'm sitting in the early 80 kilos. Lowest I got down to was 78kg. This was after purging the same amount of times during my honeymoon phase. I lost alot of weight during the first few years but after a while your bodyweight doesn't come off. I was fluctuating between 80kg and 78kg for months on end still overweight for my height. Essentially this is what it led to me for it. My thoughts? I would rather be overweight with no history of Ed at least then I would not have negative constant obsessions over my body and the weighting scale, i would diet and go to the gym like everyone else who doesnt have an non ed. This is a complete nightmare and I wish I hadn't fall into this horrible ed. Bulimia doesn't make you lose weight. It won't. Fight your demons and try and get sense with yourself. The scale doesn't rule you. If you wanna lose weight please don't do this binging and purging. Seek help first then focus on weight loss. Maybe your weight isn't the issue. ",
