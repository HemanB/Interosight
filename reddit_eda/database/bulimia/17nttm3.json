  "selftext": "Hi guys, I am in desperate need of help. My sister is very sick with bulimia, and as someone who suffered with anorexia, I feel so so horrible for her, and I know how incredibly hard it is to live with an eating disorder but, she makes a giant mess. She is incapable of cleaning up after herself. \n\nBesides the giant stack of dishes and garbage left all over the house, and her eating all of my food, which i need since i am still in recovery and like to eat the same things everyday. Which i know isn\u2019t great but that\u2019s a story for another time. there is vomit everywhere. She binges and purges multiple times a day. She leaves her puke in the sink, literal chunks of it. She leaves it running down the cabinet under the sink. And the toilet, oh my god. There has been caked on vomit around the entire bowl of the toilet, like I\u2019m sure you could grab a handful of it. She leaves piles of vomit on the ground. On the outside of the toilet. She also leaves vomit on the wall. I say to her often that I\u2019d like her to clean up after herself, but for some reason she has zero issues with me cleaning up after her. I don\u2019t understand how she can leave her puke out for everyone to see. Is it wrong of me to be upset with her? \n\nWhat do I do? Is anyone able to help. I am at the point where I hold my pee after school and wait until the next morning to pee once I get to school. I am so frustrated that if I walk into the bathroom and see the mess, I just start crying and walk out. I can not continue living like this. No one can.",

But my mom thinks it\u2019s unfair to be keeping food in my room and isn\u2019t great for my mental health, which I agree. I definitely think it\u2019s a good idea to try to trust her and mark my name on things. Thank you, I really really appreciate your input.

It depends on your jurisdiction and what country/province/state you are in on what exactly qualifies a person for this, esp in regards to EDs since there\u2019s such a grey area legally and medically. But it may be worth looking into. If she is leaving her mess around she either doesn\u2019t have the will/energy/care to clean it or she wants attention. Or both. This is a major red flag that unfortunately no amount of you and your family showing you care is going to definitively be enough to make her believe it. I saw you said she likes the attention she gets from boys, and seems to want attention from you guys as well, and all of this really seems like she has a really low sense of self worth. And her doing this everyday is just so so damaging. As someone who\u2019s been there, purging after every meal, even the smallest snack, everyday, without fail for a long time, sometimes I would claim I was sick physically or drunk or hungover because I had never told anyone about my Ed and wasn\u2019t getting treatment, and I thought that at least that level of attention and concern would be validating enough for me. But it wasn\u2019t. I still craved validation and positive attention. I wanted to be loved and didn\u2019t think that could happen with my body looking how it did, or does, I still struggle with this now tbh. But I have progressed in my recovery enough to where I\u2019m not purging everyday and I can eat at least one full meal a day. I have a long way to go of course, but the point I am trying to make is that, sometimes people do this kind of thing when they are at such a low point that they think they are worthless, or at least worthless without their ED. Often seeing their ED as the one thing that they are capable at, as the one comfort they have. I really would suggest trying in whatever way you can to help her. I totally get that you\u2019re in recovery as well and I get that is hard to have to help someone else when you\u2019re still struggling somewhat yourself, so I\u2019m not suggesting that you aren\u2019t trying hard enough, I just think this may be a bit more of an urgent situation than it seems. I mean, what she is doing is really dangerous. Best of luck to you tho! I wish you and your sister the best in terms of your recovery! This stuff is a bitch to deal with, I hope your family is able to work through this and that y\u2019all find some peace.\ud83d\udc9b",

          "body": "If someone is a danger to themselves, in many places this can be enough to admit them without their own willingness to go. It depends on your jurisdiction and what country/province/state you are in on what exactly qualifies a person for this, esp in regards to EDs since there\u2019s such a grey area legally and medically. But it may be worth looking into. If she is leaving her mess around she either doesn\u2019t have the will/energy/care to clean it or she wants attention. Or both. This is a major red flag that unfortunately no amount of you and your family showing you care is going to definitively be enough to make her believe it. I saw you said she likes the attention she gets from boys, and seems to want attention from you guys as well, and all of this really seems like she has a really low sense of self worth. And her doing this everyday is just so so damaging. As someone who\u2019s been there, purging after every meal, even the smallest snack, everyday, without fail for a long time, sometimes I would claim I was sick physically or drunk or hungover because I had never told anyone about my Ed and wasn\u2019t getting treatment, and I thought that at least that level of attention and concern would be validating enough for me. But it wasn\u2019t. I still craved validation and positive attention. I wanted to be loved and didn\u2019t think that could happen with my body looking how it did, or does, I still struggle with this now tbh. But I have progressed in my recovery enough to where I\u2019m not purging everyday and I can eat at least one full meal a day. I have a long way to go of course, but the point I am trying to make is that, sometimes people do this kind of thing when they are at such a low point that they think they are worthless, or at least worthless without their ED. Often seeing their ED as the one thing that they are capable at, as the one comfort they have. I really would suggest trying in whatever way you can to help her. I totally get that you\u2019re in recovery as well and I get that is hard to have to help someone else when you\u2019re still struggling somewhat yourself, so I\u2019m not suggesting that you aren\u2019t trying hard enough, I just think this may be a bit more of an urgent situation than it seems. I mean, what she is doing is really dangerous. Best of luck to you tho! I wish you and your sister the best in terms of your recovery! This stuff is a bitch to deal with, I hope your family is able to work through this and that y\u2019all find some peace.\ud83d\udc9b",
