  "selftext": "I am 31 years old and this week i had all of my teeth pulled. After struggling with bulimia for 16 years and spending over 100k on dental work, i had to have all of my teeth pulled. This is costing 70k to get my teeth restored :(\nIn addition to this my Ive had multiple heart attacks, my kidneys shut down last year, my esophagus has ruptured, my bladder has prolapsed and im left with life long autoimmune issues, bowel obstruction & cardiac complications. \nIf you think this can't happen to you... i promise it can. Im sick of going tiktok and seeing eating disorders glorified when this is the reality of this disease.\nPlease take care of yourselves... no one is exempt from the repercussions.",

It's really brave of you to share the reality of what eating disorders do to people, maybe it will help someone who is thinking about seeking help to recover to see the realities of what can happen if they don't seek help.",

EDs are so horrible and physically painful, there\u2019s nothing glamorous or esthetic about them, just wrinkly skin and bad moods and hair loss and moodiness. It\u2019s so all consuming. I wish the best of luck for you in your healing. I had a friend pass away this year from rupturing and heart conditions due to her bulimia. I\u2019ve had friends with EDs commit suicide and I\u2019ve seen girls in their 20s with pacemakers and people who have had grand mal seizures. It\u2019s so serious. All of my love to you.\n\nWhat helped me a lot was realizing that I needed to address the underlying trauma that was causing me to use my ED to distract myself from the pain. I did a lot of exposure work and it helped me greatly to realize that EDs are just keeping us from experiencing the true hurt we hold within ourselves. Sending you all of my love.",
