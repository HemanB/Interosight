  "selftext": "I started off by cutting calories, but extremely fast it turned into an abnormally small number. Workouts became harder and harder. I was confidently heading towards anorexic status. But my body would not let me. Just when I was at the very edge, it reacted. I got a severe hormonal imbalance with one strong symptom - extreme hunger that was impossible to resist. My body wanted to get what it needed.\n\nI believed I was smarter and started throwing up \u201cexcess\u201d food. For a moment I thought that this is it, I\u2019m going back to my \u201cnormal\u201d (a.k.a. aspiring to being underweight). But my body had another trick up it\u2019s sleeve. Soon enough I\u2019ve lost my gag reflex. I could spend a whole hour trying to shove three fingers in my throat as deep as possible. Water, baking soda - nothing worked.\n\nI cursed my body for all of that. Why wouldn\u2019t it understand that I want to be skinny? Why would it resist me with such stubbornness? \n\nNow I am in recovery and my attitude has changed. I like to think of my body as of a separate character, a friends who slaps your face when you are heading to a rock bottom. In its ways it has protected me from ruining myself. My body was ruthless, merciless, but it won.\n\nFrom your uncaring, unloving, foolish owner,\nThank you, my body!",
