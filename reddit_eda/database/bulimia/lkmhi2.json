  "selftext": "I currently have 16 days without purging, which I thought was impossible after my relapse after 2 years free \ud83d\udc9b last night I had an impulse to buy cake and immediately afterwards I was like WHY did I do that (danger food for me). I really just wish I could enjoy moderate amounts of foods without going overboard yknow? Point is, I asked my dad to split the two slices with me and he did, without judgement, and I felt safe from myself, for a moment \ud83d\udc9b. Even though I slightly binged later, I didn\u2019t hate myself, and I knew the cravings were related to \u2728my cycle\u2728 so I felt ok about it??? Love this community \ud83d\udc9b\u2728",
