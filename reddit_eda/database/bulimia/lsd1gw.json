  "selftext": "I'm so fucking tired, you know?\n\nThe fact I was born female feels like a curse. Lots of really sweet guys are interested in me but I cut them all off and stay lonely and frustrated because the porn, the Instagram. Dear god. And then I go throw up and feel slightly better until I open my phone and the fucking cycle starts again.\n\nWomanhood is just a curse. I hate having boobs, a butt, a body, just everything. Naked women are fucking everywhere and men just can't keep their eyes away. No amount of losing weight, baking them cakes or excusing their shitty behaviour fixes it.\n\nI want plastic surgery desperately bad... But then who knows? Maybe the council of masculinity will decide my body's \"out!\" and I'll need to spend millions of dollars more.\n\nI've been in love and so loyal to the fucking ugliest men but they still CAN'T keep their eyes off of other girls.\n\nPurging is a temporary fix to the never ending pain of a girl's existence.",

Feel free to delete or ignore this if it's unhelpful! Though I do hope it helps!\n\nFirst I want to say that I 100% relate. I just made another comment about my ex's porn obsession and it was agony. So you're so not alone, queenie. I feel you. We all feel you, for real.\n\nThe thing is (and I hope this is helpful for you because you do NOT deserve to suffer or have your self-worth debased),  porn isn't actually the issue. It's the replacement of real intimacy with quick, physical pleasure. Anyone, male or female, who would rather look at porn or who wishes YOU were more like a pornstar, cannot have a healthy relationship with you because they don't want one. \n\nI repeat: The problem is NOT YOU.\n\nThe problem is fear of intimacy and an insecure attachment style. People look to porn because they don't want to risk investing in what is real. They don't want to get hurt, and denying their partner for something that is predictable and cannot hurt them (like porn) gives them the boost that they need to feel better about themselves. Porn will never abandon them, reject them, or find someone new. They can control porn. What they can't control is you.\n\nI don't mean to invalidate your feelings, because they're totally valid. But I get the feeling that you blame yourself for not being attractive to your partners - even the ugly ones, lol. When the truth is, queen, that you could be a model and your partners would still look elsewhere because they have an insecure attachment to real people.\n\nI was at a seminar yesterday about this, and the speaker reiterated the fact that those without healthy attachment are bound to treat us like shit. And it sounds to me like you were treated like shit. I could be totally wrong and if I am, please correct me. But the men who were in your life were not looking for a real relationship. They don't know how to have one.\n\nAgain, your experiences are valid and I know how you feel. This might not help at all, but I at least want to reassure you that *not all men are like this*. I've seen friends find healthy relationships after experiences like this and it *is* possible. But you have to stop hating yourself for not being perfect. Anyone who's asking for perfection is asking for the impossible, and trust me when I say that you don't want that.\n\nI'm sorry if this is too long or if I've overstepped boundaries. I just remember SO vividly how I felt about porn in my relationships AND outside of them, and it hurt really deeply. \n\nI don't want you to hurt, queen. \u2764\ufe0f You deserve better.",

A very stupid one, because it backfired. \nDating has always been a huge stress factor to me. I was bullied in my early teenage years, called ugly etc. Then all of the sudden guys were interested in me. So I developed an eating disorder, went from bulimia to anorexia and then to bulimia for good. I've never been truly happy in a romantic relationship. I've been always asking myself whether I fit the requirements of the other person. Whether I pretty, skiny, funny enough. It was exhausting (plus I've always had better sex on my own lol), so eventually I came back to my safe spot, where I can eat carbs in a very unladylike manner while watching YouTube.

But years ago my first real boyfriend (18M) was talking to someone he referred to as a friend about her sex toys and what she was doing with them. He was very open with the fact he was doing this and being 15 and very naive I had no idea if this was normal or what to do about it. It really triggered my anxiety and upped the anti with my ed because I got it in my head if I was skinnier and prettier and perfect then I'd be good enough and he'd stop. Then when he found out I'd asked my friend for advice about this he dumped me via text message right before my History exam, charming I know. It took years to get over those feelings and I thought I'd almost beaten my ed until I found out my new partner was asking his female friend for \"lewds\". The personal nature of it just made it feel so much worse and I've been stuck going around in the same cycle for years. I don't know if I'll ever be able to have a normal relationship and not feel like there is something wrong with my body the way it is.",

We'd watch it together and he'd ask me if my butt had ever looked like the actors, if my hair had always been the way it was, etc. Comparing me to all these impossibly beautiful, submissive women. \n\nWe'd be in the same room, sitting not 4ft apart and he'd be watching cam girls while half-heartedly talking to me. When I caught him, he started hiding and lying about it, and eventually even intended to cheat on my with some other guy (he was bisexual). \n\nThe sad part wasn't even his addiction to it. It was the fact that he was hiding it from me. Like, you can't trust or have a healthy relationship with someone who lies to you.\n\nHis indiscretions definitely led to me restricting and b/ping full stop. I was so tired of him comparing me, so tired of him watching other girls on the street and expecting our sex to be constantly evolving to be closer to porn... that I finally just went online to find a diet and dove completely into the proana community. It was so hurtful and I felt so trapped.\n\nEventually I realized he was never going to change without therapy (to which he would not go) so I dumped his ass. But it's taken me like 8 years to finally understand that people's interest in porn over reality isn't about me.\n\nSORRY I JUST DUMPED ALL THIS HERE I have a lot of feelings about EDs and porn. \ud83d\ude14",

I know it's hard and I know sometimes when you've thrown up everything you've eaten and the room is spinning and you're just *so* cold, to go back into that boyfriend's arms. Because he makes you hate yourself but at least you can say that he's your boyfriend.\n\nBut is it worth it? Eventually, blankets will be enough to keep you warm. You don't have to sacrifice yourself to save his body heat from leaving. And you'll realise what all your friends that love you see in you. \n\nEvery single person is beautiful and unique. It sounds like at the very least he doesn't appreciate what is unique and beautiful about you. He doesn't sound like the type of man you want a future with.\n\nDms are always open. Stay safe, you're loved more than you'll ever know. :)",

So you're so not alone, queenie. I feel you. We all feel you, for real.\n\nThe thing is (and I hope this is helpful for you because you do NOT deserve to suffer or have your self-worth debased),  porn isn't actually the issue. It's the replacement of real intimacy with quick, physical pleasure. Anyone, male or female, who would rather look at porn or who wishes YOU were more like a pornstar, cannot have a healthy relationship with you because they don't want one. \n\nI repeat: The problem is NOT YOU.\n\nThe problem is fear of intimacy and an insecure attachment style. People look to porn because they don't want to risk investing in what is real. They don't want to get hurt, and denying their partner for something that is predictable and cannot hurt them (like porn) gives them the boost that they need to feel better about themselves. Porn will never abandon them, reject them, or find someone new. They can control porn. What they can't control is you.\n\nI don't mean to invalidate your feelings, because they're totally valid.
