  "selftext": "This story might be triggering. \nSo I binged today. It started off as trying to treat myself. In order to get better I need to stop fearing food and be able to enjoy things without feeling guilty. It started with fries and mayo. My roommates ordered takeout so I thought this would be a good time to jump in and challenge myself. Then I went for a pudding. I was already feeling full but then I had a pancake with chocolate spread. Then ice cream. Then I went into my room with a grilled cheese and it spiraled out of control from there. Having all of those things in itself sounds like a lot but for a healthy person that's fine. I don't eat like this every day after all. I tried to calm myself and kept telling myself 'this is fine. I can eat whatever I want. This food deserves to stay in my body - I deserve to have this food'. But even before I went upstairs, I started to feel this imense guilt. When I was alone and I knew my roommates would be staying downstairs for a few more hours, watching TV, I ran to the toilet without thinking. Just because I knew no one would hear me. There was no rationality there. It just happened. In these moments, I don't think. Straight after purging, I had more food. Multiple bags of chips, chocolate bars, cake, anything I could find either in my room or downstairs. I wasn't even looking at what I was picking up from our kitchen. I ate whatever. When I purged again, I felt so horrible afterwards. I have this awful headache that always comes with purging. Halfway through, I started having really bad stomach cramps. When I was done, my nose started bleeding. I don't know if the pressure made me pop a vessle or why that happened but it sure scared me. This scares me. Being out of control again scares me. But I have to be gentle to myself and stop blaming. Guilt tripping myself has never gotten me anywhere. I have to remember that. \nSo after nearly 60 days of being binge free, I binged again. I did well. This is a new record. \n\nTomorrow is day 1. \nTime to set a new record.",

I'm in recovery too and there are still days where I feel my eating is out of control and I feel so discusting and sick after eating a huge amount of food, but if I don't purge, I still get the stamp for the day. 1 slip up in 60 days is not going to do anything to your body and if you keep it down, your brain learns that being this full is not a nice feeling. Learn from this in a gentle way and understand that it's all part of recovery.",
