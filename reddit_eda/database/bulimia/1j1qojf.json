I find it comforting in a way for whatever reason as its became more of a routine and when I don't purge I miss that routine ",

The biological explanation to it is that purging releases endogenous opioids, which make you feel good, calm, focused etc. Just like other opioids you've probably heard about like morphine, heroin and fentanyl, these substances are addictive and your body may develop a dependency on them, to the point where if you don't purge for X days, you start experiencing withdrawal symptoms. For me this typically happens after 1 week b/p free. I start becoming irritable, erratic, experiencing loss of concentration and it feels like the need to b/p is all consuming at this point. It's VERY hard for me to resist b/p at this point and if I try to extend this timeframe it just gets worse.",
