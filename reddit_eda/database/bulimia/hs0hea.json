  "selftext": "And I\u2019m finally at the point where I\u2019m able to just eat the amount I need, what I crave etc without over doing it! It\u2019s been a long process. I initially gained a fair few kg but now I\u2019ve lost some of that without even trying which has been nice as I will admit it is hard seeing the initial weight gain. Just want to say if you\u2019re thinking about attempting recovery, if you\u2019re in recovery, if you relapsed yesterday- just keep going! It\u2019s so worth it! The ability to focus on my day, hold conversations with people without my mind being preoccupied with guilt and thoughts of food, is such a huge relief. I feel free \ud83d\ude03\u2764\ufe0f I love you all, I believe in you.",

You have the mindset that recovery WILL continue to happen and that is so so inspirational. Just be you. Be okay with what you may consider screw-ups. It\u2019s a journey not a quick fix.

I'm really really proud of you, and it made me really happy that you shared this here.",

The first year was hard but it gets sooooo much easier there is light at the end even if it feels like you\u2019ll never be \u201cnormal\u201d.
