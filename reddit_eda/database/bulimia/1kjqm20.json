  "selftext": "Most people react in disgust when you tell them you have bulimia. Especially when you\u2019re bulimic at a normal or higher BMI. There's no worry nor is it taken seriously most times\n\nI've also realized it's alot harder to tell people that you have bulimia specifically. Often times when I've opened up about it- I'm met with \"whats that?\" Or \"what is purging?\" How the hell do I explain I eat competitive eater amounts of food and purposely finger fuck my throat to make it come back up\ud83d\ude10 \n\nI think also a lot of people think bulimia is throwing up your normal/small meals etc, and don\u2019t know about the binging part which is also seen as \"gluttonous\" while purging is seen as \"gross, shameful, and wasteful\"\n\npeople need more compassion for it :(",
