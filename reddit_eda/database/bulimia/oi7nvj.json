  "selftext": "And there is nothing, nothing that\u2019s going to make me throw up and hurt my body now that I\u2019ve given it some time to heal. I\u2019m still overeating and gained a little weight and thought about purging last night after tearing through some chips and salsa. It would have been so easy and just a momentary lapse if I got right back on track afterwards, right? \n\nBut I considered it rationally. I figured it would take a day or two of exercise and healthy eating to cancel out the chips I ate, but if I purged them, it would take another 2 weeks for my body to heal again. Plus once I start it\u2019s hard to stop. So I just sat with the discomfort of an overfull tummy until I went to bed and I\u2019m glad I did. \n\nThe bloating has finally started to come down (at least it did before the chips) and now I\u2019m ready to tackle the overeating part of the disorder. I\u2019ll post here in another 15 days once I\u2019ve made it because I know I will!",

I do the daily pledges and reviews, track my moods and log notes. I think that has shifted my mindset from just wanting to stop because I \u201cshould\u201d to having real reasons to stop. My ED impacts/dominates virtually every aspect of my life and noticing the improvements across the board really helps.",

      "body": "I have discovered that the purging needs to stop before you can quit binging. Firstly, purging will almost always trigger another binge and there is nothing you can do to stop it except nourish yourself properly. Secondly, once your brain realizes that you can\u2019t and/or won\u2019t purge, the chances of binging are also reduced (based on my experience and some science). It can take a while for your body to adjust and heal, but it is healing every second that\u2019s passing by and you are doing an incredible job. I\u2019m so proud! I believe in you x",
