  "selftext": "I am currently on a train, and I had a sandwich for dinner. Of course, I had to rush to the toilet to throw it up.\n\nI thought I had locked the door, but it turns out it wasn't secured properly, and another passenger unintentionally walked in on me while I was hunched over the toilet. They quickly closed the door back, but the embarrassment I felt was overwhelming.\n\nI was afraid to leave the restroom, fearing I would encounter this stranger and have to face their judgment. Eventually, I managed to return to my seat without crossing paths with anyone, doing my best to avoid making eye contact.\n\nDefinitely a(nother) low point for me.",
