      "body": "BMI doesn\u2019t mean anything. \n\nRecovery is about replacing the unhealthy behaviours with healthier ones that can lead you to regulation and a calmer relationship with food. \n\nMedically, what\u2019s important is stopping the behaviour that causes you physical trauma. However you experience bulimia, the symptoms are detrimental to your health. Purging can lead to ulcers and even cancer in your throat, stomach and mouth, as well as gum disease and it weakens your immune system. You\u2019re at risk for many infections. \n\nSo, recovery is about rerouting your discomfort around food while also addressing the main issues that caused your ED. EDs are symptoms of a bigger mental health inconsistency that needs to be addressed. \n\nRecovery ain\u2019t about those numbers. My BMI says I\u2019m overweight but I know I\u2019m not. BMI is um... I mean, I suppose a good guideline. But as a woman who regularly gets called \u201ctiny\u201d (I hate it) I\u2019m still heavy, because of my muscle distribution and fat as well. BMI honestly is a junk science that will ruin your brain if you yas r that as a gauge to success. \n\nNumbers ain\u2019t recovery babe. Self love is, caring for yourself enough to entrust with professionals your care (inpatient or out) so you can live the life you deserve to live. \n\nYou\u2019ve got this, okay? Health isnt about being the fittest mofo out there, it\u2019s about taking care of yourself. \n\nYou can recover, you can enjoy the world, you can enjoy your life. I promise. \n\nAnd yeah moral of the story fuckkkkk BMI lol",

      "body": "Ok so I hope you\u2019re able to ignore some of the leas helpful comments here. I\u2019m currently seeing a licensed nutritionist through my ED treatment program. I\u2019ve been dealing with your exact issue. I was telling my nutritionist how hard it is to be overweight and stop the urges to restrict or purge and used the typical reasons: I worry that my weight will affect my health. My nutritionist explained that being overweight (especially while recovering) isn\u2019t necessarily dangerous as long as you try to eat balanced and healthy and maintain your weight. That is: eating enought to keep your body going and making sure your diet is full of different foods. That is easier said than done, I know, but that\u2019s also why it need to be your main priority over weight loss. The life style diseases that come with being overweight often have to do with the one sided diet in itself and fluctuating blood sugar levels amongst a few other side effects of binging, purging or restricting. (Of course if you\u2019re morbidly obese that\u2019s different) It really helped me on my way to accepting and allowing myself to be at the weight I am. Once I\u2019ve figured this ED shit out my body will also adjust and I might even get back to my normal weight, but it takes time and I need to trust the process. Please pick recovery over your ED. Allow your body to be where it\u2019s at while you work on your mind.",

Medical confirmation and I could *feel* that I was not doing well. \n\nFor me, what works best (and i got about 6 weeks in with no issues before relapsing due to the holidays) is eating a lot of super healthy food and doing some amount of exercise. I think i initially gained a few pounds, because my body wasn't used to digesting, but then starting losing much more effectively than i was pre-recovery. \n\nMost of my dinners were a giant salads, lean protein, and some cooked vegetable, only limiting refined sugars and saturated fat, but not particularly strictly. I started integrating carbs (sweet potatoes, whole grains) once my workouts got more intense, and I could feel that I needed more energy. But generally, I find that working out (and by working out i mean i jog in front of the TV and sometimes do squats) and eating healthy foods helped eliminate the guilt trigger and \"purge\" response and also kept me from gaining while recovering.",
