  "selftext": "Title. I feel like my Bulimia has made me do some incredibly stupid irrational things but here are a few I'm struggling with that I am extremely embarrassed of. I decided to post this because I'm hoping that someone can relate so I don't feel like a complete idiot.\nHere goes: \n\n- ate from the actual bins at my work regularly before I took them out. \n\n- Stolen a lot of food from work. \n\n- snapped at a girl in my class who tried to talk to me. I just said something aggressive like \"piss off!\" For no other reason than I've noticed she's been losing weight and that makes me angry. \n\n- I have also obsessively been staring at her body to a point where I'm excited to see her in class - I am a straight woman. I just want so badly to know how she lost the weight, but of course I'll never ask her. I have also secretly hoped she has an ED because somehow it's so hard to fathom someone losing weight healthily while I am this miserable. I cry from guilt often about this. \n\n- stolen other people's lunches at school (I feel incredibly guilty about this one) \n\n- hidden food/plates under my bed to the point it starts rotting. \n\n- the sound of chewing makes me extremely angry to the point of tears. Even when they're not being that loud - if they're eating and I'm not I feel like I can hear it. \n\n- I always make eating a competition. I hate finishing my food first so I purposefully eat slower and take smaller bites. I'm worried I'll hear people chewing if I finish too quickly or that I'll be jealous of their food (what does this even mean!?) \n\n- When someone is eating and I'm not, I feel sad. Even when I'm not even hungry and they are. \n\n- every time I have the urge to binge and don't - I feel like I'm owed a B/P session later on. This is even if I replace the binge with a healthy meal with great macros. \n\n- Constantly on dating apps. No intention of actually going on a date - but I crave validation so badly. \n\n- Purged. Eaten. Purged again. \n\n- Stolen money from my parents so I can buy binge food. \n\nThis is all I can think of as I'm writing. I'm very scared to post this because I'm honestly so embarrassed but I need to get it off my chest somehow. I don't want anyone to think that I don't feel guilty for every single one of these, because I do. I know how morally wrong it is and I wish I could take it back/stop. \n\nHere's to hoping someone can read this today and feel not so alone by something bad their ED has made them do.",

Purged when out on dates and other events like birthdays, funerals, a wedding too. Almost reate vomit to throw up again but managed to resist that. Eaten undercooked food, rotten food, wasted soooo much money, gotten irrationally angry when someone asked if they could have one of my biscuits during a semi-public binge and, when I was with my ex who was aware of my ED, I screamed and broke down when he stood in front of the bathroom door to stop me from purging. So ashamed of it all plus more",

I'd fill an entire bathroom trashcan and hide it in the shower to either  slowly flush over the course of a day or throw it out in the tall grass. I'm pretty sure our bi-monthly house cleaner saw it a couple times. \n\nat one point I was giving myself vitamin shots and developed a pilonidal cyst. doctors wouldn't help so it busted on its own. most painful thing ever. I didn't know the shots were causing it so it kept happening until I had a fairly intensive surgery. so many people saw my asshole that year. my doctor was super hot and I went to elementary school with my nurse. oh and the wound wouldn't close so I had a gaping wound above my asshole for 4 months. \n\nI once flooded the only toilet at a buffet. I made a swift exit and never went back. \n\nI've purged into a cup while driving, not caring that others could see me. \n\nany purge in a public restroom was humiliating.",

I\u2019ll share a few:\n- drank water from a public toilet when I couldn\u2019t purge cause it was too dry \n\n- purged in bags and kept them in my closet till garbage day\n\n- stayed home from important events to b/p\n\n- ate from the garbage\n\n- spent $$$ on food to just b/p over paying my bills \n\n- left work to b/p\n\nSo you\u2019re not alone.
