Only if you try to face it, it will show its true face, so to speak.\nBesides that. ALL problematic ways to eat or loose weight can be considered eating disorders. People having it worse is not a reason to de-valuate your own feelings. There is a good reason for there being no actual \"bar\" for serious or not-serious eating disorder. I don't have a great way with words Today... but I hope it's clear what I mean.",

I didn\u2019t take it seriously until after 8 years of sometimes multiple daily binging and purging because I told myself I was faking it or doing it for attention (although I never told anybody lol).  It was just the ED trying to keep me sick and in denial. I also did the same in alcoholism, it\u2019s just the immediate voice that makes me spiral and my brain knows it so uses it a lot.",
