      "body": "yeah i'm dealing with the same thing, of not being able to eat outside of b/ping. like i cant even put into words how much i wish i could have like, a goddamn vegetable. my body needs that so bad. or like a nice hot well balanced meal that i could let sit in my stomach and feel comfortably full and okay. but irl in that situation when i try to make that happen it just ends in me b/ping unless it's some stupid bullshit like my no sugar added popsicles or a bodyarmor lyte drink or something. i'm trying to re introduce my other old safe foods but it's so hard, because anything that tastes like remotely actually good and/or is slightly solid or substantive is a bad trigger, but if i can't have anything tasty or nutritious then it's like why am i even trying idk. very frustrating <3",
