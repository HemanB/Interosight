(Noo I\u2019ve never tried that \ud83d\ude44)\n\nYou need to be independent/have a job like ~moi~ to be bulimic, otherwise you\u2019re just selfish and hurting your parents financially (like I chose this)\n\nBulimics make no sense (duh that\u2019s why it\u2019s a mental disorder. )\n\nYou\u2019re just bored with your life.",

So I would stop talking to them about your struggles and find better people to help you.\n\nYou are valid, it's tough and difficult. But you are valid for your struggles. And it's okay.",

Tell her not to talk to you about bulimia until she educates herself on it. Her 'expertise' is a mix of misconceptions, unqualified opinions and compete lack of empathy. If she is not interested in educating herself (by looking up reliable sources) tell her to go ahead and keep her opinions to herself.",
