I\u2019m starting this thread both to get it off my chest in this week\u2019s attempt to stop the cycle and if anyone ever reads it after feeling shame and guilt - just know you\u2019re not alone. \n\n\nGoing through my vomit and smelling it to see what came up xoxo \n\nPurging at my 86 year old grandmothers house \n\nGoing to the toilet if u know what I mean while still eating at the same time because I physically couldn\u2019t stop myself from putting the food in my mouth \n\nEating from the trash in my house \n\nContemplating taking a trash bag full of binge food out of the big ass cans outside my building \n\nPouring fairy liquid over the rest of my binge food to stop myself from eating it and eating it anyway \n\nPurging into a trash can in my room while my friend was sleeping over \n\nSpending my literal savings on binge food \n\nDebating taking out a small LOAN to sustain my life and bingeing \n\nStealing \n\nLying to everyone around me to get money that I then spent on food\n\nPurging food my family cooked for me \n\nPurging at airports & in airplanes\n\nSpending money I got from my family for some occasion on binge food \n\nPurging my graduation celebration dinner \n\nPurging a Michelin star 5 course meal. Twice. Once to celebrate something and the other time it was a gift from the company I work at \n\nEating literally ingredients not even food. Butter, cream, etc. \n\n\nIdk if I can think of any more but I\u2019ve purged blood before, thought I was having a heart attack, the whole 9 yards. I have promised myself time and time again that today will be the last day but the guilt and shame I feel and the self hatred I have towards myself if I\u2019m bloated or something is just insane. It\u2019s preventing me from stopping the cycle and getting better. I love fitness & bodybuilding but am completely incapable of achieving any of my goals at the minute. \n\nWriting this today so far I got halfway through the day after a particularly bad and long cycle of daily multiple times purging. Any tips on how to stop always welcome. Hope it gets better for me and u too",

They were just desperate not to fuck w the septic tank again. When they realized I filled up those holes way too fast they told me to find another way, so I bought those huge Tupperware containers people use for Christmas decorations & started filling those up and dumping them on country roads or dumpsters. It got all over my car\u2019s upholstery and I had to rip out the trunk lining. Purging in the trash cans at home was a bust btw - we got maggots and they were way too heavy, we were warned by the trash company.\n\nDuring this time I\u2019d also dumpster dive and eat basically rotten food, or big bags of old donuts with cigarette butts in them. The cops caught me doing that lol & I got interrogated behind a Brookshire\u2019s. Of course I shoplifted but that wasn\u2019t gross just a little embarrassing. Only got caught once & played stupid to get away with it. \n\nI worked at a skilled nursing facility and would eat the leftovers from residents\u2019 meal trays.

The one that makes me feel the worst though is that I binged and purged at my cousin's Quince\u00f1era. My family isn't rich by any means, but they saved up to rent a hall, got caterers, a custom cake, and a photo both and what did I do? I binged, took laxatives because I didn't want what I was doing to be too obvious, and almost shit myself on the dance floor multiple times. I had a great time, it was the happiest I'd been in years, but intrusive thoughts gotta be intrusive I guess :/",

I keep ordering doordash even though I'm in credit card debt. \n\nI used to say that I'll \"go for a walk\" just to go into the woods near my old house so I could go purge. At our cabin I would just go in the backyard and purge in some bushes. \n\nI've eaten and binged cakes or cupcakes that I had baked for parties or family events so I had to say I burnt them in the oven or something. \n\nThe list goes on.. all the lying.. there is just way too much.",

The one that makes me feel the worst though is that I binged and purged at my cousin's Quince\u00f1era. My family isn't rich by any means, but they saved up to rent a hall, got caterers, a custom cake, and a photo both and what did I do? I binged, took laxatives because I didn't want what I was doing to be too obvious, and almost shit myself on the dance floor multiple times.

The one that makes me feel the worst though is that I binged and purged at my cousin's Quince\u00f1era. My family isn't rich by any means, but they saved up to rent a hall, got caterers, a custom cake, and a photo both and what did I do? I binged, took laxatives because I didn't want what I was doing to be too obvious, and almost shit myself on the dance floor multiple times.
