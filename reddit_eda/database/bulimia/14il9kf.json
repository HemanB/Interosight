  "title": "8 days purge free!",
  "selftext": "I'm absolutely excited that I've gotten this far without purging already. It has been extremely hard, especially with almost daily binges and having to supress the need to vomit. My body image is so-so at the moment, but I know once I can control eating and consistently exercise and watch my body grow stronger again, it'll naturally even out.\n\n I've also not skipped any teeth care days (except one where I only brushed without doing the rest of my routine) which will hopefully sustain them after the damage bulimia caused. \n\nI've shared this with my boyfriend who is helping keep tabs on my ED. Hopefully, soon I'll be tracking binge free days!",

For my teeth care, I start with flossing,  then use a waterpik to get off any debris that's left sitting on top of my teeth, then I brush with sensitive tooth paste and apply GC tooth mousse plus to add an extra layer of protection. If you can't get your hands on it, just dont fully rinse your toothpaste after brushing. As for the last question, because I've gained a bit of weight, I can't really tell whether it's swelling or fat.",
