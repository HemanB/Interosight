  "selftext": "i never thought i\u2019d write this but maybe it can save someone else.\n\ni\u2019ve struggled with bulimia for years but was always \u201cfunctional\u201d\u2026 held jobs, went out, seemed \u201cokay.\u201d then last year i started ozempic i thought it was life changing at first. no more hunger, weight dropping, felt \u201cin control\u201d for once.\n\nbut deep down i knew it was masking, not healing. i stopped working on the actual bulimia. then when i had to stop ozempic (side effects, money, access whatever), it all came crashing down. the binges got 10x worse. my body was starved and panicked. it felt like i lost all control over food again, even worse than before.\n\nand now the worst part: i\u2019ve been diagnosed with fragile bones, like my bones are literally being eaten away. i\u2019m in constant pain. walking hurts. some days i can\u2019t get out of bed. i\u2019m 100% suicidal lately because i don\u2019t know how to live like this anymore.\n\nthis is the truth that nobody talks about. ozempic & GLP-1s can look like a magic fix but they will NOT heal your relationship with food or your body. in fact, if you\u2019re struggling with bulimia, they can make it worse in the long run. i wish someone had told me this.\n\nplease be careful. please try to heal the real problem. i wouldn\u2019t wish this on anyone. \ud83d\udc94\n",
