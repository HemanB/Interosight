Am I the only one like this? It\u2019s insane bc my binges are huge, like 2/3 kg worth of food and I feel so bad about wasting it all, food, money, everything goes down the drain. \nI can\u2019t control myself anymore, eating makes me feel so good and gives me comfort.\n\nIt\u2019s also embarrassing because I\u2019m almost everyday at the grocery store buying binge food, I don\u2019t even want to know what the people working there think about me every time they see me walking in the store, I\u2019m so ashamed but I can\u2019t stop.
