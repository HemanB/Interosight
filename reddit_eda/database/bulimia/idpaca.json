  "selftext": "**Probably trigger warning here**\n\nI love grocery shopping. Everything about it. This means my kitchen is full of like everything I could ever want. It's so stupid! I wouldn't have all this shit to eat then purge if I didn't have it all right there in my face.\n\nBut like the whole thing of having the list, checking sale flyers, checking things off the list as I go, finding really cool items that my inner self wants to eat (I'm vegan and it's a blessing and a curse that there are soooo many amazing products out there these days) and like come home and find room for it all in the already-full fridge and freezer..\n\n..Then just spend every day staring at the packaging and wanting to eat so many things, talking myself out of it, eventually giving in to some things and having to get rid of it, then of course still feeling bad about eating it in the first place. The whole cycle is so annoying and I can't even binge as much as I would like to cause that too-full feeling happens crazy fast now.\n\nSorry I'm just sitting here trying to understand why I do this. Maybe like, buying the items fulfills part of the craving in the first place? But then it's actually in my house and I have to live with it all.\n\nI'm gonna try really hard to make a conscious effort to buy less stuff.\n\nIs anyone else like this with the grocery shopping?",

      "body": "I do this. Sometimes, and this is weird, I make two lists. One of shit I actually want to buy and one fake list. Shit I \"want\" but don't actually want to have in my house. Cherry tomatoes and avocado? Real list. S'mores Poptarts and tortilla chips? Fake list. Sushi rice and cucumber? Real list. Ben & Jerry's and sour patch kids? Fake list. I find the food, look at it, touch it, cross it off the list, and don't put it in my cart. It's the public version of c/s. It's not as satisfying as buying all the junk just like c/s isn't as satisfying as b/p but it feels less like denial than just pretending I don't want it. That vegan Ben and Jerrys hits perfect tho, and it's made the jump from fake list to real list more than once.",

They last months in the freezer.\n\nRight now I have a freezer full of sandwiches but I refuse to eat solid food most days. I just keep hoarding food I'll never eat, because part of my brain screams to hold on to it in case I ever ran out of money, but when I'm hungry I feel like I don't deserve it, so sometimes I just find myself crying in front of a mountain of breakfast sandwiches.",

I only go into the kitchen at 4am because of severe anxiety (and most of the times I'm asleep) so I put stuff like pasta and things that have to be cooked in there. It's a bit annoying never being able to grocery shop for the week, and most of the time I'm just eating porridge all day because I don't wanna go out, but I'm trying to recover and this is what works for me.",

I was spending upwards of $250 a week on food (for my bf as well) and I just can\u2019t afford that. Trying to cut that in half now...not entirely successful, but hopefully I\u2019ll get there eventually. I like the other redditors comment where they had a real vs. fake list, I wonder if that would be satisfying at all.",

Also these vegan mini blueberry muffins were on a BOGO sale, a friggin BOGO sale, I picked up a box and was like \"am I really gonna make myself eat all these damn muffins in the next two days\" and put it back. Phew. I only got one \"bad\" thing which was refrigerated cookie dough, but it's refrigerated so it can stay there for a while.\n\nI tried to focus more on food for my kid, that actually helped cause I get the joy of buying but also the joy of it being stuff I'm not tempted to eat myself so a win-win. (Cause I feed her healthy, while I like to eat mostly garbage lol. Well not garbage but a lot of stuff I wouldn't let her eat anytime soon)",
