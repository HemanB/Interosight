  "selftext": "I used to have bulimia. I once in a few years might experience an episode. But it would take a lot. This is a tale of recovery and regression. It is an incredibly long story, frankly I do not have the energy to explain all of the details. It is a sad day for me, I am in the US. I recently found out my daughter has bulimia. I struggled with bulimia from 14-19. I was a long distance runner who had a twin (also long distance runner). We were extremely competitive, to the point it makes me sick now. She remained in denial about how dangerous it was, while I tried to get better. She's dead now, and I was pregnant with my daughter when she died. I swore to myself it would never happen to her, but the comments I made about my body the poor relationship with food, personal appearance, excellence & success, my family's weird relationship with womanhood and sensuality it was all related and it is coming to a head. I have not been on this sub very long but I am so deeply sad for all of us. If I can give any reassurance to anyone just know recovery is possible but you will have to change completely. You need to realize that whatever happens, whatever you think looking good will accomplish it is no comparison to finally be free of this. Please realize how dangerous this is & how valuable you all are intrinsically. You might not see it now, but there is a different version of you out there that isn't scared to eat and that actually feels good.",
