  "selftext": "This might sound weird but while purging, when i look in the bathroom mirror i feel more pretty. Like when i cry and look in the mirror its like that. My eyes are glassy, cheeks and lips puffy, whole face blushy\u2026 and then this good feeling in the gut. idk, but it makes me feel much better. Well yes, i feel a bit disgusting sometimes while purging, but i also like it sometimes. this sounds super weird and gross but i always used to \u201eromanticize\u201c vomiting/feeling sick, in like movies, etc. Can anybody relate or am i just being crazy and gross",
