I always go straight to the fridge to see if they left anything, straight to the room service containers to see if there is an uneaten dessert, sometimes I go through the trash and eat food that has sat out all night and has bites out of it. I am so ashamed of myself for it, but I can't stop doing it, sometimes I look forward to it. \n\nAnyone else do things they would never tell those who don't understand?",
