  "selftext": "i relapsed today because i hated the way i look a lot more than usual. the food didnt taste that good tbh, i was more looking forward to the throwing up part, food lost its taste over time. i just hate myself, theres no one thing that i like about me, even the things people consider positive, theres a burning rage in me and i feel the hurt every waking moment.\n\n\n i hate being around people, hate knowing that they know i exist. but binging and throwing up soothes me so much. the feeling of the pressure in my stomach dropping as i throw up is euphoric. it is literally the relief im seeking. the lightheadedness and tiredness too. theres nothing like it and i wish i didnt have a job or college to attend so i could just do that all day. im so tired of trying to be my best and never feeling anything except disappointment. bulimia is my way of accepting im worthless and essentially acting out my disgust. honestly im heartbroken rn im so sorry guys\n\nedit: i also wanna say thank you to everyone to made this community exist, everyone whos here supporting me and others in this struggle. i didnt have anyone to talk to and yall made me feel better ",
