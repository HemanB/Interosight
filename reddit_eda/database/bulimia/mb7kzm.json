This is important to not feel deprived and if anything you have to make yourself feel full and satiated. And I definitely don\u2019t recommend it unless you have good health and no familial kidney problems. \n\nSo I would reset my sugar urges by eating lots and lots of my favorite proteins. A lot of it, until I was full and couldn\u2019t even think of eating sugary foods. Veggies as well, mostly broccoli and cauliflower for the fiber and bulk. But I ate til I was stuffed. Chicken, steak, fish, pork, and low carb vegetables. \n\nUltimately I didn\u2019t eat enough calories to gain weight like I was when I binged sugar, but the filling nature of the protein heavy, low carb diet got me through the sugar cravings until they subsided (for me it ranges from 3-8 days of sugar cravings). Any time I craved sugar I reached for low carb food like chicken breast and greens, steak and eggs, pork chops - but nothing with sugar substitutes either. Just whole natural (as can be) foods on the savory/salty side of taste. \n\nThese cravings should be treated as an addiction, as really for some people it\u2019s just as bad as other substances.

      "body": "\\*Warning long post\\* This is extremely common and I find sugar to be a huge trigger for me too. I have completely stopped eating sugar because I get an immediate ED response to binge. There are some practical things you can do here in order to break this cycle. Structured Eating, Eat balanced Meals and Accept Delay Distract are from the book 'The Bulimia Help Method' by Ali Kerr & Richard Kerr. This book is a great resource and I highly recommend it.\n\n1. **Reach out.** This is one of the most important parts of recovery. If you don't have a therapist, dietician or coach, I highly recommend seeking professional help. You can recover on your own but if you have support it makes the process so much easier and you feel less alone. If professional help isn't an option then lean on someone you trust who you can contact when you are feeling urges or when you are trying to distract yourself. I'm connecting with my Mom at meals so that I don't binge and purge and it's been very helpful.\n2. **Remove the triggers**. If you find you are out of control around sugar, or any other triggering foods, it's ok to acknowledge this and temporarily stop eating/buying them. Keep them out of sight or better yet, don't buy them. If you order from food apps, delete those apps. Put as much friction between you and the behavior as possible. If you tend to drive to the store to buy binge food, put your keys in an obscure location so that you have to think about what you're doing before you act.\n3. **Structured eating**. Three meals and three snacks a day, no more than three hours apart. Retrain your mind and body to expect food often and regularly. This stabilizes blood sugar and reduces instances of binge urges. When you are well nourished, your body and mind don't have to send out signals to binge. If you are worried about weight gain, keep in mind that eating regularly is one of the best things you can do to maintain a healthy weight as it is a massive boost to your metabolism.\n4.  **Eat balanced meals**. Eat regular meals and snacks made up from fats, proteins and        complex carbohydrates. This will help to stabilize erratic blood sugar levels and in turn reducing those binge urges. I find sticking to whole, mostly unprocessed, low sugar, foods reduces my urge to binge. Nobody really wants to binge on strawberries but strawberry ice-cream is easy to binge on. Pick foods that feel safe to you and the least triggering.\n5. **Accept Delay Distract.** We can't control the fact that we get binge urges because of how our brains are wired to do this behavior. We can control how we respond to those urges. Accept the urge and remind yourself that the binge urge cannot control you, it is not dangerous and does not have to be fought.Delay taking any action towards your urge for 10 minutes and allow the urge to rise and fall. Distract yourself for those 10 minutes. Go for a walk, go for a drive, have a bath, talk to a friend, listen to music, immerse yourself in a project, work or play on your computer. Anything to distract you from those urges will help.\n\nI know how helpless and miserable you can feel in a binge/purge cycle. You are not alone and so many people are going through this right now. I hope even a little of this information was helpful and I'm sending lots of love and support your way \u2764\ufe0f",

This is important to not feel deprived and if anything you have to make yourself feel full and satiated. And I definitely don\u2019t recommend it unless you have good health and no familial kidney problems. \n\nSo I would reset my sugar urges by eating lots and lots of my favorite proteins. A lot of it, until I was full and couldn\u2019t even think of eating sugary foods. Veggies as well, mostly broccoli and cauliflower for the fiber and bulk. But I ate til I was stuffed. Chicken, steak, fish, pork, and low carb vegetables. \n\nUltimately I didn\u2019t eat enough calories to gain weight like I was when I binged sugar, but the filling nature of the protein heavy, low carb diet got me through the sugar cravings until they subsided (for me it ranges from 3-8 days of sugar cravings). Any time I craved sugar I reached for low carb food like chicken breast and greens, steak and eggs, pork chops - but nothing with sugar substitutes either. Just whole natural (as can be) foods on the savory/salty side of taste. \n\nThese cravings should be treated as an addiction, as really for some people it\u2019s just as bad as other substances. There might be better, healthier ways. I\u2019m positive there are. But this is the way it works for me and may work for others, particularly if you\u2019re okay with eating lots of meat LOL.\n\nAnd as far as health goes, I\u2019ve had blood work done before and after these resets and never had an issue with any analytes.",

I then back her all the candy(which was a ton) that I had just bought, as well as all the boxes of Girl Scout cookies and made her take them away and hide them from me. I find this has helped me. Last night I had a late night urge to binge take over me, abs I was like ohh I\u2019ll just have 3 thin mints, and went to get them only to remember they are locked up hidden somewhere in her room. So it paid off and prevented me from eating them (which I for sure would have eaten WAY more than 3). But I suggest doing the same abs giving all your bad triggering treats to someone. Or just straight up throwing them out. It\u2019s not a perfect solution, but hey, were all just humans doing the best we can:)",

          "body": "\\*Warning long post\\* This is extremely common and I find sugar to be a huge trigger for me too. I have completely stopped eating sugar because I get an immediate ED response to binge. There are some practical things you can do here in order to break this cycle. Structured Eating, Eat balanced Meals and Accept Delay Distract are from the book 'The Bulimia Help Method' by Ali Kerr & Richard Kerr. This book is a great resource and I highly recommend it.\n\n1. **Reach out.** This is one of the most important parts of recovery. If you don't have a therapist, dietician or coach, I highly recommend seeking professional help. You can recover on your own but if you have support it makes the process so much easier and you feel less alone. If professional help isn't an option then lean on someone you trust who you can contact when you are feeling urges or when you are trying to distract yourself. I'm connecting with my Mom at meals so that I don't binge and purge and it's been very helpful.\n2. **Remove the triggers**. If you find you are out of control around sugar, or any other triggering foods, it's ok to acknowledge this and temporarily stop eating/buying them. Keep them out of sight or better yet, don't buy them. If you order from food apps, delete those apps. Put as much friction between you and the behavior as possible. If you tend to drive to the store to buy binge food, put your keys in an obscure location so that you have to think about what you're doing before you act.\n3. **Structured eating**. Three meals and three snacks a day, no more than three hours apart. Retrain your mind and body to expect food often and regularly. This stabilizes blood sugar and reduces instances of binge urges. When you are well nourished, your body and mind don't have to send out signals to binge. If you are worried about weight gain, keep in mind that eating regularly is one of the best things you can do to maintain a healthy weight as it is a massive boost to your metabolism.\n4.  **Eat balanced meals**. Eat regular meals and snacks made up from fats, proteins and        complex carbohydrates. This will help to stabilize erratic blood sugar levels and in turn reducing those binge urges. I find sticking to whole, mostly unprocessed, low sugar, foods reduces my urge to binge. Nobody really wants to binge on strawberries but strawberry ice-cream is easy to binge on. Pick foods that feel safe to you and the least triggering.\n5. **Accept Delay Distract.** We can't control the fact that we get binge urges because of how our brains are wired to do this behavior. We can control how we respond to those urges. Accept the urge and remind yourself that the binge urge cannot control you, it is not dangerous and does not have to be fought.Delay taking any action towards your urge for 10 minutes and allow the urge to rise and fall. Distract yourself for those 10 minutes. Go for a walk, go for a drive, have a bath, talk to a friend, listen to music, immerse yourself in a project, work or play on your computer. Anything to distract you from those urges will help.\n\nI know how helpless and miserable you can feel in a binge/purge cycle. You are not alone and so many people are going through this right now. I hope even a little of this information was helpful and I'm sending lots of love and support your way \u2764\ufe0f",
