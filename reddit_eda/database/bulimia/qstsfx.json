My parents would constantly make me feel guilty for not wanting to eat with them any day of the week not just thanksgiving. They knew about my ED but still found a way to take it personally when I didn\u2019t want to go into a triggering situation. \n\nI\u2019ve actually started skipping the cooking, day grazing, and big meal part of Thanksgiving. I show up towards the end and have a normal amount of food and play card games. \n\nI know it\u2019s easier said than done but since I\u2019ve started being open with the people who need to know (and reminded them many times) then I\u2019ve started receiving the support and acceptance to skip out or arrive late. \n\nYou can always DM me if you have any questions or need support. It is VERY difficult at first and you will be misunderstood, people will be upset, people will push. You just have to learn that your well being depends on you pushing back.",
