  "selftext": "What I mean is that I feel like no matter what I'm always gonna be in the clutches of my bulimia. Even if I'm not super focused on my weight or food, it's just my ingrained habits and unintended thoughts. \nI've been in recovery for about 3-4 months now, and I'm doing so much better mentally than I was at my lowest, and I domt wanna go back to the worst of my disorder.\nBut I won't lie and say that I don't completely miss the days where i was hyper focused on my ED , and every now and then still I'll have a planned binge/purge. \nMostly I do it randomly when I get stressed/overwhelmed, so I'll pull out a bowl of icecream or sweets and purge them all within an hour. \nIt hurts to do it but still it does give me that same relief feeling and high when I was actively puring almost everyday.  But I know that currently I'm \"recovering\" but honestly I feel like bulimia is never gonna fully leave my life. Just always subconsciously I feel like it's always gonna be there when food is present or not. I just had too vent this out, still recovering is challenge but I know it's possible.",

I\u2019ve gotten a LOT better the past 3 ish months and by that I mean purging only 1-2 times a week when before it was daily or 2x a day (I got a lot of help from recovery books/reading about nutrition). My triggers are definitely drinking. When I drink I over eat and then it\u2019s soooo easy to purge while drunk. The weeks I don\u2019t drink I don\u2019t over eat and avoid that shit but that\u2019s another addiction I have to deal with. I\u2019m getting better but that sweet relief is a high like no other. It doesn\u2019t help that even though I work my ass off at the gym I still feel stuck despite being stronger.",

Same with smoking or drinking I can let those things go when I want, I feel in control in that regard. But yeah the bulimia is something different, I feel like it controls me still. Its so difficult especially since food is always forever gonna be apart your life, but we can minimize the purging and unhealthy thoughts with time and motivation.",
