      "body": "Definitely it made life really hard. I would go to the grocery store and my eyes would always start watering because I felt like everyone was staring at me and judging me and I was so close to crying. It SUCKED and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with this anxiety. Ultimately what helped was better medication for my anxiety, ketamine treatments and emdr therapy but in the short term, baggy clothes I felt comfortable/hidden in, and going somewhere that wouldn\u2019t have people I know and just reminding myself that I didn\u2019t exist to these people any more than they did to me. And if I had to be around people I know/working etc I would wear clothes I was reasonably comfortable, not make eye contact, and basically disassociate tbh. Good luck my friend",

Idk it\u2019s hard to give advice for this because i think all of us on here are very judgemental to ourselves and it\u2019s hard to just get over that feeling. Maybe for short term fixes you may feel more comfortable going out wearing baggier clothes for example? I know i myself feel more comfortable during the fall and winter because i can wear more clothes and feel more hidden.",
