  "selftext": "Kinda embarrassing moment. Went out to dinner with my family, ordered/ate too much, and purged in the restaurant/bar bathroom. Two people came in the bathroom and although I tried to be quiet, they asked if I was ok and if I needed crackers or sprite. I said no and waited until they left, but was so ashamed. I\u2019ve never been caught purging in public before. I\u2019m sure they just thought I had too much to drink, but I\u2019m still embarrassed. What do you say to people? Has this ever happened to anyone? I feel so alone.",

They asked if whoever was in the next stall was okay, and then they realized it was me. Some of them knew I had \"food issues\" so it was obvious I was purging. Super embarrassing to walk back out to the party afterward and see them.",
