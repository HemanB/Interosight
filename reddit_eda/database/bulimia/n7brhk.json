There was so much grief from childhood  and adult trauma(s)  I hadn't processed despite years in therapy.  I kept getting injured (thanks to overexercising) and the self hatred was at an all time high.  A bad sports injury forced me to rest (along with COVID lockdown) and that's when the shit got real.  I couldn't run or starve or purge the pain away.  I finally broke and that's when the healing began.  So I truly believe it's never too late to heal.  Life on the other side of bulimia may be so amazing for you, but you'll never know if you aren't here anymore.   The depression started to lift with the right medication and with proper fueling of my body. You are so worth a happy life free of bingeing.",

      "body": "I gave therapy one last try at your age and it stuck. Looking back, I think being exhausted and knowing anything would be better than keeping on with what I was doing was part of the reason it did (I'm 72 now.) My last therapist specialized in ED and she sent me to an intuitive eating oriented RD, who is the person who basically \"saved\" me. My RD believed so strongly that if I just stopped over and under feeding my body, it would settle at a weight I could be happy with that she convinced me. It was incredibly hard to give up diet culture but my weight did settle. I've been about 15/20 lbs over my \"ideal weight\" for about 25  years but I look like a normal person (you know, not a model or actress or very slim, but no one would say I'm \"fat.\"\n\nBut most importantly it worked because I was willing to try anything, I did what she wanted: I ate all the ice cream and pizza for months till my body believed that I wouldn't put it on another diet or make myself throw up. And somehow, miraculously, the need to binge and purge lifted and then food became something to nourish myself with 3 times a day and I started to be interested in other things. Things I had been interested in during early adolescence, before I went on that first diet. It was like growing up again, finding out what I really wanted and starting to do those things instead of stuffing myself or dieting. \n\nRegarding depression, I can share that I come from a line of depressed women. I think the depression leads to bad self image and that contributes to the tendency to have ED. A few times when I was on Prozac or Paxil bulimia went away but it always came back when I went off because I couldn't handle other side effects. My last therapy was without drugs.\n\nDon't give up on yourself; life can get better. I went to lots of therapy and, looking back, most of the therapists didn't help me because of the chemistry between us. It has to be right. They have to \"get\" you. Keep trying to find the people who can help you fix yourself.",

      "body": "I'm 43 and developed an eating disorder (anorexia first, which then morphed into bulimia and stayed there for a decade) when I was 30. I relate to this post so hard, my friend. I've gotten much better about the behaviors, but the thoughts have been almost impossible to drive out.\n\nOver the past month and a half, however, I've made vast improvement after I read the book {\"Bright Line Eating\" by Susan Pierce Thompson.} I detest self help books and their smug, empty cliches, but this book was written by a neuroscientist who backed her theories up with data and it *clicked.* (I tried to have a bot give you a summary of the book, hopefully it worked.) She doesn't talk about calories or anything that triggered me, either. The idea is pretty simple, and it sounded like something I could actually do. And I was so fucking ready.\n\nFor thirteen fucking years, I have **hated** myself every single time I've put a bite of food in my mouth, and I've struggled with the same chicken/egg question about depression and bulimia. But I've been doing this program and those thoughts are much, much more quiet. Now when I make my meals I'm not telling myself what a fat, disgusting pig I am and worried about how I'm going to react after I'm done eating and fighting off urges to self harm and shit. I know my diet is okay, I know why I'm eating the foods I'm eating, and I'm actually able to enjoy eating sometimes.\n\nI've been meaning to make a post about the book here, but I'm always worried about accidentally harming someone with my recommendation. For example, there **are** ways that you could use this program for disordered ends if your commitment to recovery isn't quite there yet. If you care to inbox me, I'd love to talk further with you. It's difficult to find someone in my age group who is affected by this shit, and it sounds like we have some things in common. Feel free to hit me up any time. Just keep putting one foot in front of the other. Sometimes that's what success looks like. Take care.",
