  "selftext": "I've been bullemic for ages, but it's mainly the purging to me, a binge is eating an amount if food a normal person would at a meal time.\nI don't eat much at all, but when I do most of the time I purge because I feel guilty for eating anything at all.\n\nIf I snack on pretzels, and have a piece or two of chocolate, then eat a meal(a smaller portion size than my much smaller partner) then I feel like I have to purge.\n\nI used to binge a little more, I'd eat a little over \"normal\" and feel so bad I'd purge.\n\nBut now I barely eat, but still feel like I have to purge for eating anything at all.\nI end up having protein mix and almond milk to make sure my body dies, but most days I don't keep down really any food at all.\n\nIt's hell on my body but I don't know how to stop. I don't feel I deserve to eat. I feel so fat and disgusting even though I lost 40lbs from stress a year ago and the only weight I gained back was 5-10lbs that I lost when I was so sick I literally couldn't eat for weeks from GI system inflammation.\n\nI know I'm ruining my body. But am I even bulle.ic if i don't really binge? I'm not anorexic because I do eat some(much less than normal but still) but it just comes up so I feel like I don't fit in any community.",

Years ago, I would eat 10,000+ on a binge, so this is a new phase that I find a lot more stressful honestly. I am way more preoccupied with regular food, and am realizing my \"safe list\" is about 4 items long. I can't afford treatment, or more so, I can't afford leaving my family and job for treatment. I feel completely stuck.",

In simple terms it means that you starve yourself often and when you do give in and eat you have the self control to not let yourself go into a full blown binge.

But I literally can't even stomach have one meal / feeling full at all. The only \"safe\" snacks are fruits or applesauce or smoothies as a meal. This is so unsustainable yet I don't see it changing for me.",
