  "title": "My child binged and purged on thanksgiving",
  "selftext": "I have a child who is 15. To my knowledge, she just began purging by forcing vomiting. I have had bulimia for 20 years. She has been living with her dad and stepmom (uh) since 2017. They are not bulimic. The stepmom encourages restricting and has used food as a control and shaming mechanism I\u2019ve grown to realize. Her stepmom is very thin without a curvy figure. My child grew more self conscious about having hips and a more full lower body. She is average weight, 130lbs at 5\u20193, athletic. I did not know she started purging until i saw it. Because im very familiar with the misery of the disease, I went to the bathroom. I should have hugged her and held her immediately. I was in shock and said the word purging to her. I did not want her to have that inner secret world about it (but i also know this is impossible because of fear and shame). \n\nI believe starting wrestling at school triggered the purging. She just joined and just started purging\u2026 and subsequent binging. \n\nI remember myself at her age. \n\nShe does not want me to talk to her dad. Not about this. Not really at all. \n\nMy mother is dramatizing it more and making it difficult to think this through rationally. \n\nI need helpful wisdom. Words to say, how to reach her, how to talk to the wrestlers and coach and school. I will even give a formal speech at the school about the disease, my experiences, emphasizing the importance of committing to recovery ASAP. \n\nShe is beautiful and bright and strong. She has social barriers that are partially in her mind and partially due to her fathers controlling nature. Her dad and stepmom revere and celebrate the biological child they had together who is now 6. They are neglecting my daughter and son. \n\nI am calling legal aid this week. I\u2019m not financially able to not work and focus solely on this but it\u2019s been all i can think about. \n\nHow do I talk with her? How does one find social support? \n\nShe spent $10 of her money on junk food and purged it. This is how the cycle with money and junk food starts. I need to become a stronger safety net. \n\nThe only reason my own ED has slowed is because my appetite and metabolism have slowed with age. I am 37. I remember high school feeling like a prison because of how public school is, and social dynamics such as other children and parents, and especially\u2026 pressure.\n\nShe needs a new counselor/therapist, but she needs healthy friends and attachments and to not be in the middle of custody \u201cbattle\u201d. She has been growing more ocd and perfectionistic. I think instagram is a trigger. Are there tools to teach a child how to navigate social media without being sucked in? \n\nI need to apply for grad school. I don\u2019t think treatment is the only way out because it didn\u2019t help me stop. I think being in nature or a new environment could help but am unsure. \n\nMy mom triggers me, because my mom was the first person in my life who was controlling about food and weight. I have never criticized my child\u2019s body. My mom criticized mine. So the hurt has to be from the stepmom and my ex (her dad). How do i protect her from these forces that seem overwhelming and all-powerful?",

I think hearing some of your experience ( not like, \"gory details\" lol, but what you shared here) could help her - no scare tactics, but you seem to have a lot of insight about how other people influence body image and self esteem and eating habits. Don't make anyone look like an enemy or bad guy, but help her recognize that outside influences can maybe make someone do stuff that isn't really them, or doesn't fit their values.\n\nWrestling seems to trigger a lot of people, I've read other histories here from wrestlers. Possibly she even learned it from that environment, it almost seems like \"common knowledge\" in some groups, including wrestlers. Social media probably is a trigger, would be surprised if it's not. And that's if she's avoiding the \"pro-ED\" and other body-focused influences.\n\n>She does not want me to talk to her dad. Not about this. Not really at all.\n\nYeah, and if that brings up some memories for you, or past anxieties, it makes sense that it could be hard to think straight about what to do. At the same time, she is a child, and your partner's child. He probably is owed a conversation. And unfortunately, there is a real risk of enabling when we agree to help someone hide or lie or avoid possible consequences of their actions. It can also send the message that she can kind of take control, control who knows, what they know - it all fits with a very, very common ED habit of \"Deny and conceal\". Like sure, a weekly therapy meeting might not solve the issue, and still the right thing to do doesn't involve lying and hiding, nor assuming the role of fixer/ caretaker/ therapist yourself. Your instinct is right probably that she needs more support, more positive social connection and options - it's too easy for someone to find an enabler and close off more and more, in which case you probably feel more and more helpless and enmeshed over time.
