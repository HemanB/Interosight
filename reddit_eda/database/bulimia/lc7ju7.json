  "selftext": "I am sixteen and I have been struggling with bulimia and  binge eating over the previous year or so.  I have been having  binge eating episodes  then abusing laxatives and going days with no eating  to try to compensate.  I had a massive binge today  and I realized how much harm I am doing to my health.  I am choosing to recover beginning now.  This  bingeing leaves me nauseous and in pain every time.  I am done.  I am ready to regain my life again.  I am posting this to help with staying accountable.  I could use some motivation or supportive words also.  Tomorrow is a new day  and I am ready to begin living again.",
