Just tonight some bad news got spread out, and I've had control all day, but I just lost it.\n\nNot only that that but I think I also use b/ping to cope in a weird way, for me- it's  the dopamine of eating so so much food, then the guilt, shame, and being so uncomfortably full that follows right after, then the relief/aftereffect of getting all that food back out, my brain tells me \"you fixed the problem, good job!\". Cause I can control what comes in and what comes out, not the problems happening around me. Almost like a weird sense of accomplishment ! :(",

      "body": "This is such a good question! Thanks for asking, because it offers me the time to really reflect.   \nI am 40 something and I have had various eating disorders since I was 15 yo.  When I started purging at 16 it was because I came from anorexia and was forced to begin eating and as I gained weight and had absolutely no support, I started to freak out. So the binges then were very different from the binges I have now, as my eating disorder has transformed over the years. When I was young I had small binges. I would almost call them subjective binges, not objective binges, i.e I ended up eating to more pieces of whatever I was eating, and then that was to more than what I had decided on, and that triggered me to purge. I was all about control and feeling like I could eat exactly what I set out to eat, not more. \n\nWhat triggers me to binge today mostly about how I feel in my body. If I look bloated (for example, if my face looks bloated) that can trigger a binge, since I know that purging reduces the bloat. Likewise, if I am constipated and feel bloated/full because of that, that can trigger me to binge, because in my experience binges can make me need to...well...poop. So binges today are very much about how I feel inside my body. It\u00b4s an internal trigger, it is not triggered by anything inside me.\n\nBut of course, sometimes there are outer triggers too. A huge trigger for me is a feeling of not being in control/that my living situation is unpredictable. For example, right now I am not in control of wheter I will get access to care for my adhd and autism, and that feels overwhelming and scary. That has triggered me to binge many times. Likewise, I am in a situation at my job that is really difficult, given that I have been on sick leave for so long and now I am about to end up on social welfare because I don\u00b4t function at all. The thought of how this will end for me can also trigger me to binge. \n\nTo me, bingeing and then purging is much like you describe how it is for you, but I will add that it is also a form of purification. What I mean by that is it is almost as if I am eating the problem and then purging it out of me, and this gives me some breating room from the mental chatter. \n\nAlso, sometimes I binge and purge in order to go to sleep. If I feel to full or my stomach hurts late at night, binge and then purge and that solves the stomach pain and the feeling of fullness and so I am able to go to sleep because I don\u00b4t have those things nagging me. I binge and purge almost every night, because of this. I can\u00b4t stand the feeling of being full before going to bed. I need emptyness and control so that I can meet the next day as a blanc sheet, not a \"full and dirty\" sheet. I know it sounds funny. I guess I\u00b4m really weird.",

          "body": "Nothing. It's an emotionless ritual for me. In the beginning, when I started bingeing and then eventually purging as well, it was probably my body's reaction to starving it. That was several decades ago (my ED began at 14; I'm 40 now). So I did it out of hunger. My original diagnosis of AN-R became AN-b/p and the bingeing and purging part just became... Something I Do. Usually every night before I go to sleep, unless I'm feeling really medically unstable or I'm randomly sick (like the flu or something unrelated to my ED). The longest I've gone without doing it is about six months, 20 years ago, after I spent a while in hospital because I was critically ill and very underweight, and I was scared and giving recovery a genuine attempt for a while.\n\nAnyway. It's pretty much always the same foods in the exact same order every time I do it. I mean, they change here and there over time, but I go months and sometimes years bingeing on more or less the same stuff. I kind of suspect the way I binge and purge is related to my OCD and autism, I'm a pretty rigid/routinised person in general, so. But yeah, there's no trigger. It's not spontaneous and it's as unemotional as taking a shower every day. Occasionally I have what I think of as 'bad days' where I let things get away from me and I just can't stop and end up doing it for hours on end and feel really out of control... that happens more when I'm overwhelmed and exhausted with life stuff, and I think it's how I just totally mentally check out for a while... but that's the closest I can think of to having a trigger.",
