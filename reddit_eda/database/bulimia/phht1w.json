      "body": "One of the things I did in recovery was journal.  About everything. How i felt before a binge and after etc.  It didn't stop the behavior but it did help me identify the feelings that may have triggered the episodes.\n\nMy therapist had me do an exercise called  \"The worst day with my ED\".  I wrote about a day that I felt was one of my worst.  For some reason it helped to write it down and then share it with my therapist.   I felt such shame but as I read it aloud I also felt this overwhelming compassion towards myself.  If a friend or someone had shared this kind of entry with me I would have felt that compassion to them so why not also apply it to myself.  \n\nHang in there.",
