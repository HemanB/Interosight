      "body": "I\u2019ve got some lesser known ones for you. Bulimic of 17 years.\n\n1) [hiatal hernia](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hiatal-hernia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373379?utm_source=Google&utm_medium=abstract&utm_content=Hiatal-hernia&utm_campaign=Knowledge-panel), which is where your stomach pushes through the diaphragm, can cause food and stomach acid to push back into your esophagus. Severe ones require surgery.\n\n2) my digestive system is FUCKED. It takes way too long to digest my food now- like, food will stay in my stomach for hours longer than it\u2019s supposed to. Every. Single. Time. I eat, I get gas and stomach cramps. Literally every time. It\u2019s uncomfortable and embarrassing af in public, so I always try to be alone after I eat. \n\n3) I have a permanent bump on the hand I use to purge with. Like, under my skin, on my bone. I had a scar there for years until I learned to purge without hitting it, but the bump has remained.\n\n4) sometimes I\u2019ll hiccup and just like.. slightly vomit into my mouth a bit. I carry gum for this reason. Nothing like surprise puke breath.\n\n5) random constipation and bloating. Even if I\u2019m eating enough that I should be going regularly (like, a massive salad), my body will sometimes decide to just.. not go for a few days. It\u2019s really uncomfortable.\n\n6) heart arrhythmia, which scares the shit out of me. For no apparent reason (like, I\u2019m taking vitamin supplements, electrolytes, drinking a shot ton of water), my heart will start messing up. It will suddenly race (~130 bpm), or I\u2019ll have double beats (normal heart rate, but every other beat will be double), or it will skip beats or have random super weak, fluttery beats. It\u2019s super scary when it happens, and everything feels intensely wrong.\n\n7) vitamin deficiencies. I have to keep really on top of my vitamins, and I\u2019m aware of all the specific symptoms for particular vitamins. For instance: I recently developed cracks in the corners of my mouth, which was from a lack of B-vitamins. \n\n8) edema. You want sudden swelling of your ankles, toes, and fingers? You got it. Let\u2019s go, body dysmorphia. \n\n9) you know what\u2019s not fun? Insomnia. You know what bulimia can cause? Insomnia.\n\n10) I know people have said enamel erosion, but with this comes cavities and putting of your teeth, which are super scary.\n\n11) not a physical side effect, but MONEY. Bulimia is fucking expensive, especially with the price of food now. I\u2019ve recently mostly recovered from bulimia (straight into mild restriction, good job brain), and I calculated it out. I was spending about $800+ every month on food. \n\n12) weight gain. If you binge eat, you\u2019re not going to get it all out. You can\u2019t estimate how much you\u2019ve kept down. Just by fixing my bulimia, I\u2019ve gone from overweight back to a normal weight.\n\n13) you\u2019re constantly hungry. Your stomach is stretched out. I was preoccupied with food, so all I could think about was eating ALL THE TIME. I was so, so hungry.\n\n14) this might be just me, but binging made me have a complete lack of control in other areas. I binge drank (a handle of vodka about every week). I didn\u2019t study or work (which is very unlike me. I lived for when I could binge.\n\n15) depression. I felt out of control of my life. I felt disgusting. I was tired all the time, and had no motivation or care to do anything. \n\nBulimia is so, so horrible.",

I knew it was bad when my ED was active (before becoming a nurse as an adult), but I didn\u2019t realize how bad: \n\n1. Stomach acid will rot your teeth. Doesn\u2019t matter if you brush right away, stomach acid is SO acidic that even a minute of contact between purging and brushing is enough to do damage. This becomes painful and EXPENSIVE to combat and recover from. I\u2019ve known several bulimic or recovering bulimic patients who have to have major jaw surgeries, dental implants, and even dentures, as young as their 20s. \n\n2. Constant exposure to hydrochloric acid (stomach acid) causes sores and chemical burns to your esophagus and mouth. Long, long term exposure has been linked to mouth, jaw, and esophageal cancers. Let me put it to you this way: if you put a dead body in a vat of hydrochloric acid, it would dissolve completely. The same is true for a live body. \n\n3. Binging is not an issue of portion control. It\u2019s a mental response of overcompensation for something else in your life. Doing so can disregulate your brain. \n\n4. Electrolyte imbalance. This seems like NBD at face value, but electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium) are important for body function such as: nerve conduction (allowing your brain to talk to your body), muscle contraction (keep your heart/lungs pumping), maintaining fluid balance (keeping you 70% water or whatever), regulate blood pressure (so you don\u2019t damage important organs like brain and kidneys), allow intracellular transfer\u2026the list goes on and on. It\u2019s super duper important to keep electrolytes in check. \n\n5. Your GI tract gets fucked when it doesn\u2019t get used regularly and appropriately - meaning you can lose the ability to poop without intervention (like an ostomy pouch or shitload of laxatives), too much forced vomiting can make it difficult to keep food down *even when you want to*. It has a rhythm all its own, and messing with that rhythm can have permanent effects. \n\nEating disorders are the **most fatal of all mental health disorders**,* with the vast majority of its victims being under the age of 40. EDs are no small matter. I hope OP has access to support and can develop the skills to recover. Please find some help. \n\n*most fatal mental health disorder without external forces (ie, suicide and substance abuse disorder)\n\n[National Eating Disorder Association](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org)\n\n[ED Help Guide](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/eating-disorders/eating-disorder-treatment-and-recovery.htm)",

You binge that fuck out of food some nights and because your body is so tired you are sleeping forgetting to vomit and you wake up the next day feeling 100 kilos more and then it brings you much more depression than before. Your bathroom is a mess and you don\u2019t care. Your teeth are getting worse and worse, chest pains, headaches, the worst for me was insomnia.Your body is really getting tired, you don\u2019t have energy to wake up from the bed. For me it\u2019s like a drug that you are addicted to it and it ruins your life. I was off my balance then on my balance for only 1 day and then back again to purging. Also it makes you spending all of your money almost on cravings. Everytime you say ok I am gonna buy this purge it and is gonna be the last time. But everyday is the same sentence. Last time I purged was on last Tuesday and today is Monday is gonna be almost a week without it. I am doing a challenge where I won\u2019t do anything and keep continue having a healthy lifestyle and weight my self on 15th of august to see what happens. I never done it so far without purging. It\u2019s really a dark place bulimia. Because you have eating disorders, problems with how you look and you say ok food makes me feel better but I won\u2019t gain weight because it will go away. But sometimes you lose weight but if you are a bulimic person you can\u2019t lose weight in healthy way and never gain them back. I am not that super obese, I fit very comfortably in size L and I am about to enter M now if you see me you won\u2019t realize it I do it but I think I lost and put 100 kilos cause everyday you lose a kilo later you put another 2 back is a nightmare. \nI didn\u2019t see anybody write the thing I had. At some point my body doesn\u2019t \u201canswer\u201d to my bulimic acts. I tried as hard as possible to make food come out but it\u2019s like my body is blocking and I can\u2019t do anything and I am really panicking. I really want to stay away from it as much as possible and I am really sending my love to anybody who is going through it. Is really difficult disorder and you are a hero if you are coming out of it just like that. And if you are reading that and you are still purging please believe in yourself. The line between the healthy lifestyle and bulimia/purging is very thin. Is very hard to do the step but please put all your power in. You don\u2019t deserve to live like that.\nI love you a lot all of you who are going through this. My dms are open if someone needs to talk \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",

Bulimic of 17 years.\n\n1) [hiatal hernia](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hiatal-hernia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373379?utm_source=Google&utm_medium=abstract&utm_content=Hiatal-hernia&utm_campaign=Knowledge-panel), which is where your stomach pushes through the diaphragm, can cause food and stomach acid to push back into your esophagus. Severe ones require surgery.\n\n2) my digestive system is FUCKED. It takes way too long to digest my food now- like, food will stay in my stomach for hours longer than it\u2019s supposed to. Every. Single. Time. I eat, I get gas and stomach cramps. Literally every time. It\u2019s uncomfortable and embarrassing af in public, so I always try to be alone after I eat. \n\n3) I have a permanent bump on the hand I use to purge with. Like, under my skin, on my bone. I had a scar there for years until I learned to purge without hitting it, but the bump has remained.\n\n4) sometimes I\u2019ll hiccup and just like.. slightly vomit into my mouth a bit. I carry gum for this reason. Nothing like surprise puke breath.\n\n5) random constipation and bloating. Even if I\u2019m eating enough that I should be going regularly (like, a massive salad), my body will sometimes decide to just.. not go for a few days. It\u2019s really uncomfortable.\n\n6) heart arrhythmia, which scares the shit out of me. For no apparent reason (like, I\u2019m taking vitamin supplements, electrolytes, drinking a shot ton of water), my heart will start messing up. It will suddenly race (~130 bpm), or I\u2019ll have double beats (normal heart rate, but every other beat will be double), or it will skip beats or have random super weak, fluttery beats. It\u2019s super scary when it happens, and everything feels intensely wrong.\n\n7) vitamin deficiencies. I have to keep really on top of my vitamins, and I\u2019m aware of all the specific symptoms for particular vitamins. For instance: I recently developed cracks in the corners of my mouth, which was from a lack of B-vitamins. \n\n8) edema. You want sudden swelling of your ankles, toes, and fingers? You got it. Let\u2019s go, body dysmorphia. \n\n9) you know what\u2019s not fun? Insomnia. You know what bulimia can cause? Insomnia.\n\n10) I know people have said enamel erosion, but with this comes cavities and putting of your teeth, which are super scary.\n\n11) not a physical side effect, but MONEY. Bulimia is fucking expensive, especially with the price of food now. I\u2019ve recently mostly recovered from bulimia (straight into mild restriction, good job brain), and I calculated it out. I was spending about $800+ every month on food. \n\n12) weight gain. If you binge eat, you\u2019re not going to get it all out. You can\u2019t estimate how much you\u2019ve kept down. Just by fixing my bulimia, I\u2019ve gone from overweight back to a normal weight.\n\n13) you\u2019re constantly hungry. Your stomach is stretched out. I was preoccupied with food, so all I could think about was eating ALL THE TIME. I was so, so hungry.\n\n14) this might be just me, but binging made me have a complete lack of control in other areas. I binge drank (a handle of vodka about every week). I didn\u2019t study or work (which is very unlike me. I lived for when I could binge.\n\n15) depression. I felt out of control of my life. I felt disgusting. I was tired all the time, and had no motivation or care to do anything. \n\nBulimia is so, so horrible.",

I knew it was bad when my ED was active (before becoming a nurse as an adult), but I didn\u2019t realize how bad: \n\n1. Stomach acid will rot your teeth. Doesn\u2019t matter if you brush right away, stomach acid is SO acidic that even a minute of contact between purging and brushing is enough to do damage. This becomes painful and EXPENSIVE to combat and recover from. I\u2019ve known several bulimic or recovering bulimic patients who have to have major jaw surgeries, dental implants, and even dentures, as young as their 20s. \n\n2. Constant exposure to hydrochloric acid (stomach acid) causes sores and chemical burns to your esophagus and mouth. Long, long term exposure has been linked to mouth, jaw, and esophageal cancers. Let me put it to you this way: if you put a dead body in a vat of hydrochloric acid, it would dissolve completely. The same is true for a live body. \n\n3. Binging is not an issue of portion control. It\u2019s a mental response of overcompensation for something else in your life. Doing so can disregulate your brain. \n\n4. Electrolyte imbalance. This seems like NBD at face value, but electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium) are important for body function such as: nerve conduction (allowing your brain to talk to your body), muscle contraction (keep your heart/lungs pumping), maintaining fluid balance (keeping you 70% water or whatever), regulate blood pressure (so you don\u2019t damage important organs like brain and kidneys), allow intracellular transfer\u2026the list goes on and on. It\u2019s super duper important to keep electrolytes in check. \n\n5. Your GI tract gets fucked when it doesn\u2019t get used regularly and appropriately - meaning you can lose the ability to poop without intervention (like an ostomy pouch or shitload of laxatives), too much forced vomiting can make it difficult to keep food down *even when you want to*. It has a rhythm all its own, and messing with that rhythm can have permanent effects. \n\nEating disorders are the **most fatal of all mental health disorders**,* with the vast majority of its victims being under the age of 40. EDs are no small matter. I hope OP has access to support and can develop the skills to recover. Please find some help. \n\n*most fatal mental health disorder without external forces (ie, suicide and substance abuse disorder)\n\n[National Eating Disorder Association](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org)\n\n[ED Help Guide](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/eating-disorders/eating-disorder-treatment-and-recovery.htm)",

Your bathroom is a mess and you don\u2019t care. Your teeth are getting worse and worse, chest pains, headaches, the worst for me was insomnia.Your body is really getting tired, you don\u2019t have energy to wake up from the bed. For me it\u2019s like a drug that you are addicted to it and it ruins your life. I was off my balance then on my balance for only 1 day and then back again to purging. Also it makes you spending all of your money almost on cravings. Everytime you say ok I am gonna buy this purge it and is gonna be the last time. But everyday is the same sentence. Last time I purged was on last Tuesday and today is Monday is gonna be almost a week without it. I am doing a challenge where I won\u2019t do anything and keep continue having a healthy lifestyle and weight my self on 15th of august to see what happens. I never done it so far without purging. It\u2019s really a dark place bulimia. Because you have eating disorders, problems with how you look and you say ok food makes me feel better but I won\u2019t gain weight because it will go away. But sometimes you lose weight but if you are a bulimic person you can\u2019t lose weight in healthy way and never gain them back. I am not that super obese, I fit very comfortably in size L and I am about to enter M now if you see me you won\u2019t realize it I do it but I think I lost and put 100 kilos cause everyday you lose a kilo later you put another 2 back is a nightmare. \nI didn\u2019t see anybody write the thing I had. At some point my body doesn\u2019t \u201canswer\u201d to my bulimic acts. I tried as hard as possible to make food come out but it\u2019s like my body is blocking and I can\u2019t do anything and I am really panicking. I really want to stay away from it as much as possible and I am really sending my love to anybody who is going through it. Is really difficult disorder and you are a hero if you are coming out of it just like that. And if you are reading that and you are still purging please believe in yourself. The line between the healthy lifestyle and bulimia/purging is very thin. Is very hard to do the step but please put all your power in. You don\u2019t deserve to live like that.\nI love you a lot all of you who are going through this. My dms are open if someone needs to talk \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",

Doesn\u2019t matter if you brush right away, stomach acid is SO acidic that even a minute of contact between purging and brushing is enough to do damage. This becomes painful and EXPENSIVE to combat and recover from. I\u2019ve known several bulimic or recovering bulimic patients who have to have major jaw surgeries, dental implants, and even dentures, as young as their 20s. \n\n2. Constant exposure to hydrochloric acid (stomach acid) causes sores and chemical burns to your esophagus and mouth. Long, long term exposure has been linked to mouth, jaw, and esophageal cancers. Let me put it to you this way: if you put a dead body in a vat of hydrochloric acid, it would dissolve completely. The same is true for a live body. \n\n3. Binging is not an issue of portion control. It\u2019s a mental response of overcompensation for something else in your life. Doing so can disregulate your brain. \n\n4. Electrolyte imbalance. This seems like NBD at face value, but electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium) are important for body function such as: nerve conduction (allowing your brain to talk to your body), muscle contraction (keep your heart/lungs pumping), maintaining fluid balance (keeping you 70% water or whatever), regulate blood pressure (so you don\u2019t damage important organs like brain and kidneys), allow intracellular transfer\u2026the list goes on and on. It\u2019s super duper important to keep electrolytes in check. \n\n5. Your GI tract gets fucked when it doesn\u2019t get used regularly and appropriately - meaning you can lose the ability to poop without intervention (like an ostomy pouch or shitload of laxatives), too much forced vomiting can make it difficult to keep food down *even when you want to*.
