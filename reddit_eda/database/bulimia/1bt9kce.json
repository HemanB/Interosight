  "selftext": "Every single night I lay in bed and I tell myself \u201cI can\u2019t keep doing this anymore\u201d. It has made me gain weight and lose my friendships and my grades in college are SUFFERING. But it\u2019s the only thing that gives me dopamine. I tell myself I want to get better and I want to eat normally and exercise and just focus on studying. I want to stop wasting money on binge food and just save it so that I can move out of my parents house. BUT THIS FUCKING DISORDER IS RUINING ALL OF THAT. And it sucks because I don\u2019t want to stop. My dream life consists of me being BP free. Yet I can\u2019t find the desire to stop!??????? It\u2019s like the only thing I\u2019m living for. I love shoving food into my mouth and making myself throw up how fucked up is that. I can\u2019t believe that\u2019s my biggest desire in life. Eating and throwing up food ",

Even in treatment I wasn\u2019t ready. Not long after I got out, I started back up. It wasn\u2019t until I noticed my gums bleeding that I actually wanted to stop for myself and not other people. I\u2019ve been in recovery almost 180 days. You can do it, but the best results are when you\u2019re ready.",

      "body": "I'm going to be honest, I've been in therapy for 8 years. I started therapy during my sophomore year of college, I'm currently in grad school. Trust me, I KNOW how hard and how easy school makes this disease. Eating while studying is sooo soothing, but you also can't actually work while using your hands to eat... it's a total struggle. \n\nPlease seek professional help. Even your primary care doctor can be helpful. Hell, I went in crying to mine about how I couldn't handle it anymore. My pcp forced me to go to therapy and told me he wouldn't refill my Adderall if I didn't seek help. That was the best thing anyone has ever done for me. It's can be the day your whole life changes.\n\nI'm 8 years in recovery, and a few months ago, my doctor asked me if they wanted me to take bulimia off my charts. I hadn't remembered the last time I purged (I'm still going many months at a time without an episode), so I said, \"Yes. That would be so freeing.\" You can get there too.\n\nYou can do it. But you really can't do it alone. Getting away from this disease requires retraining your brain, and that requires a teacher (aka therapist). We support you. Please, fellow college friend \ud83e\udde1 don't wait until it gets so bad you can't wait.\n\nIn the meantime. TAKE CARE OF YOUR TEETH. We all had beautiful teeth before this disease, and you can't heal those back. Baking soda, swish, then brush gently with sensodyne. Floss. Everytime. Carry that shit with you to the bars if you have to. That said, creating another exhausting routine related to your purging can help deter you.\n\nStay safe \ud83d\ude4f \u2764\ufe0f",
