  "selftext": "hi all!!! i just wanted to share my achievement here. i haven't been active in a while, but since i've been gone, it has been 105 days since i've purged!!! never again. i have so much energy now. i've gained weight and i love it! i feel strong and capable and i can move around without getting tired or passing out. i can go to concerts and dance and spend time with the people i love!! i can eat my favoritest foods and not feel bad. i still remember the calories but it doesn't bother me :)! sometimes it's even helpful, when i don't have much time to eat, the knowledge of macros helps me to decide what is best for quick energy. i was always terrified of the fact that i could never forget those things, but that's the thing. you just learn to find peace with it. recovery is so beautiful. i hope all of you can feel this someday. this peace and happiness. its not always easy, sometimes i still get insecure about my body. but i fight those insecurities with everything i have, and they are no match for me!! recovery always seemed so impossible. i didnt know what i would be without my eating disorder. i am happy. finally i am happy. i love you all and you are not alone. you will find peace.",
