I feel like a lot of times eating disorders are romanticized and portrayed as a delicate dainty thing when in reality they're shitty and ruin everything. Your post shows the raw truth about bulimia and I really think that your post would be eye opening to people that do not understand the bulimia mindset.",

I went to a doctor and they gave me topamax...it worked but only temporarily. But it helped get me to stop and so when the urges did finally come back they were a bit easier to fight. Talk to a doctor about that medication. I was suicidal from b/p so they gave it to me. It does cause brain fog tho pretty bad. Maybe do some research but if it's really this bad it might be worth it",

I used to not be able to go a day without binging and purging multiple times a day. It's much different for me now and it is possible to recover. Please seek help because you are much more likely to break the cycle with the guidance of a professional. I know it seems impossible and that you will never escape the cycle of bulimia. I promise you, if you are willing to make a change, you will be amazed at what you are capable of. Sending you lots of love and support \u2764\ufe0f",

But when it comes to behavioral diseases there are also a very large proportion of people who try to conquer them through willpower alone by simply making a decision to stop, and then keep failing over and over, because it is the nature of these diseases that this approach simply doesn't work. Obviously I don't know if OP is one of them, but it's never a bad idea to bring it up, in case he/she actually is trapped on that threadmill (someone pointing that out to me in the past actually saved my life).",
