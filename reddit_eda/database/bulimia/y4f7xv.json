  "selftext": "If you look at my post history, you\u2019ll find a post from last month about the most terrifying night of my life. This is the update. I am still going strong. 36 days purge free. The longest I\u2019ve ever gone in years. I still have the occasional \u201cbinge\u201d but the magnitude is multiple orders of severity better than when I was still purging. My binges now aren\u2019t me eating the entire contents of the pantry and fridge in the span of an hour. Or eating a tub of PB in 20 minutes only to make myself violently sick. Now a \u201cbad day\u201d is me eating 5 TBSPs of PB over the course of a day. It\u2019s eating two frozen dinners instead of the 6 I bought. It\u2019s getting a double scoop of ice cream with friends instead of emptying a half gallon tub that I picked up impulsively from the grocery store while hiding in my room. \n\nI\u2019ve gained a good 10 lbs but I\u2019m not gaining anymore. This weight is temporary. It\u2019s a small price to pay for the time and money I\u2019ve saved and the mental peace that has come with stopping. I can already feel my urges to eat more than I need subsiding, so I\u2019m sure I can lose it eventually in a healthy way but right now my recovery comes first. If you\u2019re thinking about recovery, I really do wish you the absolute best of luck. This is such a horrific disease and I wouldn\u2019t wish it upon my worst enemy. Take care <3",

It's such a brave and strong thing you're doing, and I'm sure you're an inspiration to people thinking about recovery. \n\nGive yourself a high five from me; you are awesome.",

      "body": "Thank you <3\n\nPhysically? I\u2019m not freezing all the time anymore.  I used to think only underweight people get cold from EDs. Totally untrue. Even at the worst of it, I have always been a normal weight, yet my hands and feet felt like icicles all the time and I would have two layers on while everyone else was in shorts. I don\u2019t get dizzy when I stand up too fast. I don\u2019t wake up with a throat ripped to shreds every few days. \n\nI will say it\u2019s not all good things though. I do feel sluggish from the weight I\u2019ve gained. I can feel my clothes getting tighter which makes me very uncomfortable, yet somehow the panic that I used to feel is gone. \n\nMentally? The amount of time and money that bulimia robs you of is enough to make the most sane person spiral into a pit of stress and depression. And for yours truly who was already far from sane? Go figure. I don\u2019t overanalyze what I\u2019m eating nearly as much, even though I do make a best-effort attempt to not go off the rails everyday. It\u2019s a positive feedback cycle because the more I keep myself in check, the less worried I am about what I eat. I\u2019m not sure how to describe what I\u2019ve been feeling lately, to be honest, but calm is probably the closest word for it. This isn\u2019t my first attempt at recovery and I\u2019m not sure why this feels so different from all the other times. It\u2019s like a switch flipped, which I hate to say because it\u2019s useless for anyone reading who\u2019s trying to recover but I\u2019m not sure what it is.\n\nThis was a long-winded response but I hope it helps :)",

The mental aspects of it are the hardest part. I no longer have urges to binge eat or restrict but I\u2019ve never ate breakfast even as a child so I have a tendency to fast accidentally. I used to always be cold, and always constipated. I love pooping. I will poop anywhere I do not care. I hate being constipated. \n\nI just had 6k worth of dental work done bc of problems stemming from purging. My teeth didn\u2019t start rotting until after I stopped.",
