  "selftext": "Case in point, I just cooked some ramen in a specific way (tempered the eggs so it would blend with the soup). He asked me about the step-by-step process while I was eating. Then said that the texture was like baby vomit. And also my dog's vomit - same color, too.\n\nMy food sensitive ass went on to throw up immediately.\n\nThe other week, I was having problems with eating. I had not eaten a proper meal in two days. Anything I ate, no matter how little, I threw up. Got the guts to prep a bowl of oatmeal with nuts and berries. As I was eating, he kept asking me if I wanted some stew in the oatmeal. Then kept asking if I wanted to add some fish sauce.\n\nPromptly stopped eating.\n\nIt's even more annoying that he insists I should fucking eat something.
