When I was in college I didn\u2019t have much money so I couldn\u2019t do take out all the time and instead I consistently binged on pasta, mac and cheese, and cake batter. All are super easy to get up and not expensive. \n\nAnother thing I\u2019ve done is eat a TON of salad right before you binge so when you binge on the bad food, there\u2019s not as much room and you\u2019ll get full quicker/eat less/can order less?",
