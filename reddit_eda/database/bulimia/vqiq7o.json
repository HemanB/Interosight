      "body": "Hi there! I know what that feels like to look down my cest towards my bellybutton or if I stand in front of a mirror. In these situations I feel physical pain, disgust and I'm afraid of gaining body fat.\nWhat has helped me the most was to rationalize these feelings and to think of them as a pointer towards repressed needs I have. For example everytime I ask myself \"Did I gain weight?\" or \"You look fat here, right?\" or if I feel bad about the shape of my body I instantly check my list of needs: 1.) enough sleep 2.) three nutritious and balanced meals per day 3.) enough contact with loving friends and family 4.) any other feelings or thoughts in this moment. \nMost of the time I can escape my own destructive thoughts, if I call someone, because most of the time I feel alone or lost. I'll ask another friend \"How are you?\" and then I can just listen for a while. That's what brings my mind away from the bad stuff I'm thinking about myself. I can share the stuff that is bothering me and afterwards I feel so much better.\nTrust me I don't want to call someone and I want to fuck up myself with these \"bad body image\"-thoughts, but deep down I know, that I deserve better.\nSometimes I talk to myself, if I have the thought that I want to cut my flesh like: \"Yo bro! What's wrong with you today? Are we getting ourselves into trouble here again?\". Oftentimes I have to laugh about my inner conversations and I have the feeling I don't need to take myself so seriously.\nI'm sick and if there is one big goal in my life, it's to take good care of myself just day by day. So I can make myself useful and be there for other people.\nThanks for sharing your thoughts with us here. I wish you all the best and I hope you can use a bit of what I wrote here.",
