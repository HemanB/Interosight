  "selftext": "Does anyone else deal with this? I feel so incredibly deeply bored and disappointed by every single task in my life. All the things people normally go to for dopamine (music, movies, games, hobbies, even other people) has lost the appeal to me and I bounce between activities restlessly but never feel satisfied emotionally by anything except binge eating. I don\u2019t know how to get un-bored. I have lots of options for entertainment but I just don\u2019t really enjoy any of them, so I\u2019m left feeling unsatisfied and empty and food fills that perfectly.",
