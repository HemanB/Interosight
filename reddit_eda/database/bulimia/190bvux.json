      "body": "When my purged were bad I would always try to eat something around half an hour later, especially things like banana and sports drinks mostly to replace lost electrolytes through purging.\n\nMy understanding is that if you feel you can\u2019t stop a craving it\u2019s because your body is trying to replace lost nutrients and, I guess to try and stabilise things like electrolytes, blood sugar etc.\n\nWhen I learned this that was when I decided my ideal post snack would be banana, sports drink that type of thing. It feels more like rebalancing my body chemistry than feeding the impulse. Hopefully that helps, I know it\u2019s a really hard thing to feel after purging which can be quite traumatic in itself \ud83d\udc9c",
