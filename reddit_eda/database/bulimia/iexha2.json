  "selftext": "Ana was a bitch, so I decided to ditch her. That's when I met Mia. She seemed better. At first. She let me eat, telling me to indulge because I've \"earned it\". That's where the fun stopped.\n\n\n\nShe started whispering in my ear about how fat I am. She guided me to the bathroom. I trusted her. She shoved my fingers down my throat, saying this would undo it. This would fix it.\n\n\n\n\"That's not enough\", she says as I choke on my own vomit.\n\n\n\n\"You need to get it all\", she says as my eyes are bulging out of their sockets.\n\n\n\nShe praises me as I wash my face. She holds me as I wobble back to my room, barely able to stand. I am light-headed, but at least Mia was happy. For now. It's never enough for her.",
