  "selftext": "Being bulimic really does suck. I hate when people think it\u2019s some sort of \u2018advantage\u2019. I hate when people say \u2018oh so you get to eat more and still not gain weight??\u2019 Like it\u2019s soooo easy. \nBeing bulimic is tiring. It\u2019s exhausting. It takes up your entire day and ruins your mood. It stops you from being able to have a healthy relationship with food and lose weight healthily, instead your just filling yourself up with junk and hoping you rid yourself of it, while you know deep down that the damage you\u2019re doing is terrible.\nBeing bulimic is waking up feeling like shit because you have more than your total calorie allowance before the day has even started. Being bulimic is not being able to make or keep normal connections because you fear eating in public. Being bulimic is losing your hair and watching your health deteriorate. Being bulimic is knowing that there is \u2018a way out\u2019 but it\u2019s so far away that you give up before even trying to help yourself. \nI hate being bulimic. I hate doing this to myself. I guess I hate everything about myself but the whole idea of people assuming bulimia is the \u2018easier eating disorder\u2019, that\u2019s what I hate most of all.",
