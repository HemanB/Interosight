  "selftext": "Ive been bulimic for 7 years. I b/p over 3 times a day. I am so young and have no future. Im on my death ed in my youth. I should be partying and going out with friends, instead I just sit at home and wait patiently for something awful to happen to me because I cant keep living with this disease anymore.\n\nim 19. my teeth are rotting and my face is bloated. I have terrible osteoporosis and osteoarthritis. I have gastroparesis. Ive been vomiting blood. I have extremely bad anemia, and every mineral deficiency in the book. I can hardly stand without collapsing or feeling naesueous.\n\nI feel like the only thing i can do now is wait to die. All i want is for this to be over, for me to be normal, but my body wont let me die yet. I am too young for this",

When I was 18 and purging as much as you, I thought there was no hope for me and that I was just going to die a sad, slow death to this disease. I still get worried these days, even though I don't purge anymore, that the damage will catch up to me and I'll die a sudden death before I'm 30. But still, things can get better and life can be happier and more fruitful than you can imagine.",

I\u2019ve already began to feel the damage this has brought me and to think we are so young. I truly believe one day we will be free from this, look back, and think of how strong we were to choose recovery. We got this.",
