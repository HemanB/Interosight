I completely understand that even hearing a story like this makes you think, but isn't a catalyst for change bc ED IS and I'll say it again IS so freaking strong.   It becomes a part of what defines you when you think of daily life.   It's basically like the only consistent thing one can count on when everything else feels so flaky.  I get that.  I may not have struggled with ED myself but I know that feeling regarding my own coping mechanisms.. \u2764\ufe0f. \nI know ED is so misunderstood and so stigmatized and it's so detrimental to beautiful souls like yourself.  It's not something that's quit cold turkey like cigarettes or whatever.  \nSo just know that there is someone out here who doesn't know you personally, who will never judge you for anything, that will be here if you need to talk.  \u2764\ufe0f.  - Sarah",
