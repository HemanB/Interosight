  "selftext": "i thought i finally recovered from it..cause i didnt b/p for almost 3 months\nmy story with bulimia started 2 years ago when i was in a toxic relationship\nand i slowly degraded until it got out of control and i lost for about 10 kgs\nand after the guy broke up with me i had to make a change\nand i recovered again, for a few months, but i kept coming back to my old habits\npause and purge\nrecently things changed because my classmates told me im obese.. i tend to mention im on 63 kgs and 5.2 ft(1.58 m)\nand i started purging..again\nim not much of a binging person\nbut even if i eat a slice of watermelon i get sick and i feel like i need to throw up my guts because i feel guilty for my body image\nthis is the 1st day without actually purging\ni still feel the urge to do it but i gotta fight it\nat least today\ni got scared cuz my hair started falling( fists full of hair)\nidk what to do anymore\nim trying my best yet i always get back to it\ni recover for a month, 2 at best\nnow im struggling to get to a single day without it\nheres my story..i felt like i needed to open up to someone cuz\ni cant tell my family about it.. and my friends were like \"so if its bad stop doing it lol\"",
