  "selftext": "I have non purging bulimia, it\u2019s an eating disorder that\u2019s never mentioned. Because it\u2019s not well known.\n\nWhat is non purging bulimia? \nNon-purging bulimia is a type of bulimia nervosa in which excessive exercise or fasting follows binge episodes to compensate for food consumed, instead of self-induced vomiting.\n\nThis is a disorder in which you binge but do not purge through vomiting, diuretics or laxatives. Instead, the person with the non purging disordered eating uses other compensatory behaviors, such as fasting, skipping meals, or obsessively exercising.\n\nIf you struggle with this, you are not alone. It\u2019s a terrible cycle, but there can be an end. \u201cBrain over binge podcast\u201d has helped me for some part and I recommend listening to it.",

The second one I purged for an hour straight and it terrified me, I could feel how much harm I was creating to my body.\n\nSo basically through the years I went from exercise/activity compensation to pharmacological compensation and ended up purging. Decided to draw a line after that second episode and I don\u2019t compensate anymore in any way. Although binge episodes still occur and they still hit hard. \n\nI am a bodybuilder so this impacts me heavily, not because I feel bad about my body but rather because I am required to have a certain look on the stage, I am far from fat and you wouldn\u2019t even ever think I am bulimic from seeing me. \n\nStay strong brothers and sisters. And keep trying. Every dark night ends at dawn eventually. \n\nTo those saying this is \u2018fake bulimia\u2019 go feck yourselves honestly, you have no empathy for people who suffer as much as you do.",

My friend visited me for 3 days and left today, needless to say i purged every night etc. But on \u201cnormal\u201d days, i have to walk in between every meal. 10k steps turned to 15, then 20-25 and sometimes 30k. Only then do i feel like i can eat on some days, not all. I always have to do some sort of exercise, or intermittent fasting. \n\nWhy not to do this: i lost more weight when i was eating breakfast, lots of fruit and focused on eating fresh and healthy with restrictions only towards junk and some high calorie foods like pb. I felt better, looked better and had more energy to exercise properly. \nThis has me constantly bloated, and constipated. I\u2019m tense all the time and the body doesn\u2019t have time for recovery. Meaning it\u2019s all for nothing. Purging is the worst. Face gets all swollen and just no. I need to get out of this mindset because i was in fact loosing a lot last fall and I didn\u2019t purge much at all(my body doesn\u2019t lose fat easily either) so if anyone\u2019s reading this, these methods aren\u2019t sustainable unfortunately and probably won\u2019t help reach your goals. Instead, start over and find a routine that gives you results, learn to say no when friends want to eat if you\u2019re afraid it\u2019ll trigger you. Start today and the results from a healthy diet and mindset will definitely noticeably change how you feel and look within a shorter time. You\u2019re not alone<3",
