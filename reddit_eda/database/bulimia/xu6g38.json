I wish people didn't make assumptions based on my weight. My electrolytes are all a mess and I'm very unwell despite my weight being restored I'm actually more unwell than I was when I was underweight.",

It's like they are pissed I'm not suddenly obese.\n\nThere's no point in saying to them well actually I am a healthy weight and eat 2000 calories a day i engage in that behaviour (binge+purge) 3 times a week, which is external from the 2000 calories now rather than 20 times a week and I'm no longer striving to maintain an anorexic body.\n\nIt's like they want me to be extremely unfit and overweight and feel gross and unhealthy to be normal. I haven't picked up a phonecall from that family member in 10 months.",
