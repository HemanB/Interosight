  "selftext": "\"Think of your old body like a pair of shoes that's two sizes too small... Sure, you can squeeze your feet in for a while. You might even be able to walk a few steps - but you can't run, or hike, or dance around... You have to let go of those shoes and get a better fitting pair, one that lets you do what you love.\"\n\nI'm recovering from \\~6 years with bulimia. I've been struggling with letting go of my old body, which was a product of disordered behavior. I discussed this with my therapist today and it really resonates with me. Just wanted to share it with you guys, and hope it helps you in your own journeys too. <3",
