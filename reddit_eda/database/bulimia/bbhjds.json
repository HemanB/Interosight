      "body": "Thanks so much for the support guys! I\u2019ve been struggling with bulimia for 7 years and I\u2019ve definitely come a long way. Most of you guys are saying your entire calendar would be red, and mine would have been too before this year. I don\u2019t know what changed this year but I\u2019ve been actively trying to wait out that overwhelming feeling of dread and guilt after I eat. Sometimes I succeed, sometimes I fail, but I think I\u2019m on a good trajectory. Hope it becomes all white by the end of the year and I wish you guys the same <3",
