Money I would have spent in a month b/ping in the worst part of my eating disorder was enough to pay for 2 months worth of gas for my car.",

I justify this by telling myself plenty of people spend this amount of cigarettes or weed daily and at least I'm not addicted to cocaine, I would be so broke lol.\nWhen I buy binge foods I usually get all the discounted crap for like 50p that is going to be thrown away. It's extremely tempting to order \u00a3100 of Uber eats though, but I've never crossed that line. I feel and behave like an actual addict.",

      "body": "In addition to the financial waste, I feel like the amount of physical garbage that comes with binge eating is rarely talked about. The amount of cardboard, plastic, even metal that must be tossed can be astronomical. \n\nFor example: say a binge you have frozen pizza, ice cream, and a package of cookies. You now have the cardboard pizza box, the plastic the pizza was wrapped in, the cardboard tray the pizza sits on inside of the plastic, the ice cream container and its plastic top, the plastic wrap you peel off the top of the ice cream, the plastic cover for the cookies and the tray the cookies sit in. Just with those three foods alone you now have to discard all of that waste. It piles up *so* quickly! \n\nI\u2019m certainly no eco activist, but when I was living with my parents while struggling with bingeing, I had to hide SO much fucking trash and find ways to get rid of it. It was a job in and of itself.",
