I don\u2019t know why I try to gave him money  and cry and lie I\u2019m. Not a liar but bulimia makes me do all these things I don\u2019t even want to do",

      "body": "If your boyfriend truly loves you he wont judge you so dont feel embarrassed, try to talk to him about how it all started and the emotions the disorder causes you to have so he can have an understanding of what you are going through & if you feel like purging you can tell your boyfriend and he can distract you from doing it. Having bulimia myself i know its hard to stop but it is possible and if your boyfriend really cares about you he will help you get through recovery, sending you lots of positive energy \u2764\ufe0f",

Even quit that job. thank god i\u2019m 3 months clean and life hasn\u2019t changed a lot but my health is definitely BETTER and I feel so different! purging is an addiction, it is very hard to quit but it IS possible. i know getting help is not for everyone but there a lot of resources online. facebook groups and youtube videos and tiktok people too. that\u2019s how i started recovery. please let this situation stop you from doing it. it is very embarrassing. just like you said, it makes us people we are not. i\u2019m here with you and understand you",
