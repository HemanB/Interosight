Everyone is eating the same amount as me so I don't know why she singled me out. I ended up purging in the bathroom and I left.\n\nI am now in a remote parking lot crying. \nI hate myself so much.",

Well, maybe let it get you down enough to process your emotions and feel them but don\u2019t let it linger. \n\nBut what she did really was not only rooted in diet-culture and triggering af and messed up but also truly the definition of BULLYING. Talking down to you and trying to publically SHAME and put you down in front of others is bullying and shows truly what kind of a boss she really is and probably makes her feel good and in control and is an ego/abuse of power/power trip thing! \n\nNo pressure of course\u2014 but If I were in your position I would either find a safer job or report or report and then put my two weeks in after finding a better job if you can.
