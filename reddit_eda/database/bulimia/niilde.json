I feel fine looking at myself before I\u2019ve eaten but whenever I eat food I see myself in an entirely different way and just think I\u2019m disgusting. My body seems to actually warp in my own eyes and I really don\u2019t know what to do.",

Logically I know I\u2019m on the small side and fairly muscular, but all my crazy eyes see is a big disgusting failure. It feels awful. \nDoes anyone know about your bulimia? Could you tell your parents, or a school counselor, or your primary care doctor? If you could get into a therapy situation, they would have some suggestions for how to feel better. \nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with this. I hope you find some peace.",

      "body": "This sounds like body dysmorphia which is very common in those with eating disorders. You can help yourself if you start reducing body checking behaviors. If you are aware that checking your body after eating triggers your eating disorder then try to avoid doing that. Especially avoid checking your stomach because yes, it will look bigger after you've eaten. It doesn't mean you are disgusting, it just means your stomach has food in it. I used to body check first thing in the morning and that would determine how the rest of my day was going to go. I found that once I stopped doing that, my eating disorder stopped showing up in the morning. \n\nAnother great tool you can use are dialogues between your ED self and your Healthy self. We all have an ED self and it usually is abusive, negative, critical and cruel. We also have a Healthy Self that we are all born with and it usually shows up for other people. Whenever you have an ED thought about your body, write it down and respond to it. It helps to imagine what you would say to a loved one if they were having negative thoughts about their body. For example:\n\nEd Thought: Eating food makes me look disgusting\n\nHealthy Self: You do not look disgusting, nothing has changed about your body just because you have eaten. Your body image cannot be trusted because it is warped. You deserve to eat and to treat yourself with kindness.\n\nThis is a very powerful tool that will help you identify what your eating disorder sounds like and what it's messages and beliefs are. Your eating disorder is going to keep telling you that your body is disgusting so that you will keep relying on it. Every time you challenge your ED, you weaken it. I hope this made sense and I'm sending lots of support your way. \u2764\ufe0f",
