The moment I finish purging I\u2019m already setting up for the next one. This repeats over and over with no breaks in between until well past midnight when I either collapse on the floor or force myself into bed shaking and do it all again the next day. Even half asleep all I can think about is eating. It never stops. I have no hobbies, no friends, no dreams, no passions. Every thought is about food. I don\u2019t even care about my weight anymore. I used to obsess over maintaining an underweight bmi but honestly now I wouldn't even care if I got fat if it meant I wouldn't have to live another day like this. I\u2019m not even 20 yet and I'm afraid I'll die but I can't get myself to accept help because deep down I think I deserve this. ",

I still will once a day binge something like a box of donuts and purge that but in comparison to all day everyday - starting therapy next week too. I see everyone else saying this and it\u2019s so true but anyone relating and going through this - it is literally hell. I seriously cannot believe how fucked this is - I\u2019ve gone a few days even maybe a week binge and purge free - I felt a sense of freedom, I felt hope for myself. \nBinging gives me a feeling a relief - even a feeling of relief from the pain in bulimia itself. - so, if u need a different outlet of relief - I smoke so much weed now and I\u2019m honestly trying to transfer the relief purging gives me into weed - not working out too well but\u2026.\nI\u2019ve taken sleeping pills in the mornings and mid days to make myself pass out cause that was once the only thing that would stop me from bulimia. I\u2019m always finding myself trying to hide from it but u can\u2019t hide from it. It\u2019s not something u can suppress cause itll always be there literally changes our brain chemistry forever. I just have gotten better at holding it back. - might literally go find someone to hypnotize me into having a fear of toilets or something - lowk funny but like I\u2019m so serious \ud83d\ude2d we all need to vent and ik im not alone in this which could be comforting but honestly just devastated sm people go through this.",

I couldn\u2019t talk to my family friends or doctor\u2026 you can find specialized nurses online to talk to who you don\u2019t know via a video link. Costs a small fee. I found it easier to talk to a stranger about it freely. Not that anyone o know would have judged me but I found it easier talking to a complete stranger myself.",

A lot of time wasted. If you are looking for quick help In A dyer situation I would suggest talking to a doctor about Vyvanse. It\u2019s used to treat binge eating disorders. I will warn you tho it isn\u2019t a permanent fix\u2026 you need to do a lot of recovery work to ensure you don\u2019t risk relapse or dependency. A drug can almost become just as bad as the actual disorder if you don\u2019t put in the effort to change your mindset/addiction/obsessive thoughts. I found it provided relief from the thoughts and gave me an opportunity to recover\u2026 I wish I had it as an option 20 years ago to assist me in relieving me From my constant thoughts\u2026 and save me a decade or 2 of suffering\u00a0",
