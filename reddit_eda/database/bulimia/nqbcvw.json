I feel it my throat and my stomach and I have to make it go away. And when it\u2019s over I\u2019m just depressed. Then you tell myself I\u2019d rather just not eat. But that never happens. I\u2019m not I I over weight. Gained a little over quarantine but not over weight.",

If I\u2019m by myself I may over eat and purge but if I\u2019m with others I can usually control how much I eat or just accept that I won\u2019t be able to purge. This doesn\u2019t feel extreme to me and it feels like I\u2019ll be able to and will continue to do this until I am 57 etc. I feel like it\u2019d be more difficult to continue binging and purging if i ate extreme amounts and felt the need to purge every single time in every single situation\n\n\nSo my question for you is, are you \u201ccasual\u201d about it or is it more extreme (purge after every little thing every single place whether a restaurant, dinner party, museum, etc)",
