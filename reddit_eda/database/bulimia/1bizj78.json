Like I felt invisible??) and bc I took like $1k worth of stuff they called the police and I was arrested and had to walk out of the store in handcuffs. It was like 9pm so I couldn\u2019t see a judge that night so I spent the night in jail.\nI was so embarrassed I lied when the other women asked me what I did and said prostitution. I wish I was kidding.\nI had my period and the toilet was basically open and you had to ask a guard for tp every time. And obvs I didn\u2019t have a pad or anything bc I couldn\u2019t have anything w me.\n\nGuys, I spent the night in jail in nyc. Did it stop me? For a minute.\nI stopped shoplifting for the most part except little things. Now I just have thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars in credit card debt.\n\nLast week was bad for me, but bad now is 3x in a week not every night. And I can go months without purging. \n\nI do think recovery is possible!! I do think we can get to the other side!!\n\nAnd you are SO young!!! Right now your brain is hardcore LYING to you!!! It\u2019s glitching like crazy and that voice telling you there\u2019s no hope and it\u2019s always going to be like this is fkng lying to you!!\n\nI got really sick once and cried to the dr saying I knew I\u2019d done it to myself, and I wanted so badly to change.\n\nI\u2019m not religious at all so apologize if I get this wrong/ but she told me that Jesus washed Mary\u2019s feet and she was instantly changed or something like that?\nAnd for some reason that stuck with me, that you can like wake up in the morning and change??

There must be a tiny shred of hope in you, even if most of the time you convince yourself it's not real, or its delusional (I'm the same) - or else you wouldn't be here. That hope is not delusional, it's not ridiculous, a life better than this is still possible for you, it's possible for all of us, even if we can't always see it... I'm also stuck right now, but holding on to that shred of hope, and I pray you hold on, too. You are not a monster, you are not an animal, you are not evil or greedy or morrally irredeemable - you are a human who is very ill, with something there isn't enough research and understanding about.
