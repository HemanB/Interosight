The day I decided I was going to stop binging and purging was the best decision I ever made in my entire life. I didn\u2019t have the option of seeking medical intervention so I just went cold turkey. If you can talk to a therapist I would, bc I still suffer from Anorexic tendencies. I would say this month has been my worst in terms of my eating disorder. Unfortunately it never really goes away, but you WILL be able to eat food without even THINKING about purging. I used to have panic attacks thinking I\u2019d never ever have a normal relationship with food but I do know! I intuitively eat, and I\u2019m the biggest I\u2019ve ever been (before I started B/P) and I can honestly say I love my big thighs and my little jiggly tummy. \n\nI am so so happy for you! Keep going! I always thought I\u2019d be okay in regards to health problems bc I only B/P for 5 years but that\u2019s far from the truth. I\u2019m 31 and will be getting implants this year on at least 4 teeth and I\u2019ve already had one pulled when I was 24 bc it was so rotten. My digestive system took about 7 years to be able to poop regularly and now I get really bad bouts of indigestion. I also was diagnosed with sever Rosacea at 21 (which is very rare to be diagnosed that young with this skin disease) and I have no doubt my weakened immune system had a lot to do with it. \n\nAnyways take my advice or don\u2019t, but your future self will thank you if you stick to quitting. I think I maybe relapsed once and I felt so so guilty bc I broke my promise to myself that I would never do it again and I didn\u2019t! If I can do it, anyone can! (Severe Anxiety and Depression since childhood) I may be just a random Reddit stranger but I believe in you, I know how hard it is and I know you have the strength to beat this disease!",
