  "title": "Today, I talked myself out of a B/P",
  "selftext": "  \n\nToday, I talked myself out of a binge/purge (B/P). I was walking to the store with the intention of B/P, grocery bag in hand and I thought to myself, \u2018you can stop this now. This is one of those moments they talk about, when you could have turned it around.\u2019 I wasn\u2019t immediately sure that I even wanted to stop it from happening. I thought about what it would feel like, the release as it comes back up. I could sort of feel relief but, mostly it just felt hollow. After that momentary relief would come a wave of disappointment, hopelessness and exhaustion. I thought to myself, \u2018if I ever have any hope of becoming the person I want to be, who I believe I can be, I will have to stop this eventually. I either end it or it ends me.\u2019 I went into the store and the angels on either shoulder were arguing. In one ear, \u201cif you do this now it was your choice. You could have stopped it.\u201d In the other ear, \u201cJennifer Anniston doesn\u2019t eat burritos, fat ass. How are you going to undo this?\u2019 And then there was only one voice, \u2018you aren\u2019t Jennifer Anniston.\u201d So, I got a seltzer, some kombucha and some almonds to munch on and I am not going to B/P tonight. With any luck, I won\u2019t B/P tomorrow either. I can\u2019t say for sure that I\u2019ll never B/P again but tonight, after 16 years of fighting, I successfully talked myself out of a B/P and I am actually pretty fuckin\u2019 proud. It turns out this type of control feels good too. Never lose hope, my friends. \n\nI will not purge with you today.",
