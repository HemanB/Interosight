But, when I\u2019ve tried it, it definitely helps. I think the most important thing is to find what works best for you. Maybe 3 substantial meals is better than smaller portions throughout the day, or maybe you need to add in more snacks and ensure that your not restricting food groups.\n\nIt sounds weird but one of the patterns that helped me the most was actually having a sweet pastry for breakfast instead of oatmeal because it was so much more mentally satisfying and I then craved sugar less during the day.\n\nI think it\u2019s also about trusting the process. Our brains will take some time to realise it\u2019s getting adequate nutrition so binges may continue for a while BUT they will decrease and hopefully stop if you continue to regular eat enough. As I said, I know how tough it is because I\u2019ve not been following my own advice recently BUT I believe in you. Let\u2019s beat this x",
