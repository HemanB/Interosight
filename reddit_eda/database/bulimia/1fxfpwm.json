My binges started of as (i know how silly this sounds) a symptom of crushing boredom, being controlled & lacking freedom- my brain was so understimulated & my life so stifled that food was one of the only ways I could stimulate my mind & feel that sweet sweet dopamine & that gave me absolutely wild joy. It still hurts remember what life was like.\u00a0\n\n\nThen ofc I began to get scared of gaining weight & then desparate to lose weight (its a bit confused but I think my logic was if I could make myself visibly different then I'd be treated differently too) so bingeing became FORBIDDEN, which only made me obsess over it more & made the rush of crazy joy when I'd inevitably crack & binge even more intense- really, it was ecstatic.\u00a0",

      "body": "The b/p cycle consumes a lot of energy. The effort in purging can also tire a ton and have a toll on mental health. Food is a natural source of pleasure, especially if you're starved. Having this explosion of pleasure hormones after a long period of deprivation, suffering and malnutrition (during which a lot of stress hormones are secreted) multiple times in a row activates a natural mechanism called conditioning,.. You start looking forward to bingeing and your brain sees it as a reward for purging. At least that's my view on it, as I'm a binge-then-fast-and-do-sports bulimic (who's trying to recover like all of us). I'm sure there are interesting and informative studies about the subject at a neurological level\n\nIf anyone here has further knowledge that would be really cool\n\nEdit : worth mentioning too that most of us bulimics use food as a way to soothe emotions and feel comforted. Every single day living with bulimia can be challenging mentally/emotionally and we tend to turn to food for the alleviation of these heavy feelings",
