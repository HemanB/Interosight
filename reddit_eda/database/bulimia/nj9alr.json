I had an endoscopy last week and I have gastritis and an inflamed esophagus. I have severe and excruciating heartburn and chest aches. My body is so used to throwing up that food automatically comes up after I eat. I want to  recover but it's like my body doesn't want me to. I cannot see myself getting out of this hellhole.\n\nI'm so fucking tired. I don\u2019t want to be here anymore this isn\u2019t living",

It can take a bit of time but your emotional health can heal too, and living can go hand in hand with peace I promise you. My heart goes out to you \u2764\ufe0f",

I didn\u2019t have a routine schedule to plan my binges around. not sure if this helps but we\u2019re rooting for you",
