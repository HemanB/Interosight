  "selftext": "binging and purging does absolutely nothing for me at the end of the day. \n\nits embarrassing, going through a full bag of candy in just a couple of days. it\u2019s expensive. going to bed with a stomach full of food makes me suicidal. it depletes my energy and demotivates me. it pushes people away. it makes me prioritize food over school work. it makes me secretive. it makes me hoard bags of vomit in my room. and it causes weight gain and increases my dysphoria. \n\nno pros whatsoever and it\u2019s been months since i\u2019ve went a week b/p free. how stupid of me to run back to it every single time. why can\u2019t i just stop. why can\u2019t i just let go of it. please give me a reason",

It sounds like the eating disorder has been going on for quite some time and has gotten pretty bad. You need help because that's something you're not going to give yourself when you hate yourself. In the meantime, practice self-forgiveness. Practice being ok with feeling uncomfortable. Practice being really present in your body, no matter how it feels and feeling grateful that you have a life. If you continue this pattern, you won't have a life. I've been struggling with purging too and I think the first step is being kind to yourself. If you can't do it for yourself right now, do it for somebody you love and every time you want to purge, think about how hurt they would be. Remember that thoughts aren't reality and that you are stronger than whatever your thoughts are telling you.",

I keep telling myself it\u2019s the last time. I agree with everything cmhamlet said, we need to remember how dangerous this is if we want to continue to live, & that we need to be kind to ourselves. \n\nLet\u2019s try to beat this together. We can overcome this. We can stop buying binge food. We can start by keeping down small amounts to get our bodies used to it & work our way up. I believe in you, friend, & I want you to recover & stick around the planet. Hugs!",
