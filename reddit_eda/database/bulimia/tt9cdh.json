  "selftext": "I can\u2019t 100% pinpoint what my problem is, as I have multiple different mental illnesses that factor into my daily life, but I\u2019ve noticed the worse my ED gets (particularly the perfectionism aspect, my main trigger is feeling like I must be perfect) the more difficult it is for me to shower and suspect my opposition to showering is rooted in ED. Between how long my hair is and shaving and stuff I tend to be in there a long time and spend most of it thinking to myself things like \u201comg my thighs look bigger\u201d among many other harsher thoughts and feel almost disturbed by it. Now I\u2019m going ridiculously long periods of time not showering (like a week) and it\u2019s interfering with my daily life because like I\u2019m too unkept to go out and really be around people. I think part of it is also I genuinely just don\u2019t want people to see me so it\u2019s an excuse to keep me from going out, maybe part of it is I don\u2019t want men to be attracted to me because I\u2019m sick of men hurting me. But my job is literally based on my appearance (entertainment industry).. I think part of me, not all of me but part of me just wants out of the industry and not maintaining my body/appearance is a pretty sure way out. I have a shitty therapist and struggling to find a good new therapist so I\u2019m not working through much at this time. Anyways.. I digress. Do any of you guys know what I mean with this?",

Using my phone flashlight or a single candle to light up enough off the room that I could see what I was doing but not enough that I'd have to look at my body. I've been in recovery for several years now, and on bad days I just don't look in the mirror. Usually though, I force myself to look. If I'm having a bad body day, I make myself shrug and move on. It helps minimize the negativity and enforce body neutrality which for me has been a life saver. Body positivity is great, but when you're recovering from dysmorohia, neutrality is an easier goal to achieve. Most days now, I do have a positive relationship with my body, but it's amazing when my weight fluctuates and I can honestly say it's not that important. Edit: spelling",

I started covering my mirrors last year to help with my eating disorder recovery. Every encounter with the mirror gave the eating disorder a reason to show up and criticize every part of me. Humans were not meant to look at ourselves as much as we do now with multiple mirrors in every room, social media, Zoom, it's endless! It's amazing how much of a difference not looking at myself all the time has made. It was a really hard habit to break at first but I'm so glad I did.
