  "selftext": "So I\u2019m well aware that it probably doesn\u2019t work this way and drug addiction is probably just as worse but I am so sick and tired of bulimia and this life that I actually consider just turning to drugs to make life more bearable and at least I might be skinny and maybe I\u2019ll die of drug abuse and that will be fine too. Anyone can relate?\n\nEdit: thank you so much for all the responses. It\u2019s a relief to see that there\u2019s more people that struggle with the same idea. But also its very helpful to have people share their experiences. It\u2019s clear to me now that adding a drug addiction won\u2019t help me a single bit, it will only make things so much worse. Ofcourse my \u2018healthy\u2019 brain already knew this but my disordered brain makes it seem so appealing. And apparently I\u2019m not alone in this. However, it won\u2019t make bulimia go away and probably just ruin things more. I hope anyone who reads this is safe and know you are not struggling alone. Sorry life puts you through this, sending love to y\u2019all ",

When I first started taking x (im not going to say what I was taking because I don\u2019t want anyone to get any ideas), it was the first time I got my bulimia under control. It actually made my addiction to x seem not so bad, because every time I would try to stop, I would fall right back into the bp cycle. But the addiction got so bad. It ruined my life and brain in ways that my ED never could. When I finally detoxed and went to rehab (and went though traumatic withdrawals, including seizures), I was at my lowest weight ever, was weaker because of my years with bulimia, and my body could barely handle it. The eating disorder was right there waiting for me. It\u2019s another addiction. I purged the day I got out of rehab, and gained 20 pounds within 3 months. It is not worth it. Drugs can ruin you in ways you never thought possible, in ways you can never recover from, it can change your personality, and worst of all, when you finally quit, the bulimia will be right there waiting for you. Adding drugs just meant one more near addiction that I had to recover from. Be safe.",

When I first started taking x (im not going to say what I was taking because I don\u2019t want anyone to get any ideas), it was the first time I got my bulimia under control. It actually made my addiction to x seem not so bad, because every time I would try to stop, I would fall right back into the bp cycle. But the addiction got so bad. It ruined my life and brain in ways that my ED never could. When I finally detoxed and went to rehab (and went though traumatic withdrawals, including seizures), I was at my lowest weight ever, was weaker because of my years with bulimia, and my body could barely handle it. The eating disorder was right there waiting for me. It\u2019s another addiction. I purged the day I got out of rehab, and gained 20 pounds within 3 months. It is not worth it. Drugs can ruin you in ways you never thought possible, in ways you can never recover from, it can change your personality, and worst of all, when you finally quit, the bulimia will be right there waiting for you. Adding drugs just meant one more near addiction that I had to recover from. Be safe.",
