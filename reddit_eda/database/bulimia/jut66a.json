  "title": "Advice from a Dental Hygienist",
  "selftext": "This is my first Reddit post ever and my stomach is churning so please excuse any errors. \n\nI\u2019m a practicing dental hygienist and I purged for the first time in about five months last night. \nI moved out on my own for the first time two months ago and I\u2019ve gained five pounds in that time from binge eating. My personal experience with purging as a dental professional had influenced me to make this post.  \n\nI\u2019ve seen a few posts on the dental side of reddit from people who struggle with eating disorders expressing their fear about going to the dentist. I wanted to offer some encouragement and reassurance that the people who work in a dental office are human too (some may struggle with b/p themselves) and as healthcare workers we\u2019re only concerned with helping you. \n\nThere are visible signs of acid wear (called erosion) on the teeth from stomach acid exposure. This is not just from purging but also acid reflux/GERD and morning sickness with pregnancy. Your dental professional may ask questions in an effort to determine the cause and help you by offering advice - this is not to discriminate or make you feel bad. We just want to help you take care of your teeth. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if this is allowed but the biggest piece of advice I can offer is to not brush your teeth after purging; instead rinse with some baking soda mixed with water to help neutralize the stomach acid. I know its an automatic reflex to brush and get the taste out of your mouth but you are causing even more harm by brushing away the enamel while it is weakened. \n\nIf anyone has questions about dental care I would be more than happy to try and help.",

I haven\u2019t heard of the tums thing before this thread so this is based off of quick research I\u2019ve done and professional opinion. I think tums are probably more harmful than good even if you\u2019re not swallowing them due to containing sugar and causing dry mouth because of how chalky they are - both of these can lead to increased risk of cavities. If you have problems rinsing with the baking soda then drink some water to wash away the taste/debris and wait at least 30+ minutes before brushing so the acidity level in your mouth has time to normalize.",

Long term use of antacids can cause issues with digestion/nutrient absorption because they alter the composition of your stomach acid, they are also likely to contain sugar and can lead to dry mouth both of which increase risk of cavities. Using the baking soda also ensures all the surfaces of your teeth are rinsed whereas Tums don\u2019t really have the same sort of effect since they\u2019re swallowed.",

It\u2019s not a very strong mint taste and isn\u2019t foamy; if you hate mint there are cinnamon flavoured toothpastes like crest cinnamon or close up that are fluoridated you could try. I don\u2019t recommend using kids toothpastes even though they have fruit flavours because the fluoride percentage is lower (if any) and won\u2019t be effective.",

There are bad seeds in every profession and the dental world gets a bad rap in general (on media, family horror stories, etc.) - I don\u2019t know how many times I\u2019ve had people tell me to my face they hate me and hate being at their appointment; it can become disheartening to have that and some people become bitter about the career they chose. \nSome good news is that the profession is evolving and new information is introduced into the curriculums each year so a lot of newer dentists/hygienist are more focused on what we call client cantered care and are therefore more interested in working with you to help you achieve your goals (I am one of those). \nI would highly recommend looking into getting your care done at a dental college where the work is performed by student and overseen by registered dentists/hygienist. At the dental hygiene school I went to our pricing was about half that of private practice and the students are on their best behaviour and practicing their communication skills. The biggest issue is time commitment because it takes much longer than private practice - for hygiene it was anywhere from 3-5, 2.5 hour appointments due to all the paperwork and check points. Otherwise, try to find an office that has good reviews online/low staff turnover and do what I did when looking for a job which is look at the dentists on ratemds.com to see what their patients are saying about the care they provide and their chairside manner as that will semi-reflect the behaviour of the other staff. In the end they\u2019re your teeth and you don\u2019t have to settle for a dental office or hygienist you hate; request to see a different hygienist in the future or take your money elsewhere. \nIt\u2019s great that you\u2019re even contemplating that first step and I encourage you to get things taken care of sooner rather than later because they won\u2019t improve on their own - they could even develop into infection or worse.

But if you\u2019re noticing it specifically on the backs of your teeth it might be what I referred to as \u201cerosion\u201d which is where the top layer of the tooth (called the enamel) has been worn away (in this case by acid) and is exposing the internal layer (called the dentin). Erosion is typical of purging because the stomach acid hits the back of the upper and lower teeth; though usually the upper teeth are the most affected. I would highly encourage that you go to a dental office for an exam so they can tell you definitively.",

I haven\u2019t heard of the tums thing before this thread so this is based off of quick research I\u2019ve done and professional opinion. I think tums are probably more harmful than good even if you\u2019re not swallowing them due to containing sugar and causing dry mouth because of how chalky they are - both of these can lead to increased risk of cavities. If you have problems rinsing with the baking soda then drink some water to wash away the taste/debris and wait at least 30+ minutes before brushing so the acidity level in your mouth has time to normalize.",
