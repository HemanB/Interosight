  "selftext": "Content Warning! (purging, self hate, dysphoria) \n\n\n\n\n\n\npeople who don\u2019t have an eating disorder will never understand the way it makes you feel. i\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the purging, but i stopped it hurt to drink, i had bile in my throat that i had trouble swallowing, and my throat was sore and scratchy, for weeks afterwards. i\u2019m still experiencing those symptoms. i\u2019ve been restricting myself from food because i can\u2019t purge anymore. ill end up overeating as a \u201creward\u201d (too many times a day), and afterwards, hate every part of my body. every time i eat, i compulsively put my hand on my stomach to feel how it\u2019s expanded, and it\u2019s been a habit of mine for over two years. i HATE the feeling of being full. i hate it so much. i can\u2019t stand it. it makes me feel ugly and disgusting. it all started when i was 13. i know why, but i feel helpless against it because i developed ptsd from those incidents. i feel like i\u2019ll never feel better unless i lose weight. even then, it doesn\u2019t last very long. i have a trainer. i trained for 8-10 months last year until the pandemic. i started again two months ago, but feel upset and destroyed because i don\u2019t look like how i looked last year. i\u2019m scared to look at myself in the mirror. i literally turn off the lights when i shower to avoid looking at my body while i\u2019m washing myself. i looked back at myself the other week from when my bulimia was at my worst, and i was so fit, and i\u2019m so envious of myself before i started training. i became overconfident and it contributed to my mania for a few months as well. still, i had so much dysphoria. it sucks. it hurts so bad. it\u2019s crazy how body dysmorphia can completely change the way you view yourself over something like how much you weigh . i feel horrible. i want to purge so bad right now, but itll hurt my throat so bad. people wouldn\u2019t understand this. i can\u2019t imagine having a healthy relationship with food or my body.",

Especially my nutritionist. She really believed I could find a \"happy weight\" if I could just stop under and over feeding my body. And she made me believe, and coached me.\n\nOne thing we worked on was eating really slowly so my brain could start getting fullness signals before I overate, because, like you, I would panic if I got that \"full\" feeling. So I was eating slowly and eating 4/6 small meals and snacks a day.\n\nOther good news is that I had developed Barrett's esophagus from vomiting, but 15 years later, it's healed. So that can happen, although I do still have to watch certain foods because my acid reflux problem seems permanent.\n\nThings can get better. You won't always feel this bad.",

I am building a life that I never thought I could have. I don't need antidepressants anymore. I can live and face the everyday fears and insecurities of life and just turn them over in a 10th step as I go about my day living my HP's will. That's my experience!  And it's not easy, it's not a magic pill that works permanently, but it works and I work it everyday bc I WILL go straight to binging my brains out if I don't take the action steap everyday. and that's ok with me! the freedom I get from the time I put in is indescribable. I was so selfishly wrapped up in myself that I ignored that there is a whole world out there and I am meant to be a part of it, and I can't be present for it ynless I get out of my head! if you have any qs let me know, i'm here to share my experience. and I am very grateful to walk this path with everyone on this board. \ud83d\ude1d\ud83c\udf38\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd70",

You\u2019re message is def my hp helping me out. I was hoping for an easier/quicker/softer way but know those aren\u2019t lasting solutions. Thank you again!",
