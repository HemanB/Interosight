  "title": "6 weeks without purging",
  "selftext": "I am doing an 'all in' bulimia recovery method and have not purged for 6 weeks. This method dictates that ANY sort of restriction is the enemy and purging is not an option. The goal is to be able to eat intuitively and finally be free from food and body obsessionfor ever. \n\nIt's extremely scary because I have to eat what ever my body or mind feels like until I am satiated without purging! At this stage, with the extreme hunger I have, this usually means until I am totally stuffed and very uncomfortable all day every day. I am expecting to put on a considerable amount of weight for a period of time until my hunger subsides and intuitive eating starts to kick in. Then my weight will settle at its natural set point and I have to work on loving my body at what ever that weight is. I'm expecting that process to take about a year.\n\nI am petrified and mortified about 'getting fat' but, after suffering with bulimia for over 20 years, I am starting to realise that I deserve more than that bitch ED telling me I'm not good enough. So until she's gone, I'm just going to ignore her, get fat and keep plodding along. It's time! \u2764\ufe0f",

I\u2019ve dumped him. I\u2019m still in recovery but it takes a great effort not to purge when I overeat. I\u2019m proud of you anyways.",
