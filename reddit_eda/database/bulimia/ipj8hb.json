Alcohol, like bulimia, was a solution to problems that I knew of no other solution for. It was an obsession. I craved it. The more I ingested it, the more I wanted. After drinking, I\u2019d be full of remorse and guilt. I wanted desperately to stop but I couldn\u2019t. I tried multiple things.. drinking less, drinking only wine, drinking only with friends, etc. nothing worked, I always found myself going to the point of blackout. I was hurting my body. My self esteem was in the gutter. I would muster up a resolve that by will alone, I\u2019d never do it again! And the next day after drinking I would think, what happened? Where was my resolve? Why can\u2019t I just stop it? Alcoholism is a liar. It tells me that it\u2019s not that bad, that I can have just one drink or that I deserve a drink. It lies and deceives. I am no match for it. \n\nI got sober through AA. The next thing I want to try is Overeaters Anonymous. The difference between alcoholism and an eating disorder is that I must never touch a drink again, but I must continue to eat. So I\u2019m hoping OA has figured out a way of doing things to help me be free.\nMost alcoholics have cross addictions, like many with bulimia. Binge shopping, sex, gambling, video games. These things all release the dopamine that our addicted brains crave in intense and unnatural ways. It truly is a disease of the brain.",

      "body": "Hi, I haven't read all the other comments, but yes - bulimia consists of 3 addiction types - addiction from certain foods (sugar, wheat), addiction from the process (emptying) and obsession with body image (never thin/perfect enough). Even if we eat the \"right foods\", we can still suffer from the two other. The addiction from the purging process is the worst, because it has no \"end result\" (in opposing to getting drunk), it is the same type as working out - you get the high while the process takes place, therefore the purging can go on forever. And even if we force ourselves to eat the right foods and stop purging, the obsession with the body image can still be triggering enough.",

      "body": "I absolutely think so! Of course, there are different types of bulimics: the ones who are truly anorexic and so afraid of food they feel they have to throw up after every meal (and usually only eat in social situations or with family to hide their problem); and then there are those who are technically binge.eaters who are.juat throwing up after to try to offset the binge. It's not exactly a weight loss strategy. It is absolutely food addiction! And if you're someone with control issues around food (and everything else) then dieting might just make it worse. The only thing that has helped me is getting into intermittent fasting (anywhere from 18-60 hours without eating) and allowing myself to \"eat all the things\" in my eating window. I don't throw up after (generally, but I have my moments) because I know I need to eat and also your stomachs shrinks when you fast so you can only get so much food in. I go back on my fast afterwards so there's no real damage. Our human race hasived through plenty of \"feast and famine\" throughout history and it's only recently that food is so abundant that people are eating 3-5 square meals a day in small portions. It is natural to want to eat all the foods when they're there- like we haven't quite caught up with our current reality on a genetic basis. So don't be so hard on yourself! Also it might be best to avoid alcohol and other drugs if you have an issue controlling those urges too, as that can do a lot of damage. I personally quit weed a little over 3 months ago and this has helped a lot with my binges, but I started drinking.more alcohol to compensate (lol) so now I'm working on letting that go too. So, uh..yeah...",
