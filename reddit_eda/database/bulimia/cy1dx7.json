There is nothing wrong with you even if your brain told you differently for way too long. I. LOVE. YOU! We're all in this together.",

What u said about how we perceive others and their happiness could not be more true to me. Sometimes I talk to people that on a daily base think about completely different things and I wonder why on earth I would be the one having these abnormal behavior yet we forget that that is what we perceive, not an objective truth. Thanks for your reply :*",
