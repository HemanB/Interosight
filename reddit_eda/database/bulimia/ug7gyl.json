This is odd, but sometimes when I feel down or hopeless I drive past restaurants and look at people having a great time eating with friends. That\u2019s truly one of the main reasons I am doing this. I miss having a vibrant social life, and we deserve to bond with friends and family over food and laughs without being interrupted by the toilet and stomach pain!",
