  "selftext": "I have this friend (she doesn't have an ED) and I'm so jealous of her for the stupidest reason. It's so wrong and I hate myself for it. Every time I mention eating, she always says \"she didn't eat for x time\" because she just can't be bothered to eat, or she just didn't think about eating. And I envy that. I wish I had no motivation to eat. I wish I didn't cope with things by eating. I wish I wasn't thinking about food 24/7. She knows I have bulimia, and I'm sure she doesn't do it on purpose, but every time she says it I wish I could just ... not eat for days. Of course, I can't do that because all I think about is food but I just wish. I wish even for one day I could just not eat.",

She very well could have a problem with eating, too. None of my friends knew I had an ED (unless I told them), because I hid it so well. Maybe she feels the need to mention her lack of eating for validation. I could be wrong, but my point is, don\u2019t beat yourself up. You are working through your issues; don\u2019t let what she says get you down. Perhaps avoid talking about eating with her? You should find friends who make you feel loved and safe, not that trigger harmful thoughts. I love you and hope the best for you. You\u2019re doing great. You\u2019re not alone.",
