  "selftext": "my roommates are back and i was hoping that their return would mean i would b/p less because it would be harder to hide. \n\nbut no. \n\ninstead, my dumb ed brain thinks it\u2019s okay to b/p the ice cream and other snacks they buy. they haven\u2019t said anything yet, but i know they\u2019ve noticed some of our food going missing at an alarming rate . . . yet i\u2019m looking somewhat skinny . . . and i take really long showers . . . and sometimes my face looks puffy . . .\n\nit\u2019s just a matter of time before one of them says something, and i know it will be out of genuine concern for my well-being because they\u2019re both amazing people, but it\u2019ll be so embarrassing for me. like what do they do with me? lock me in my room and feed me normal portioned meals??\n\ni don\u2019t know where to go from here. i just feel so alone.",

      "body": "Well, idk if this helps you in any way, but I\u2019ve been living with a roommate for almost a year and with his ex first few months. Pal, both of them knew I was bulimic, but it started exactly like this. Them buying snacks and those going missing, because I have zero, cold hard zero self control. Then slowly, it did not matter if I cleaned the toilet/sink or whatever my sick brain decided to purge into, because the smell fucking stays (even more if you live in a flat instead of house). With bulimia or any other mental illness, there are hardcore moodswings and if you can handle them for now, it\u2019s more than possible that one day your insides say \u201cthat\u2019s enough!\u201d and you\u2019ll let it all out. That\u2019s how all the good with my roommates ended at least - they couldn\u2019t handle my moodswings and things dissapearing to trash. Even the one that lives here to this day (he\u2019s moving out in 2 weeks) told me straight into my face that if I asked if I could take that food, he\u2019d say yes, he\u2019d be more content knowing what is and isn\u2019t at home but under a condition that I\u2019d eat it, enjoy it and it would stay inside, not go to waste by purging it. Also, binges are expensive as fuck. When your roommates start realising what is actually happening and after some fight to get you into normal eating (which in my case failed, but I stopped eating almost completely to stopnpurging), they\u2019ll just hide stuff. Eat somewhere else. Buy only the food for day amd that\u2019s it",
