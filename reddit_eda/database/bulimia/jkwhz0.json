      "body": "My girl. My girl. And all of y\u2019all. This is not it.\n\nI\u2019ve been on this garbage illness for a decade. I\u2019ve been overweight, underweight, normal weight, and everything in between. I\u2019ve had virtually every male friend I\u2019ve had try it on with me. Regardless of weight. It\u2019s not about \u201cbeing snatched\u201d. It\u2019s about your personality and perspective on the world. I used to be mad superficial and selfish, with about zero self esteem. And all the dudes who\u2019d pull up would be utter trash - the kinda guys who would point out a stretch mark or have you over but not give you food bc they \u201calready ate\u201d so you\u2019re drinking on an empty stomach whilst trying to recover. \n\nWork on yourselves. Not necessarily your ED. Take online courses. Public speaking, economics, just anything random. Start building your confidence in different areas. Become the intelligent and articulate people we are all meant to be. It\u2019s only through working on different areas of my life that I became confident to trust myself to date. I\u2019ve got a partner now who is loving, attentive and a keeper (after years of 3 month wastemen). \n\nI\u2019m at virtually the highest weight of my adult life (bordering between normal and overweight) and have the best relationship of my life. Sure, I don\u2019t really like being naked or feel super comfortable with my body during sex or when we go out, but I didn\u2019t need to be thin to get the man. Not all men love thin. And if that\u2019s what a man loves in you, will he still love you when you\u2019re older and not hitting the gym so often? It\u2019s far more sustainable to find a man based on shared values and interests than who is just into you for being hot. And y\u2019all probably hot af. But that attracts fuckbois too. Y\u2019all too good for that shit.",

She works out but she also nourishes her body eating food she wants and it reminds me I can do the same. My psych told me bingeing occurs when I don\u2019t give myself the foods or nutrients my body craves. Classic example: I haven\u2019t bought bread from the supermarket in so long bc I\u2019ve tried \u201ccutting it out\u201d *eye roll at myself* bc what does that even achieve...This makes me crave pizza and garlic bread like crazy, both of which are pretty carb dense foods. I don\u2019t give into these cravings in the short term but in the long term it almost makes me go crazy in the inside bc I\u2019m controlling the craving. Sooner or later I can\u2019t control it and I will binge eat like 2 pizzas and a garlic bread loaf in one sitting and feel like shit afterwards. All this cutting out and bingeing certain foods can\u2019t be good for my metabolism which I already complain as being slow which I attribute to my 6 years of having an eating disorder. I hate me for giving you such cliched advice not even I want to hear but remember that weight loss or getting fit is a long term goal and it can only be achieved when you equate true health as being a marriage of a health mind AND the body. See if you strive for a healthy body w/ a very toxic mind or cognition (trying to plan starves, saying \u201cI ate this today so I\u2019m going to starve tomorrow\u201d, your body can\u2019t be healthy. It needs the partnership of a healthy cognitive thinking process too. You\u2019re not a clown\u2014your mind is. For playing tricks and making you obsessed with short term fixes and weight loss goals. Tell you clown mind to back the eff off. The glow up will come. Just take it a day at a time.

What draws me to her videos are her voiceovers for the vlogs. It\u2019s in the style of a monologue where she\u2019s reflecting and talking to herself, reassuring herself that it\u2019s okay to eat foods she wants or craves. I see her as an embodiment of both a healthy body and mind. I also appreciate that she isn\u2019t stick skinny. She has a really healthy glow and she looks strong.
