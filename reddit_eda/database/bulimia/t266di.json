  "selftext": "when i was a kid, whenever adults would talk about eating disorders at all (which was rare in an of itself), anorexia was presented as dieting taken too far, and bulimia was presented as an icky bad habit. \n\ni wish they would warn us about the dangers of EDs the same way they warned us about drugs in our school years. all the warnings i was given about heroin can be applied to my ED more accurately than anything i was actually told about EDs. \n\n\"it will take over your life.\" \"you'll rely on it every day.\" \"you'll convince yourself you can stop any time, but you can't.\" \"it will ruin your hair, skin, and teeth.\" \"you'll always feel like shit.\" \"it'll drain you financially.\" \"it'll be hard to think of anything else.\" \"it will change you as a person.\" \"it will screw up your relationships with your friends and family.\" \"you'll feel like you can't cope with life without it.\" \n\nand more than anything: \"it doesn't take much to become addicted.\"\n\nall i can think about today is how no one fucking warns us. no one wants to even try to talk about it until it's too late.",
