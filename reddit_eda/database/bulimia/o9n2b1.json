Im constantly challenging myself by actually looking in the mirror and talking positively to myself and even taking pics of myself little by little so that one day I just wont be scared or\ntriggered by it.",

      "body": "I know how this feels and it's horrible. In these situations you get tunnel vision and all that matters is how you look or how dissatisfied you are with how you look. For those in recovery it is really helpful to limit mirror time. I have my full length mirror covered so that I'm not constantly looking at myself and I am working on not body checking in the mirror. Human beings were not meant to be looking at ourselves as much as we do now. Whether it's in mirrors, pictures, social media or zoom, all of this is way too much time spent looking at ourselves, and criticizing how we look. For your own mental health, be aware of how much time you spend in the mirror or taking photos. Try to limit that time so that you don't end up spiraling.\n\nThere's a great tool to reframe how you feel about your body/appearance. Even if you don't have children or want children, this can still be helpful.\n\nImagine you have a daughter and she is your exact age, she looks identical to you, she is exactly where you are in your life right now. She is struggling with her body image and how she looks. She feels bad about herself, she obsesses, she spirals and cries. What would you say to her? What advice would you give her? How would you comfort her? Would you try and help her see the bigger picture? Would you tell her that she is right and she should feel bad about herself?\n\nThis kind of exercise should help you realize that you are deserving of the same compassion, love and care that you would give to your hypothetical daughter. You are so much more than how you look. You are a complex human being with so many amazing traits and your body is just a vehicle. It helps you live your life and do all the things that you want to do. Focus on all that you do have and what your body allows you to do instead of tearing it down. I promise if you keep trying to change the way you talk to yourself, you will start to see yourself in a whole new light. \u2764\ufe0f",
