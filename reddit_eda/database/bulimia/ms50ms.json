      "body": "Not necessarily unstable. I am currently in recovery, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m perfect. The point for me is that while I would choose to be skinnier if I could, because I don\u2019t practice the same habits it is not the foremost thought in my mind. I want to lose weight and when it comes up I still don\u2019t love my body, but I don\u2019t spend every waking hour hating myself and focusing on the physical. Recovery doesn\u2019t always mean rainbows and sunshine and having the perfect mental image, sometimes it just means living a life that isn\u2019t focused on everything wrong with me. I hope that not thinking about it in black and white terms makes it a little easier to see a path to recovery. Please feel free to reach out if you need someone to listen!",

But believe it or not (I have always thought I was fat since I was 7) when you find recovery you do reach a point where you feel content. You can\u2019t see it now but it\u2019s important for you to know that it is possible xx",
