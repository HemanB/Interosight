  "selftext": "I told my fianc\u00e9 my ED has gone too far and I need to assemble a treatment team again. He asked if he should be concerned (this is how he gauges if I am concerned and how to handle my situation). I said yes immediately out of honesty and then instantly regretted it. And then all of a sudden it\u2019s like I had my ED voice SCREAMING in my brain to just shut up and take it all back. That I can get skinny for our wedding and *then* get help. That\u2019s 5 months away. Logical me knows it\u2019s already gone too far...\n\nI\u2019m on my therapist\u2019s schedule for Wednesday evening. I also asked him to refer me to a psychiatrist and a dietician (I haven\u2019t seen either in about 9 years now). \n\nThis is the worst my ED voice in my head has ever been. I feel like I\u2019m two different people and it\u2019s freaking me out. I try to be as open with my fianc\u00e9 as I can because he\u2019s so willing to listen and help and understand so I tried explaining to him I\u2019m going to get help because I need it but I hate it and don\u2019t want to get better at the same time. I just need some support from you guys. I want to be healthy but the want to be skinny is just a little bit stronger. There is a war going on in my mind everyday now especially when I eat ANYTHING. \n\n2021 New Years resolution: Start the recovery process \n\nAnyone want to join me? \ud83e\udd17",

I think (hope) that as recovery gets further along, that shifts more into the camp of 'life is pretty good now that I'm eating' rather than raging ED voices.\n\nYour fiance sounds like a really amazing person and make sure you tell him how much you appreciate him. Seems like a really good, healthy situation that you feel comfortable stepping outside your comfort zone with him. \n\nYou're going to like your wedding photos so much more when you look at them and see that you were healthier and working on being better you, and better health :)",

I\u2019m still working on accepting that recovery is even possible. I\u2019ve essentially just swapped one ED for another for years so sometimes it feels like it\u2019s just not possible for me. Trying to stay hopeful and I\u2019m thankful I have people in my life to offer me words of encouragement when I\u2019m doubting my strength. I really appreciate all the time you put into writing this. I hold onto the pro recovery advice I get from this group. Happy new year!",
