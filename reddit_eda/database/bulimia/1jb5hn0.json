But I had twins and the pregnancy was fraught with issues of gestational diabetes and blood pressure swings, so suddenly I had so much more to consider and it wasn't about just me any more. \n \nI was so sick the first trimester I was never bulimic sick because I was just pregnant sick. And eating was very very hard. By the time I was over that food sensitivity I was so big that I could barely eat as there was just no room in my abdomen for food. So the whole thing was bizarre. \n\nAs soon as I gave birth I was more or lass back to my usual cycle of binging and purging, more so than usual from the stress of first time mum with new born twins and army husband shipped out when they were 3 weeks old. And then it happened (the story above). I knew in that moment I was the most worthless mother, most selfish human, that had ever been, and I had to do better. \n\nI can happily say that was the last time I purged, after having done it for almost 30 years. And with a LOT of therapy and medication, my binging is now under control as well. So I still consider myself bulimic, because for me it's like being alcoholic. Every morning I wake up and want to relapse, and I think I always will. But that isn't enough to make me, now. And that's a pretty good place to be at.",
