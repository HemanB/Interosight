  "selftext": "I just had a realization that this isn\u2019t about my body for the most part. Yes I purge to not gain weight, but it\u2019s only because I binge. The food turns of my brain off and then when I\u2019m done I don\u2019t want to put on a bunch of weight. Another weird reason is it gives me something to do. I\u2019m so lonely and bored that focusing all day on either a binge or getting rid of the calories fills up my day and it gives me something to focus on other than my feelings. Even the guilt gives me something to do. ",
