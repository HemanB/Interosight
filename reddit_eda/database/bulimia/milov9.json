I have a male friend who has exactly that issue, doesn't mean he shouldn't gain more weight as he is unhealthily skinny. BMI is used as a form of how healthy your body weight is. Recommended BMI 18.5-25 for adults below 60 or 70ish. Anything below 16 means they should visit a doctor and dietitian.  \nI see why you might feel it's body shaming but **I** prefer people to be healthy and I think most people do, because of biological evolution/selection. However there's about 7 billion people with many different preferences, we have people who love extremely obese people and even feed them (feeders), we have people that marry cars, sex dolls, or even pillows, we even have people who prefer animals or even weirder.   \nJust because guys 1-10 don't like you doesn't mean guys 11-20 don't like you. Just because there are preferences  doesn't mean your ugly. Also even if you're the hottest woman in the world there will still be plenty of guys that don't like how you look or prefer many other women (and I assume vice versa for women).",
