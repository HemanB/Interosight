  "selftext": "It\u2019s so weird how seamlessly an eating disorder can coexist into your life. At one point it becomes so imbedded that you think nothing of it. Binge. Purge. Restrict. It\u2019s almost like second nature. Here I am, living a completely normal life. Working a normal job and doing normal people shit. I don\u2019t even think about it anymore. It\u2019s just how my life works. Occasionally I\u2019ll have moments of clarity with my head in the toilet bowl but it\u2019s nothing more than a fleeting thought. I stopped looking at this page because every time I visit I\u2019m reminded that my perfectly normal world is entirely fucked up.",

People have no idea about the binge/purge/restrict monster that lives inside me. I\u2019ve said \u201cthis is just my life now, this is how we eat and view food\u201d to myself so many times. This is my life now. You are not alone!!",

Like palpitations, weird muscles sensations and tingling, blood sugar issues, dizziness, insomnia, and overall I feel SO NOT OK and not normal but at the same time I\u2019m so used to it. Living like this has become my default. I had to take time off from college due to my mental health and eating disorder interfering and my relationships have suffered but I still work full time and am kinda living a normal life. I forget  it\u2019s not normal to live in this state of constant suffering. I can\u2019t even imagine how good it feels to live without bulimia, without daily binging and purging, without panicking after every meal. It makes me kinda hopeful but also scared and sad because right now it feels so out of reach.",
