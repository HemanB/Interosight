Took too long in the bathroom, fianc\u00e9e was questioning why I was in there so long.\n\nToilet flusher wasn\u2019t working so it took me 20 minutes to take the back of the toilet off and fix the flusher thing. So embarrassing, tried to pass it off as a stomach ache but I\u2019m past the point of my family buying into my bullshit.\n\nI am so tired, and just want this all to end.",
