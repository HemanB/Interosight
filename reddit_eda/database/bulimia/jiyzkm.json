Not necessarily physically stomach rumbling but I always feel kind of weak like I haven't eaten enough (i have, not restricting), dizzy, or just waiting for my next meal.

I ate a whole jar of Nutella the other day (not a binge was just hungover haha) with a friend, who was so confused at what I was doing. I polished it off like a snack. That was only about 5% of what I ate that day.\n\nI can out eat most people! It's embarrassing and would usually try and hide my appetite.",
