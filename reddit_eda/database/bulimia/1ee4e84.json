Like yesterday I was convinced I have fucking worms - then remembered I ate quinoa and the tiny white \u201eworms\u201c were just germs from it\ud83d\ude2d same happened when I ate cheese sticks \ud83d\ude2d\nOr for example I thought I threw up blood (which happened before so I\u2018m always searching for signs ig) - turns out it was jam. Or half digested salad,\u2026\nNot to forget the moment I thought I had internal injuries because I threw up black/ dark brown anything (it was half digested salad and a liter of Coke Zero\ud83d\ude2d)\n\nPls tell me I\u2019m not alone with this!!\ud83d\ude2d",
