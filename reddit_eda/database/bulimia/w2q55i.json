  "selftext": "Idk, I guess this is a warning post.\n\nI had an endoscopy about a month ago and got the results about a week after. They confirmed my stomach is paralyzed, with moderate gastritis throughout my entire stomach/colon.\n\nI\u2019ve been purging since 19, and I\u2019m 25 now. I would puke after every meal and b/p for hours on the weekends, sometimes up to 20+ times a day.\n\nI am prescribed ensures, reglan, and enough zofran for a cancer patient. My life is constant stomach pain and bloating. It\u2019s on the foreground of my mind all day how much my stomach hurts. I have since drastically reduced the amount I purge, but the damage has been done. The docs told me taking reglan (gut motility stimulator) will eventually lead to tremors, so I have that to look forward to as well.\n\nI\u2019m just sharing this because I want everyone to be careful. There CAN be lasting damage from this disease. I almost wish I would\u2019ve lost my teeth instead, at least I could get veneers. You can\u2019t get a new stomach.\n\nStay safe. I\u2019m open to questions.",

I assume what fucked it up the most is that I learned how to do it hands-free. Now I haven't done it in months and I'm still unable to process food normally. Any time I get too full I involuntarily throw up, or at least start regurgitating it which feels gross. My stomach also often hurts for no reason and pills like Nexium don't help. I've been to doctors before and got a gastroscopy done but they said everything looks fine. And I also get nauseated easily which means I can't enjoy many of the foods I used to like before.\n\nThis went off the trail but I just wanted to share my own experience I've never seen anyone warn others about before.

At the height of my disorder I never thought of the long lasting consequences - all I could hear was the voices of those around me telling me how good I looked in an outfit;  that I looked the best I ever had.  I told myself I had to do whatever possible to stay that way including injure my body to the point of no return.  My greatest hope is that there are those who will read your post, mine, and those of others on this forum and realize they need help and get it before the scars are too far to be fixed.",

I started purging meals I had the day prior, with tons of bloating, random vomiting, and bathroom issues. I just wasn\u2019t digesting anything anymore.\n\nIt took me a few years of tests and different doctors to take me seriously because of my age, and when they did, they took it SERIOUSLY. I highly recommend seeking a decent GI doctor and suggesting you may have gastroparesis. The zofran alone is life-changing. The reglan helps, but its also been giving me bathroom issues and the high risk of tremors scares me. But it\u2019s either that or throwing up dinner in the middle of the night every night.\nI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this as well. I hope you don\u2019t have gastroparesis but I\u2019d really recommend seeing different docs.",
