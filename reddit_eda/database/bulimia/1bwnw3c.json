I\u2019m sure I have met some people who were, but there was just no way of me knowing. That\u2019s literally so scary that it\u2019s so difficult to tell if someone has it. I always see bulimics online. There\u2019s this woman that I follow on TikTok who obviously has bulimia and she has literally said it herself. But still, so many people in her comment section are literally clueless. They try to come up with any explanation to the behavior that she\u2019s doing. I literally saw a fat phobic comment about how everyone who is saying she has an eating disorder is just trying to cope with being fat. Like, she is literally binge eating and posting it for everyone to see. She is very underweight. It is so obvious as to what she is doing. It\u2019s like everyone is in denial about bulimics. I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s so taboo when it\u2019s such a common disorder. ",

The lesson I took from this was a reminder that:\n\na) Mental health education is not where it should be;  \nb) Bulimia is portrayed as a butt of the joke/insult behaviour pattern in which people choose to throw up their food, and;  \nc) Normies will not understand your eating disorder, no matter what you tell them, until they have something equivalent (i.e., an addictive behaviour disorder).",

I've had weight loss surgery, and sometimes I actually seem to forget (after 11 years\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f, clearly I'm still a bit of an emotional eater at times, honestly) that my stomach pouch is the size of a banana now and not a football, and I eat a little more than I should, and the only way to feel better is to just get some back out. So yes, this happens sometimes. But my partner doesn't get that. \"Did you just throw up,\" he asks. \"Yeah, I think I just ate too much,\" I say. But I'm always careful to pull my sleeve back down before I leave the bathroom. I've never said this out loud before or typed it publicly as such. If you notice this happening to your person, talk to them, and do it in a loving, helpful way, not in an accusing way, because that does tend to be his tone when he does ask that question, which makes me even more reluctant to share this with him.

I said that in the mirror plenty of times, but I always thought other people, especially beautiful, confident people at any weight living their best life with no eating disorder, were a lot more beautiful than myself. \n\nAll eating disorders are hell on earth, and they all have their own specific struggles, but they are rarely about judging other people for their weight, and instead all about judging and controlling yourself, and all of us with these disorders are suffering.

The lesson I took from this was a reminder that:\n\na) Mental health education is not where it should be;  \nb) Bulimia is portrayed as a butt of the joke/insult behaviour pattern in which people choose to throw up their food, and;  \nc) Normies will not understand your eating disorder, no matter what you tell them, until they have something equivalent (i.e., an addictive behaviour disorder).",
