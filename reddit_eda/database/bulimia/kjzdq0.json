  "selftext": "Convinced myself that I can do both Christmas Eve & Christmas without purging but who am I fooling? \ud83e\udd21 \n\nWith the gatherings and big family meals, there was a lot of family drama going on, and I noticed that no one was really paying attention to me. So being the clown that I am, I decided to purge throughout the day whenever I wanted, just to test out my theory.\n\nI told everyone that I have an upset stomach/need to go to the bathroom, multiple times throughout the day & no one cared. Hell, at one point I just walked out in the middle of the meal and when I came back no one noticed.\n\nI was practically doing it just for the adrenaline rush & to entertain myself. And I wasn\u2019t even binging, so it got to the point where it wasn\u2019t even worth it to do it anymore. There was an incident involving me purging in the nastiest bathroom at a dim sum restaurant that made me shiver to just even think about.\n\nAnd now I\u2019m just so disappointed in myself for being so... childish, I guess? I\u2019m a grown ass adult ffs, and I spent weeks prior to this convincing myself that I won\u2019t purge because I\u2019ve been doing so well. But family gatherings like this always make me feel like a child cos everyone is treating me like one. And it\u2019s safe to say this is definitely one of the rock bottoms of this year for me. So... merry Christmas, I guess? \ud83d\ude43",
