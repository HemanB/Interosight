  "title": "I went grocery shopping with my dad today",
  "selftext": "Usually going to the grocery store stresses me out to no end but I've been staying with my dad a lot more so we decided to go grocery shopping together. He knows about my disorder and so he let me pick out most of the food based on stuff I know I'm less likely to binge. In the past he has disregarded all of this and the house has only had junk food in it which was my worst nightmare. There was nothing that I could eat without binging or feeling guilty. So it was a great experience to have him care about me and be willing to make some changes on my behalf. We found new safe foods and he was really encouraging the whole time. It seems so simple but it absolutely made my day. It's nice to finally have a win, you know?",
