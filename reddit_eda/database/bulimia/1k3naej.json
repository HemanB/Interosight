  "selftext": "Last night I binged over 10k calories and right as I was trying to purge, my body wouldn\u2019t let me purge out hardly anything. I purged 2 days prior to this fairly easily and successfully, but I was purged for like 4 hours that day. Since I couldn\u2019t purge anything out (hardly anything), I started to stress out, freak out, cry, and felt like a failure and was scared for all the weight I was gonna gain. I never wanted to die more than ever then.  I started to hurt myself by cutting myself. I felt like a failure. I called my dad and his gf, my brother, and him came over and supported me and stopped me from hurting myself more than I did. They cleaned up my wounds and I luckily didn\u2019t cut to deep to go to the hospital. I still had the worst night sleep ever. This morning the guilt is hitting me hard and I still feel so uncomfortably full and tired from the binge last night. I say this to say I wish this disorder on nobody. I wish and pray for you all to recover and get the help you need. This is a serious mental health disorder that deserves to be addressed. I hope u all have a great Easter and a better day than me. ",

I am on medication, currently on olanzapine. I do get support for my mh and ed. I\u2019ve been with an all virtual ed program for over a year now, but I\u2019m starting a php program hopefully this week. My family is looking for higher level of care.
