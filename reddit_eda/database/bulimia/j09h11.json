  "title": "After suffering from bulimia for 15 years I am on day 3 ( of forever, hopefully ) of being b/p free",
  "selftext": "It is the weirdest feeling in the world, I literally woke up 3 days ago and had no urge to b/p. After 15 years of purging daily, sometimes multiple times a day, I woke up that day and just decided I don\u2019t want to put my body through it anymore.\n\nIt isn\u2019t that easy, trust me.  In between those 15 years I\u2019ve been hospitalized, been to therapy, had my weight fluctuate by 30 pounds on either end of the scale, and plenty more rock bottoms. I\u2019ve tried countless times to recover and quit but I was so deep into my bulimia it became a daily routine. It wasn\u2019t about the food anymore but about the control I had to make myself throw up. \n\nI\u2019ve always had issues with self imagine and self worth and the bulimia was just a hurricane to it. I was with the most toxic guy I have ever come across and it made my self worth that much worse. \n\nThese past months I did a lot of self reflecting and confiding in my close friends and it has helped me tremendously ( not about my ED). I now know my worth, set boundaries, see that I am worth recovery, that this eating disorder doesn\u2019t define me or have to control me. I have a new outlook on life and a new drive. \n\nWhen I woke up that morning and decided to not b/p something else awoke within me. There was nothing traumatic or significant that happened the day before or even weeks before but I woke up with a desire to live again, to take control of my life back and not just scoot along until I die. \n\nThis is just a little rant and I hope everyone is doing well in their recovery!\n\n\ud83d\udc9e\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the kind words and upvotes. I never imagined my little rant would get so much attention. I wish everyone recovering or suffering from this all the best!  No one understand what we go through unless they\u2019ve been there and I find this community to be nothing but amazing!",

I was always obese growing up, family bashing me telling me to lose weight and that i would look more pretty and if i didn't lose weight no one would marry me.. btw im Arabian. i swear if ur not skinny ur ugly.. so toxic. so basically senior year HS i was 18 i started losing weight healthy i kept it from everyone yk doing my own thing and i started seeing results ahhh i was so happy so basically i lost 80 pounds in 9-10 months i was 120 i was so happy but still thought i was big..  people around me kept saying \"omg go eat you look dead\" \"go eat a burger\" \"you looked better before\" \"you lost beauty\" \"ur face is so skinny\" omg when they said this i just felt SO ANGRY i felt like the Hulk SMASH, these motherfuckers like WTH first yall wanna attack me for being obese now this. I WAS IN RAGEEEE, and these piss of shits kept saying in party's \"omg she looks like an old lady\" BOIII I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA LOSE IT THERE. After all the bashing, hearing those comments made about me i felt anger, rage it made me want to even go further. Thats when i met the devil bulimia it lasted 2 year. Everytime i woud eat it would go to the toliet even if it was healthy.. it was getting really bad it lasted for 2 years i was 18. Now im 20 & recovering!!! woohoo!!!! I haven't purged for months, proud of myself. What made me stop is teeth. I saw so many pics of peoples teeth after bulimia AND BOY I WAS SCARED. I WAS HAVING NIGHTMARES OF MY TEETH FALLING !! & then i realized purging is not worth it!! i rather have a beautiful smile. AND MY HAIR WAS FALLING, i was literally balding AND so that made me depressed so i had to get my life together I HIT ROCK BOTTOM. i just wanted to be happy and happy in my own body. F\\*CK everyone else i aint pleasing anyone THIS IS MY BODY NOT URS I CAN DO ANYTHING I WANT! My mindset has changed about food and everything. As soon as i stopped listening to those motherf\\*ckers were saying about me I CHANGED. I FEEL POWERFUL I TOOK CONTROL OVER MY LIFE. Now i have a good relationship with food. I eat high volume YUMMY foods & it keeps me FULL to the point were i don't even want to binge eat anymore. I learned to eat the foods i LOVEEE in moderation. I can finally say i am happy.. hehe lowkey crying typing this.. i just cant believe this is me ahhhhh i am shook i have come so far and i am so proud of myself. My hair has stopped falling its getting healthy, my skin ITS GLOWING FINALLYYY YAY!!!  I realized were human our body's will always change and thats okay!!

I hope that you'll find, like me, once you're not b/p all day every day that your mood begins to stabilize quite a bit. It's not sunshine and rainbows all the time, but it's not constant misery and torture.

I have a few very close friends but at this age they are all either married and have kids or have a partner and I\u2019m single. \n\nI tried \u201cgetting out there\u201d and online dating but it never really worked out. Now have to find a way to make friends in my 30s who have the same interest as me and available to hang out, after SIP of course. \n\nI am learning to appreciate the little things in life and find the beauty in everything. I have recently been diagnosed with mild depression and ADHD so it just adds to the tornado. I am looking forward to my recovery and become the person I was again before my ED. I remember her being empathetic, kind and gentle, and this ED has made me become the exact opposite. \n\nThank you for your replies, it\u2019s truly appreciated!",
