And Google recipes.\n\nSometimes I plan a night away to myself in a hotel just so I can binge. I've never done it before because it's always been a 'when I reach xx lbs' reward which I never reach.\n\nI literally dream about bingeing. I tell myself I don't have to purge if it's a planned binge. But I always purge it anyway because I can't deal with digesting all that food. I feel like shit after too. I hate purging but it's better than the guilt. It's a cycle for sure",

Wine is drunk in copious amounts from double-handled silver cups, while a lyre plays in the background. There are performing troupes, poets, even the occasional leopard, and sometimes rose petals flutter down from on high. One sadistic host, the Emperor Elagabalus, built a banquet hall with a false ceiling that tilted open, allowing a torrent of flowers to rain down upon his unsuspecting guests, smothering to death those unable to crawl out from under the floral deluge.\u201d \n\nhttps://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/05/20/712772285/the-lavish-roman-banquet-a-calculated-display-of-debauchery-and-power?t=1602323165573",
