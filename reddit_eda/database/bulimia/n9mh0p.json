  "selftext": "I\u2019m dealing with a lot of health problems lately and really made the decision today to put my health first and not try to puke or even take laxatives which is huge because I\u2019ve been taking them a lot lately and felt like I had no control over taking them or not. But today I am in control. Getting surgery done in the near future so I have to get used to not taking them or purging so I feel like this is a step in the right direction. Thanks for listening\u2764\ufe0f",

I'm so happy for you!\u2764\u2764\u2764 Today I struggled with my mind a little bit, i was going to walk go the bathroom for no specific reason, but I turned myself around and told myself dont do it today-you have been sick lately with a sore throat and this will make it all worse and make your body weaker... I dont purge alot, but sometimes if I eat too much.. I hope you all are doing ok",
