  "selftext": "First boyfriend held my hair back and helped me throw up, he said that \"if this is how you wanna lose weight that's fine\" and encouraged it, enabled it, even forced it sometimes. \n\nSecond boyfriend hated it, avoided it, didn't let me talk about it, shamed me and called me disgusting.\n\nThird, and current boyfriend... he goes to the store every day so that we don't keep snacks or anything binge-y in the house, he knows the difference between me buying binge food and me buying healthy food. When I come out of the bathroom after throwing up he has my water bottle, my blanket, my phone, my favorite show playing, my mints, and the heater on full blast. I love him for knowing how to support me, *without* supporting my disorder. \n\nHow have you guys experienced bulimia in your relationships?",

My current boyfriend was very aloof at first but I told him about it and he could tell it was get worse-not because he ever heard me-but because of how depressed, irritable, anxious I became. He supported me through residential. I told him if he needed to leave me I would understand but he stuck by my side. I did slip when I got out of res and he was angry. His anger was just masked sadness. Anyway, I personally don\u2019t think being in a relationship will in active ED or early recovery is good, but here I am. I wish ED handed destroyed my relationship with my x. And I wished it hadn\u2019t affected my currently relationship but all I can continue to do is stay in recovery one day at a time. After my slip I did make a decision to break up with him IF I slipped again because I don\u2019t want to cause more harm.

In that situation you have been together long enough to develop a strong foundation and it's a \"wait out the storm\" situation. Also if you already have a partner, the likelihood your ED will develop and then get to a really bad place is unlikely (if your relationship is good and healthy etc).\n\nIf it was a short term partner and they were not trying to improve/recover then yeah, it would be warranted to dump them, you did not sign up to be put in such an uncomfortable position where you have to ignore/support an ongoing addict. Same as if someone developed a drug/alcohol addiction during a relationship, you leave if it's not improving, because it affects you too, not just them.",

No matter how healthy and nice you try to be, you'll always be dragging your partner out into the storm with you. It's the same as being with anyone who has an ongoing addiction.\n\nBeing in recovery means they are supporting you towards being better, which makes them a great partner. Not being in recovery puts them in some kind of limbo where they aren't okay with it, but they kind of have to be, and they don't know what to do, but even if you tell them what to do, is it morally right for them to accept and just enable the disorder? Nope, so you're putting them in a bad position, and they're putting themselves in a bad position too.",
