But you want to purge first because if you shit and then purge you will face the possibility of shit remnants in the toilet bowl coming back at your face.

      "body": "Yes, good gosh I had circumstances of this sort too. Many times, but there was one that literally became a core memory of mine \ud83e\udd72 \n\nIt was my 17th birthday and I had eaten stuff I *needed* to purge, so at about 1:00 in the morning (when it was dark out), I walked to a giant open field to just purge in the grass\u2026 but had forgotten that I had taken a bunch (like\u2026 way more than recommended) of laxatives ~6 hours ago after a bp session earlier that day. The lax kicked in as I was walking there, and once I was finally at the field there was nothing I could do since I was pretty far away from any bathrooms or private places. It was PAINFUL and (tmi, kinda gross here) literally liquid. \n\nSo yeah, I ended up spilling my guts from both ends on my birthday in a dark grassy field. I remember just looking up at the moon after I was all done and just thinking \u201cI\u2019m so tired of this life\u201d before walking home in the dark. \n\nBut it\u2019s been ~2.5 years since then and I\u2019m still a severe bulimic, but I\u2019ve learned how to better structure my life around it so I\u2019m not as handicapped by the disorder. I\u2019ve had it for 5 years now. But the memory of that puke/shit night still haunts me when I catch my mind going back in time, sometimes. UGHHDHD",
