  "selftext": "my main reason is i want my face back. i used to have such a cute jawline even being slightly overweight but now i look bloated and ugly and i just HAVE to stop vomiting. i\u2019ve been having a lot of teeth problems as well and i just cant anymore with this horrible disease\n\nafter purging almost daily since 12 years old i am 2 days completely clean. i know its not much but for me it is a big deal. last night i binged but DID NOT purge. im going to try my absolute best this time around, no lax this time to dull the fullness. i feel legit like a potato sack but i just want to be ok and i want my facial structure back :(\n\ni just needed to vent a bit :( stay strong friends",
