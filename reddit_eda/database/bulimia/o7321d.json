  "selftext": "you grow up overweight your entire life next to a sister who is very petite. said sister wears dresses that are about 5 inches below her waist and mom doesn't really say anything about it. but you wear a dress that is 3 inches above your knee and mom reprimands you for wearing too short of dresses. fast forward a little bit and you develop an eating disorder and you a lose a lot of weight. you wear dresses that are 5 inches below your waist and now mom says you look beautiful. \n\npicture me that and then tell me how that wouldn't fuck your kid up, you know?",
