I think spending time learning about the harm and the long term effects is kind of like a scare tactic to scare you out of it. If you\u2019re presenting it out loud, I really hope that things are going to go ok, and I hope that you\u2019ll find a way out of this nightmare of an illness.",

For example, bulimia is so easy to hide because ppl with Bulimia often have average to above in body weight. This is a big reason why loved ones don't follow up on asking if we need help the way they would with someone who suffers from annorexia. In my experience, the subject of bluimia is brought up once and then forgotten about. Almost as if it was a phase or something.",
