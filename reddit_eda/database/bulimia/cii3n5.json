All the staff was very nice and encouraging. The dentist even told me that for the amount of time I\u2019ve been throwing up, my teeth were actually pretty good. Huge relief! They gave me a fluoride treatment for at home Incase it happened again. Best thing I ever did was open up to my dentist. It was nothing like I had feared for 10+ years",
