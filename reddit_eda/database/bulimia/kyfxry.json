  "selftext": "I had bulimia for around 4 years, binging and purging daily sometimes up to 4 times. I so badly wanted to get better and tried therapy, medication, meditation, self care, treatment, so many things and nothing worked. Mum always said 'one day love I think you'll be in a better place mentally and just not want to do it anymore' and she was right. \n\nI had my last BP Christmas day and honestly don't know why it stuck but boxing day I just stopped doing it! Everyday I would tell myself 'this is the day you quit' and it never happened until now. I think its been the build up of trying all the mentioned strategies but mainly putting myself first by removing toxic people from my life, stopping dating if I feel judged and self conscious, working on myself and generally just accepting that I dont have to be perfect. \n\nI still have moments where I want to BP and I worry that if something upsetting happens I might, but right now I am just enjoying saving money and time plus not damaging my health!!\n\nI don't know if I'll be of any help but feel free to drop me a message if you want an understanding ear or some advice on things to try that I felt helped me recover. Good luck to you all, you have the power \ud83d\udc95",
