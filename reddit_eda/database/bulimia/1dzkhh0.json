The amount of invalidation and judgement that comes with this disorder is insane, unlike how glamorized anorexia is, bulimia is the thrown to shame cousin. \n\nNot to mention how no one will ever take you seriously because most of us are at a weight that we can lose some and people will think it\u2019s an accomplishment! Doctors will treat us poorly, family and friends won\u2019t trust you\u2026 it\u2019s awful. \n\nIt\u2019s not some png of someone with measuring ribbon on a plate looking all dainty with all the self control in the world. It\u2019s awful photos of shoving your fingers down your throat over the toilet, stuffing your face with pizza and doughnuts idkkkk \n\nI just wish things were different.
