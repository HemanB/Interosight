  "selftext": "i feel so invalid being overweight while bulimic because of the stereotype. i feel like im not good enough at my ED which is what my sick brain tells me. but the truth is i struggle so much. why is GROcery shopping SO HARD. i feel so overstimulated by the food there and have lost all trust with myself. i come in with a list of healthy food my new dietician told me to get and come out with b/p food. i feel like there is a stereotype of bulimics ONLY being thin (im not shaming anyone\u2019s body type, its just hard for me, in a larger body now, to deal with the stereotype from family/even doctors). this disorder makes me lie to those i love most, steal food, and isolate myself from my friends. this message is kinda all over the place. thank you for reading though, i know im not alone here. \ud83e\ude77",
