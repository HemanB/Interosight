I couldn\u2019t eat any normal baby food and my mom had to buy some expensive sensitive stomach formula so I\u2019d keep it down... well I still have stomach pain whenever I eat anything and the only thing that makes the pain go away is purging. So the issue there hasn\u2019t changed over 20 years",

      "body": "I had that but at a later age. From 14-17 (during high school which I hated) i would throw up every meal at home. Not intentionally like purging but I couldn\u2019t hold it down. My parents showed a little concern but then stopped caring.\nThat was fun. Having parents who are so involved in their relationship they ignore their children. Sorry I\u2019ve had a really rough month and it\u2019s coming out here.\nMy main point is I can relate. And I find it funny now too!",
