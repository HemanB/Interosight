  "selftext": "You know that feeling when you binge on something terribly hard to purge? Like for me, it's pizza. The density just makes it so difficult. In the thick of my ED, I would eat a whole pizza, head to the bathroom and not be able to get anything up. The feeling was... horrifying. Guilt, regret, general worthlessness. Remember that feeling? Use it. \n\nIf you took throwing up out of the equation, how much would you actually WANT to eat? \n\nTry that mindset moving forward. \n\nWhenever I go to eat more, start a binge, I think, \"If I eat this and don't have the opportunity to throw up, will regret eating it and hate my life?\"\n\nAnd if the answer is yes, I don't eat it.",
