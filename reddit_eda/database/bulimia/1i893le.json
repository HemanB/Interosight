I've been told by multiple therapists that the average purge is around half of the energy consumed. 50%.\n\nRegular, adequate eating will give you sustained energy and the ability to think more clearly and make better choices. \nYou'll also very likely be absorbing less energy overall when compared to a day of b/ping\n\nThe emotional discomfort of sitting with the food (not purging) will lessen with practice.\n\nIt sounds like your previous physique was dangerously unsustainable. Your brain will kick in powerful urges to eat as much as possible when you're underweight or your BF% is too low.\nIt's a tough pill to swallow when you're terrified of being bigger than your \"ideal\". \n\nI honestly think you need to leave the bodybuilding behind for now. I'm sure there are more sustainable options that will help you maintain a positive relationship with your body and support your mental health. I had to leave my obsessive exercise behind \n\nWith regards to accessing treatment, try googling \"eating disorder help\" in your area. Ideally, a visit to your GP could start the ball rolling, but I acknowledge this isn't always the case for everyone. Finding a psychologist and possibly a psychiatrist who has worked with EDs before can be hugely helpful. It's very difficult to recover on one's own. Community helps. Check out r/fuckeatingdisorders, it's a recovery-focussed sub. (Strictly no posting of numbers, but full of very supportive people when you're struggling emotionally).\n\nIf you have the head space for it, watch the \"Minnesota starvation experiment\" video on YouTube. It explains what happens to the body in a starvation state. It was an experiment undertaken in WW2 by healthy men under medical supervision. These people did not start with eating disorders, but their brains did some interesting things to protect their bodies during a period of semistarvation and underweight.",

You would need to refeed that animal, create safety in environment and not push it hard so it can heal. people often cant understand why they have suddenly developed binge eating which is just a wired biological system being switched on trying to keep them alive, a survival response to the stress and famine they\u2019ve put it through. It\u2019s literally in our DNA to \u2018feast\u2019 after famine.

It\u2019s like if you saw an animal under extreme stress for a prolonged period of time- would you expect it to bounce back to balanced health just because it ate some food? It needs to recover. You would need to refeed that animal, create safety in environment and not push it hard so it can heal. people often cant understand why they have suddenly developed binge eating which is just a wired biological system being switched on trying to keep them alive, a survival response to the stress and famine they\u2019ve put it through. It\u2019s literally in our DNA to \u2018feast\u2019 after famine.

          "body": "It's basically impossible to completely purge your stomach contents after a binge. You may *feel* empty, but you won't be. I've been told by multiple therapists that the average purge is around half of the energy consumed. 50%.\n\nRegular, adequate eating will give you sustained energy and the ability to think more clearly and make better choices. \nYou'll also very likely be absorbing less energy overall when compared to a day of b/ping\n\nThe emotional discomfort of sitting with the food (not purging) will lessen with practice.\n\nIt sounds like your previous physique was dangerously unsustainable. Your brain will kick in powerful urges to eat as much as possible when you're underweight or your BF% is too low.\nIt's a tough pill to swallow when you're terrified of being bigger than your \"ideal\". \n\nI honestly think you need to leave the bodybuilding behind for now. I'm sure there are more sustainable options that will help you maintain a positive relationship with your body and support your mental health. I had to leave my obsessive exercise behind \n\nWith regards to accessing treatment, try googling \"eating disorder help\" in your area. Ideally, a visit to your GP could start the ball rolling, but I acknowledge this isn't always the case for everyone. Finding a psychologist and possibly a psychiatrist who has worked with EDs before can be hugely helpful. It's very difficult to recover on one's own. Community helps. Check out r/fuckeatingdisorders, it's a recovery-focussed sub. (Strictly no posting of numbers, but full of very supportive people when you're struggling emotionally).\n\nIf you have the head space for it, watch the \"Minnesota starvation experiment\" video on YouTube. It explains what happens to the body in a starvation state. It was an experiment undertaken in WW2 by healthy men under medical supervision. These people did not start with eating disorders, but their brains did some interesting things to protect their bodies during a period of semistarvation and underweight.",

And I probably binge 100k cals per day. I\u2019d be obese if I absorbed 50%. I think it\u2019s mostly used as a deterrent. Some people are very inefficient at purging, I think.

Definitely experience and ongoing damage (eg delayed stomach emptying, slack oesophageal sphincter) changed the results.\n\nI'm so sorry you're going through this. I've definitely had similar low points of being underweight and eating absurd amounts of food. It's such a difficult thing to tackle. Wouldn't wish it on anyone. Becomes like a fugue state. A free fall without a ledge.\n\nIt's been 25+ yrs for me, and its been in the last year that I've finally had moments of seeing the genuine possibility of life without it, which is something I'd NEVER believed was possible.\n\nIf you need any support or advice, feel free to DM me. <3",
