  "selftext": "Especially with people in the stall next to me. I felt so horrible about it. Partially because I know they could hear me, partially because I'm sure it didn't smell great, partially because my head was spinning but I didn't have any water with me (besides the toilet water half full of lunch, of course), and partially because throwing up never feels great. Also the ultimate walk of shame is the walk from the stall to the sink. I did wipe my hands with toilet paper but my university doesn't pay for the fancy kind so it mostly broke apart and definitely didn't get all the chunks :(\n\nPublic apology to everyone in the science lab building women's restroom",
