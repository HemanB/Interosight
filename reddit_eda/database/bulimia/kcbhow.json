It\u2019s been a lot and I\u2019m so drained and last night my mom FaceTimed me and I attempted to ask for help but then she told me I am at a healthy weight so I can\u2019t have a eating disorder and then I got angry and regrettably showed her a bag of vomit just to prove a point. I want to disappear I can\u2019t believe i did that I don\u2019t think I can face my mom again.",

But it\u2019s amazing that you\u2019ve managed to reach out to your mother, I\u2019m sorry she reacted that way though, it was totally unfair. But it just shows how she doesn\u2019t understand what you\u2019re going through whatsoever.\n\nSHE should feel embarrassed after telling you you have no ED and then seeing that bag of sick, not you.",

My mother who didn\u2019t really believe in EDs decided to help with the dishes and opened the cupboard to get a pair of washing up gloves and saw the pitcher. Besides being very embarrassing and a bit humiliating for me, it was an eye opening thing for my mom.",

Please don\u2019t feel embarrassed or ashamed, your mother is the one who should feel like shit after this. I\u2019ve been a normal weight bulimic my whole life and no one has ever believed me because of that. Until I got help from a professional. Are there any resources available at your uni? Please try and see if there are and if you can seek help somewhere. You deserve to get help.",

      "body": "I actually think this is a good thing, it shows that ED hasn\u2019t taken over your entire brain yet, there\u2019s still a part of yourself still there, and that part of you obviously wants you to be healthy, it knows Ed is toxic and NOT your friend, your true self over powered and disobeyed what Ed wants, Ed wants you to keep everything a secret, it wants you to feel shame and guilty. So telling on your eating disorder really pisses it off and tries to make you feel stupid and embarrassed in order to get you sucked in even further. Don\u2019t let it have that power over you. You are stronger than that, and there\u2019s a part of your real rational brain that still knows that.. try not to let the eating disorder to take over that part of you, because once it takes over completely, it is extremely hard to let it go. \n\nBest of luck! Try to recognize your own thoughts, and separate them from the EDs manipulative and abusive brainwashing.\ud83d\udc95",
