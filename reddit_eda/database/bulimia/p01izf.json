  "selftext": "...within 2 days (3 meals!) hehe completely b/p free :D\n\nI can't believe I did it! It was quite oily with regular crust, extra cheese, and good quality pepperoni! \n\nScary.\n\nIt was my first time in a very long time allowing myself to fully enjoy REAL pizza :3 I had no choice but to eat it bc someone else got it for me. I was hungry and not home so I ate a few pieces in moderation, came home ate some more leftovers, and finished the rest today for lunch!\n\nNobody ever said pizza was nutritious...but it sure brings pleasure, and pleasure is HEALTHY!",
