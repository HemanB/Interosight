  "selftext": "I have been struggling with a purging disorder with an anorexic subtype (I restrict so that I don't trigger my purging) for a couple months, and it's been two days since I've purged! Every day there is some point where I feel full enough to do so, but I'm literally already feeling more resilient (I haven't had a huge meal in a while but this is a big deal for me)! I rarely purge full meals anyway (I usually don't even have that much in my system when I do) but this feels like a huge accomplishment",
