  "selftext": "i always hear people w ana talking about having an ana honeymoon phase, where restricting is super easy and it feels exciting / whetevs. yk what i mean, haha\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d but like i hardly hear anybody talk about having something similar with mia??\n\npersonally, when i first \"unlocked\" the ability to b/p, it felt like the best thing since sliced bread. after years of restriction, i felt relieved that there was a way i could \"finally eat without guilt\". i let myself get worse and worse, my binges got bigger and my episodes got more frequent. i told myself that id stop when i wanted to, it's just that i didn't want to. i felt excited each time and i felt like i was on top of the world.\n\nflashforward to now, i feel trapped in my illness. im sick all the time and i can't stop even though i want nothing more. sometimes i still get excited to b/p, but usually it's just mechanical; b/p is just part of my life now, and i hate it.\n\nhas anybody else experienced something similar??",

Now- over a decade later- anytime I b/p I just feel like I'm yanking back the chain on my own neck after running a little too far ahead of myself. There's nothing empowering or fulfilling about it, it's just painful and exhausting. It feels more like I'm atoning for a sin.",

I haven't binged/purged for a long time. I can't handle that blood sugar crash after a purge. Wow it's intense. That's what made me stop purging. Whenever I purged my blood sugars crashed so bad that I could barely function. I went hypoglycemic and had to lay in bed. Honestly felt like my body was dying.\n\nI still clsss myself as bulimic. I just don't purge anymore. I haven't purged for a while now thankfully.\n\nI hope you manage to stop. Honestly the damage from bulimia is bad. I mean seriously bad. Not just stomach acid burning your throat and teeth etc. I'm talking. Electrolyte imbalances to the point that your heart can just stop. Your then dead. Your heart can stop mid purge due to a blood sugar drop + electrolyte imbalance. Just switch off. If you look online. It's common.\n\nPlease try and stop",
