  "selftext": "If you need one more reason to recover, here it is. \nI have been purging routinely for about 3 years. Usually there has been no issues. But then this time I had pasta, and it struggled alot to get it all out. Panic intensifies. And I start breathing heavily. While inhaling inbetween pauses the toothbrush disappears..? It took me a moment, and i desperatly try to fish it back up, but is is GONE. Anxiety is through the roof. I search on here, and Google, but can\u2019t find anything helpful. I rush out of the bathroom, crying for my boyfriends help. He doesn\u2019t understand at first, but calls 911. They were concerned, but relieved that I can breath. I was told to drink a little water, and get to the hospital. The SHAME I felt walking in to the hospital with a toothbrush in my stomach\u2026 I got questions like \u00abDo you usually do this? Swallow objects\u00bb. But almost no concern for the ED aspect of it. Anyways, I had to get an endoscopy to get it removed. Mind you, I\u2019m the biggest wimp when it comes to needles, and everthing in a hospital really.\nI survived, but was told that I was quite lucky it all worked out like it did. \n\nPlease be careful, people. \n\nWanted to share the X-rays, but not sure how to. I\u2019m a numb here, that only made this user to share this scary experience.",
