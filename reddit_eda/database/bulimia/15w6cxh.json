  "selftext": "Anybody else feel like they are completely obsessed with bingeing and purging ? I hate it when people are at home. I resent my boyfriend being here because I can\u2019t do it when he\u2019s off work. I get angry when things get in the way. I am never happier than when I know I have hours and hours alone . If anybody ruins that , I get so upset inside.  When my parents went in holidays, I used my key to their house to go and do my thing alone . If I hear my boyfriend say he is going to football for the day in a few days \u2026. I tell myself to hang in there until that day and then as soon as he leaves , I start eating or set off to buy the tons of things I want to eat. I get so so annoyed if he\u2019s home because he\u2019s in the way of my eating .  I feel like an addict . If I go shopping for binge foods , my feet can\u2019t carry me home fast enough . I literally am in the worst phase with it right now.  I\u2019d anybody else like this ? I feel so greedy :(",

The level of sneaking about and WANTING to do it , it just makes me feel so isolated and to know there are so many people doing exactly what I do - it actually does make me feel a bit better.  Honestly, I just woke up and the first thing on my mind is food and where I\u2019m going to get it from seeing as I don\u2019t have immediate access to enough food so that I can b/p.  I just got on the scales and I\u2019m 2 pounds heavier than I was on two days ago because I\u2019ve ended up keeping more stuff down. It\u2019s put me in a foul mood.  My friend has just messaged me to invite me to hers for the day as she\u2019s on maternity leave and I\u2019ve already said no because I\u2019d rather spend my day eating and purging . I already know what I\u2019m going to buy and what it\u2019s going to cost me .  Off I go again.  I have to go on holiday in two weeks with my family and I\u2019m already thinking about how much restraint I\u2019ll have to show on that 7 day trip because repeated trips to the bath room are difficult when everyone there knows you \u2018used to\u2019 be bulimic . My family aren\u2019t the brightest and they think I don\u2019t do it anymore. I\u2019m slim but not bony - so they wrongly assume I\u2019m okay with food. I\u2019m\nAlso a bridesmaid just before the holiday and I\u2019m dreading that too.  What amazes me , is if I\u2019m dressed up nice , or out on the town for the day with friends , the restraint I can show about food and eating is like nothin you\u2019ve ever seen . I will be the only one not ordering food . When there\u2019s a function and there\u2019s a buffet , I don\u2019t even approach it or show any interest in it.  I know though , that if I were on my own with all of that buffet food , I would eat all of it and purge all of it until there was nothing left. To think this all started with my mum calling me fat and greedy age 17 and now I\u2019m 46 and food will never just be a normal thing to me.  And all day now , I\u2019ll obsess about this extra 2 pounds and how I need it gone FAST . :(",

We go on vacation and the level of stress I go thru every time I eat out is immense. There is a massive difference between bingeing and purging when people are there , to the level I can go to when I\u2019m alone . After 30 years of being bulimic, I can rid myself of what I eat easily around anybody . But the way I feel when I can eat WHATEVER I want for AS LONG as I want \u2026. It\u2019s different.  Privacy to eat mountains is not the same as eating and purging when I\u2019m not alone . The shame , the conniving\u2026\u2026 that is not an issue when nobody is there to witness what I REALLY want to eat .  You need privacy to fully binge . I\u2019m sure you get what I mean here  ??",

I have never put my fingers down my throat , and I\u2019ve never ever used laxatives . I\u2019ve always been able to bring up food at will if there\u2019s enough there to come up , even before bulimia , I would ruminate on food a lot as a little kid ( ugh I know ) so maybe that has a link as to why my digestion isn\u2019t off  \u2026..
