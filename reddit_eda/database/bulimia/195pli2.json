I hope it continues working. Iknow there are underlying issues mentally that lead me to b/p that i definitley need to fix, but I'm really happy to have started on my recovery. It is the longest break I've gone in about two years. I had bulimia for 8 years. I guess not much to say here, but I'm just happy and proud of myself.",

      "body": "Fabulous!  This is how it's done!  Slow and steady,  baby steps.  I recovered after 35 years and it was hard work! DAILY hard work, until my healthy behaviors felt like the normal ones, and ED behaviors felt like the wrong, shameful actions.\n\nI still don't love my new recovered body shape or weight. But I LOVE the mental freedom...the mental Peace.  I don't freak out about meeting people for dinner, don't get furious that every social event seems to involve food,  no terror at the Holidays...\n\nTip: stop weighing yourself on the scale,  or at least put farther and farther amounts of time in between weighing,  until you can stop.  Tbh, after a while,  the number on there is no longer \"rewarding\".  Once you settle into your body's choice of weight, It doesn't move one way or the other dramatically anyway.  No reward or punishment there in the scale anymore. \n\nTip: Immediately get rid of ALL clothing in your closet that doesn't fit your changing, recovering body.   I went up 3 sizes during Recovery.   NOTHING in your closet or dresser should taunt you, be cruel to you... insist on ED behaviors just so you can fit into them.   I learned to shop at Second Hand Stores and Costco... but this is important here...keep NOTHING that no longer fits your changing body.\n\nIn a world screaming Diversity for race, gender, religion , it's about time there is BODY DIVERSITY. \n\nKeep going.  Always forgive yourself.   And always remember:  a slip is NOT a relapse.   It's hard work relearning how to choose food, eat food, sit in the uncomfortable and then digest food.  Relearn how to cope without ED behaviors...Relearn how to comfort yourself when facing Life's stressors (or other people's comments!)\n\nKeep going.  You are doing it.  You are not alone on the Recovery Journey.",
