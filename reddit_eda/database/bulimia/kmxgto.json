  "selftext": "Hi I have been struggling with anorexia and bulimia for probably 7 years (Im 21F) I\u2019ve been in recovery since early 2019. I always used purging as a coping mechanism to regulate my emotions (really it just completely numbed me out) and i\u2019ve been purge free for almost a month now, which doesn\u2019t sound like much but it\u2019s a big deal for me and i\u2019ve been going through a really tough time right now and i\u2019ve decided i\u2019m going to admit myself to the local hospital and really choose to take care of myself instead of going back into the throes of an ED. But really i\u2019m terrified, i\u2019m giving up control and I don\u2019t even know how long i\u2019ll be in there or if i\u2019ll be able to have my phone, and my parents don\u2019t even know yet, I know I have to if I want to get better but i\u2019m scared but i\u2019m still trying. Ugh okay it\u2019s like 1am as I write this after a long day of like sobbing and emergency phone calls, and I just wanted to write this to try to hold myself accountable to still go tomorrow. anyways if anyone reads this far send support pls:)",
