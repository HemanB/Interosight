  "title": "Found out about bulimia watching a movie and I wish I never did",
  "selftext": "When I (20f) was 15-16, I was in a bad place mentally and emotionally and I remember watching this movie. I can\u2019t remember the name of it and I can\u2019t even remember any of the storyline, all I remember was this young girl purging. I do have a feeling though that the movie was addressing the problem of eating disorders. Anyways, I had no clue what an eating disorder was at the time, let alone bulimia, and decided to look it up. At this point, I started to \"learn\" about bulimia and basically chose to try it out because at the time I felt like I needed to lose weight to gain confidence. Eventually, with years, I used this more as a tool of self harm.\n\nBut when I think about it now, I doubt I would have known about bulimia until recently had I not seen this movie. At that age, I was so desperate and gullible, I didn\u2019t care about my health, I just chose to try anything that would help me lose weight.\n\nIt\u2019s weird because obviously I feel it\u2019s important that we teach young people about issues such as eating disorders but at the same time, are we introducing these eating disorders to them?\n\nEdit: thank you for the award! I really appreciate it! And wow, I\u2019m so shocked to read how many of you guys have also found out about bulimia via documentaries, movies, shorts films... Thank you though for sharing your experiences! I\u2019ve been following this sub for a while but never posted as I feel a bit embarrassed about even being subscribed to it (I\u2019ve never told anyone about my ED) but to see how kind and open you guys are about your own experience inspires me massively!",

My initial thought was \u201ceew that\u2019s dumb\u201d until I started it myself. \n\nI started to purge out after every meal. They\u2019re easier to come out immediately after a meal imo so I didn\u2019t have any trouble or issues with those side effects i Googled - gum disease/cavities/intestinal problems etc. This somewhat kind of consoled me mentally to think that I\u2019m okay and not an extreme bulimic. \n\nMy mum noticed a pattern and she started to confront me. She kept a close watch on me and I started to recover from it. Slowly but surely.\n\nA year ago, people around me started to comment about my weight and chubby-ness again. So I relapsed till today. I\u2019ve since lost 16kg (from 68kg to 52kg) and I\u2019m 1.65m... I no longer live with my mum so no one noticed my eating habits or patterns. Not even my husband. Everyone around me noticed my weight loss and gave me compliments even. \n\nI know it\u2019s a problem but I can\u2019t seem to stop myself. I\u2019m starting to see some side effects - hair loss / sleeping problem and I\u2019m very certain that I have a fertility problem too. \n\nI wished I never knew the existence of eating disorder. Till date, it seems like my go to solution to lose weight as compared to exercising and eating right.",

I think it also makes people fall deeper into their disorders. 'Oh, you wanna lose weight even though you're healthy? You must be anorexic.' Then what could have been something insignificant is made that person's identity and they'll likely see it as an opportunity to explore a new world, try something new and/or be a part of a community.\n\nI don't really have an answer... what would I tell my younger self? \"Hey mate, people are actually gonna like you less, you'll become an irritating, selfish prick with no friends.
