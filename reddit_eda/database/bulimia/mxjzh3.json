  "selftext": "I was 2 days clean but had a shit tonne of cheese and bread all because a guy hasn\u2019t messaged so my brain went crazy. I keep telling myself he was lying and he thinks I\u2019m a fat disgusting ugly troll and now I REALLY feel like a fat disgusting troll because of all the cheese and bread I couldn\u2019t get up. I tried so hard my brain feels like it\u2019s gonna explode and I feel like there\u2019s chucks of cheese in my throat. Idk this is a stupid rant I\u2019m just so anxious because I really strained myself this time and my stomach is so full. This feels like the end of the fucking world",

I was in the exact same position as you yesterday except swap cheese for a family size sour patch kids.... (GUMMY CANDY NEVERRRRR COMES UP FOR ME FML). Anyways. Wear comfy clothes. Dont go past mirrors for a while. Do some selfcare like a face mask and a bath. Give yourself permission to relax and just watch a movie or something you enjoy. I promise you, the boy you are messaging doesn't notice. We are our worst critics. Its just one day in the grande scheme of things girl.",
