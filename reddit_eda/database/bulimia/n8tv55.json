AN\u2019s not willpower, it\u2019s (for me) absolute terror. Being compelled to put food in my mouth was, at the worst times, like walking a tightrope over the Grand Canyon. Sometimes, and around certain foods, I still feel this way. It feels like a vacuum is sucking all the air out of my body, like I\u2019m drowning.\n\nAnorexia is \u201cabout control\u201d but I have never felt so much like a punching bag than in these times. No willpower, no agency.\n\nNinja edit to add: people need to stop equating thinness with willpower, like, yesterday :) thinness is not an inherent moral good :) nor are all anorexics thin :)",
