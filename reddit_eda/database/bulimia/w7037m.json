I just ate a couple of slices of pineapple, and I feel like purging because I\u2019m nervous (not related to losing weight). I\u2019m scared that this is like a coping mechanism now, how do I break it?",

Once your body realizes it has a shortcut to relieving anxiety, its going to keep pushing that button. Our monkey brains love that stuff haha. I dont have advice just completely understandable and its advantagous that you can recognize it as such!",
