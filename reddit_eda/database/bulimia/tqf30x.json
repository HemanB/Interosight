  "selftext": "Purging is not an option. It sucks right now. My stomach is rock hard and bloated, and I\u2019m full FULL. But, because I\u2019ve sat with this discomfort many times now in recovery, I know that my body knows what to do and that this feeling will pass. I was not poisoned, I am not in danger, nothing bad will happen if I keep this down. Maybe I didn\u2019t have enough fats the last few days. Maybe my body needs more energy. Maybe it was just mental hunger. Who knows. Purging is not an option.",
