(Before when I was binging and purging a lot the most cooking I did was reheating microwave meals or eating an entire container of pasta with a stick of butter and a shit ton of melted cheese.) cooking is helping me connect to food more and see it as fuel for my body instead of something to be afraid of and learn how I react to eating different things. I used to meal plan (without counting calories) but now that I am out of the \u201cdanger zone\u201d as I call it, it\u2019s kind of just waking up and seeing what I feel like eating, or what needs to be used up before it goes bad.",
