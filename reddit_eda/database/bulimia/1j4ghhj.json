  "selftext": "When I\u2019m not binging and purging, my cheeks aren\u2019t puffy, my stomach isn\u2019t bloated, my hair isn\u2019t brittle, my lips aren\u2019t dry and dehydrated, my mind isn\u2019t warped, I\u2019m not bitchy, I care about my life and future, I\u2019m so much more attractive and pleasant to be around, physically and emotionally. \nYet, I still continue to be consumed in something that makes me feel and look ugly because there\u2019s still the lingering hope that I might go down 5 sizes or the stress I\u2019m feeling will be magically erased if I purge everything away and maybe I\u2019ll be perfect and liked. \nIt sucks that even though I feel and believe this, I\u2019m still too scared to get help or tell anyone. I\u2019ve been in the dark with my bulimia and eating disorder for 10 years, dealing with it all on my own and it oddly feels safer this way. The judgement from others might push me over the edge. ",
