But still! One time in the entirety of 2021? Not too bad. I KNOW it's been at least 3 months since that night so I'm still counting this as a win. We all falter but we gotta stay up and stay positive!\n\nANYWAY the point of this post was that I haven't even noticed the lack of binging this week! Maybe my new job is helping but I just sit around waiting to approve loans lol. I eat trail mix or jerky when I'm feeling snacky so I don't order fast food. \n\nLast night I realized I had chocolates, cookies and ice cream in the house.. its been over a week since I bought them! I was like wait.. when was the last time I binged?? I can't remember! It gets better keep pushing!!!!",

      "body": "Okay so, a few things in here are above my pay grade BUT, I think some of the tips I used can be useful for you at least until you're ready for the next steps. \n\nThe first thing I had to learn was to let go of the \"all or nothing\" attitude that I know a lot of us have. If you're having a good day or week, and you eat something that triggers you, it's okay. Just relax and be kind to yourself. Relapses are going to happen, and there's nothing we can do about it, except control our reaction to it. It's silly to think we have 100% control on ANYTHING in life. \n\nThe second thing, mentioned above, be kind to yourself and understand that it is ok to eat. It's okay to crave your favorite foods. Instead of saying \"I shouldn't eat this, it's bad, but I can't control my urges..\" say this, \"I'm CHOOSING to have this cookie. I am going to enjoy this cookie. And then take small bites. Close your eyes, enjoy the flavors. Pair it with some milk, tea or coffee. And smile about it. Treats are soooo good and we don't have to feel guilty for enjoying them. \n\nThe 3rd thing, and is most important imo, at least for me, is to focus on what is going on when you have the urge to binge or purge. Are you bored, feeling anxious, stressed out, did something or someone upset you? Once you pin point the reason, talk yourself through it. Distract yourself w a hobby, maybe go for a walk, meditate of you're into that. \n\nThe last thing I'll leave you with is positive affirmations. \"I'm going to recover.\" \n\"I'm getting better everyday.\" \n\"Wow I feel healthier already.\" \n\nSmile at yourself in the mirror. Pose, put on your favorite outfit and strut around the house. The brain is a powerful, powerful thing. I like to act cocky with my affirmations \"bulimia? Don't know her. I'm the hottest bitch I ever met tbh.\" Or be silly. Make funny faces, dance really crazy. It'll lift your spirits c: take it day by day. It won't happen overnight. Give yourself time to heal. Keep a journal and reflect on your day! \n\nGood luck!!!!",
