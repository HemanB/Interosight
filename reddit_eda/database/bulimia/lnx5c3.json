  "selftext": "I've been b//p for a free weeks straight now, (small steps yay!!) but the other day I chugged a glass of milk after eating cookies and I wasn't even freaking about the calories or how I was going to get rid of it I just enjoyed the food and that was it. \n\nAfter that I was helping my mom load the dishwasher so I bent down and -- ended up with my stomach contents on the kitchen floor. (It was not induced or anything, purely automatic- so much so I don't count it as a purge since I had no intention do doing so. )\n\nIt was very embarrassing to do that in front of my mom who just looked on, in stunned silence as I joked it off. \n\n*facepalm* \n\nLiterally how embarrassing.",
