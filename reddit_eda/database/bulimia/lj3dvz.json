  "selftext": "I had a Chipotle burrito for dinner. I got guacamole, cheese, sour cream. Everything I wanted on it. I hung out with my friend for the rest of the night. First time I've eaten anything like that in a long time and not immediately purged. Been one day purge free. Downloaded the  I Am Sober app after seeing someone here write about to work on accountability and keep track of my spending. A small success but if I can do it so can you.",

Even if that morning I've committed myself fully to recovery or had the worst purge ever the night before. It's crazy how intoxicating our eating disorder voice is. \n\nYou only have two hours though. Distract yourself. Work on self care. Whiten your teeth. Shave your legs (only listing this because it takes me a lot of time, you obviously don't have to do this), scrape dead skin of the bottom of your feet. Put crazy eye make up on. Walk around the block if it's safe. Do a yoga routine. You've got this. Drink some tea.",
