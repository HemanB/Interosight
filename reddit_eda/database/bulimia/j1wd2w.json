My dad and brother play cricket and are big fans of him so it gives me a bit of hope that they'll be able to see how easy it is to be affected. I'm both sad and pleased that he's coming forward about it though, he's been a bit of a familiar face on TV the last few years so it's cool that he's using it for something important.",

I felt so understood. Especially the part about him being super reluctant to admit he had an ed and get treatment and recover. I am constantly in 2 minds about these things. I hope the documentary inspires people to seek help and talk to someone about their eating disorders.",
