  "selftext": "Have had an ED since I was about 10, but used to be anorexic. After college, I switched beasts and have been bulimic for about 3 years.  Since starting throwing up, the damage to my teeth has always been in the back of my mind. I finally got up the courage to go to the dentist, and.... everything is okay! This is not a post to encourage anyone to keep throwing up, and I don't want to insinuate that your teeth will be fine if you continue on your current path. I just feel relived that it's not too late for me, I can stop today and I will not have destroyed my teeth.",
