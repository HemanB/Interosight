  "selftext": "I don\u2019t know there\u2019s something about the catharsis purging gives me, the control, the release. I\u2019m an emotional eater but sometimes I\u2019m too upset to even eat, today was one of those days. In those times I don\u2019t even feel the need to binge but I do want the numbness it provides.  The food doesn\u2019t make me feel happy or safe anymore just distant from everything and I need that but more than anything I want to be able to purge and feel all the things I mentioned before. I also want to feel good at something and in a way hurt. Today it stopped me from badly s/h, it stopped me from drinking half a bottle of vodka, it stopped me from taking something to blur it all, it stopped me from ending things. I don\u2019t know, the process is so exhausting and takes about an hour to both b/p and then clean up so by the time it\u2019s over I\u2019m too gone to act impulsively and ruin things, it\u2019s like a buffer.",
