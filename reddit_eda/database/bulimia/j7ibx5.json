  "selftext": "I've only had potato and leek soup and some halloumi and hot sauce but I kept it down!! I relapsed recently and I've been using some techniques I learnt in therapy today to stop myself purging and it worked! \n\nI don't feel bad that I didn't purge as I know I have some food in me to keep me going (I've been purging everything I eat and I struggle to walk even).\n\nTomorrow I'm going to eat small and healthy to try not to purge, as it worked today. I'm proud of myself.",

First 2 weeks are insanely hard, I find the trigger is mostly night time, but in recovery I was always hungry due to the unusual amount I would B/P, the brain and stomach just go back to normal, where a normal meal would satisfy!
