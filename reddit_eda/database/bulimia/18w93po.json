Deafness when the acids hit the inner ear. In time your body will decay and it happens without warning in most cases. Stop the best way you know how before you end up living in a shell of your previous self. Find any way possible to stop purging. Your body needs nutrients and TLC.",

Already I purged this year, I\u2019m freaking exhausted and yet I still purge, even when food taste gross I still purge but there\u2019s always hope and 2024 feels like a time to reset and get my body balanced. The feeling of not being able to remember the last time I purged is the best feeling ever, my whole body feels better and mind. For me in comes in cycles I go weeks without purging and the need to binge and purge comes when I restrict after so long. My body needs a break and once you feel better it\u2019s easier to go longer and longer without purging. Motivation Is everything\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",
