I suppose it would be a neat party trick if it wasn\u2019t so disgusting \ud83d\ude02\nI hope that doesn\u2019t sound braggy. It\u2019s really sad that I\u2019ve put so much time and energy into this, as opposed to\u2026 pretty much anything else. Also, no matter how long I\u2019ve been doing it, I will occasionally sneeze right in the middle of purging and it goes absolutely everywhere lol \ud83e\udd74",
