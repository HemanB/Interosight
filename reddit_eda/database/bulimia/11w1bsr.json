  "title": "Words of encouragement from a former bulimic",
  "selftext": "I was severely bulimic from the ages of 19-25 (binging and purging over 20 times a day at points).  I remember feeling completely hopeless, and that I\u2019d spend the rest of my life in bulimia hell.  The urges to binge were SO powerful.  I thought it would kill me.\n\nI am 34 now and have been living happily bulimia free for almost 10 years.  I want you to know you ABSOLUTELY can recover COMPLETELY.  I haven\u2019t the slightest fear that bulimia will ever come back.  It seems like such a distant memory.  I promise you can do it too.  Here are a few things that helped:\n\n*Self-compassion:  If I had to attribute my recovery to one thing, it would be self- compassion.  It\u2019s SO crucial.  You didn\u2019t become bulimic in one day.  You can\u2019t expect to have a perfect recovery from day one.  Be NICE to yourself.  You\u2019ve gone through enough pain and heartache.  You don\u2019t need to pile on anymore.  Being mean to yourself has never gotten you anywhere.  Recovery takes effort, and give yourself credit for trying!  Give yourself credit for even wanting to try!  It DOES NOT MATTER if today wasn\u2019t perfect.  The whole day isn\u2019t ruined.  Even if you binged and purged 50 times today- give yourself credit for stopping at 50 and not going to 51.  Baby steps.  Remember your end goal: a happy, bulimia free life.  Mistakes can and will happen along the way and you will still get there.  I had sooooo many days during recovery that weren\u2019t perfect, yet I\u2019m still here now almost 10 years later fully recovered!  I was also 1000x more likely to stop the cycle the KINDER I was to myself.  Talk to yourself like you\u2019re a baby learning to walk.  You don\u2019t yell at a baby because she didn\u2019t run a marathon after her first step.  Be your own best friend!  Would you berate your best friend because she wasn\u2019t perfect from day 1?  Or would you remind her of how amazing she is for having the courage to try?  I can\u2019t stress this enough: SELF-COMPASSION IS CRUCIAL AND LEADS TO RECOVERY!\n\n*Understanding that dieting led to my bulimia.  It wasn\u2019t my fault.  I simply started dieting and I couldn\u2019t take it anymore.  This is the natural result of dieting gone too far.  IT\u2019S NOT YOUR FAULT.\n\n*Structured eating: During the first part of recovery I had 6-7 small meals a day spaced 2-3 hours apart.  Smaller meals are easier for you to digest at first.  The goal is to get those awful binge urges (that come as a result of physical and psychological restriction) to calm down and eventually go away.  You don\u2019t have to eat this way forever.  You\u2019ll eventually get attuned to your body and you can eat intuitively.\n\n*Temporary weight fluctuations and bloating is to be expected.  Take it as a sign your body is recovering- it\u2019s a GOOD thing.  It WILL NOT be this way forever.  Your body will learn how to digest food again, your binge urges will go away, and you will be free.  Get yourself some comfy, stretchy clothes and BE KIND TO YOURSELF!  \n\nAlso, I read \u201cThe Bulimia Help Method\u201d by Ali Kerr.  She also had severe bulimia and is fully recovered now.  \n\nYOU CAN DO IT!  I am living proof.  \n\nSending lots of love to all of you!  BE KIND TO YOURSELVES!!!",

It\u2019s as if that my life isn\u2019t meaningful if I don\u2019t suffer and it\u2019s hell. I want recovery but there\u2019s something there telling me that I\u2019m not suffering enough and I can\u2019t take it anymore. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re doing okay tho. Sending lots of love!",

It\u2019s 100% possible and your life is absolutely worth it!\n\nI would say all in all it took a little less than a year to be completely free.  In hindsight, this is NOT a lot of time considering I had been dieting/ restrictive eating/ etc. since I was 12, and my bulimia was very severe.  \n\nThere were encouraging things that happened along the way throughout the process, too.  One day I noticed I barely thought about food unless hungry.  I started to be able to keep all types of foods in the house (and forget about them completely).  I\u2019d have stressful days and not want to binge/ purge to cope.  \n\nI know it seems daunting at first, but I\u2019m so glad I fully committed and kept moving forward.  I was so tired of living in hell.  \n\nYou won\u2019t regret it.  I promise!",

I remember feeling like I was too far gone and beyond hope, but that was just another LIE bulimia was telling me.  \n\nRecovering from bulimia will ultimately give you the strength to face ANYTHING in life.
