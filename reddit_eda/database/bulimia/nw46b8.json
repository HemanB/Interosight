  "selftext": "Its almost nothing but i used to take laxatives every other day and about 2 months ago i started taking them just 2 times a week.\nI also havent been able to work out in about 2 weeks so the urge to take them has grown, but my sister\u2019s friend convinced me to try to drop them, so im really trying.\nToday i kept thinking of taking one (sneaky so my sister and her friend wouldn\u2019t know) but it feels wrong so i thought maybe posting about here would help me keep my morals (if thats the word for it) about not taking it lol \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",
