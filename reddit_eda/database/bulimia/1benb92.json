  "selftext": "Today my friend was telling me about how she felt ugly because she'd gained a bit of weight. She's maybe 1-2 sizes bigger than I am currently. My first instant thought was \"yeah you really need to lose the weight. You are not pretty.\" I never said it aloud but the instant guilt stayed. So much so I had to excuse myself to the bathroom and cried a bit because how could I ever think such a thing? I love my best friend to bits and she's gorgeous, so I don't know why I thought it. It happens all the time - people walking down the street, people I'm talking to, friends, strangers - I instantly look at their stomach and thighs and judge how much weight they need to lose. \n\nI look at overweight people and feel like they're not putting in the effort to lose weight, and then cry because I know what a horrible thought it is and I don't know why I keep having it. I wish bulimia on no one and yet somehow get instinctively angry at overweight people - if I'm putting in \"effort\" why aren't they?\n\nI feel horrible. All the body positivity posts on the internet piss me off now because my first instinct is that anyone showing off their belly is disgusting - and then guilt hits me. I can't seem to get over what a horrible person I am now, judging everyone in my head. I have never acted on these thoughts or said them aloud, but I can't escape the feeling of what a bad person I am.\n\n I wonder if anyone else has experienced this? ",

      "body": "ED really messes up our way of thinking, I honestly compare it to addiction in how destructive and all-encompassing it truly is. \nI feel like a lot of the judgement and anger doesn't necessarily come from yourself, but from the ED and from the person (you) who it's hurting. For example; \nI'd for sure attribute the judgement of those you know and love to ED. It's clear that *you* don't really believe that, but ED *does*, and it will worm its way into that at every corner, it tries to make you think it's a fact rather than a intrusive thought. \nAnd when it comes to the judgement of those bigger than you, I'd say that's probably coming more from the person who's hurting-- why do *you* feel this pain, why don't *they*? You're working so hard, you're doing so much better than them, what is stopping *them*? This one I honestly still struggle with-- that anger is real, and it's justified, but *not at them*. That anger should be instead redirected, not at yourself or others, but to your disorder. Why do others get to be healthy? Why can't I be healthy? Don't I deserve better? And, you do. And this redirection has really helped me in recovery. You *do* deserve better, you *don't* deserve this awful invasive parasite. \nIn the end, ED is a game of will, and a test or strength. I truly liken it to addiction, it feels so good to restrict or purge, but it's so awful in actuality-- and recovery is a bumpy road lined with relapse, panic attacks, and pain, that all ultimately ends with a feeling of comfort, knowing your skin and your body are *yours*, not some invisible monster who hunts you. You will likely always struggle with these thoughts while in active ED, it's unfortunately the nature of the beast. But, you *know* they aren't true, and you *know* they are wrong, and that is so incredibly important and so good that you recognize. \nI know the struggle OP, I've had my own on and off for around half my life at this point, but I promise you, that same driving force that brings us to purge/restrict/etc, is the same force you can use to help yourself. It fucking sucks. Recovery is one of the hardest things I've ever gone through, and at times felt *worse* than my ED-- but the thing with recovery is that it doesn't go on forever. You don't have the nagging thought that \"oh god, what if someone finds out about my recovery?\", or \"oh no, that's a healthy amount of calories\", and you don't struggle everyday with the inital pain that recovery causes. It takes a long time, relapse in ED is so common, especially during recovery, so don't think too poorly of yourself if you can't now, or if you don't think you will be able to for a *while*. Everyone's journey is different, but with your awareness about what your disorder is doing, I hold good faith in my heart thay someday, your recovery will be long past, and you'll barely even remember these moments besides the passing shudder.",

Since last year I've seen her lose weight - slowly but surely. She's definitely not as big as she was this time last year. I know because In every class I have a mental \"rank\" from fattest to thinnest (I know how terrible this is, I cry about it often) and she's no longer on the \"big side\". I obviously have not mentioned this to her at all and have not asked about her weight - how weird would that be!? \n\nI do however, keep staring at her in class. I can't stop wondering if she's working out, or eating different, or exercising..?? One day I was staring at her in class and thought to myself \"I really hope she has an ED too.\" Because my brain couldn't handle someone losing weight healthily and being happy while I'm here B/P four times a week and still gaining weight. I cried twice that day because I felt like it was such a horrible thought.",

          "body": "ED really messes up our way of thinking, I honestly compare it to addiction in how destructive and all-encompassing it truly is. \nI feel like a lot of the judgement and anger doesn't necessarily come from yourself, but from the ED and from the person (you) who it's hurting. For example; \nI'd for sure attribute the judgement of those you know and love to ED. It's clear that *you* don't really believe that, but ED *does*, and it will worm its way into that at every corner, it tries to make you think it's a fact rather than a intrusive thought. \nAnd when it comes to the judgement of those bigger than you, I'd say that's probably coming more from the person who's hurting-- why do *you* feel this pain, why don't *they*? You're working so hard, you're doing so much better than them, what is stopping *them*? This one I honestly still struggle with-- that anger is real, and it's justified, but *not at them*. That anger should be instead redirected, not at yourself or others, but to your disorder. Why do others get to be healthy? Why can't I be healthy? Don't I deserve better? And, you do. And this redirection has really helped me in recovery. You *do* deserve better, you *don't* deserve this awful invasive parasite. \nIn the end, ED is a game of will, and a test or strength. I truly liken it to addiction, it feels so good to restrict or purge, but it's so awful in actuality-- and recovery is a bumpy road lined with relapse, panic attacks, and pain, that all ultimately ends with a feeling of comfort, knowing your skin and your body are *yours*, not some invisible monster who hunts you. You will likely always struggle with these thoughts while in active ED, it's unfortunately the nature of the beast. But, you *know* they aren't true, and you *know* they are wrong, and that is so incredibly important and so good that you recognize. \nI know the struggle OP, I've had my own on and off for around half my life at this point, but I promise you, that same driving force that brings us to purge/restrict/etc, is the same force you can use to help yourself. It fucking sucks. Recovery is one of the hardest things I've ever gone through, and at times felt *worse* than my ED-- but the thing with recovery is that it doesn't go on forever. You don't have the nagging thought that \"oh god, what if someone finds out about my recovery?\", or \"oh no, that's a healthy amount of calories\", and you don't struggle everyday with the inital pain that recovery causes. It takes a long time, relapse in ED is so common, especially during recovery, so don't think too poorly of yourself if you can't now, or if you don't think you will be able to for a *while*. Everyone's journey is different, but with your awareness about what your disorder is doing, I hold good faith in my heart thay someday, your recovery will be long past, and you'll barely even remember these moments besides the passing shudder.",

But if you\u2019re not able to get meds or be assessed by a psychiatrist, meeting with a therapist generally might be your best bet. Is your mom aware of your ED?",
