  "selftext": "The number one thing that has stopped me from getting professional inpatient and outpatient treatment  for my eating disorder is that every single facility caters to anorexia first. It\u2019s \u201emore dangerous\u201c so why even quit being bulimic? It\u2019s not going to kill me, so what\u2019s the reason to even stop? I need to keep going until I look anorexic, or no one will even care. There is never any space online or in person for bulimia  and bulimia  treatment solely- it is always  coupled with anorexia. I have no interest sitting in group therapy with anorexics who\u2019s literal  worst fear is my body. I seriously can\u2019t stress enough how this makes it impossible to get help for bulimia.",

Some programs are better than others with treating non-anorexic patients, and I can assure you that you can die from bulimia, and that it is very dangerous. Treatment programs with HAES approaches might be a better route for you to go if you decide to seek help, as they\u2019re less focused on weight and more on overall health and quality of life",
