I was great at saving and RARELY treated myself.\n\nNow I spend all my money on food and I live with my mom (who recently found out about my ED) so she notices when food disappears and it\u2019s so embarrassing having to make something up every time because she probably doesn\u2019t believe me.\n\nI\u2019m not ready to recover at all but I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t have a car so I can\u2019t drive to the stores who have good deals. \n\nThe closest store happens to be the most expensive one in my town as well\u2026 2025 is such a shit year already",

It\u2019s a repetitive cycle very similar to addiction - hell, it is an addiction. I wish I never started this. I can\u2019t even imagine what being normal with food is.",
