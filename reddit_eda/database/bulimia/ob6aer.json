  "selftext": "I've actually lost weight this year, but not when the bulimia has been at it's worst again I was completely stagnant for ages. But, I only mention that as I've been trying hard not to eat any big meals for bulimia and healthy weight loss reasons.\n\nAnd I had a whole big meal and I enjoyed it. Enjoyed each bite. Ate a bit too much.\n\nThen did a small amount of gardening with the other half.\n\nAnd watched breaking bad.\n\nAnd the thought did enter my mind but I batted it away! \n\nFeel good about it.",
