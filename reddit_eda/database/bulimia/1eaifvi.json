I\u2019m eating three reasonably sized balanced meals a day of stuff like fried angel hair with onion & egg and whole wheat English muffins with tomatoes and eggs, plus snacking on peanuts and drinking a lot of tea/coffee/water. I genuinely feel so much better, I\u2019ve only had one binge and I convinced myself not to purge because I knew that would just send me back where I was and I actually have lost weight bc I\u2019m not sneaking massive amounts of junk on the daily behind my family\u2019s back.\n\nI\u2019m living with a girl I\u2019m p sure has an ED and honestly seeing behaviors from the outside & focusing on my job atm helps a lot. Idk I\u2019ve been hardcore bulimic for like 4 years atp so even 3 weeks is a win for me, praying it lasts because I actually feel like a person and not a zombie self-stimulating myself with massive amounts of food and numbing everything I feel by purging (speaking to my own experience).",
