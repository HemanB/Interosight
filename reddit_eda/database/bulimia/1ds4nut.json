  "selftext": "I had planned this binge for a long time and went to a buffet. That\u2019s where I met another bulimic. she was violently purging in the bathroom while I was doing the same thing. That\u2019s when I wonder \u201cI really hope I don\u2019t sound that loud when purging\u2026\u201d\n\nWe came out at the same time, I saw her eyes were red and there were Russel signs on her knuckle, she uses tons of soap to wash her hands to make the smell go away. I also notice she has swelling glands\n\nHow did I know she was bulimic? She was also taking huge amount of food and going to the bathroom frequently. The amount of times we\u2019ve met each other in the bathroom was insane (6 times at least).\nI think she knows I\u2019m bulimic too but we just get into our businesses and don\u2019t talk about it.\n\nOh gosh\u2026. I wish I can just give her a hug and say \u201cit\u2019s not easy, there\u2019s still hope, you\u2019ll be fine darling\u201d \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79 \n\nIf it was you guys, what would you guys do?",
