But it must have been around 20+ lbs (at least that\u2019s what multiple people told me) from February to May. I also went from a medium to an extra small in shirt size, for reference. Not only did I loose some weight but I also started loosing my hair, i lost my good grades in school, i lost my feminine cycle, i become unintentionally distant with my friends and my partner, i almost lost my 2 year relationship, i was in a \u201cbad mood\u201d 25/8, my nails would take forever to grow, i lost all the undertones in my face i looked pale/grey, i had under eye bags that would never cover (no matter how much concealer I would use). Also what was unfortunate in my case was my weight distribution, so i did loose belly fat but that was the basically the last place i was loosing from and which is why i did this for so long. I became underweight and had the bmi of about 13 (I\u2019m 5\u20198). At some point i did stop loosing (july). I also forced myself to semi recover because I wanted to stop being so mean to the people that loved me most ( my family and my boyfriend). Not only that but people started to notice we\u2019re making comments to my mom at family outings (some people didn\u2019t think it was an ed and thought I had cancer) that was when I knew I had to stop. But I cant stop, it doesn\u2019t ever just stop, the feeling of always needing to loose weight and being thin always outgrows my want to get better. Of course some days are worse than others but I have stopped b/p as much as I used to. And I still haven\u2019t gotten my period back (if you have any tips to help with this please let me know!!). I think this process would have went by quicker if i did get professional help but I didn\u2019t want to put my schooling on pause (especially now that I\u2019m in my last year). Wishing you all the best and hope you all get better one day. Please don\u2019t let this take over your life.",

I\u2019ve been gradually decreasing b/p frequency over the past few months and had been losing and gaining the same 2kg. I think part of it was also that my intake (outside of b/p) had gotten very low so when I increased it there was a bit of weight gain while my body adjusted. And I went through a little phase where I was trying to quit while simultaneously increasing my cal intake and had some extreme hunger episodes, after which I\u2019d purge but bc it wasn\u2019t planned I ended up absorbing quite a lot of food from them. Now I do seem to be losing weight again with the OCCASIONAL b/p but it is slower than expected and if I b/p more than about 3-4x a week I maintain. The other problem is that the constant quitting-then-giving-in-again cycle is causing recurrent water retention.\n\nHonestly though, even if you do lose weight from b/p that doesn\u2019t make it worth it AT ALL.

But it must have been around 20+ lbs (at least that\u2019s what multiple people told me) from February to May. I also went from a medium to an extra small in shirt size, for reference. Not only did I loose some weight but I also started loosing my hair, i lost my good grades in school, i lost my feminine cycle, i become unintentionally distant with my friends and my partner, i almost lost my 2 year relationship, i was in a \u201cbad mood\u201d 25/8, my nails would take forever to grow, i lost all the undertones in my face i looked pale/grey, i had under eye bags that would never cover (no matter how much concealer I would use). Also what was unfortunate in my case was my weight distribution, so i did loose belly fat but that was the basically the last place i was loosing from and which is why i did this for so long. I became underweight and had the bmi of about 13 (I\u2019m 5\u20198). At some point i did stop loosing (july). I also forced myself to semi recover because I wanted to stop being so mean to the people that loved me most ( my family and my boyfriend). Not only that but people started to notice we\u2019re making comments to my mom at family outings (some people didn\u2019t think it was an ed and thought I had cancer) that was when I knew I had to stop. But I cant stop, it doesn\u2019t ever just stop, the feeling of always needing to loose weight and being thin always outgrows my want to get better. Of course some days are worse than others but I have stopped b/p as much as I used to. And I still haven\u2019t gotten my period back (if you have any tips to help with this please let me know!!). I think this process would have went by quicker if i did get professional help but I didn\u2019t want to put my schooling on pause (especially now that I\u2019m in my last year).
