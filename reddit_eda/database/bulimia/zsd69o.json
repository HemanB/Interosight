  "selftext": "Went out for dinner for Christmas with my dad and sisters. He really wanted to treat us and do something special. before leaving though, I just had to get it up. I feel like I wasted my Dad's money and that the food could have gone to someone who needed it. \n\nWasn't a pleasant purge either, we had a blue cheese platter to finish, which definitely did not taste as good coming up and it did going down. \n\nI just want too cry, I feel so much guilt",

      "body": "I try not to think of purging food as a waste first I doubt anyone who \"needed it\" would have got the food it was a treat at a restaurant which most people who are in poverty wouldn't be able to afford and restaurants just throw out leftovers anyways second treats aren't exactly meant for fuel you don't need to justify eating it you wouldn't say you eat chocolate for fuel or nourishment it's okay to have fun foods or meals just for the sake of enjoyment regardless of whether you manage to keep it down and last of all you're a human you deserve to have food and trips out to eat at restaurants just because you're struggling doesn't mean you suddenly don't need food or deserve to have fun foods and expensive foods your dad took you to the restaurant so you would enjoy the meal and if you enjoyed it then he will be happy and that's all he wanted from you you haven't betrayed him or wasted it in any way you guys had a nice time eating and that's it I'm sure he wouldn't want you to beat yourself up over a mental illness :)",
