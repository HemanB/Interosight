  "selftext": "I am honestly petrified to post this, I am afraid it will get back to my family and friends.  But, here goes.  I am a 43yo Male, a 15 year Combat Veteran and I have struggled with binging and purging since I was 17yo.  I have become an expert at hiding it, I have lied to people I love, I have purged at friends houses, family's houses, pretty much anywhere I have put food in my mouth I have done it.  The only person that knows is my wife and she has no idea how to help me.  I am so tired of living with the guilt and shame that I feel every time, I am tired of blowing through hundreds of dollars in groceries and I have kids that need me around and I don't want them to lose me early.  I am ashamed of what I see in the mirror, I don't know how to stop and worst of all, I am scared to go get help and they don't believe me.  I have learned different ways of keeping just enough weight on me that people don't get suspicious.  But, I am obsessed with shoving as much food in me as possible and I need help.  Please.\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for the amazing support and for sharing your personal experiences with me. It really helps to know I\u2019m not alone. And thanks to all your encouragement, I called my doctor and made an appointment for Monday! I hope to be in this group helping others just as you\u2019ve all helped me! You\u2019re all in my heart!",

No one deserves this, and it's never your fault for developing an ED.\n\nIts good that your wife knows about your situation, but I feel like professional help would benefit you both. A therapist and treatment team would be able to support you in recovery, and they could also direct your wife in helping you get better as well. As far as I know, you can get referred to a therapist through your general practitioner (in the USA) who can then diagnose you and maybe also refer you to a dietician. If you can't get to your GP, I believe you can also make a direct appointment with a therapist.\nAgain, I'm so sorry you've been struggling for so long, and you deserve a life better than what your ED has been giving you.

There is so much guilt and shame associated with eating disorders it's unbearable a lot of the time. I hope knowing you aren't alone helps. If you can try to see a therapist I think it would help. I saw one thisbpast year until quarantine and I was too embarassed to continue because I live with parents and there is never a time where I have ghe privacy to do therapy from home and my family history is riddled with abuse and causes of my mental health issues, but I would continue if I felt I could comfortably. Posting here helps me a lot, and so does watching videos by ED therapist Kati Morton on youtube. Your wife along with you could understand and help by watching her videos, she has some on helping loved ones along with every other mental health and ED issue under the sun. I also use a workbook called The Body Awareness Workbook for Trauma written by an MD and when I regularly use it it feels like therapy. I am also a parent and as much as I feel depressed and deep in a hole, I too want to be here for my child. Remember that baby steps in the right direction are worth celebrating.

I know mine now is more habit and compulsion than it was at the start. At the start it was a way to control my life when I had basically no control over anything. Perhaps if it\u2019s not too painful or uncomfortable, you could talk with your wife about when this all first started and try and reflect on your feelings and emotional state then. And maybe you could reflect (potentially in your head or in a journal) about what you feel just before a binge and what kind of triggers it. This may not be easy bc for some of us it\u2019s like a drawn out process of looking at catalogues and planning a binge. Tbh most of the professional help I\u2019ve gotten was a) keep a food journal (makes u feel shit bc u see all the food ur wasting) b) just follow this shit meal plan for a while c) CBT. No one was ever really interested in the cause, just masking or changing symptoms. Perhaps you could also speak with a doctor about medication. Good luck friend, I really feel for you being not the typical sufferer. It must be really hard and I could imagine the shame much higher. Best of luck!",

      "body": "Thank you for your service. And for opening up and sharing your story. Know that your ED does not define you. Binging and purging are symptoms sometimes of a deeper illness - some have already mentioned therapeutic help. I want to provide you with another resource that helped me recover. \n\nWhen I tried dieting, I would binge harder. When I tried a pill prescribed by my psychiatrist, i thought I had carte Blanche to binge and purge - because surely the medicine just wasn\u2019t working yet. \n\nI was terrified of the kitchen and what I\u2019d do in there. I\u2019d sometimes spend all day in bed, afraid if I left I\u2019d eat everything I had, go to the store, pack in more, and purge it all again. Fear ruled my interactions with people, with what they might find out about me, with what I saw in the mirror, what I ate and didn\u2019t eat. I binged, purged, restricted, compulsively exercised - anything to fill the void. \n\nMy eating disorder was in control. And I\u2019d learned I couldn\u2019t be. I had zero willpower to handle this illness. This past spring, I met some people who were recovered from what they called compulsive eating. And when they described their stories to me, I felt like someone could finally understand me. They described an illness that affects the mind and the body - with a mental obsession around food and a bodily craving that is set off whenever I start to compulsively eat. It all made sense. That\u2019s why no diet could work for me. I was obsessed. I needed help outside my own willpower. \n\nToday, I\u2019m recovered from my compulsive behaviors around food. I don\u2019t have to white knuckle it anymore. I don\u2019t count calories, weigh myself obsessively, or cut out certain foods. I found this recovery through a 12-step program that emphasizes freedom over restriction and fellowship and spirituality over going it alone. If that sounds like something that would interest you, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out via PM. I\u2019d love to be helpful in any way I can \u2764\ufe0f",

The more you talk about it, the easier it will be. If you get an appointment, I also recommend writing down everything you want to say (symptoms, how this affects your life, what you need, any questions), so that no detail goes unsaid and your issue is treated seriously.\nIf you're concerned about binging and purging a lot of money, I'd advise you to drink more water. When you eat, take a sip of water after every 2-3 bites. It will at least slow down your binge, and it may trick your body into thinking you're more full. However, if you begin drinking a lot of water, remember to take electrolytes (natrium, calcium, kalium, magnesium etc.)! And this is really not a solution to the issue as a whole, seeing a professional is the #1 priority.\nI hope things get better soon. We believe in you!",

I see specialized therapists, for EMDR (a type of trauma therapy) and IFS (a type of therapy developed for eating disorders) after years of regular talk therapy didn't help me much.

No one deserves this, and it's never your fault for developing an ED.\n\nIts good that your wife knows about your situation, but I feel like professional help would benefit you both. A therapist and treatment team would be able to support you in recovery, and they could also direct your wife in helping you get better as well. As far as I know, you can get referred to a therapist through your general practitioner (in the USA) who can then diagnose you and maybe also refer you to a dietician. If you can't get to your GP, I believe you can also make a direct appointment with a therapist.\nAgain, I'm so sorry you've been struggling for so long, and you deserve a life better than what your ED has been giving you.

There is so much guilt and shame associated with eating disorders it's unbearable a lot of the time. I hope knowing you aren't alone helps. If you can try to see a therapist I think it would help. I saw one thisbpast year until quarantine and I was too embarassed to continue because I live with parents and there is never a time where I have ghe privacy to do therapy from home and my family history is riddled with abuse and causes of my mental health issues, but I would continue if I felt I could comfortably. Posting here helps me a lot, and so does watching videos by ED therapist Kati Morton on youtube. Your wife along with you could understand and help by watching her videos, she has some on helping loved ones along with every other mental health and ED issue under the sun. I also use a workbook called The Body Awareness Workbook for Trauma written by an MD and when I regularly use it it feels like therapy. I am also a parent and as much as I feel depressed and deep in a hole, I too want to be here for my child. Remember that baby steps in the right direction are worth celebrating.

I know mine now is more habit and compulsion than it was at the start. At the start it was a way to control my life when I had basically no control over anything. Perhaps if it\u2019s not too painful or uncomfortable, you could talk with your wife about when this all first started and try and reflect on your feelings and emotional state then. And maybe you could reflect (potentially in your head or in a journal) about what you feel just before a binge and what kind of triggers it. This may not be easy bc for some of us it\u2019s like a drawn out process of looking at catalogues and planning a binge. Tbh most of the professional help I\u2019ve gotten was a) keep a food journal (makes u feel shit bc u see all the food ur wasting) b) just follow this shit meal plan for a while c) CBT. No one was ever really interested in the cause, just masking or changing symptoms. Perhaps you could also speak with a doctor about medication.

Binging and purging are symptoms sometimes of a deeper illness - some have already mentioned therapeutic help. I want to provide you with another resource that helped me recover. \n\nWhen I tried dieting, I would binge harder. When I tried a pill prescribed by my psychiatrist, i thought I had carte Blanche to binge and purge - because surely the medicine just wasn\u2019t working yet. \n\nI was terrified of the kitchen and what I\u2019d do in there. I\u2019d sometimes spend all day in bed, afraid if I left I\u2019d eat everything I had, go to the store, pack in more, and purge it all again. Fear ruled my interactions with people, with what they might find out about me, with what I saw in the mirror, what I ate and didn\u2019t eat. I binged, purged, restricted, compulsively exercised - anything to fill the void. \n\nMy eating disorder was in control. And I\u2019d learned I couldn\u2019t be. I had zero willpower to handle this illness. This past spring, I met some people who were recovered from what they called compulsive eating. And when they described their stories to me, I felt like someone could finally understand me. They described an illness that affects the mind and the body - with a mental obsession around food and a bodily craving that is set off whenever I start to compulsively eat. It all made sense. That\u2019s why no diet could work for me. I was obsessed. I needed help outside my own willpower. \n\nToday, I\u2019m recovered from my compulsive behaviors around food. I don\u2019t have to white knuckle it anymore. I don\u2019t count calories, weigh myself obsessively, or cut out certain foods. I found this recovery through a 12-step program that emphasizes freedom over restriction and fellowship and spirituality over going it alone. If that sounds like something that would interest you, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out via PM. I\u2019d love to be helpful in any way I can \u2764\ufe0f",

When you eat, take a sip of water after every 2-3 bites. It will at least slow down your binge, and it may trick your body into thinking you're more full. However, if you begin drinking a lot of water, remember to take electrolytes (natrium, calcium, kalium, magnesium etc.)!

There is so much guilt and shame associated with eating disorders it's unbearable a lot of the time. I hope knowing you aren't alone helps. If you can try to see a therapist I think it would help. I saw one thisbpast year until quarantine and I was too embarassed to continue because I live with parents and there is never a time where I have ghe privacy to do therapy from home and my family history is riddled with abuse and causes of my mental health issues, but I would continue if I felt I could comfortably. Posting here helps me a lot, and so does watching videos by ED therapist Kati Morton on youtube. Your wife along with you could understand and help by watching her videos, she has some on helping loved ones along with every other mental health and ED issue under the sun. I also use a workbook called The Body Awareness Workbook for Trauma written by an MD and when I regularly use it it feels like therapy. I am also a parent and as much as I feel depressed and deep in a hole, I too want to be here for my child. Remember that baby steps in the right direction are worth celebrating. You matter and you aren't alone.\u2764\ufe0f",
