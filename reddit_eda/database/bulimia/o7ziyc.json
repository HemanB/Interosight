  "selftext": "So I had a pretty bad relapse\u2026.2 weeks straight b/p. Only eating once and day and making sure I got every last bit out. I decided about 3 days ago I would have a normal meal and keep it down (which I did, horray)!\n\nFast forward to today and I was still feeling incredibly bloated and still hadn\u2019t used the bathroom. I decided I would help things along by taking 3 of those little orange pills I used to down like candy. I mean like 10 a day at my worst. 3 can\u2019t possible hurt, right?\n\nWRONG. Satan himself is wreaking havoc on my insides and liquid evil has been spewing from me for 4 hours now. Any water that was in me is now in my plumbing. I feel like a rag being wrung out. I want off this ride. Please do not make the same mistake I did and for the love of all things good stay hydrated. Luv yall!\n\nSincerly,\n    Girl on the toilet.",
