  "title": "How I beat 12 years of Severe Bulimia and What Recovery is Like",
  "selftext": "As the title says, I've finally beat Bulimia on my own and have been purge free for months. It hasn't been an easy journey, but I'm glad I'm here and I feel obligated to share with everyone else in this community my journey and how I beat it so that everyone can feel a little less alone with this isolating disorder, and in hopes that my story will inspire someone else to recover. I only discovered this subreddit recently, and tbh I wish I had discovered this earlier because I went a decade thinking I was completely alone in this battle.\n\n**History**\n\nI started when I was 16 when I found out I can throw up at will. I never needed to poke my throat which made throwing up that much easier. I'd tell myself it wasn't \"really\" throwing up because I could naturally do it and I could throw my food up almost instantly. Once I found out I could do it, I was throwing up everyday.\n\nI prided myself in being a \"good\" bulimic. I would research a lot on how to minimize the effects of the disease--throwing up immediately after to reduce the acid, gargling and drinking water right after, trying not to let it hit my teeth, eating a bit of healthy food after throwing up a binge so that I'm not actually malnourished, eating foods that were easy to throw up, etc. Do not do what I did because you are essentially lying to yourself--no amount of risk mitigation will actually prevent the damage, which I will get into later.\n\nIt wasn't too long until my family found out I was throwing up because I was careless with the vomit. They would smell it in the bathroom, and there was one time I clogged up all the sinks and even the shower drain from throwing up. It was mortifying and obviously strained my relationship with my family. Eventually they tried to get me help when I was 19. Unfortunately, as most of you probably know, when you're *just not ready* to let go of the disease, any form of help or therapy won't actually be able to help you. At the time, I was ecstatic to be skinny and still be able to eat what I wanted. I was prescribed Prozac and instead of it helping me with the binges, it ended up becoming something I found that made it easier for me to throw up. (Serotonin loosens your lower esophageal sphincter so, go figure). Eventually I stopped going to therapy and my family thought I was recovered but I was anything but that.\n\nThe bingeing and purging continued for years to the point that it just became a part of my life. It was so second nature to me that I'd instantly go to the bathroom and throw up whenever I ate and never thought twice about it. When I was particularly stressed, I'd buy a lot of binge food with the intent of just throwing it up. I'd spend almost all my money just buying food which I would never digest. I would weigh myself before eating, then weigh myself again after throwing up to see if I had kept any of the food in. There were times I really tried to stop on my own, I'd keep telling myself \"Tomorrow I'll stop, I promise,\" but it ended up being a never-ending cycle which just made me binge and purge more. I felt really trapped. On the outside I was this successful, attractive, bubbly, and happy girl, but in secret I was throwing up every chance I could get.\n\nI've had to do some of the most disgusting things because of the disease. There were times I'd throw up in the woods when I hiked, I'd throw up in disgusting bar bathrooms, times when I threw up into a straw of a plastic cup when I couldn't get to a bathroom in time... I've literally done everything to get away with it. Some of the worst experiences were when the flush at a restaurant wouldn't work; there were times I'd empty a trash bin and fill it with water from the sink just so I can pour it over the toilet. Yes, it was that bad. I'd do anything so that I wouldn't get caught.\n\n**Health Effects**\n\nIt wasn't long until I started getting complications from the disease. Despite being careful and doing the best to try and \"mitigate\" the effects, there really is just so much you can do to prevent damage from years of bingeing and purging. This is TMI but a few years ago, I ended up developing a really itchy butt. Yes. My butt would literally itch all the time and it ruined my life because I had to sneakily scratch it when it was really bad. I had my butt checked, I got dewormed and everything and it wouldn't resolve. Honestly until today I'm not sure what it is, I can only speculate low acid in the stomach but since I've recovered, the itchy butt has gone. On top of that, I was always constipated and pooping only a little (which I used to rejoice in because hey, little poop means I didn't process a lot of food! Yes it's fucked up.) I also started getting a LOT of food bits stuck in my nose cavity and my throat and they would smell really bad to the point that I got conscious making out with my then partner. I always felt like my breath smelled because I couldn't get the dry food bits/tonsil stones out of my mouth. I had my nose checked by an ENT around last year and he said one of my glands inside were inflamed. As for my teeth, I had to have 5 of them root canal-ed and I now have jackets over them. I'd say I'm actually pretty lucky to have gotten away without losing any teeth, but let me tell you, root canals are NOT pleasant. It took months of work to patch everything up in my teeth and had to spend so much money on it. I also frequently had a hoarse voice and sore throat, and a pain in the middle of my chest. Over the last 2 years all of these got worse, which is why when the pandemic hit I told myself that it had to end or that I was eventually going to lose my health and succumb to the disease. I had to take charge of my life and not let the disease take over my life and completely ruin it as I have already let it.\n\n**Start of Recovery**\n\nThe reason I developed the disease was my vanity, so I thought to myself, the only way I could beat this was to anchor its reason on precisely that--my vanity. Throughout the years I had always been around 105-115 pounds for my 158cm height, which is low-normal but I never actually looked \"fit.\" Despite throwing up everything I ate and doing loads of cardio, I was flabby and looked pudgy. I didn't have any nice curves and I'd always wanted a big butt. I mean, yeah I looked good in clothes but I didn't actually look to good out of them, you know what I mean? This was when I started looking to the internet for solutions and found what has helped me the most through all of this: **weight lifting.** I shifted from doing cardio all the time to doing mostly lifting weights to build muscle. I got a coach which cost pretty much as much as the food I would usually buy to binge and purge. Now, lifting weights requires that you get enough nutrients, especially protein in your system in order to build muscle. I wasn't going to be able to do that if I kept throwing everything up since I wouldn't able to track how much I'd actually thrown up. This helped immensely in keeping myself from throwing up. I would tell myself that my butt wouldn't grow and my workouts would be useless if I just threw my food up, so instead I focused on eating what I think would fuel me and my muscles.\n\nLet me tell you though, it was NOT easy. I would still slip up from time to time whenever I ate \"Bad\" foods and would rationalize it as me throwing up food that would hinder my progress. But eventually, I would remind myself of all the health problems I would be putting myself through if I keep throwing up (my butt would start itching immediately after any single purge session) so I just powered through it and let myself absorb the calories when I slipped up.\n\nFrom 108 pounds at the start of the pandemic, I went to 120 in a matter of three months. The best thing about starting my recovery when the pandemic started was the fact that I didn't have to go out, I didn't have to see anyone and I could just focus my efforts on the recovery itself. Luckily, because of weightlifting I didn't actually look like I gained too much weight, in fact, I would say that I look **much better** then, and especially now than when I was throwing everything up and just doing cardio. So LISTEN TO ME. If you're doing this to look good, I'm telling you now that it won't. You'll look so much better if you actually fuel your body and work out. I now have abs and a butt which I never had in my years of the disorder and people comment on how healthy and fit I look. Yes, I no longer fit into my size 2 clothes but now I'm working towards cutting down in a healthy way whilst maintaining my muscle mass.\n\n**What Recovery Is Like**\n\nI won't sugar coat it. Recovery is a bitch. For the first few weeks, I was bloated as fuck. Literally--I looked like I was pregnant and my stomach would just swell every time I let it digest anything. I would constantly have to stop myself from throwing it up as I was scared that eating would make me fat instantly. Sometimes I would throw up even when I didn't want to because my stomach was so used to throwing everything up.\n\nAfter a few weeks, the bloating went down though and I stopped being constipated. My itchy butt disappeared, too. I stopped having food bits stuck in my throat and nose cavity and the swelling in my nostril went down. The last time I went to the dentist, I only had one tiny cavity compared to having so much discovered before when I was throwing up all the time. My cheeks are also a lot less swollen.\n\nThe only real symptoms that remain with me now that I'm months recovered is acid reflux pains and a sore throat most of the time. I will be having myself scoped at the end of the year, and honestly, it scares me to know what kind of damage I've done to my esophagus and my throat. I am scared that I've developed esophagitis or Barrett's esophagus and it keeps me up at night. Sometimes I drink coffee and my throat just closes up and I cough all the time. But I just tell myself, it's good I've recovered now and that I am taking steps to heal myself and make sure this doesn't happen again, and there's no use regretting something that's already been done. I am constantly riddled with anxiety over it, and I guess that's another lingering effect of the disorder. Honestly, it's the worst. If you're experiencing health anxiety now, it won't get any better unless you actually do something to stop it.\n\nAnyway, that's it. I just wanted to get this off my chest, and hopefully show you guys that recovery is possible even for the most severe of cases. I am just here if you want someone to talk to or need an accountability buddy; tbh none of my friends irl even have an inkling about it so it's been a very isolating thing. The only person who knows is my partner (who has been very understanding and supportive about my past) and my family.\n\nFeel free to comment if any of you have gone through any of the stuff I have because I have really believed I'm the only one who's had it this bad!",

      "body": "Thank you so much for sharing your story. It is wonderful that you have reclaimed your life from such an all consuming illness. You should be so proud of all your efforts and hard work. \n\nI had an eating disorder for over 15 years and it can be incredibly difficult for long time sufferers to recover. I can relate to a lot of your story and you are definitely not the only one who has gone through this. I've been in recovery for 4 years and it's been a journey. Recovery is incredibly difficult but infinitely worth it. I feel like I recovered my true self, the person I was before I ever got sick, the little girl who was always on her own side.\n\nYou mentioned \"cutting down in a healthy way\" which is a bit concerning. When I first went into recovery, after about six months, I had gained weight. The weight gain was torturous to my eating disorder, which was still present in my thoughts even though my behaviors were gone. I went on a diet in order to lose it the weight and I told myself I was doing it in a \"healthy way.\" I ended up relapsing and it took me over a year to climb out of that relapse. I urge you to be careful because this kind of thinking can be a very slippery slope. I'm not saying this will happen to you, I just want you to be aware that your eating disorder can still be active in your thoughts and use the guise of \"getting healthy\" in order to weasel its way back into your life.\n\nYou are amazing, strong and you have your whole life ahead of you. Take good care and keep up the fantastic work. Lots of love! \ud83d\udc97",

It's actually recently return as I'm slowly starting recovery.  I'll actually need surgery in due course. Luckily my teeth have always been in surpringly good condition though. \n\nI think the only difference is i took the bulimarexic route to have the fit body for 7 years.\n\n\nAnd the fact i need significant trauma based psychotherapy. So it's not really doing it on my own. \n\n\nI found the biggest regrets **weren't** body wise as i was so crazy in my disorder i had the body i wanted for quite a while.  It was more the money i spent on binge purge food,  and the chronic exhaustion and always feeling like shot and the refusal to let it go as a stress management vice. \n\nI've also been caught in some incredibly embarrassing situations,  being busted at work, having my car searched by police because i looked suss as i had binged and was ready to use to the public toilet,  clogging a toilet in my parents house and costing them a plumber,  looks of pity from supermarket staff even though i would rotate to 7 different supermarkets to try to cover it up,  throwing up in a bag in my car before work. Being caught multiple times nicking other people's food. \nAnd the simple crazy amount of time i spent each day doing it. \n\n.",

As  for my digestion, it's actually fine aside from acid reflux problems. I will be getting an endoscopy/gastroscopy at the end of the year, though, just to make sure.

You should be so proud of all your efforts and hard work. \n\nI had an eating disorder for over 15 years and it can be incredibly difficult for long time sufferers to recover. I can relate to a lot of your story and you are definitely not the only one who has gone through this. I've been in recovery for 4 years and it's been a journey. Recovery is incredibly difficult but infinitely worth it. I feel like I recovered my true self, the person I was before I ever got sick, the little girl who was always on her own side.\n\nYou mentioned \"cutting down in a healthy way\" which is a bit concerning. When I first went into recovery, after about six months, I had gained weight. The weight gain was torturous to my eating disorder, which was still present in my thoughts even though my behaviors were gone. I went on a diet in order to lose it the weight and I told myself I was doing it in a \"healthy way.\" I ended up relapsing and it took me over a year to climb out of that relapse. I urge you to be careful because this kind of thinking can be a very slippery slope. I'm not saying this will happen to you, I just want you to be aware that your eating disorder can still be active in your thoughts and use the guise of \"getting healthy\" in order to weasel its way back into your life.\n\nYou are amazing, strong and you have your whole life ahead of you. Take good care and keep up the fantastic work. Lots of love! \ud83d\udc97",

I was getting a big allowance from my parents and literally it all went out the drain when I'd order multiple food items at a time and buy food to binge on. It's such a waste. I'm glad we realized that and it's a good deterrent not to do it again since there's so much better things we can be spending it on!\n\nI've also gone through all of those embarrassing situations! I've been caught throwing up a couple of times, too, and I've had to pretend I was just sick. Honestly, it is the worst. \n\nI'm wishing you the best for your recovery. Honestly, I didn't think I could do it on my own and was almost at the point where I wanted to go inpatient or do something extreme since years of trying to break free really didn't work. But I guess I linked my obsession to it to being seen by other people as \"fat\", and the only thing that finally made me stop is being forced not to see people for a while due to the lockdowns. Tbh I'm still planning to get help to iron my issues out, since it might also be trauma-based. I was bullied and shunned a lot growing up for being fat (as I think a lot of people who have EDs were,) and now I'm just deathly afraid to be called fat again. \n\nWe can do this! It's not too late for us.",

It's actually recently return as I'm slowly starting recovery.  I'll actually need surgery in due course. Luckily my teeth have always been in surpringly good condition though. \n\nI think the only difference is i took the bulimarexic route to have the fit body for 7 years.\n\n\nAnd the fact i need significant trauma based psychotherapy. So it's not really doing it on my own. \n\n\nI found the biggest regrets **weren't** body wise as i was so crazy in my disorder i had the body i wanted for quite a while.  It was more the money i spent on binge purge food,  and the chronic exhaustion and always feeling like shot and the refusal to let it go as a stress management vice. \n\nI've also been caught in some incredibly embarrassing situations,  being busted at work, having my car searched by police because i looked suss as i had binged and was ready to use to the public toilet,  clogging a toilet in my parents house and costing them a plumber,  looks of pity from supermarket staff even though i would rotate to 7 different supermarkets to try to cover it up,  throwing up in a bag in my car before work. Being caught multiple times nicking other people's food. \nAnd the simple crazy amount of time i spent each day doing it. \n\n.",

What I will recommend depends on what stage of recovery you're in and how much you've been doing it and how long. Because, if you're still stuck in the daily b/p cycle, nothing will be able to help you stop it unless you take the external pressure off you to do b/p. For me, the external pressure was going out and being seen by people. I needed to take the time not to be seen, and used weightlifting as a \"healthy\" way to gain weight while I was recovering. But now, when the urge arises I just think about all the health effects it has given me. The painful root canals, the heartburn, the fact that I might not be able to enjoy life later on because of all the health effects I'd be suffering. I also look at GERD and bulimia posts online to see posts written by those who've had it for decades and tell myself I'd be living with the same amount of suffering and regret if I don't stop it now.",

Avant c\u2019\u00e9tait doctissimo qu\u2019on utilisait pour \u00e7a). \n\nJ\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 boulimique vomitive (avec quelques phases de semies anorexies toujours termin\u00e9es par un festival comme on les d\u00e9teste) de mes seize \u00e0 vingt-sept ans (avec une tr\u00e8s br\u00e8ve rechute d\u2019un mois suite \u00e0 un d\u00e9c\u00e8s en 2019), mais on peut dire que je suis gu\u00e9rie parce que c\u2019est presque quelque chose que j\u2019ai oubli\u00e9 et dont je ne me souviens que lorsque quelqu\u2019un parle de TOC ou en ce moment parce que j\u2019ai de gros reflux et que je dois prendre de l\u2019inexium (apr\u00e8s une visite chez un gastro ent\u00e9rologue y\u2019a huit ans, on a vu des ulc\u00e8res et d\u00e9tect\u00e9 un clapet qui n\u2019\u00e9tait plus capable de se fermer - d\u2019o\u00f9 les rejets). \n\nBref, dans mon cas je sais que les ulc\u00e8res sont surtout li\u00e9s \u00e0 une ultra consommation d\u2019ibuprofene et d\u2019aspirine quand j\u2019\u00e9tais ado et au d\u00e9but de ma vie d\u2019adulte (j\u2019avais litt\u00e9ralement envie d\u2019avoir toujours un m\u00e9doc dans le corps \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque. Ma m\u00e8re \u00e9tait pharmacienne, et j\u2019avais d\u2019\u00e9normes soucis avec elle, le lien se fait assez rapidement). \n\nPhysiquement aujourd\u2019hui il ne me reste plus que 1) ce clapet ouvert constamment et qui me donne donc parfois de gros reflux mais qui sont tr\u00e8s bien soign\u00e9s par la prise d\u2019inexium sur quelques mois. \n2) Et quatre dents que j\u2019ai carr\u00e9ment d\u00fb faire raser pour mettre un bridge (de fausses dents permanentes quoi. Je le pr\u00e9cise parce qu\u2019on pense que les bridges sont une esp\u00e8ce de truc bizarre r\u00e9serv\u00e9s aux vieux, mais en fait non. Et m\u00eame si \u00e7a co\u00fbte bien cher, genre 600 balles par dents, ensuite c\u2019est pour la vie), parce que l\u2019acidit\u00e9 due aux vomissements quotidiens les avaient compl\u00e8tement \u00ab\u00a0lim\u00e9es\u00a0\u00bb et que \u00e7a ne faisait carr\u00e9ment pas propre. \nJ\u2019ai toujours eu de tr\u00e8s belles dents ainsi qu\u2019un tr\u00e8s beau sourire en plus, donc \u00e7a me faisait passablement chier d\u2019avoir tout ab\u00eem\u00e9 comme \u00e7a et d\u2019avoir l\u2019air d\u2019une cam\u00e9e au niveau buccal. \nEt c\u2019est tout ! \n\nEt pourtant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque c\u2019\u00e9tait catastrophique. \nPlusieurs fois par jour comme toi (jusqu\u2019\u00e0 dix fois par jour). Tous les jours. Avec que \u00e7a dans la t\u00eate. J\u2019ai pass\u00e9 le bac \u00e0 moiti\u00e9 dans les chiottes \u00e0 faire semblant d\u2019\u00eatre malade. \nJ\u2019avais tous les vaisseaux sanguins autour des yeux en permanence \u00e9clat\u00e9s (des points rouges partout) \u00e0 force de forcer sur le visage t\u00eate en bas. \nMal \u00e0 la gorge tout le temps, ultra ballonn\u00e9e (envie de peter tr\u00e8s souvent hein, autant dire vraiment les choses), mal \u00e0 la m\u00e2choire, les yeux gonfl\u00e9s, les ganglions de la gorge enfl\u00e9s, des pointes au c\u0153ur tr\u00e8s bizarres, l\u2019impression d\u2019\u00eatre physiquement \u00e9puis\u00e9e. \nAlors m\u00eame si un t\u00e9moignage n\u2019est jamais une preuve et ne vaut jamais comme ultime v\u00e9rit\u00e9, il est possible de s\u2019en sortir sans trop de s\u00e9quelles. \nJ\u2019ai appris r\u00e9cemment que ma belle-s\u0153ur avait eu le m\u00eame souci que nous. Elle a eu la chance de n\u2019avoir aucune s\u00e9quelle physique. \n\nJe voudrais te dire, et dire \u00e0 tous ceux qui me liront, que c\u2019est possible d\u2019arr\u00eater. \n\u00c7a ne se fait pas du jour au lendemain, mais c\u2019est possible m\u00eame quand on est au pire stade de la maladie (\u00e0 ne vivre plus qu\u2019\u00e0 travers et pour \u00e7a. D\u00e9penser tout son argent l\u00e0-dedans, faire son emploi du temps en fonction de \u00e7a, etc.) \n\nChacun aura sa fa\u00e7on (ses fa\u00e7ons m\u00eame) d\u2019y parvenir, et malheureusement je crois qu\u2019aucun conseil sp\u00e9cifique n\u2019est applicable \u00e0 tout.e.s mais je vous promets que m\u00eame quand on croit que c\u2019est impossible et qu\u2019on a envie d\u2019en finir : on peut y arriver. \nPerso, je n\u2019ai pas essay\u00e9 d\u2019arr\u00eater la boulimie je crois. J\u2019ai finalement r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 me d\u00e9tacher des emprises ext\u00e9rieures et \u00e0 faire ce que j\u2019avais vraiment envie de faire en envoyant chier les personnes \u00e0 qui \u00e7a ne plaisait pas. \nJ\u2019adorais le cin\u00e9ma, l\u2019\u00e9criture, la photo, les trucs bizarres : j\u2019\u00e9tais bizarre et je le suis toujours, et en fait c\u2019est en rencontrant des gens qui m\u2019aimaient sinc\u00e8rement avec ma bizarrerie (et le sinc\u00e8rement fait toute la diff\u00e9rence, parce que d\u2019autres n\u2019aimaient que ma bizarrerie parce que c\u2019\u00e9tait \u00ab\u00a0cool d\u2019avoir une amie aussi barr\u00e9e\u00a0\u00bb) et en me lan\u00e7ant du coup moi aussi sinc\u00e8rement dans des activit\u00e9s qui me plaisaient que \u00e7a a finalement disparu (sans que je n\u2019y pense vraiment). \nPar ex: Progressivement, je me suis aper\u00e7ue que j\u2019avais envie d\u2019\u00e9crire ce sc\u00e9nario, je l\u2019\u00e9crivais, je ne voyais pas le temps passer, le soir arrivait et je m\u2019apercevais que j\u2019avais carr\u00e9ment oubli\u00e9 de manger ! Le soir je vomissais une ou deux fois, par \u00ab\u00a0principe\u00a0\u00bb, et voil\u00e0 comme \u00e7a a commenc\u00e9. \nJe crois que le truc similaire chez tous ceux qui sont gu\u00e9ris, c\u2019est une forme d\u2019\u00e9mancipation face \u00e0 un juge interne qui s\u2019est fabriqu\u00e9 \u00e0 cause de pressions ext\u00e9rieures. Ce juge interne finit par dispara\u00eetre quand on se d\u00e9couvre vraiment \u00e0 travers de nouveaux regards, de nouvelles appr\u00e9ciations. \n\nOn aura toujours un rapport \u00e0 la nourriture diff\u00e9rent (moi maintenant parfois je saute des repas quand je suis tr\u00e8s investie dans un t\u00e2che, mais je ne compense pas apr\u00e8s. Mais je sais qu\u2019il est assez inhabituel d\u2019oublier de manger). \nJe mange seulement quand j\u2019en ai envie moi. \nDu coup je d\u00e9jeune \u00e0 15h, je prends un go\u00fbter bien gourmand \u00e0 19h, et ensuite je remange vers 23h, et g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement je me fais un yaourt avant d\u2019aller dormir vers 2h. Et je ne change absolument rien par devoir social. Les autres savent que mes horaires de repas sont les miens, et je pense que \u00e7a m\u2019a bien aid\u00e9e aussi qu\u2019on accepte cette part un peu socialement inadapt\u00e9e de moi. \n\nBeaucoup de courage \u00e0 tout le monde. La gu\u00e9rison est possible et m\u00eame souvent tr\u00e8s probable apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de la vie \u00ab\u00a0d\u2019adulte\u00a0\u00bb (bon moi faudra qu\u2019on m\u2019explique \u00e0 quel moment j\u2019ai oubli\u00e9 de signer le papier \u00ab\u00a0je suis adulte\u00a0\u00bb parce que clairement je ne le suis pas, mais vous avez compris).",

Are you still doing it now? Try to stop b/p for at least a month and see what happens. You really need to commit to it for your gut to rebalance yourself. As  for my digestion, it's actually fine aside from acid reflux problems. I will be getting an endoscopy/gastroscopy at the end of the year, though, just to make sure. Have you tried getting scoped before? Maybe it could also give clues as to why it's happening, but really, it only stopped for me when I consistently stopped the b/p.",

Recovery has been quite a journey for me and definitely not linear.\n\nAt the beginning of recovery my digestion was really bad and I would get severe bloating/pain. Luckily that didn't last for more than a few weeks and it drastically improved. I was extremely emotional during recovery and my moods were all over the place. After having numbed myself for so many years, suddenly I was no longer numb and I was feeling everything. This was actually good even though it was difficult. Tolerating difficult emotions is a life skill and I'm forever grateful that I have this ability. \n\nI have a bit of acid reflux but its getting better all the time. I need to make a dental appointment which I've been putting off. I'm not experiencing any tooth pain or issues but I know it's a good idea to get checked out. The body is amazing at healing itself and I've been very lucky that my physical health is good.\n\nI'm glad to know you are aware of the risks around losing weight and that you are being careful.

Tbh I did have those relapse issues at the start; but I think at this point I'm never going to purge again because I've been starting to be afraid of the consequences. The acid reflux and LPR are no joke, as well as the root canals so I'm a bit traumatized out of the habit.

Being caught multiple times nicking other people's food. \nAnd the simple crazy amount of time i spent each day doing it. \n\n.",

I've been caught throwing up a couple of times, too, and I've had to pretend I was just sick. Honestly, it is the worst. \n\nI'm wishing you the best for your recovery. Honestly, I didn't think I could do it on my own and was almost at the point where I wanted to go inpatient or do something extreme since years of trying to break free really didn't work. But I guess I linked my obsession to it to being seen by other people as \"fat\", and the only thing that finally made me stop is being forced not to see people for a while due to the lockdowns. Tbh I'm still planning to get help to iron my issues out, since it might also be trauma-based. I was bullied and shunned a lot growing up for being fat (as I think a lot of people who have EDs were,) and now I'm just deathly afraid to be called fat again. \n\nWe can do this!

What I will recommend depends on what stage of recovery you're in and how much you've been doing it and how long. Because, if you're still stuck in the daily b/p cycle, nothing will be able to help you stop it unless you take the external pressure off you to do b/p. For me, the external pressure was going out and being seen by people. I needed to take the time not to be seen, and used weightlifting as a \"healthy\" way to gain weight while I was recovering. But now, when the urge arises I just think about all the health effects it has given me. The painful root canals, the heartburn, the fact that I might not be able to enjoy life later on because of all the health effects I'd be suffering. I also look at GERD and bulimia posts online to see posts written by those who've had it for decades and tell myself I'd be living with the same amount of suffering and regret if I don't stop it now.",

J\u2019ai finalement r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 me d\u00e9tacher des emprises ext\u00e9rieures et \u00e0 faire ce que j\u2019avais vraiment envie de faire en envoyant chier les personnes \u00e0 qui \u00e7a ne plaisait pas. \nJ\u2019adorais le cin\u00e9ma, l\u2019\u00e9criture, la photo, les trucs bizarres : j\u2019\u00e9tais bizarre et je le suis toujours, et en fait c\u2019est en rencontrant des gens qui m\u2019aimaient sinc\u00e8rement avec ma bizarrerie (et le sinc\u00e8rement fait toute la diff\u00e9rence, parce que d\u2019autres n\u2019aimaient que ma bizarrerie parce que c\u2019\u00e9tait \u00ab\u00a0cool d\u2019avoir une amie aussi barr\u00e9e\u00a0\u00bb) et en me lan\u00e7ant du coup moi aussi sinc\u00e8rement dans des activit\u00e9s qui me plaisaient que \u00e7a a finalement disparu (sans que je n\u2019y pense vraiment). \nPar ex: Progressivement, je me suis aper\u00e7ue que j\u2019avais envie d\u2019\u00e9crire ce sc\u00e9nario, je l\u2019\u00e9crivais, je ne voyais pas le temps passer, le soir arrivait et je m\u2019apercevais que j\u2019avais carr\u00e9ment oubli\u00e9 de manger ! Le soir je vomissais une ou deux fois, par \u00ab\u00a0principe\u00a0\u00bb, et voil\u00e0 comme \u00e7a a commenc\u00e9. \nJe crois que le truc similaire chez tous ceux qui sont gu\u00e9ris, c\u2019est une forme d\u2019\u00e9mancipation face \u00e0 un juge interne qui s\u2019est fabriqu\u00e9 \u00e0 cause de pressions ext\u00e9rieures. Ce juge interne finit par dispara\u00eetre quand on se d\u00e9couvre vraiment \u00e0 travers de nouveaux regards, de nouvelles appr\u00e9ciations. \n\nOn aura toujours un rapport \u00e0 la nourriture diff\u00e9rent (moi maintenant parfois je saute des repas quand je suis tr\u00e8s investie dans un t\u00e2che, mais je ne compense pas apr\u00e8s. Mais je sais qu\u2019il est assez inhabituel d\u2019oublier de manger). \nJe mange seulement quand j\u2019en ai envie moi. \nDu coup je d\u00e9jeune \u00e0 15h, je prends un go\u00fbter bien gourmand \u00e0 19h, et ensuite je remange vers 23h, et g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement je me fais un yaourt avant d\u2019aller dormir vers 2h. Et je ne change absolument rien par devoir social. Les autres savent que mes horaires de repas sont les miens, et je pense que \u00e7a m\u2019a bien aid\u00e9e aussi qu\u2019on accepte cette part un peu socialement inadapt\u00e9e de moi. \n\nBeaucoup de courage \u00e0 tout le monde. La gu\u00e9rison est possible et m\u00eame souvent tr\u00e8s probable apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de la vie \u00ab\u00a0d\u2019adulte\u00a0\u00bb (bon moi faudra qu\u2019on m\u2019explique \u00e0 quel moment j\u2019ai oubli\u00e9 de signer le papier \u00ab\u00a0je suis adulte\u00a0\u00bb parce que clairement je ne le suis pas, mais vous avez compris).",

You should be so proud of all your efforts and hard work. \n\nI had an eating disorder for over 15 years and it can be incredibly difficult for long time sufferers to recover. I can relate to a lot of your story and you are definitely not the only one who has gone through this. I've been in recovery for 4 years and it's been a journey. Recovery is incredibly difficult but infinitely worth it. I feel like I recovered my true self, the person I was before I ever got sick, the little girl who was always on her own side.\n\nYou mentioned \"cutting down in a healthy way\" which is a bit concerning. When I first went into recovery, after about six months, I had gained weight. The weight gain was torturous to my eating disorder, which was still present in my thoughts even though my behaviors were gone. I went on a diet in order to lose it the weight and I told myself I was doing it in a \"healthy way.\" I ended up relapsing and it took me over a year to climb out of that relapse. I urge you to be careful because this kind of thinking can be a very slippery slope. I'm not saying this will happen to you, I just want you to be aware that your eating disorder can still be active in your thoughts and use the guise of \"getting healthy\" in order to weasel its way back into your life.\n\nYou are amazing, strong and you have your whole life ahead of you.

The acid reflux and LPR are no joke, as well as the root canals so I'm a bit traumatized out of the habit. At my highest after recovery I was at 128 lbs, slowly but surely, 3 months later at the moment I'm at 123 lbs.

Recovery has been quite a journey for me and definitely not linear.\n\nAt the beginning of recovery my digestion was really bad and I would get severe bloating/pain. Luckily that didn't last for more than a few weeks and it drastically improved. I was extremely emotional during recovery and my moods were all over the place. After having numbed myself for so many years, suddenly I was no longer numb and I was feeling everything. This was actually good even though it was difficult. Tolerating difficult emotions is a life skill and I'm forever grateful that I have this ability. \n\nI have a bit of acid reflux but its getting better all the time. I need to make a dental appointment which I've been putting off. I'm not experiencing any tooth pain or issues but I know it's a good idea to get checked out.

What I will recommend depends on what stage of recovery you're in and how much you've been doing it and how long. Because, if you're still stuck in the daily b/p cycle, nothing will be able to help you stop it unless you take the external pressure off you to do b/p. For me, the external pressure was going out and being seen by people. I needed to take the time not to be seen, and used weightlifting as a \"healthy\" way to gain weight while I was recovering. But now, when the urge arises I just think about all the health effects it has given me. The painful root canals, the heartburn, the fact that I might not be able to enjoy life later on because of all the health effects I'd be suffering. I also look at GERD and bulimia posts online to see posts written by those who've had it for decades and tell myself I'd be living with the same amount of suffering and regret if I don't stop it now.",

It is completely normal to feel stuck and if you are recovering on your own, the process can seem even more challenging.\n\nI definitely experienced extreme hunger and mine lasted for several months. I'm currently working with a recovery coach who is an incredible resource and knows a lot about recovery and eating disorders. Here is a link to a video of hers where she discusses extreme hunger.\n\n[Dealing with Extreme Hunger in Recovery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zh5PnDS0xsI&t=3s)\n\nI tried \"all in recovery\" but I ended up relapsing after a year and that method did not work for me. When I started working with my coach we used a meal plan which included 3 meals and 2-3 snacks a day, eating every 3 hours. I still follow this structure of eating just to ensure that I am getting enough food and keep my blood sugar levels stable.\n\nRemember there is no \"right way to recover\" there is only what works for you. If you have any more questions feel free to message me. I am more than happy to help. \u2764\ufe0f",

          "body": "Thank you so much for sharing your story. It is wonderful that you have reclaimed your life from such an all consuming illness. You should be so proud of all your efforts and hard work. \n\nI had an eating disorder for over 15 years and it can be incredibly difficult for long time sufferers to recover. I can relate to a lot of your story and you are definitely not the only one who has gone through this. I've been in recovery for 4 years and it's been a journey. Recovery is incredibly difficult but infinitely worth it. I feel like I recovered my true self, the person I was before I ever got sick, the little girl who was always on her own side.\n\nYou mentioned \"cutting down in a healthy way\" which is a bit concerning. When I first went into recovery, after about six months, I had gained weight. The weight gain was torturous to my eating disorder, which was still present in my thoughts even though my behaviors were gone. I went on a diet in order to lose it the weight and I told myself I was doing it in a \"healthy way.\" I ended up relapsing and it took me over a year to climb out of that relapse. I urge you to be careful because this kind of thinking can be a very slippery slope. I'm not saying this will happen to you, I just want you to be aware that your eating disorder can still be active in your thoughts and use the guise of \"getting healthy\" in order to weasel its way back into your life.\n\nYou are amazing, strong and you have your whole life ahead of you. Take good care and keep up the fantastic work. Lots of love! \ud83d\udc97",

Do you still have lingering issues after 4 years without purging? \n\nI really appreciate the concern! Tbh I did have those relapse issues at the start; but I think at this point I'm never going to purge again because I've been starting to be afraid of the consequences. The acid reflux and LPR are no joke, as well as the root canals so I'm a bit traumatized out of the habit. At my highest after recovery I was at 128 lbs, slowly but surely, 3 months later at the moment I'm at 123 lbs. I have no plans on getting as low as I used to, but still I'll make sure to be vigilant and not to get complacent. Again, congrats for making it out as well! Thank you for sharing with me your experiences. :)",

We are all in this together. \n\nJust to clarify, I'm 4 years in recovery but not 4 years without purging. I'm more like 1 year without purging. Recovery has been quite a journey for me and definitely not linear.\n\nAt the beginning of recovery my digestion was really bad and I would get severe bloating/pain. Luckily that didn't last for more than a few weeks and it drastically improved. I was extremely emotional during recovery and my moods were all over the place. After having numbed myself for so many years, suddenly I was no longer numb and I was feeling everything. This was actually good even though it was difficult. Tolerating difficult emotions is a life skill and I'm forever grateful that I have this ability. \n\nI have a bit of acid reflux but its getting better all the time. I need to make a dental appointment which I've been putting off. I'm not experiencing any tooth pain or issues but I know it's a good idea to get checked out. The body is amazing at healing itself and I've been very lucky that my physical health is good.\n\nI'm glad to know you are aware of the risks around losing weight and that you are being careful.
