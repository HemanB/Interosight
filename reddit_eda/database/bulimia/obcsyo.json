Some even gain.\n\nBesides, purging fucking sucks. I hate how weak I feel afterwards and how I can't think straight. My heart is pounding and my hands are shaking. I hate that feeling of dread knowing I need to find a way to purge around my family after a big meal I couldn't avoid. I hate having to stare at the toilet and psych myself up as a punishment for binging or even just overeating a little. I haven't even been purging for long and it already sucks. \n\nI wish people would educate themselves a bit more, especially if a loved one has an eating disorder.\n\nI'm really sorry he told you that. I would tell him how that made you feel and how the things he says can push you to b/p. I'd also ask him to read a bit about it from medical sites, that way he can learn more about it without you having to dig through all of the really difficult emotional stuff.",
