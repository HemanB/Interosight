  "selftext": "After my baby girl finally went to sleep (she is the WORST at going down to bed, and it\u2019s stressful) I found myself starving. Instead of b/ping like I normally do in a stressful situation I made myself a big salad, big glass of water, and a small bowl of the snack I would\u2019ve b/ped with. Now I\u2019m full and not hating myself! This is legit a new feeling, I hope to keep it going!",
