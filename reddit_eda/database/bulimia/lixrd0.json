I know this guy that I talk to and I vented about my body issues and how I didn\u2019t want to be 130 but my parents said if I didn\u2019t gain the weight they wouldn\u2019t let me drive. he said I shouldn\u2019t give a fuck as long as I\u2019m happy. And if I\u2019m happy at 130 then who cares. But I\u2019m still scared to gain weight. The last time that guy saw me was when I was overweight. Now I\u2019m nearing being underweight and i haven\u2019t seen him. I really am starting to find an interest in him though. He\u2019s a huge football player and he\u2019s really funny. Idk, we\u2019ll see what happens. \n\nAnyway, like I said. I\u2019m really happy for you and strive to be where you are someday.",
