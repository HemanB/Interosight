  "selftext": "like many of us, granola is my kryptonite. i budgeted in a serving or two in my meal plan for today but i definitely overdid it. i got that feeling of \u201cyou\u2019ve already fucked up, let\u2019s just finish the whole bag and then make a huge pasta dinner with lots of cheese, etc etc.\u201d but i put the bag away and haven\u2019t binged. this seems trivial but granola is a big trigger food so i feel like i took a big step in overcoming it.
