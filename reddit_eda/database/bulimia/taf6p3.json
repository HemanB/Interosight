  "selftext": "1) going up and down the snack/bakery aisles in the grocery store, just to look at the food, or fantasize about binging on it, without actually purchasing any of it\n\n\n2) looking up the menus of restaurants online, again just to look at the food. also adding things to your cart on uber eats/postmates/etc but not actually ordering it\n\n\n3) buy clothes, try them on in private, but stick to only wearing the same few \"safe\" outfits around other people\n\n\n4) saving countless recipes on pinterest, but never making any of them\n\n\n5) pacing every chance you get/ feeling guilty whenever you're sitting still and not burning as many calories as you could be\n\n\n6) loving to just TALK about food (my sister and i can have an hour long phone conversation just about our favorite things to eat)\n\n\n7) subconsciously grabbing at your hip/collar bones, especially when laying in bed\n\n\n8) entire youtube feed is related to food/weight/fitness in some way\n\n\n9) becoming addicted to oatmeal\n\n\n10) getting weirdly hurt/defensive if someone insults one of your safe foods\n\n\n11) suppressing the urge to binge results in some other compulsive behavior, like online shopping\n\n\n12) accounting for an extra 5-10 minutes in your morning routine to stare in the mirror and feel weird",
