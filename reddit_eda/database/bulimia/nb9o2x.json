  "selftext": "Today marks one month purge free, which I honestly am so relieved and proud to have finally reached this point. HOWEVER, I have also not weighed myself for the past 6 months. I have absolutely no concept of what my body actually looks like to other people because I used the number on the scale to validate/reassure me that I was at an \u201cacceptable\u201d size. Because of this, I basically switched from purging through throwing up to purging through exercise to deal with the anxiety that comes from not knowing, and I don\u2019t know how to stop. Does anyone have any experience with this and how they managed to cut back on the exercise? It\u2019s getting more and more obsessive and I really am trying to give my best at recovery.",

Unfortunately, I'm in the same situation (my bulimia actually started with excessive exercise and then moved into puking, now I'm back only at exercises again).

They will set up a routine for you and they surely know better how much rest is vital for a good workout routine.\n\nI'd give that a try being you! :)",

I also stored away my scale and feel the need to earn a meal though exercising. \n\nI found that my Apple Watch helped me in many ways. I would have a set goal for my \u201cmove ring\u201d, and as long as I hit that move goal by the end of the day, I stop. \n\nI also didn\u2019t set the bar too high, but I found a middle ground to make sure I\u2019m still getting in at least 30 minutes of exercise a day for health. It\u2019s also important to note to give yourself 1-2 days of rest without an intensive workout! On those days I take a light walk, do yoga, or super light exercise in comparisons to what I do during the week/non rest days. \n\nLastly, sometimes I like to plan my workouts by the week. By having it written out, I can physically see what my exercise routine might look like and I try to stick to it to not overwork myself!",
