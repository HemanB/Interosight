  "selftext": "I\u2019ve been purging for 13 days straight.\nSome days with binging, some days with overeating and some days just because I couldn\u2019t deal with the feeling of food in my stomach.\nThe last 5 days I\u2019ve been feeling it in my stomachmuscles, that they\u2019re sore from contracting in that way.\nI\u2019ve been feeling it in my throat, getting more and more sensitive.\nBUT TODAY! I\u2019ve been eating foods that make me feel good and \u201csafe\u201d and I haven\u2019t purged. I\u2019m pretty sure I won\u2019t either.. the day is almost finished!\ud83d\ude09\nCan I get a YAY for finally breaking the cycle? Feels really good!",
