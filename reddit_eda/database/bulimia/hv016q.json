  "selftext": "I\u2019m not sure if this has already been posted or if there\u2019s a rule against this but this is something that\u2019s really helped me survive through some of my darkest times. I\u2019ve been to a lot of treatment centers and they never really teach you about harm reduction. It\u2019s always focused on quitting, the thought of relapse is hardly entertained and what I\u2019ve learned through many years of addiction is you can\u2019t make somebody stop until they\u2019re ready. So here are my tips to potentially keep you safe or even save your life; some of these things have literally saved my own. \n\n-BODY ARMOR. If you\u2019re throwing up a lot and feel dizzy, light headed etc make sure you are replacing what you\u2019re losing. There\u2019s a drink called Body Armor and it\u2019s like Gatorade but it actually has electrolytes. It has 80% of your daily potassium in 4 servings (an entire large sized bottle). If you can\u2019t find this, pedialyte is a better option than Gatorade. I really encourage getting the regular ones and not the lite but if you absolutely can\u2019t do the calories, they make low cal options too. *apple juice is another good option. \n\n-ORAL CARE. I\u2019m sure we all know not to brush our teeth immediately after purging. Use mouthwash if you need to. I had a dentist recommended swishing with baking soda after purging, however, do not brush with baking soda. It\u2019s abrasive. If your teeth are damaged avoid whitening tooth pastes and use something for sensitive teeth. I wish I took better care of my teeth while I was Bulimic. I have super jagged, small teeth as a result. \n\n-PURGE FREQUENCY. This is something I did a lot. I\u2019d purge, drink water, purge, drink water. It was my way of making sure everything got out. If you can, purge ONE time per session if possible. Purging is obviously dangerous but purging over and over again can be deadly and increases the risk of hospitalization.\n\n-KNOW WHEN TO SEEK HELP. If you have tried replacing fluids/electrolytes yourself and don\u2019t feel better by the next day (dizzy, light headed, fatigued, palpitations, seeing stars etc) go to the hospital. Ideally you want to tell them the truth but if you can\u2019t, tell them you\u2019ve been sick and have not been able to hold down fluids. They\u2019ll give you fluids and check your blood. I went in for stomach pain and found out my potassium was critically low, near heart attack levels. It\u2019s also a good idea to get regular blood work done. I know some people don\u2019t have health insurance, but if you REALLY don\u2019t feel well and it\u2019s not getting better you need to get help. This is life or death. \n\nIf anyone else has any tips please add to this!!! These are just the major ones that really helped me.",

Hopefully that's all it was, 'cause that's something I can be easily cured of forever and prevent in the future. (Unlike intra-arterial deposits of fat.)\n\nEdit: Strangely enough, my inability to remain standing and to get enough air and to even be able to think clearly and lay down memories properly so that I would be able to better recall and re-tell that experience, started to hit, right as I was browsing the salts aisle, in a grocery store. They may have had just what I needed right there. (Or maybe not, if this heart,-lung,-and-mind life-threatening problem was in fact a result of some different cause.)",
