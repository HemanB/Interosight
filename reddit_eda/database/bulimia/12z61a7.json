  "selftext": "My bf was being distant to me for the past few weeks. No intimacy, short conversations, hardly texting me. I finally put my foot down and confronted him. He kept biting his lip and I begged him to tell me what was on his mind.\n\nHe asked if I was sure, that it was heavy stuff. My heart sank and I was certain it was another woman, but I pressed for the information. \n\nHe confessed he\u2019s known about my purging for months. That he thought it was gross so he didn\u2019t kiss me. Felt weird that I threw up meals he made for us. Overall was uncomfortable, but scared for my health. And didn\u2019t want to invade my privacy but wanted me to get better. \n\nWhy am I relieved? And him putting my purging into his perspective really.. helped. It *is* gross. I wouldn\u2019t want to kiss vomit mouth\u2026 why am I so okay with throwing up all the time?? What is wrong with me?? Am I really so comfortable with vomiting all of my meals that I forgot how unnatural and weird it is to others? How did my disorder become so normal that I forgot him finding out was even an option? \n\nYour partners may and probably have an idea of what you\u2019re doing. Whether you think so or not. It\u2019s only been a few hours and I\u2019m still having trouble digesting the issue. It doesn\u2019t feel real. He knows my deepest darkest secret\u2026 and my secret is no longer precious to me.",

I used to look back on these situations and feel absolutely humiliated that I had \u201cthe audacity\u201d to do that. \n\nI\u2019ve crashed my car after a really bad purge episode that caused me to drive like a drunk driver afterwards. \n\nI\u2019ve gotten a speeding ticket trying to race home cause I got nervous about binging. \n\nI was rushed to the hospital from a really high blood pressure and low oxygen level reading.\n\nAm I continuing to b/p even after so many wake up calls? Yes. \n\nBut is beating myself up afterwards the last thing I need? Absolutely. \n\nComparing my disorder to any other addiction like drugs/alcohol/etc has made me come more to terms with it. I\u2019ve also learned that my bulimia probably stemmed from unresolved trauma - and it could be the same for you.\n\nEven if the cycle for you continues, and it most likely will, coming to some acceptance of it that you have it might help.

They were so cruel over it! \n\nFunny story. I once dated a guy who took me out for omelettes. When I went to the bathroom, he asked if I threw up because he could smell it. I literally didn\u2019t and I was so embarrassed. We ate eggs for Christ sakes! Lol\n\nMy current partner knows I have dealt with this but never brought the issue of \u201cnot wanting to kissing me\u201dup (but I\u2019m very adamant on brushing my teeth each and every time) but I\u2019ve recovered off and on for periods of time between 16 years of this. \n\nNow your post has me thinking from his perspective as I slip into another \u201cjust one more time-\u201c kind of month. So thank you for making me think a little outside of my usual box today! \n\nTry not to worry that he knows, it\u2019s not a secret anymore and it couldn\u2019t be forever, anyways! Maybe this will be good for you guys. I hope you feel better!\ud83d\udc9c",

I KNOW it happened. But I can\u2019t fathom that I could possibly do something so shameful or gross. \n\nBut I also know A LOT of people can relate to these gross things I\u2019ve done because I\u2019ve seen countless others on here talking about the same things. \n\nAlthough sometimes they feel intertwined, I feel like our ED\u2019s and our true self are two different people. & in the moment, sometimes the ED takes over.
