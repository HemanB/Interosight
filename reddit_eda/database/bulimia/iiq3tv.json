I have a sister who is close in age to myself and my insecurities (especially since my weight gain) flare up around her. As well as with other women. It's hard! \n\nWhat's helped me is to first of all, acknowledge that it's hard and uncomfortable to exist in a body that doesn\u2019t look the way you think it should. You don't have to stop yourself from feeling that way. Of course you feel those things given the way our culture is so body-focused. We value thinness more than we value kindness, intelligence, wisdom, humor, etc. So, of course you feel uncomfortable. BUT, you're still allowed to live your life, to respect your body and it's needs/desires (including for intimacy, which believe me, I know how hard that is when you don't feel sexy or attractive). This is basically how I talk to myself when I'm having those feelings of anxiety and discomfort around my body. \n\n*\"Of course you feel that way - our world has brainwashed you into this belief system and it's gonna take time to change. But, you still deserve your own respect and you can still take care of your body even if you don't like how it looks.\"*\n\nI hope this is helpful - I hate that so many people have such a hard time with food and their bodies.
