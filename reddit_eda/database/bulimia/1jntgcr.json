If they had been even an hour or two later I wouldn\u2019t be here - maybe they were exaggerating, but I don\u2019t think so, several doctors and nurses told me that in the hospital. (I pieced all the info together from emt/dr reports and the person that unlocked the door for the welfare check). I probably almost died several times before from chronic \u201ccritically low\u201d potassium - causing frequent dizziness and hitting my head, seizures; I couldn\u2019t drive. I could barely get out of bed most days at the end. I went from being so athletic I made a garden bed from hauling logs out of the woods beside my house, to needing assistance walking up the two steps to my front door. Really.\n\nI\u2019m still putting my life back together after beginning recovery that day I woke up in the hospital. It got worse before it got better, but I\u2019m finally healing - my period came back after being gone 4 years! I just drove for the first time in 3 years a month ago! I feel like a kid going through milestones again\u2026 I will be 39 this year. I am sad that I will probably die much sooner than I had without this disease\u2026.after all these years I am finally happy and at peace, and wish nothing more than to spend many happy years with my family. And I probably will not get to. Please don\u2019t waste your years. Regret is the saddest emotion of all. I considered myself pretty much dead - like being in a coma - all the years I was sick. I just stalled out & lost 5 years. I am so lucky I made it through that hell, but now I\u2019m realizing how much damage I did - I was getting severe gastroenteritis every 6 weeks, you don\u2019t even want to know about my teeth, my bones are crumbling and causing nerve compression and numbness/pain, and now that I\u2019m emotionally ready to eat, it seems my body cannot handle a good majority of foods in a cruel ironic joke. I promise you won\u2019t regret recovery - only however long it takes you to get there \ud83d\udc9c",

She looked so sick we thought potassium pills and ivs would help. It was shocking and awful. They found throw up in the toilet from the night before. She died suffering. She was a musician and it took away her creativity it took her away. I\u2019ve had it for 4 years and my potassium is great, Almost too high. But it depends on the person. It sucks I feel like I set such a bad example she thought there would be no side effects for just one year. But I am dealing with so many now they all came at once that I wish I was dead. This disorder is the hardest thing I\u2019ve gone through mentally. My sister passing made it 100% worse. I\u2019m trying to stop so bad. I feel her trying to help me call me crazy\u2026 I was buying binge food and a rare song that was played at her funeral came on the radio. I never have heard anyone play it. I broke down put the food back. If anyone has any tips at all how to stop I would greatly appreciate it! I don\u2019t want to die because I\u2019ve seen how grief is I\u2019ve felt it nonstop. My teeth are clear and see through i am constantly tired. Shell of a person for years now. It is a prison I\u2019m getting nowhere in life I live to eat and purge I have no spark at all anymore and I\u2019m broke as hell living this shameful double life.

She looked so sick we thought potassium pills and ivs would help. It was shocking and awful. They found throw up in the toilet from the night before. She died suffering. She was a musician and it took away her creativity it took her away. I\u2019ve had it for 4 years and my potassium is great, Almost too high. But it depends on the person. It sucks I feel like I set such a bad example she thought there would be no side effects for just one year. But I am dealing with so many now they all came at once that I wish I was dead. This disorder is the hardest thing I\u2019ve gone through mentally. My sister passing made it 100% worse. I\u2019m trying to stop so bad. I feel her trying to help me call me crazy\u2026 I was buying binge food and a rare song that was played at her funeral came on the radio. I never have heard anyone play it. I broke down put the food back. If anyone has any tips at all how to stop I would greatly appreciate it! I don\u2019t want to die because I\u2019ve seen how grief is I\u2019ve felt it nonstop. My teeth are clear and see through i am constantly tired. Shell of a person for years now. It is a prison I\u2019m getting nowhere in life I live to eat and purge I have no spark at all anymore and I\u2019m broke as hell living this shameful double life. I have lost 35 pounds since she died I am underweight the only thing is she had low potassium that\u2019s the difference between life and death. Your heart can stop at ANY time",

She looked so sick we thought potassium pills and ivs would help. It was shocking and awful. They found throw up in the toilet from the night before. She died suffering. She was a musician and it took away her creativity it took her away. I\u2019ve had it for 4 years and my potassium is great, Almost too high. But it depends on the person. It sucks I feel like I set such a bad example she thought there would be no side effects for just one year. But I am dealing with so many now they all came at once that I wish I was dead. This disorder is the hardest thing I\u2019ve gone through mentally. My sister passing made it 100% worse. I\u2019m trying to stop so bad. I feel her trying to help me call me crazy\u2026 I was buying binge food and a rare song that was played at her funeral came on the radio. I never have heard anyone play it. I broke down put the food back. If anyone has any tips at all how to stop I would greatly appreciate it! I don\u2019t want to die because I\u2019ve seen how grief is I\u2019ve felt it nonstop. My teeth are clear and see through i am constantly tired. Shell of a person for years now. It is a prison I\u2019m getting nowhere in life I live to eat and purge I have no spark at all anymore and I\u2019m broke as hell living this shameful double life. I have lost 35 pounds since she died I am underweight the only thing is she had low potassium that\u2019s the difference between life and death. Your heart can stop at ANY time",
