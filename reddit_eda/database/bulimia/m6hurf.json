  "selftext": "If i end up binging and reach the point where i know for a fact i\u2019m going to purge i\u2019ll purposely try to make my binge bigger so that if i end up binging again i\u2019ll have less food available. It\u2019s like if i\u2019m already going to purge i might as well get rid of as much as possible even if it makes the binge so much worse. I think it\u2019s tied to an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 mindset but either way it sucks and I hate that I do it. I also don\u2019t have a lot of money atm and it\u2019s a huge waste of it.",
