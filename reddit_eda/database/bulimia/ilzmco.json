      "body": "In the early, and more restrictive, years of my ED I hated my body. Couldn\u2019t look at myself, felt like everyone was constantly making fun of me, didn\u2019t even feel like I looked human. Over the years it\u2019s changed, so that now I generally feel pretty neutral about my body- never beautiful, but never like I\u2019m a monster. I want to be thinner, but I think my fear of getting fat is what\u2019s driving my ED at this point. Like if I stayed at my cw forever I\u2019d be fine, but the thought of gaining even a couple pounds is terrifying. I\u2019m always terrified I\u2019ll start eating and never be able to stop, and that\u2019s how I started purging, not to lose weight so much as just to not gain. \n\nFor me, it seems like the amount I hate my body has very little to do with my weight, and more about how much I hate myself and my life. I\u2019m at a point now where I\u2019m doing well in college, finally made some friends, feel like an overall decent person. But when my ED started, I\u2019d just dropped out of high school, had no friends, no plans for my future, felt like a total failure... it was a lot easier to put all that hatred and disappointment I felt about myself on my body and focus on what felt like the easiest part of me to fix at the time, as if being thin enough could at least give me something to like/be proud of.\n\nBut it\u2019s still really weird that I\u2019m a lot of ways, my ED has been so much worse (much more frequent b/p) for the past year even though I\u2019ve started to be ok with my body most of the time. Makes me question sometimes if I actually have an ED, or just addicted to food and the rush I get from b/p at this point",
