They crossed a moral line once, and then they kept crossing it. And it got easier and easier up to the point that where they were doing things they'd never have imagined they were capable of in their younger days. I'm sure they wondered (like I do sometimes) how to stop what feels like a moving freight train.",

I feel like if someone who hasnt experienced it theyd be HORRIFIED about the details but also about how FUNNY it is. hahah. \n\nlike one time i threw up ramen noodles and a noodle came out my nose and i pulled it out. i could feel it come all the way through my esophagus and out my nose. it was kinda cool haha.\n\nor about how delicious ice cream is to throw up haha. like its still cold and tastes exactly the same. lolol. \n\nliterally nothing grosses me out when it comes to the human body now. its totally a superpower.",
