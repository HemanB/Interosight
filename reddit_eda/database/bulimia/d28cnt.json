  "selftext": "I was telling my therapist how I ate like a 1/4 of a sheet cake yesterday after dinner after being so good all day eating regular healthy meals. I felt so disgusted with myself for eating so much dessert and didn't want my hard work during the day to be for nothing so I threw it up. And her remark was \"why don't next time you just have one piece of cake, or have your husband serve your portion\". I wanted to laugh in her face so bad. I was also angry at this point, but trying not to show it. \n\nI told her I can't \"just have one piece\". My obsession with food is all-consuming. If I have one piece I'm just going to struggle for the rest of the evening in my head, thinking about that damn cake in the refrigerator, how I can sneak another piece or two, the feeling of eating and how it soothes my emotions, constantly thinking of wanting to binge on the cake. I can't concentrate on anything else when I'm trying to overcome am urge to binge, and 9/10 I give in because I'm so damn tired of thinking about the cake that I just eat it. \n\nIf I could eat just one piece of cake like a normal person, my problems would be solved. But it's not that easy.",

It might be worth adding an ED specialist or an addiction therapist to your care plan. You really are worth the effort and seeing someone who doesn't truly understand what you're going through sounds so frustrating. I know they're probably still good at their job in general if you've established trust to get so far as to talk freely about your bulimia, but damn that response is just so completely unhelpful! :( I hope you can get the help you deserve!",
