  "selftext": "I had a bit bad voice chords even before bulimia started because of GERD (acid reflux). Now i haven\u2019t sang for a while, about a month or so. Today when i tried i realised there\u2019s no more voice left in me at all. It sounds so dead, cracky like i would be extremely sick. \n\nIs it a sign to stop? nope. Going to the shop to get some binge food now cause what\u2019s the point. I can\u2019t sing anymore anyway. \n\nStay safe u guys. And please give up this shit.",

      "body": "Yeah meditation and mindfulness are pretty much the only cure for me I\u2019ve found in addition to forcing myself to eat adequately w ample calories and not restrict. Eating 3 meals and two snacks at 8:30,10, 1:30, 4, 7, and 9:30 bedtime snack, If u don\u2019t restrict to make up for the binges, u are able to dismiss the binge urges- it\u2019s too hard dismissing if my eating is caos or I\u2019ve altered meal plan to restrict secretly more. Telling myself I\u2019ll stop restricting completely after I get to X ant of weight. That never works. It always leads to BP cycle. It\u2019s scary thinking holy shit but I\u2019ve been restricting:dieting for so long I don\u2019t even know how to eat \u201cnormally\u201d- but w sustained commitment and practice to adequate eating (which is a LOT more calories than u think since binging cals added drops off) it comes if u really WANT to live a life free from food obsessions and instead deriving happ from relationships and hobby\u2019s such as singing! Routine eating helps me feel I\u2019ve met small goals for myself all day long which feels more rewarding than binging. Also my advice would be write down all the reasons u don\u2019t want to purge and force urself to read before purge. If u stop purging ur brain won\u2019t give\nU option to binge either bc u don\u2019t have option to get rid. Purging not an option plain and simple.\n\nHope this helps and we all in it together \ud83d\udc95",
