So as hard as it was, I opened up to my friends about my eating disorder and they\u2019ve been  supportive. Or so I thought. \n\nMy therapist had me put on a 72 hour hold Monday after I said some concerning things during our appointment. I had a friend pick me up on Wednesday and we went to Chick-fil-A. While we were eating, she asked me \u201cwhy do you even bother eating if you\u2019re just going to throw it up? You\u2019re just wasting money and food.\u201d\n\nI feel like I might be overreacting, but that comment really fucking hurt. \n\nAnyways, just wanted to rant for a second. Have a great day.",

Everything is a potential \"waste\" of time, money, effort, when your attitude is beligerant, pessimistic and tactless. She's completely ignorant and vapid when it comes to the subject of disordered eating and therefore her ideas and noise on the subject are identical to a cat meowing at someone trying to follow a cooking recipe.\n\nPeople just love to insert themselves into anything and everything to prove they're relevant, even when they absolutely aren't and can't be. It's maddening and you don't need to deal with it. You know she has literally no idea wtf is going on or how to approach, so fuck. Nod and smile. Good Lord.",

They are very **lucky** they have no clue and think it\u2019s okay to ask a question like that. Thank whatever you believe in or love, that your friend doesn\u2019t have to ever understand what it\u2019s like to have an ED.... I know I\u2019d get soo extremely hurt if someone said that to me. I also love that a friend that  is there for you, is asking you questions, instead of just automatically thinking bad, wrong things of you. Just try to remember they have no idea what this is like... you have to help them understand what it\u2019s like for you. \ud83d\udc99\n\nEdit- I\u2019m 29 so I\u2019m about with ya on where I\u2019m at in life lol \ud83d\ude43",
