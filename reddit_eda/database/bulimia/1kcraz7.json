  "selftext": "It only ever shows it as a a pretty, thin, popular teenage girl purging her normal sized meals. I never really see the bingeing side of bulimia mentioned in quite literally everything.\n\nbulimia is often made fun of in shows or movies too and its genuinely so sad dude\n\nAnd plus, I feel like purging Disorder is misinterpreted as bulimia, when it's NOT.\n\nAnother thing- was watching an older movie about it (Kate's secret I think?) And they show purging as so clean and pretty, and FAST. When it's the literal opposite. For me personally, drool down my arms, in my hair, nose runny, it's shown so bad on the internet.\n\n",
