  "selftext": "So usually every night I get this unignorable urge and need to b/p. But last night, and this morning, I have no desire to do that. Idk if it\u2019s the new antidepressant I\u2019m on or maybe my mental health is improving idk. But this is a weird feeling of content. I kinda don\u2019t know what to do cause I haven\u2019t felt like this in a really freakin long time. Recovery maybe? Yay :)",
