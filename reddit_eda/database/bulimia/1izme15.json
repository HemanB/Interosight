I\u2019m still severely struggling) but to remind anyone (including myself) that recovery is worth it and possible! By no means am I \u201crecovered\u201d. I still have incredible urges to binge/purge and technically have binged on some occasions but managed to keep it down. I still am struggling with many other things in recovery. I\u2019m a 22 yea old male whos very underweight and anorexic and malnourished and have severe constipation from all the b/p I did two months ago. Even though I still am struggling with those symptoms, I know purging won\u2019t solve or make those issues better, and the same goes for all of you if you struggle with bulimia. Know that you got this! I still struggle everyday but remember that recovery is hard, but worth it\u2764\ufe0f",
