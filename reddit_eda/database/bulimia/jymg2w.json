      "body": "For me it was just understanding them better. I used to think eating 500 cal would make me super fat and I\u2019d have to get on a treadmill and burn 500 to even it out. That felt impossible most of the time so I\u2019d throw up instead. My mind was blown when I learned how many calories a sedentary body burns during the day. You need to consume a fair amount just to keep up with your body\u2019s natural processes so there\u2019s simply nothing to fear until you exceed your tdee.  And even then, you\u2019d need to exceed it a significant amount on a regular basis to have a negative impact on your body. Going over one day doesn\u2019t matter at all.",

I try to focus more on the nutrients and tell myself that it is okay because I'm not going to be able to eat again for another 4 or more hours anyway and I need the calories to make it to the end of my shift.\n\nI tend to forget to eat on my days off (I only eat 1 meal) so I also let myself eat more on my work days because I have a consistent schedule to remind me when to eat.",

I have been trying different things throughout recovery, and the only thing that seems to work for me is to alternate between undereating and bulking+exercise. That gave me the longest periods without purging, but it's still highly related to calories, as I have to undereat or overeat. \n\nIf you can, eat out or ask someone to make food for you, so you don't know the amount of calories, and use other indicators to make you feel better. Feeling less light-headed is definitely a motivation to eat for me, as well as being able to lift heavier weights.",
