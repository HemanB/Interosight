Or is making yourself throw up inherently more damaging than throwing up naturally from being sick? I hope this makes sense",

      "body": "Vomiting is bad for you regardless of whether it\u2019s purging or illness caused. (No judgement here, I do it too.) \n\nThe reason people will specify purging is bad for you is that people who purge tend to do it more often than a person would \u201cnaturally\u201d throw up due to illness, and the more you do it the more damage you do. \n\nThe other thing is purging is actually more like regurgitating than vomiting. In \u201ctrue\u201d vomiting, the vomiting center in the brain (yes that\u2019s a real thing lol) coordinates your muscles to act together. So your esophageal sphincter opens, your stomach muscles contract, but at the same time the lining of your esophagus produces extra mucus, and your mouth produces extra saliva to protect your teeth, and your epiglottis closes so you don\u2019t aspirate into your nose/lungs. In regurgitating, the vomiting center is not active, so all that happens are the stomach contractions forcing contents out. \n\nSo on top of the risks associated with regular vomiting (acid damage to teeth, esophagus, etc etc) you could also damage your esophageal sphincter, as it\u2019s being forced to open rather than opening voluntarily, and have a higher risk of aspiration than \u201cregular\u201d vomiting. \n\nTldr regular vomiting is also bad for you, but we usually purge more frequently so the damage accumulates more. Also not having visible/obvious damage doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not there - I kept having asthma flare ups my GP ended up blaming on \u201creflux\u201d - I never told her I was purging. Turns out the stomach acid can irritate your airways too \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\nEDIT: the other thing that can also happen is electrolyte imbalances. These can be very serious to the point of causing muscle/heart problems. Again, still possible with regular vomiting.",
