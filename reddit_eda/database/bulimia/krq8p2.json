Both were at home in my room, but still felt gross having no control and feeling like I was 2.\n\nAnyways, yeah. Thank you for this and for somehow being an email in my inbox. It\u2019s like I was supposed to see it. I\u2019d love to begin healing physically and mentally and that\u2019s my first step this year. My first step is to stop looking at my reflection every living second. \n\nThank you fellow human",
