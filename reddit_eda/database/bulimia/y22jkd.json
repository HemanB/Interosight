  "selftext": "So I was at the dentist yesterday for the first time in two years (appointments got delayed due to covid). These have been my worst two years ed-wise. \nI am only 20 years old and my teeth are completely fucked. My dentist was shocked to see how such a young person could have such disgusting teeth. \n\nThe dentist says my teeth are completely flat from erosion, especially in the back. There's no enamel left at all. This explains why my teeth feel rough and not smooth. I also have gum recession and a lot of cavities, some of which are visible and painful, and three of which will need immediate repairing (i already got an appointment).\u00a0\n\nThey kinda took me aside to talk about what the causes of this mess could be and straight up asked if i had a problem with nausea or regurgitation. I just admitted to having food issues and the lady was like \"oh. Bulimia.\" and I wanted to sink into the ground. She was sweet though, she told me the usual aftercare (not brushing immediately after, etc) and I got a prescription for a special toothpaste with extra fluoride.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBut instead of going to buy toothpaste, my dumbass immediately went to buy binge food after the appointment because I do. Not. Know. How. To. Cope. With. Stress. \nI'm so fucked.",

I\u2019m so sorry, but I\u2019m really glad they treated you with kindness and special toothpaste. Take care as best you can, and thank you for sharing your experience :)",
