  "selftext": "I hate the feeling I have after every. Single. Meal. The feeling that I want to shove an entire pint of ice cream down my fucking throat. I hate not knowing if my body needs more food or if I\u2019m just going to binge. I want to seek help, but about 8 months ago I was released from anorexia treatment. My parents were so proud of me, they said that it was so mentally draining for them to see me like that. They are going to be so disappointed in me. Especially my mother since I promised not to purge again after she found me bent over the toilet three years ago. I hate how different you get treated for bulimia than anorexia. \n\nI wish I could just be a normal son, not with a shit ton of mental issues. \ud83e\udd72\ud83d\ude4c",

Recovery like most difficult things isn't a one and done. YOU are worth it.  It's hard for parents and other loved ones to really understand the struggles of eating disorders.  They honestly can't.  You are a human being, there is no \"normal\".  So many are struggling with disorders of one sort or another.  So try not to label yourself.  A great life awaits you.  I promise.",

      "body": "First off, I want to say that I am so sorry that you feel that your parents will be disappointed in you. I can relate because I haven\u2019t told my parents about my current eating issues because in the past I had serious issues with OCD/ restrictive eating and just feel like that was enough for them. However, you are a human being and you matter. Your problems do not define who you are; it absolutely sucks that you have to go through this but you should never feel bad for struggling. You didn\u2019t choose this. \nA lot of what you wrote really resonates with me. I feel like sometimes I can eat normally, and then I always go back to a ravenous state, feeling like I can\u2019t start eating out of fear that I won\u2019t be able to stop. I know what it\u2019s like to feel exhausted and ill after purging, I know what it\u2019s like to wake up the morning after a binge, and I know what it feels like to feel completely alone because absolutely nobody understands this disorder and people\u2019s comments just make it worse. Everybody\u2019s story is different, so I won\u2019t say that I understand completely how you feel, but there are some similarities that resonate with me. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re suffering through this too, and I hope you remember that you are SO important and you are more than your disorder.",

My family doesn\u2019t know I have an ED but seeing as your family knows of your past, they\u2019re sure to support you through this too. Focus on healing and what it takes to get there, and if that means familial support then don\u2019t worry about telling them.",
