  "selftext": "i was thinking about how much my mom's food rules she learned from years and years of fad diets and insecurities about her own weight played a role in me developing an ED. i practically hear her voice yelling at me in my head any time i'm about to eat a carb. i've had \"nothing tastes as good as skinny feels\" drilled into my head. \n\nshe also had a purging disorder in the past. she has said things like how she never had the \"nerves of steel\" to be anorexic. she scolded me heavily when i opened up to her about b/p, because to her that's a shameful ED, vs anorexia which she seems to find impressive in some sick way. she encouraged both me and my brother to continue restricting when we were losing a ton of weight super fast, because i guess neither of us ever got skinny enough for it to be concerning to her. \n\nanyway, how did your parents impact your ED?",

She hoped her harsh words would inspire me, but they instead lowered my self-esteem.\n\nMy father had a strong dislike of larger people, and he did not like me being a \"chubby blonde\" because it apparently makes the family (aka him) look bad. \n\nHonestly, I think high expectations to meet physical standards and societal influences create a perfect storm for a lot of ED sufferers, both male and female.",

Some of my earliest memories are of her showing me her Atkins diet shit (mostly so I wouldn't eat it, i guess), Nutrisystem, WW, all that stuff. She used to buy diet pills like they were candy. \n\nMy mom would always, and still does, comment at stores and public events, \"Who's fatter, me or her?\" When she sees an obese or plus size woman. She used to say, if it was a larger man, \"[ButtonyCakewalk], that's your husband.\" And she still calls herself Jaba the Hutt all of the time, but also when we were kids. Now my brother (who is in his 30s) talks disparagingly about her weight to me (i tell him not to) like she's an awful person on that factor alone.\n\nShe thought I was chubby from like ages 8-12 and would constantly say I needed to lose weight, but she also kept our home stocked with soda and never cooked for us, we just ate frozen meals or fast food, and never with any structure. Even if she brought us Taco Bell or KFC, she'd give my brother and I the food then go to her room to eat her portion alone, eventually my brother started doing that too. I think having no quality time around food with my family made me feel a lot of anxiety around eating with groups of people. I stopped eating lunch at school (and at all) when I hit puberty, I'd wait till i got home and could have some fatty or sugary foods that they wouldn't serve at school.\n\nWhen I was 8, I started stealing her diet pills and taking them because she wouldn't stop talking about my weight. Spoiler alert, it did not change anything. Most of the times in my life where I've lost a lot of weight, it's been due to a serious illness. And everyone, but especially her, compliments me on my weight loss. My mom virtually ignored my brother and I for our whole childhoods, partially because she was a single, working mom, but she sent us to our grandparents' house most weekends and spent her evenings with friends or locked in her room. When I started getting thinner in high school, she suddenly was very interested in spending time with me, but never my brother. I know she lives vicariously through me. And that's not intuition, she used to tell me that constantly.\n\n I started purging when I was 13, I'll be 29 in four months and this is a continual and constant, painful struggle. I'm in therapy specific to bulimia, but I am still constantly gaslighting myself on so many different levels. I've gained weight because i purge so little now and still binge every now and then, more often than purging. My mom is so disappointed. I'm scared to visit home because I'm afraid of her comments, I decided to just tell her I went up a few dress sizes recently and she lectured me, telling me that my partner would be upset (nope nope nope, he is incredibly body positive) and that i should wait until i have kids (nope) to gain weight. She knows I have bulimia and am in treatment.\n\n\n\n\nAlso, some fuck is downvoting everyone's stories. I came here and the latest comments had 1 vote and I upvoted them all, and now all of them have 1 and some of them have 0. If you're gonna come on an eating disorder sub and be petty, fucking use your words so we can judge you, too, coward.",

She made her stepdaughter (that was my friend) measure out all of her food meticulously, but the younger sister (also a stepdaughter) didn't have to. My friend had to go to the doctor because she was underweight when we were in the 6th grade. Friend told me that her dad and stepmom were with her. Doctor says she needs to gain weight, gives her parents tips on getting her more food healthily, and then her stepmom \"jokes,\" \"we'll make sure you can lose the weight after!\" My friend was horrified. I don't think it was a joke.",

I don't know I'd she struggles as much with this anymore, but she definitely still shows off disordered habits.",
