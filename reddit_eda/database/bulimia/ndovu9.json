  "selftext": "whenever i decide that enough is enough and try my very hardest to hve a b/p free day i\u2019m constantly stepping on eggshells with my emotions hoping i don\u2019t trigger another episode. \n\nwhy is it so hard not to self sabotage . b/p clearly has no benefits for me. it causes weight gain which makes me spiral. it makes me emotionally unavailable for my partner. it makes me unproductive , i rarely get anything done on a b/p day thanks to the black or white mentality that makes me continuously b/p to the point where i only purge to make room for more food. it makes me dissociate, it makes me depressed, it makes me anxious , it makes me suicidal ruminating on methods and hovering my thumb over the suicide hotline . it makes me run frantically from 24/7 to late night diners at 3 in the morning looking like a complete crack addict from a bystanders perspective. \n\nthere are no lasting benefits , none . i want my brain to finally acknowledge rationality and help me stop, but it continues to be cruel and work against me at any opportunity . i want to be kind to it , i want to be kind to myself .",
