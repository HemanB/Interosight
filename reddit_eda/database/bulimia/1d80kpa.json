I relate sm with everything you wrote in here. I really want to get betterb because this thing is seriously ruining me. My teeth are getting more and more sensitive, my stomach hurts everytime I eat, I can\u2019t focus, I can\u2019t study which really sucks because it\u2019s exam season and I\u2019m failing 2 exams already. It\u2019s just that these urges are so intense I can\u2019t separate myself from them,so I really need something to snap me back to reality. \nTysm for your answer!",
