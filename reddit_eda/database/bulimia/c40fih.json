I thought I had really kicked it for some reason (and almost thought maybe I'd faked it this whole time).\n\nI'd been eating 1200-1300 calories a day for about 3 days and had been losing some water weight but not as fast as I normally would when i don't b/P. Anyway, I went to bed so hungry last night just so I can see the scale this morning and be happy but I was only 100g less when I woke up. I felt like all that struggle going hungry and giving myself pep talk was for absolutely nothing. So I ate 1000 calories first thing in the morning, but then stopped myself thinking it's not too late to turn the day around. By 3pm I was so hungry I binged on bread and noodles, then threw most of it up. I'm now 800g heavier than this morning and I feel like shit. Oh well. Tomorrow's another day I guess..",

I actually received some advice from a dog trainer that I think translates well into bulimia recovery (I know, weird, but stick with me lol) My rescue dog was severely abused as a puppy so we are working on training her to be less afraid of people. She will do really well with training and going out but will still have really bad days, which always made me think that I was failing her. Well the trainer told me that it\u2019s totally normal for my dog to relapse into old behavior, and that I will notice that after each bad day I will find that it will take her less time to get back to having good days, and the bad days will get farther and fewer between. \n\nI started thinking about that advice in terms of my ED, and realizing that I\u2019m not failing if I have a bad day/week/month because I keep finding that I bounce back a little better every time I come out of the other side of my bad time. I started having only 1 good day at a time and the rest were bad. Then it would turn from one good day at a time to one good week at a time. Right now my good times will last a month or 2 and I will relapse for anywhere from a day to a week. I basically just tell myself \u201cwell okay, I\u2019m going to give myself permission to relapse right now, but I know I\u2019m going to come out of it a little stronger, and I\u2019ll find it a little easier to get back on the wagon.\u201d \n\nI know this is a little heavy for a meme post lol.

Keep working on yourself and you will get there, keep reminding yourself on the + you feel when you're successful. I think it's a great sign that you felt different this time. Try not to get so discouraged because a weight drop is lower one day (i know you probably know all this rational parts of weight fluctuation, water, food retention etc. We still want to see specific numbers... but scale doesn't tell you right away. Maybe, if this is a big trigger for you, you can maybe try waiting a day a see if there's a bigger difference (at my case it usually is and the thought of it helps me not to bp straight away).",
