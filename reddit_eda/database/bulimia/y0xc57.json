  "selftext": "I am 43 yrs old. I have been bulimic since I was 12. The physical damage I have done to myself is irreversible. I used to have perfect teeth and now I have both a full set of top and bottom dentures. I started menopause at 40. I am a qualified scientist specialising in cancer research and forensic science. Because of bulimia I can't hold down a job for more than three months. I was married once and it lasted for 3 years and it was as a direct result of my eating disorder that it ended in divorce. Now I am living with my elderly parents and to be brutally honest I feel like a total failure/loser and a waste of space. If this post reaches just 1 person then I am happy I found the courage to write it. \nGet help. Live your life. Don't end up like me xx",

Your eating disorder didn't kill you - even if I'm sure it caused a lot of damage. See this as a sign. You're so strong for surviving all of this! That doesn't make you a failure at all, it makes you so strong!! Don't waste another 20 years with your ed. You can overcome this!!\nThink about what you want in life. I'm sure you have plans yet. Where would you like to go? What would you like to do? What do you need to be happy? There is so much more to life than making it depended by a single number! Come on get up, don't pity yourself!! I believe in you!! Sending love <3",

I know this type of words are throwaway and won't help You but that's something I need to tell You. You have inner Good, something that she lacked. I've been places and I've seen complete failures. You're not a failure to me. You have inner worth. You don't blame others for what's going on with You now, You're self-aware, You worked hard for Your education. Most people lack this.",
