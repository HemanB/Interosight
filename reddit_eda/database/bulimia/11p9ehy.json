  "selftext": "I was under my calorie limit for the day but ate my last meal of the day super fast and just purged a lil bit to get rid of the bloat icky feeling??? Just to get a bit off the top. Like why not just wait a bit for the sensation to dissipate a bit??? I literally haven\u2019t purged in a year to a year and a half (I don\u2019t know exactly). Why on earth would I open this door??? As soon as I do it once I know it\u2019s 200x easier to do it again so why? Also like how fucking stupid, it wasn\u2019t a full purge so?? I literally stared at the toilet on my knees for a full 2 min (someone even knocked on the bathroom door) and still went through with it. Idk what\u2019s wrong with me. I feel so fucking dumb, like bruh.",
