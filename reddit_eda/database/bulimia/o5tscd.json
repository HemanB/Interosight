You are beautiful and I am very proud of you for fighting!! My friends used to tell me stuff like that, and my best advice is to sit and have a serious conversation about it. Talk about what triggers you, and tell them not to bring those things up. Also if they want to know why those things trigger you, you can tell them that you don't have to further explain your triggers to them, because you are valid. \nReminder: grab a glass of water and stay hydrated!! You are loved <33",
