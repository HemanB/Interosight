  "selftext": "After my afternoon run, I was super hungry today and could feel myself wanting to start nibbling/grazing on random foods around the kitchen.. I was trying to hold off on eating lunch because I\u2019d scheduled eating it for later, but I recognized I was hungry now so I went ahead and ate (the healthier option) my lunch instead of just snacking because I knew I\u2019d feel bad afterwards. Idk if this is relatable but grazing on food is SUCH a trigger for me so I\u2019m glad I avoided it!",

Plus I can have some more today and enjoy the good food for more than just a day. I'm going for a run tonight and I'm excited to continue on this healthier path. \n\nI wish for your continued success!!!",
