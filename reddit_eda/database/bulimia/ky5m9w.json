  "selftext": "I couldn't even imagine being able to do this. But I've made it this far!! This is the longest I've gone without vomiting in pretty much 3 years :/\n\nThe first week genuinely felt like some of the hardest days of my life. The intrusive thoughts and the urges to purge after eating felt like they'd never go away. I've been attempting recovery for so long I had given up hope in a lot of ways.\n\nI just want to tell you all that it started to get easier and jesus fucking christ I feel so free.\n\nDo not listen to the voice that says you don't need to recover, or you're not sick enough, or you dont deserve it, or anything...\n\nI've got a long way to go in recovery but I already feel like I have some of myself back!! Sending love to every single one of you, you can do it angels xxxxx",
