  "selftext": "I can be feeling okay and get ready and everything is fine and then I start to deteriorate.\n\nI wanted to dress cute today but now all I want to do is put on a massive potato sack, ideally with a smaller potato sack to cover my face.\n\nI know why, I overate yesterday without purging and had breakfast and lunch today and I'm having a big meal later. So now I'm a troll woman with a huge nose and beady lil beast eyes, and a body like a boulder.\n\nAnd I'm sat on my bed thinking wtf can I wear that will hide my whole body and still look acceptable for seeing people \ud83d\ude2d",
