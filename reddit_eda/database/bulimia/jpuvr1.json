  "selftext": "Do y\u2019all ever get confused about whether you\u2019re actually sick sick or you\u2019re just having shitty side effects of bulimia? \n\nWoke up this morning with chest pains (feels more like heart than lungs), a sore throat that I\u2019ve had for a while but is progressively getting worse, a lil bit of a cough, and dizziness (again always dizzy). During this devastating pandemic with a bunch of idiots who don\u2019t wear masks, I\u2019m always worried I\u2019ve contracted COVID- even though my job until I got laid off was working as a case manager with the homeless population. I was surrounded by people constantly and never got COVID, so it makes me weary now in that I probably don\u2019t have it... but you never know.\n\nThis sucks. Actually miserable, but I have a love/hate relationship with this disorder.",
