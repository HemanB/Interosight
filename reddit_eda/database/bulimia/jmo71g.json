  "selftext": "I had to have a physical exam today for a new clinic and they took my height first and I\u2019ve always thought I was 175cm bc that\u2019s what my previous clinic measured me at but this one said i\u2019m 171.6cm which means all my bmi calculations are off. and then I had an instant panic attack but they still had to take my blood pressure and it was in the hypertension catergory bc of that so that\u2019s wrong bc I\u2019ve always had low blood pressure and I\u2019m so stressed out and crying and panicking on the bus home lol I thought I was ready to recover but this is way too much",

You are being completely rational and I know it\u2019s hard to see those numbers and it probably feels like you are trying to rationalize them because I know EDs plant that feeling, but you are valid and working on being better and that\u2019s amazing",
