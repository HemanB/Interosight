I ate slowly, I was mindful of every bite , I drank with mindfulness, I took deep breathes and reminded myself why I\u2019m choosing to feel this discomfort, I stayed focused on gratefulness and positive thoughts and took notice of the ANTS ( automatic negative thoughts) that wanted to evade my brain . Now I\u2019m happy to say it\u2019s the next day and I succeeded. Tummy hurts a little but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s normal given the trauma it\u2019s been through. One baby step at a time .\nWe got this community. Words are powerful and we as humans are programmed to see negativity for survival, let\u2019s acknowledge this and start shedding light on the POSITIVES . Love you all.",
