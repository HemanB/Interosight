  "selftext": "I keep thinking about the massive b/p session I\u2019m going to inevitably have. I\u2019m almost looking forward to it. I almost thought about doing it today but I know my body needs longer of a break, because I know once I purge again I\u2019ll probably struggle to stop for a little while and have to start this process all over again. This cycle kinda sucks I wonder if I will ever break out of it or if I\u2019ll just be like this forever even with therapy",
