  "selftext": "Going on 44 days binge and purge free. \n\nI made up my mind to just eat what I want when I want for the first 6 weeks. To remind myself food is a good thing and to enjoy food again. \n\nI feel so much healthier. My eyes aren't sunken anymore. My skin isn't so dry. My insides don't feel like its filled with gravel. Is this being healthy? \n\nI've put on 5ish pounds. Which caused me some alarm...but I made up my mind to stick with it for 6 weeks. Both my wife and a lot of friends have noticed I actually look more tone. Heavier but healthier?\n\nI had a bloodtest a few months ago with elevated levels in my kidney and liver. I'm hoping these changes could reverse that :)",
