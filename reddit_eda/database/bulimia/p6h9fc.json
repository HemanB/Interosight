  "selftext": "Around January I had to go to the hospital because I couldn\u2019t keep any food down. I remember being absolutely miserable at the time, but I can\u2019t help but look back at it longingly. I miss being cold, freezing even with multiple sweaters on. The brain fog that dulled my senses and made life bearable. Hell, I even miss being hooked up to an IV and being so dehydrated I couldn\u2019t even stand for very long (along with low blood pressure and heart rate). I miss it more than I\u2019d like to admit, and that stubborn part of my brain wants to go back but I know I\u2019m at a good place in my life and I can\u2019t afford to do that to myself. I\u2019m scared because I don\u2019t want this to end in a relapse, but I can\u2019t help the thoughts. I was just wondering whether I\u2019m alone in that or not.",

It's the ED tricking us into thinking we were special and superior when we were sickest. Reality is that life is much more special and superior when you can enjoy it and focus on important things like your family, friends, career, hobbies!!",

It wasn't like I enjoyed being in that place, but I don't know how to explain, I simply felt some kind of nostalgia and I wanted to get bad again so I could come back there... Idk it's just so hard to explain",

This doesn\u2019t look good, no one should look like this and if they do you should be worried. When I tell people I\u2019m not doing well, they just come back in with \u201cwell you look great so you must be doing something right\u201d didn\u2019t realize slowly killing myself was the right thing thanks fam\u2026.
