Well the first thing that worked for me was slowly building a healthy relationship with food, forcing myself to keep food down even if I felt \"fat\" and bloated, after a while the bloat goes away and it's easier, second is weight lifting, pretty much the big thing responsible for my healthy weight gain, that definitely made me feel less guilty when eating, your stomach will eventu go back to normal and you will no longer require a binge to satisfy your hunger, lastly it took alot of falling and getting back up again but every time I went longer without binging and purging, so dont feel like you have to do it all at once, it's a slow process that you will barely notice but when you look back you will see how much you have achieved, I thought I could not live without bulimia but now I'm question how did I live with it all those years?",

I b/p between once and three times a day right now...the higher number happening on days when things are stressful, I'm bored or am looking for that \"soothing and empty\" feeling on the other side of the purge. Empty is the best. I eat high calorie foods in the morning (nuts, more nuts, fruit, some granola, multivitamin) and keep that down but come, oh, 2 pm it all hits the fan. I work from home at some volunteer online efforts to am placed in my kitchen whenever I want so the trick is to stay busy. Especially during this CoronaEra. Anyhoo - you've accomplished things to which I can aspire. Will keep at it. Thanks again.",
