When you\u2019re mid binge- when your post binge and the purge is coming- when you\u2019re right by the toilet, just pause and wait. Sit with whatever it is so you\u2019re not on autopilot, and see if you can just stop for this one time. Over time it gets easier and easier to interrupt the cycle.",
