  "selftext": "i binged really hard last night and took a bunch of laxatives.\n\ni woke up this morning, liquid shitting and vomiting. it came out of my nose.\n\ni tried to go to the kitchen to get water and i got so dizzy i fell on the floor, i pulled myself up and got the water. my body temperature shot up so fast i was dripping sweat by the time i got back to the bathroom.\n\ni vomited again and liquid shit for a bit more. my throat and nose are burning. i\u2019m so bloated. the bathroom smells like shit and vomit. \n\nmy mom is taking me for a covid test now, i don\u2019t have covid obviously but i can\u2019t tell her the real reason, so i get to go to the testing center and get a cotton swab shoved 8 inches into my nose! \ud83d\ude03\n\nall that and i didn\u2019t even lose any weight. in fact, i gained half a pound. it was so not worth it. the binge or the purge, not worth it. not worth shitting my insides out, not worth vomiting out of my nose, not worth the excruciating cramps and dizziness and almost fainting. not worth the burning pain in my throat and sinuses, not worth the pressure behind my eyes that\u2019s giving me a headache, not worth the bloating in my stomach and puffiness in my face. \n\ni hate this disorder. i hate it i hate it i hate it.",
