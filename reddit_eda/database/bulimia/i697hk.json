You're doing amazing. Your ED will be full of ups and downs, and honestly, accidentally going over your limit a little on a few days will make very little to no difference to literally anything. It is only your mind telling you that it is a massive issue. I know you know this, I just want to reassure you that you've done nothing wrong.\n\nYou're amazing and strong, and I wish you all the best!! \u2764\ufe0f",
