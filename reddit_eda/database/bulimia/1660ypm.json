  "title": "Would it be weird if I made my flatmate a lasagna",
  "selftext": "My flatmate is bulimic, and she's currently in treatment. Unfortunately she seems to be really struggling to get a start on her treatment plan and is ordering McDonalds every day.\n\nI know it's still progress, since she's eating and I haven't heard her throwing up. But the plan was to eat homemade food, and I know McDonalds everyday makes me feel like shit so it can't be making her feel great either.\n\nWould it be weird if I made her a lasagna? We're not super close but we're close enough that she's talked to me about her bulimia.\n\nI know she likes beef and pasta because she's cooked it often in the past. I would include a bunch of veges, cause it would take her days to finish it and I wouldn't want to stick her with just beef pasta and sauce every night. She's lactose intolerant but I have experience making vegan ricotta for lasagna so I can do that.\n\nI'm pretty sure that if I offered, she would turn me down so as not to be a bother. She was embarrassed just asking me if I could take my scale out of the bathroom and keep it in my room. Would being made a lasagna be too far? I'm guessing she'll be embarrassed a bit but would it make her feel bad enough to counter the benefit of having a home-cooked meal for a little while?\n\nI would just pretend I made it for myself and offer her some, but I wouldn't be able to eat it on my own dietary plan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I ended up making her something we could both eat, update [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/166zv4l/update_would_it_be_weird_if_i_made_my_flatmate_a/)",

The \u201dit would take her days to finish it\u201d wouldn\u2019t work with me, because having a lot of food is a huge trigger to me and I just get that \u201dI have to finish all of it, I can\u2019t think anything else until it\u2019s all gone\u201d when I\u2019m having the urge to binge. \n\nYou sound like a wonderful friend\u2665\ufe0f",

But again, that\u2019s just me and how I would feel. I think the best way would be eat with her and also ask what she thinks could help her, since it\u2019s very individual. Regardless, the idea is very beautiful.",

Your heart is in exactly the right place, but as someone who struggles w food I can say I'd absolutely binge in the lasagna if I had an entire one handed to me. But a single portion w maybe a lil side salad, would be ideal! This is just so kind and thoughtful I'm getting emotional over here!!",
