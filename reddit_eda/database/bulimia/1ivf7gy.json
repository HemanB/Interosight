Bread and rice cakes are a nightmare to me because of that thinking. People probably think \"why is this girl staring so weirdly at the snack section?\" and trust me, I wish it was different.\n\n  \nEach time I think about food that way I just think I must have really lost it at some point. I miss when I was a child and could eat without thinking about all these stupid things, panic about calories and look into the toilet bowl each day hoping I won't gain even a gram of weight. \n\n  \nI am looking forward to the day I can beat this disorder :(",
