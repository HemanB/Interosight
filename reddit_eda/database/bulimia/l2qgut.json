  "selftext": "nobody really talks about this too much. the competitive side of having an eating disorder sucks so bad. it makes me feel like such a shitty person. my friend posted some pictures yesterday and she looked so skinny. i haven't seen her in a while and i've honestly suspected that she might have an eating disorder just from some posts she's made previously. but instead of being worried, like a human should, i was jealous and depressed. \n\n\nwhy does seeing other people lose weight hit me in such a wrong place? my friend might be sick and all i can think about is myself. i hate it, but i can't stop it. i can't. i'm 11 weeks purge free and in recovery/therapy, but i want to lose more weight and purging/restricting was the only thing that worked for me.\n\n\ni guess i feel like if i don't lose as much weight as she does, my eating disorder isn't valid. i know it's dumb. but i probably haven't lost nearly as much weight as her. and it makes me feel like shit. \n\n\ni feel awful for posting this. i feel like the shittiest person alive. but i just have to know if someone else has felt like this.",

Very frustrating lmao. He\u2019s both and inspiration and a source of futile comparison that just makes me want to drive deeper into behaviors. The most recent competition has been his new girlfriend who is a model\ud83d\ude44 Lmao and is in denial about her ED with a mf thigh gap for daysss gah damn. Shit is mad frustrating. Sorry for the rant lol",

She\u2019s gorgeous and you know it. She has good muscle, good amount of fat, vibrant. She most likely doesn\u2019t have an ED. It\u2019s okay that\u2019s more thin.
