I\u2019ve been open about it to those I\u2019m close with , and even some strangers that feel the need to ask why I\u2019m taking so long bc it upset me why anyone would think it\u2019s their business. Anytime I eat a lot of food in front of anyone I wonder what they think when I get up and walk away. I\u2019ve even asked friends for hair bows. It is embarrassing for me at times, but my friends also try to talk to me to distract me a lot after that happens , I don\u2019t binge very often but when I do overeat I feel like everyone knows what\u2019s about to happen. Yes it\u2019s embarrassing to me but it\u2019s part of who I\u2019ve become facing this ED. It\u2019s very normal to people around me, and I didn\u2019t think anyone really cared. Until one day my bestfriend ( this was around 3 years ago) told me I can\u2019t get sick at her house anymore because her daughter was asking \u201cwhy was I always sick\u201d and could hear me I guess. I left very quickly and cried for a while about this. She was only protecting her daughter, and I felt sick knowing a child who is like my own heard me do such a thing to myself ( she obviously didn\u2019t know I was forcing this ) but when she gets older if she remembers it could impact her. The wildest thing about this for me is when I was around 12 years old my mom had a friend come over and she brought her daughter , who was probably 16 at the time . She asked me if she could use my bathroom upstairs and of course I said yes. She had been there for a while so I went up to check on her, I could hear what was happening and when she came out I asked if she was ok. She told me everything was fine and that she just got sick sometimes after she eats but I didn\u2019t need to worry about her. I wish to this day I never saw that. It never left my brain what had happened and seeing what I do to myself now, I feel so sad for her. She probably didn\u2019t mean for me to hear her retching either. Of course at that age I wasn\u2019t aware it was forced. I do now. And I cry inside for anyone else struggling who wishes no one could hear. I\u2019ve even had girls ask when I have come out of a bathroom stall in public if I was ok, and I\u2019ve lied and said I \u201cdrank too much\u201d . Yes I have hid it from strangers , yes I\u2019ve hid it from family until they realized. I felt very alone, and I still do dealing with this disorder. It\u2019s become such an easy thing for me, and it\u2019s become purely something I do when I overeat or don\u2019t eat a safe food. It\u2019s become a part of my daily routine. This disease inside of us , is killing me. No matter how many people know that I have bulimia, only one has pushed me to get help.",
