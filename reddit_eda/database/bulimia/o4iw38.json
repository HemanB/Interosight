I will always be obsessed with being skinny, I know purging is bad but I don\u2019t care, it makes me feel so proud and in control afterwards. Honestly I don\u2019t care about health consequences anymore I just want to lose weight and be skinny. Anyone else feel the same? This might sound fucked up but I honestly don\u2019t care anymore",

      "body": "I have definitely felt this way before when I was in the grips of my eating disorder. It warps your priorities and your sense of self. You said you want to eat normally and not feel bad, you want to enjoy and have fun in life. Those are YOUR priorities. Your eating disorder is the thing that is scared of gaining weight and who just wants to be skinny. If you are at all interested in recovery, you need to start questioning these eating disorder beliefs. Some examples of questions that you could ask your eating disorder are;\n\nQuestion: What do you think will happen if you gain weight? \n\nAnswer: I will hate my body, I will be uncomfortable, I will be rejected by people, people will judge me.\n\nThe reality is, your eating disorder is doing all of those things. Your eating disorder is judging you, rejecting you, making you hate your body, making you uncomfortable. You need to look at the truth of what your eating disorder is actually giving you. Is it something you really want to hold onto?\n\nQuestion: What could go well if I recovered and potentially gained weight?\n\nAnswer: I could feel better about myself, I could be healthier, I could have more time and energy for things that I enjoy, I could pursue my interests, I could try new things, I could deepen my existing relationships or form new ones, I could learn to accept myself, I could be happier, I could feel free.\n\nJust some things to think about. Not everyone is at a stage where they are ready to look at these deeper issues. You might not be ready and that's ok. I hope you get to a place where you realize you deserve more than the shit your eating disorder makes you put up with. You deserve a happy and full life.

If I ate even a little too much, the sensation was really triggering. If I ate too little I felt like I was restricting which was also triggering. Focusing on staying hydrated also helps curb hunger.",

I would tend to eat more if I knew I was going to purge and you don't actually purge up all the calories (even if you see the first thing you ate, it doesn't work that way, or so I was told in the hospital). When I first stopped purging I admittedly did gain some weight because my body was normalizing and I was bloated, etc. Now that I have been purge free for a long-ish time, I don't have the mental obsession with food so much so I don't constantly feel the need to snack, it's easier just to stop when I'm full AND all my facial/stomach bloating is gone to the point where I'm like, \"damn, my purging was creating the very body issues that were triggering met to purge in the first place.\" It's a long road. It look be about 16 years but I can safely say that purging was 100% not helping me keep weight off. I have MUCH easier time maintaining a lower (but still healthy) weight today.",
