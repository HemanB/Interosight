Things that have helped: Spacing out my meals and snacks. I don\u2019t eat anything too complicated or high fiber for dinner if I can help it (sometimes it happens anyway, like if I have a craving). But generally if I\u2019m going to have salad, broccoli, beans, pizza with toppings, etc, I do that at lunch so I can get through the gas/bloat by moving around during the day. I go for a 30-60 min walk almost every day, that helps. I go alone so I can be gassy, lol. Buying some larger tops/loose dresses. The bloat is honestly still a thing for me some days. But it happens way less over time and it got easier after about 3 weeks. The intensity goes away-now it is like a mini bloat instead of feeling 7 months pregnant. It helps to remember that your digestive system is INJURED. If you\u2019ve ever broken a bone or sprained something, it took 4-6 weeks or even months to heal, right? When you get bloated, reframe it as your body healing from all the damage. Just like swelling around an injury. It will pass, but not if you keep re-injuring it.",

      "body": "I understand, I\u2019ve seen many therapists and tried like every book. I know how hard it is. As I mentioned above, eating 2000-2500 calories a day and giving up on controlling my weight got rid of 50-70% of my urges immediately. For the rest of them, I just realized that bulimia would literally never end on it\u2019s own. I would get messages from my brain to keep binging and vomiting until I either 1. went to the ER or 2. woke up in another 17 years at age 49, having utterly wasted my life. Keeping those harsh and very real examples in my mind empowered me to   say \u201cI\u2019m not doing this tonight.\u201d I went for walks, took drives, did whatever I had to if I felt I needed to leave the house. I accepted that being unhappy temporarily was unavoidable and so long as I waited for recovery to be fun or easy, I would never get better. I cried, sometimes I was angry. And before I got to now, it took me about 10 months of decreasing b/p episodes to get here at all. I made the most progress because of the times I binged but chose not to purge, and did not diet or starve the next day. It sucks. But for me I b/p not to cope with emotions, but to hit the escape button on them. Something I did early on 10 months ago was when an urge hit, I\u2019d set a timer for 15 minutes and sit with myself. No phone, no tv, etc. Just listening to my own thoughts and feelings and asking myself questions about why or what was going on. If I wanted to binge after, I could. And sometimes I did. But sitting for those 15 minutes at first showed me that I could stand my own emotions. And over time I lengthened the timer. And eventually I got to a point where I felt like I could handle my feelings without food, because I saw that b/p made my emotions worse! The feelings never really go away, you\u2019re just piling a problem on top of them. Once you start facing your emotions and problems that have been masked by your ED, you\u2019ll gain confidence in yourself that you can address them in new and better ways. Think of it this way, by your late 20s or into your 30s, you\u2019ve been through a lot of things that were awful. Losses, work stress, breakups, money problems, etc. When those things happened, they were horrible, and can drag out for years. But they were worse because of bulimia. Not better, not easier. But you got through those hard things\u2014and I bet you didn\u2019t have any clue how you would at first. But you did. Getting through the first stages of recovery is shitty and it takes a long time, but it is temporary, and you will improve every aspect of the rest of your life by doing it. I used to think bulimia helped me cope, but I eventually saw that that was a lie! Whatever happened in my life, I had to cope with, all while very sick. It\u2019s easier when you\u2019re not sick, not the other way around.",

      "body": "Ugh, I know what it\u2019s like, I\u2019m sorry. Here are my tips. They are not easy, but I know they worked for me.\n1. Eat a minimum of 2000 calories a day. If you exercise or are under 25, bump that up to 2200-2500 or more. Eat regular meals and snacks every 3-4 hours. Do not diet, do not cut corners, do not intermittent fast. \n2. Throw out your scale. Let weight go. You cannot focus on weight and get better. Your body has a natural weight that makes sense for you. You will not endlessly gain weight. You might fluctuate a bit, but ultimately you have to decide that this does not matter. Going up one pant size is not worth being tortured 24/7, indefinitely. \n3. Stop compensating when you overeat. It\u2019s going to happen and you have to learn how to chill when it does. If you want to go for a walk or something to ease discomfort, fine. But do not purge, skip meals, or exercise to make up for the calories. Every purge sets you up for another binge. You cannot recover from bulimia without learning how to make peace with occasional overeating.\n4. Here\u2019s a fun one - stop taking it all so seriously!!! For real. A clothing size, a number, calories, a single big meal, whatever is you\u2019re stressing about\u2014trying laughing at it, or at least say, \u201creally?\u201d. In the grand scheme of things, the stress of an ED is not worth it. It gives you nothing in the end\u2014weight comes back, and even if you \u201cstay thin,\u201d (basically impossible unless you\u2019re hell bent on dying from the disorder, which is very possible with bulimia *shudder*) all other aspects of beauty will start to diminish because your health is trashed. You can\u2019t win! What a joke! It\u2019s honestly so ridiculous. Start laughing at the thoughts, or tell them to f*ck off.",

That there was never going to be a time when I wanted to stop. That in order to stop, I needed to accept being uncomfortable. In practical terms, this meant eating adequately, allowing myself to overeat if it happened without purging, letting go of dieting, and letting go of weight control. Just eating enough every day (and I mean really enough, like 2,000-2,500 calories - NOT a diet) cut half of the urges away. The rest was a matter of learning to accept the discomfort. This didn\u2019t happen immediately. It took me about 10 months, every month b/p less and less (which again, meant that when I felt like overate or was unhappy with my weight, I just sucked it up did the next right thing: like eating my next meal anyway, or going to bed at night without purging).",

Anytime life got hard, I focused on my weight instead of what really mattered. I was tired of watching myself fail in so many other areas of my life because I was putting my limited and precious energy into a fantasy world of being thin and obliterating all my emotions with food. The more time I\u2019ve spent not b/ping, the more my motivation has grown, because I\u2019ve started to see that life is much more interesting without an ED. An ED keeps your reality so small, repetitive, and boring. I will say though, that there are tough days. There are times when my motivation takes a dip and I feel very empty, alone, and uncomfortable, and I just have to get through it. Even if that means laying on the floor staring at the ceiling until my next meal. Eventually, the next day, or a few days later, it comes back, and overall the trend keeps going upward.",

      "body": "Bulimia tricks you into thinking that there\u2019s a quick fix for everything. That there even IS a switch. There isn\u2019t. There will never be a day when you want to stop. You will die first. You have to accept that you will have to keep doing things you don\u2019t want to do in order to get better. Eating regularly. Not dieting. Giving up on weight manipulation. Not purging when you binge. Not binging when you overeat. If you\u2019ve ever gone to school or work, you can do this. I say that because we all have to do things we don\u2019t want to do ALL the time. But bulimia tricks us into thinking it\u2019s different. It\u2019s not. You suck it up and do what you don\u2019t want to do. You accept that doing it *your way* has never worked. If you keep at it, it gets easier, and it starts to feel natural and less like work. Most days, at this point, it\u2019s not work at all. Occasionally I have urges to restrict, and I remind myself that\u2019s setting myself up to binge. If I have an urge to binge, I take a time out and go for a drive/walk. Or lay on the floor until I don\u2019t care anymore. If I\u2019m actually hungry I just eat something. Even if it\u2019s more than I think I need. If I really want food, I just have it. Body image is hard sometimes. But I remind myself that bulimia did not keep me thin, either. In fact I gained and lost weight randomly all the time during bulimia and I had no control over it. So basically, it\u2019s not ONE big decision. It\u2019s a commitment, and an attitude, and you make many many little decisions all the time. You just keep asking, what would a healthy person do? What\u2019s freedom in this scenario? What do I want my life to be like? And then you do those things, even if they feel scary or gross or weird. Eventually everything loses its big electrical charge. You eat half an ice cream cone and throw it away. Or you eat a whole container of Chinese food and let it go. Little decisions, like that, over and over.",

No phone, no tv, etc. Just listening to my own thoughts and feelings and asking myself questions about why or what was going on. If I wanted to binge after, I could. And sometimes I did. But sitting for those 15 minutes at first showed me that I could stand my own emotions. And over time I lengthened the timer. And eventually I got to a point where I felt like I could handle my feelings without food, because I saw that b/p made my emotions worse! The feelings never really go away, you\u2019re just piling a problem on top of them. Once you start facing your emotions and problems that have been masked by your ED, you\u2019ll gain confidence in yourself that you can address them in new and better ways. Think of it this way, by your late 20s or into your 30s, you\u2019ve been through a lot of things that were awful. Losses, work stress, breakups, money problems, etc. When those things happened, they were horrible, and can drag out for years. But they were worse because of bulimia. Not better, not easier. But you got through those hard things\u2014and I bet you didn\u2019t have any clue how you would at first. But you did. Getting through the first stages of recovery is shitty and it takes a long time, but it is temporary, and you will improve every aspect of the rest of your life by doing it. I used to think bulimia helped me cope, but I eventually saw that that was a lie! Whatever happened in my life, I had to cope with, all while very sick. It\u2019s easier when you\u2019re not sick, not the other way around.",

      "body": "Good luck! I wish you all the best. You will find that as you move away from bulimia, even if it\u2019s just b/p less often, you\u2019ll have more time. And with that time, you can reflect on what else it is that you might want for your life. What else is around you to notice in the world. And the world gets richer. Here\u2019s an example. I used to not be able to go in the grocery store at night because if I was there, I would buy binge foods and binge. Every time. Since I started eating adequately, gave up dieting, and am now no longer purging, I no longer have such strong urges to dismiss. So I can go in the store and either not have an urge, or it is like a small thought that I can dismiss pretty quickly (\u201cI\u2019m not doing that. If I\u2019m hungry when I get home, I can eat something\u201d). What I mean about the world being richer is that going to the store at night is NEW. I can be in there and notice all the people around me. I can read packages of foods I\u2019ve never even noticed before, just out of curiosity. I can look at flowers, and magazines. When I get home I can watch a movie and focus on the whole movie, because I am not thinking about food. If I am thinking about food, I make a meal or a snack and then it is OVER. I can go for a long walk and simply notice nature, or listen to a podcast, and I am not thinking about how I need to lose weight or what diet to try next. I am not afraid at restaurants because I know that whatever I eat, it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay because I decide that it is. And every day I feel better and more clear-minded because I don\u2019t have a purge hangover. Anyway, those are just some small examples of how your life gets better.",
