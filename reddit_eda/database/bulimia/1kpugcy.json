  "selftext": "I started a new job, I never eat on my lunch break or snacks. They constantly say I don\u2019t eat. I had to make up allergies I don\u2019t have to get out of it. I can\u2019t purge working 12 hours straight. It hurts so bad to hear \u201coh she doesn\u2019t eat\u201d when I\u2019m dreaming and drooling about being able to enjoy the plain sandwich that\u2019s probably dry in the staff fridge. The stomach pain when I smell someone\u2019s hot meal in the break room. \u201cOh she doesn\u2019t eat\u201d\u2026. God I wish I could. Why do people say this sh* lol",

      "body": "This was a big thing at work for me. I have the babiest digestive system and also was restricting and I knew that if I ate a donut it wouldn\u2019t be just one, anytime I ate even my safe food I would bloat, so I kept my food intake really low residue and safe and I know it appeared like I never ate. AND it never helped that there was a constant supply of food. My supervisor would order donuts like every other morning and make sure all of us had one or two, or we\u2019d have team meeting and food would be there for all of us. There were always comments, you\u2019re not eating? I\u2019d say I already ate, and was always hit back with yeah but you can eat again!! (No\u2026but thank you) So my go-to was to always take the food, take a plate and stack donuts, stack the birthday cake slices, the croissants and cookies, sandwiches, pizza slices, whatever it was, and keep it at my desk for \u2018later\u2019. I was always the last person to clock out anyway so no one saw me eating it but they did see it on my desk and the comments stopped. Now this part I didn\u2019t like, but I\u2019d take those things and toss them on my way out when I knew no one was around or looking. I didn\u2019t want to binge on any of those things. If the food was sealed then I\u2019d donate to a friend but if it wasn\u2019t I\u2019d toss it. So keeping food at my desk, in plain sight for all to see, really helped curb their idea of me never eating.",
