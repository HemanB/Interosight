  "selftext": "I truly wish I was anorexic, with every bone I wish you could see my skin latching on to in my body. I hate having bulimia. Sticking objects so far down my throat in negative degree weather outside, at 1:00am, doing anything to purge. But it\u2019s been getting so hard to purge lately. My gag reflexes get better and better everyday. Waking up every morning, going to school, coming home just to binge and purge and binge and purge. The worst part is I\u2019m so good at not throwing up that I\u2019m gaining all the weight I worked so hard to lose back. So I genuinely mean it when I say I wish I was anorexic. Life would be so much easier compared to being bulimic. I could hide it, no need for buckets all over the house. I could live my fucking life. I wouldn\u2019t be wrecking my family. To live on an empty stomach would be the dream. Feeling cold in warm rooms, my hair falling out, the whiteness I would have in my eyes, oh my gosh and my jawline would be stunning. Everything would be so much better. I strongly believe Bulimia is worse then Anorexia.",

I just couldn't continue.\n\nIt's funny you mentioned ana because that was my next step. However, all that restriction eventually led me back to binge eating (no purging this time) so I wouldn't recommend. Made me get to 380 lbs. At the end of the day you just need a therapist or meds lmao that's what actually worked for me. Might be cliche but yeah. I can finally say I have a normal diet and a normal weight now.

I was heavily bulimic... and I definitely 'wished I was anorexic'. But what was I actually wishing for? I wanted to feel less out of control, I wanted people to have compassion towards me instead of just thinking I'm gross for throwing up or wasteful for bingeing, I wanted my brain to be more quiet, I thought if I was anorexic people would take me seriously and I could get help. \n\nBecoming anorexic wont give you any of those things but when you feel like you'll never be able to feel ok or eat normally or be comfortable with your body.... 'switching' disorders can seem like the only way to stop your current pain.",
