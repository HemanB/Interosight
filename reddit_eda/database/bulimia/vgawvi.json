  "selftext": "This crosses my mind a lot. Im so afraid of being stuck with thousands of calories whether from being injured and in the hospital and not being able to purge... or the time lapsing having to wait around for the police report/insurance swap with the other driver. \n\nAnd it's sad. \n\n\nOn the other hand, I fantasize about being hurt enough or sick with an illness to be in the hospital so I don't have the option of binging.  And then I can fully restrict and  let myself lose weight and feel my bones in new ways...\n\n\nIm not doing well tonight. In that space of post binge/pre binge where dread, shame, fear and disappointment is playing on repeat. Why havent I died already. This is an awful life.",

      "body": "This actually happened to me. When I was 17, I got into a head on car crash (I was front passenger) after a binge and the pressure from the crash/seatbelt combined with my stomach from being so dilated after binging caused it rupture. I had several surgeries and spent almost 2 months in the hospital. I'm extremely lucky that I didn't develop sepsis and my stomach and intestines still function normally. That was almost 10 years ago. I relapsed back into binging and purging behaviors later that year.  Thankfully, I sought ED treatment last year and I'm doing a little better. The car accident was the most horrific thing I've ever experienced but recovering from bulimia is still so hard:(",
