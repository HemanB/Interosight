  "selftext": "I used to love binging. I would spend days planning out all the delicious food I was going to eat. I would bake desserts, cook huge meals, and always enjoy eating it. I would spend 30 minutes eating all this tasty food and then purge it and feel amazing and satisfied.\n\nNow, I don\u2019t even enjoy the food. I will binge on 3-day old leftovers from the fridge that don\u2019t even taste good. I spend maybe 5 minutes binging on anything I can get my hands on and then get rid of it immediately, just to feel the high from purging. I\u2019m miserable.\n\nI\u2019m not saying bulimia is a good thing AT ALL, but it used to be my coping mechanism. Ever since I was a child, food was my comfort. I used it to cope with trauma, depression and anxiety. Now I don\u2019t even enjoy that one thing I had to comfort me: food. I feel absolutely dead inside.",

      "body": "Honestly like I went about 6 months really actively wanting to get better. So by that I mean I kept setting my day up good with eating healthy foods, but then since I hate the feeling of being full, which most of us can relate to, I would always end up binging & purging anyway.\n\nThen on June 1st, I was determined to stop, even if it was just every 4 days, as long as it stopped being every single day. I went clean the 1st & 2nd, purged the 3rd. And then on the 4th I woke up, went to run/work out, and when I got home I cleaned up, and then it's like a switch flipped, and I just knew I'm done with this life style. I can't do it anymore. I'm DONE. And it felt soooooo relieving to finally feel like something mentally changed so now I can actually move forward. And then I was really tempted to purge a couple days later but I knew that if I did, it would just open the door again. So I was so fortunate to be able to be done.\n\nSo basically it's like something changed in my mind, I can only describe it as like a switch flipped. Like the desire was still some what there for a while, but it wasn't nearly the same as before. And the more days I got under my belt, the easier it got.\n\nSo I just suggest working on mindset & trying to work on it. I don't know, it's just so freakin crazy how it happened for me.\n\nOh another thing I read that a recovered women wrote, was she would always repeat the quote, \"Never regret the decision\" when she had relapsing thoughts and she even tattooed it on her arm. I took a sharper and wrote it and it did help. When I first read her story, I thought \"If only that could actually help me\". But when it was my right time, it really did.\n\nOne thing with me also, I gained a ton of weight with bulimia. Like I lost weight at first, but then once I never had energy I stopped working out nearly as much (distant runner so I was really fit) and I just gained SO much weight, so that was another huge incentive I had to get back the energy to get back in shape.\n\nSo basically at some point it just clicks & the desire changes deep inside you after enough mental work I think. It happened like I would have never expected. I can't believe how much easier I had it compared to most people, and my heart goes out to them. At least that's my story, I wish I could have better advice but I hope this helps a little \ud83d\udc99",
