  "selftext": "12 year bulimic here. Cant stop crying. \n\nI recently managed to force my way into a small bought of not purging (yay very proud woohoo) and found the courage to go to the dentist. I had one root canal (of 6 total needed)   completed !!! But last week, when eating an apple, I had another tooth break. I told my dentist when I went to get my crown put on today. My dentist x-rayed this broken tooth and discovered a severe infection pressed right up against my sinus cavity - which he told me, is very very dangerous.\n\nFine, just yank it - I\u2019ll get an implant whenever I decide I can afford that. Except no, I can\u2019t just have him yank it because I just had a fucking rhinoplasty (another symptom of my self loathing) and any sort of pressure on my sinus cavity, especially a tooth that is so close, could cause damage or worse collapse that sinus cavity \n\nI am 25 and missing 4 teeth, this will be 5. Thankfully they are all towards the back, but god, I really just lost a lot of wind out of my sails. I am defeated today and just want to cry into the toilet. \n\nDo you ever just sit here and think how easy it would be to skip over the purging thing and just be a \u201cgood\u201d anorexic? I am so hopeless. I hate this disease. I love it but hate it at the same time. I love keeping her in my back pocket as my escape plan, I hate the guilt, shame and consequences that she brings into my life. \n\nI truly wish I had the nerve to kill myself, but I don\u2019t want to die. I just want to be thin, I want to be pretty. I want to be free and yet here I am clipping my own fucking wings.\n\n\nThanks for reading, and if you\u2019re struggling, or newly experiencing bulimic behavior, please ask for help. It doesn\u2019t just go away when you reach your \u201cgoal weight\u201d . it gets harder and harder every waking moment the more you go on.",

But now it can't be avoided any longer,  one of my top teeth hurts like heck at the gum line, I feel like I can see the tooth right through the gum. I finally got the courage to make an appointment, due to covid the earliest I can get in is in 3 months.  I am beyond scared of the news I will receive from the dentist,  the cost,  the pain, and the recovery. I knew for all these years what I was doing was awful,  but I managed to block it out until now. The full realization of the damage of this disease is finally starting to sink in when it is too late. I'm sad and I'm scared.  I am so happy to know I am not alone in this.  Keep on staying strong you beautiful soul.

          "body": "If I COULD TURN BACK TIME\n\nI am 45 yrs old. I have been bulimic since I was 12. The physical damage I have done to myself is irreversible. I used to have perfect teeth, and now I have both a full set of top and bottom dentures. I started menopause at 40. I am a qualified scientist specialising in cancer research and forensic science. Because of bulimia I can't hold down a job for more than three months. I was married once, and it lasted for 3 years, and it was a direct result of my eating disorder that it ended in divorce. Now, I am living with my elderly parents, and to be brutally honest, I feel like a total failure/loser and a waste of space. If this post reaches just 1 person, then I am happy I found the courage to write it. \nGet help. Live your life. Don't end up like me xx",

Even better, try to get the help we all need. I am so sorry you are going through this, I know the terror and shame that goes along with it.",
