  "selftext": "So I engage in restrict binge / purge type of behavior. I literally think about what I\u2019m going to binge on for dinner all day, and then the second I start eating it I\u2019m like \u201cwow this isn\u2019t nearly as satisfying as I thought it would be\u201d. But regardless I continue binging because I\u2019m convinced that I can find something that will \u201csatisfy\u201d the craving. After every b/p episode I am fully convinced that I will not crave these foods I\u2019m restricting anymore because of that feeling of being \u201cunsatisfied\u201d in the midst of / after a binge. But then the next morning I wake up and it feels like all of those feelings fly out the window and I\u2019m back to craving foods that the night before I didn\u2019t even understand why I was hyping them up. Idk if this makes sense but the moral of the story is that I\u2019m addicted to the idea and ritual around food more than I am addicted to the *actual* taste of the food. Yes, of course the food tastes great when I\u2019m eating it, but it\u2019s never as great as I think it\u2019s gonna be. The food is never as good as the glorified image that I make of it in my head. My brain feels so fucked . UGH. Anyways , yeah.\n\nEdit: I never expect my posts to blow up aha. It makes me feel less alone to hear that so many people can relate, but at the same time Im sorry that many of you are enduring this awful struggle as well. Shit sucks:/ regardless, I am happy I could articulate what many of you feel as well. Much love to all, hang in there <3",

      "body": "For me I am actually starting to not enjoy binges anymore. I have low blood sugar in the morning sometimes and it's probably the only time I enjoy bingeing now. If I do not binge in the morning and get through most of the day without doing it I just kind of feel better and would rather not eat at all. I feel like lately from b/p so long after having previously been anorexic for years it's kind of coming back. I don't want to b/p anymore because it kind of feels pointless and unsatisfactory but eating a normal amount isn't either so I'm just kind of not wanting to bother with food anymore. I used to chew and spit and at a certain point that didn't do it for me so I began to binge and purge and now that's starting to feel the same way. I wanted food so bad for years and now it's kind of whatever, not worth the guilt of ingesting it half the time honestly.",
