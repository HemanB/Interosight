I also planned to purge it out again. But at the grocery store I thought how counterproductive this behavior is, so I bought lots ofvegetables and a small package of chocolate and didn\u2019t feel bad about eating it \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f afterwards I took a depression nap \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
