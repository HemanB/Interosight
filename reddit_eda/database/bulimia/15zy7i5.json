  "selftext": "if i was anorexic my family would take me more seriously. shit not even the fucking psychiatrists are taking me seriously. i know u technically don\u2019t get to choose what Ed u get but i so fucking wish u could.\nbulimia doesnt even seem to make sense on paper, i mean anorexics starve themselves bc they wanna feel in control of something, they wanna feel like at least there is something they can be successful at, and these are all sentiments i feel too so why the fuck can\u2019t i just do it too? bulimia just makes u feel a thousand times shittier.\n\ni am so tired of feeling like a fake. i am tired of looking just like everybody else, of people not being able to tell that i am sick just by looking at me. i want people to look at me and gasp. i am tired of telling myself i can start doing the things i want to do once i reach a certain weight but staying at the exact same one ive been at for years now. this is such bullshit? i dont wanna recover and i never wanted to recover and in my head \u201cgetting better\u201d simply means becoming anorexic, being able to restrict without the b/p bullshit in the way.\n\nthe most ive ever went without bingeing was 48 days and its fucking pathetic. that was genuinely the best i was able to do. and now i just turned 18 and thats just telling me even more that i wasted so much of my time when i couldve lost all this weight and be like all those girls in the ed documentaries and movies and any other type of ed content under the sun. the ones everyone feels bad for, that everyone romanticizes, but no i am stuck with stupid fucking bulimia. bulimics dont even get the privilege to be made fun of most of the time.\n\ni have read about bulimics being able to stop bingeing and get to scarily low weights but the opposite is much more common, and honestly i cannot tell you how much that makes me feel hopeless. i actually have >!attempted suicide!< a couple of times but i was too much of a pussy to go all in (just like literally everything else i try) so i always end up asking for help.\n\nthe reason why all of this started in the first place was that i wanted to be confident. i wanted to have control and i was ready to fuck up my life to get that, because nothing matters more to me than feeling like i am not completely worthless, but my repeated failures at restriction and weight loss have only proved me right and now i fucked up my life for nothing.\n\ni am sorry if the things i have said are insensitive to anorexics or whatever. but im sure a lot of people will understand what i mean when i say that anorexia is a better eating disorder than bulimia.",

I started with just anorexia and when I was severely underweight people expressed concern and took my illness seriously. As soon as I gained weight people stopped worrying and assumed I was doing good. I only gained weight from not getting all the binge food up when I purged \ud83d\ude12 \n\nI relate so much to everything you said. It\u2019s the unfortunate truth about eating disorders that I feel is taboo to talk about. Another thing about bulimia is the MONEY. When I was strictly anorexic I was saving money because all I bought was oats, protein powder, almond milk and fruit. I\u2019ve gone into DEBT from buying binge food. \ud83d\ude43",

With bulimia you're just disgusting cause you waste food and puke all the time. Not to mention how much MONEY I saved from ana cause rarely bought groceries. I've literally binged myself into debt with bulimia. \nAnd people PRAISE you and are SUPPORTIVE of you when you manage to eat something somewhat normally. No one's ever praised me for not puking.
