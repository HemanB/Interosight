I've struggled with various EDs for nearly 5 years now and I really want to get better. My last b/p was last night, March 6th. I'll update tonight and talk about how the day was, urges, how I deal with them etc. Who's doing it with me?\n\nLots of love everyone x",

I\u2019m 2 months, 13 days purge free today and counting and feeling so much stronger than I have in years since my last long remission of ~2 years. I aspire to continue and getting to where you are now! Keep going strong and congratulations on such an amazing milestone... and OP, start off one day at a time and don\u2019t think about the future, just think about making it through the day without hurting yourself through binging and purging. It gets easier as time goes by and you notice how healthy and willing to be happy you feel. Keep strong!!",
