It sounds like your mom is scared and worried about you but doesn\u2019t have the right skills to help you. Unfortunately, our loved ones can be more detrimental to us getting help or recovery. In order for me to stop drinking Alcohol I had to really work hard on focusing on myself and letting go of other peoples opinions and judgements, or what I assumed they were. I realize this isn\u2019t the exact same issue as having bulimia since I have been struggling with B/P on and off since I was a teen, and I\u2019ve found it hard to find full recovery from it. It\u2019s a horrible mental illness to have and tends to live and thrive in secrecy which makes it hard to talk or listen to others ask us about it. I have an adult son that I know has struggled with it and might still be. I am worried about him and have tried to talk to him about it but I know first hand how hard it is to talk to someone else about it. My heart goes out to all of us here that are trying to get healthy. I believe the neurological effects that bulimia has on my brain is very similar to what consuming alcohol did for it. I am going to work as hard on recovery from my bulimia as I did to recover from my AUD (alcohol use disorder). In committing to this, I understand that it will take much effort on my part to do the hard work that recovery requires. Self education on the disorder, creating a new daily routine that will help support my goal, sharing with others who are struggling with the same problem, and seeking treatment and support from a safe professional. I have hope for all of us and believe that we can get better. Are you able to talk to a professional therapist who specializes in eating disorders?",

      "body": "I don\u2019t know if bulimic people realise who offensive and emotionally straining their behaviour can be on others. Most notably their families. Like it or not, but a mentally diseased person is often the centre of attention. In case of bulimic girls, binge eating in front of others seems to be part of the attraction for them. Let me tell you that for everyone else it is repulsive and creates outright anger when the bulimic person eats all the food that was meant for sharing. Or when replenishing the enormous quantities that she eats and then vomits out strains their family finances. All of this is not to mention that other family needs have needs too. At one point, caring for the special needs of the bulimic girl will naturally cause envy and frustration in others.\n\nIn my mind, eating disorders can be incredibly selfish acts of attention grabbing. Combine this with the ubiquitous advice that one must never do things such as to call out their binging or restrict their food supply and you have a toxic situation for everyone else.\n\nYour mom may not have used particularly sensitive language in calling you a junkie. But factually she is right. You have an addiction that naturally causes her to stress out. Ask yourself what you are doing to straighten yourself out! End the defeatist attitude that is so rampant in these forums. You have agency and free will. An eating disorder is not a physical addiction, it is all in your head. Plan to stop it and then do it! And yes, you have every reason to feel ashamed about what \u2014like it or not\u2014 amounts to antisocial behaviour.",

I now realize that my mother had no skills because she had a much more difficult childhood than me. It\u2019s sad to realize how our family members lack of support or negative responses can make our struggles even worse. Now that I\u2019m in my 50\u2019s and my parents have been dead for a longtime, I realize that they were limited in how they could help me.

Children often look up to the same sex parent the most for guidance in their formative years. I would move heaven & earth for my kids & happily die for them if given the opportunity. I literally can\u2019t imagine any greater love, & I\u2019ve been married for over 26yrs. If I saw one of them struggling so severely, I would want to know if I did something wrong so I could apologize & change my behavior. Heck, I had metastatic cancer & my kids still remind me of how they had to wash dishes & do laundry in middle school when their friends didn\u2019t have to, lol!! I\u2019m saying all of this to try to ENCOURAGE YOU. I do not know the entire story, but I\u2019m guessing your mom cried b/c she loves you & was worried about you. She probably feels guilt for every wrong decision she\u2019s ever made, b/c let\u2019s face it, no parent is perfect\u2026",

But from a daughter\u2019s perspective who very much loves her mother, knowing how much she sacrificed for me, it\u2019s reactions like these that prevent me from being honest with her. Because I wouldn\u2019t want her to blame herself, I couldn\u2019t let her know what I am going through. And I think my mom has been doing the same since I was born, she\u2019d hide the hardships from me so I wouldn\u2019t worry. Is this healthy? Not at all :(",

Once she told me why, I\u2019ve really tried to do better. I\u2019ve actually locked myself in my bathroom & turned my shower on to have a good cry so no one could hear me, but I\u2019m SO HAPPY SHE TOLD ME, b/c now she\u2019s able to share more with me.

I guess I\u2019ve always come from a position of protection, because I see my mom as frail. She\u2019s much smaller than me and is clumsy so I always do look out for her even physically and I realize that I generalized and also do that emotionally. But just because my mom is empathetic does not make her weak. Thanks for also sharing your experience with your daughter. I should think of having a more honest conversation with my mother.
