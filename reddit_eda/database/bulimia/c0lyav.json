Recovery is not linear. It's a slippery slope, and that's what makes it so difficult. It's alright to have bad days, you just have to try again. Don't be too hard on yourself.\n\nI hope that maybe you see this, and I hope you're okay. This community will here to support you whenever you come back \u2764",

I had not binged but we buried my nana's ashes yesterday and then went out to lunch so I was overly emotional and overtired from being at work at 430 am before going to cemetary. Thought purging would make me feel better....turns out a 2 hr nap worked just as well. Urges are strong today but I'm trying to stay distracted.",

It\u2019s so hard sometimes, and once you slip up once, you just get sucked into that awful cycle again. \n\nBut we can do it :) \n\nAs long as we acknowledge our mistakes, keep going, and recognize that we have the strength to keep trying.",
