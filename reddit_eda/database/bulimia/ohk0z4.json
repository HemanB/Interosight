I'm well rid of him now (THANK GOD) but still rely on laxatives to help me poop.  Thing is they stop working after awhile.  I'm on day 3 of nothing and I'm bloated and swollen and gassy but I'm determimed to kick this habit once and for all.  I'm weight restored and otherwise very happy in my life and this is my final hurdle.  I have faith in my body and I'm determined to work through the discomfort.  I do have a colo-rectal Dr. appt coming up but in 6 weeks time. My current thought is this; if after 7 days no BM I'll do one enema.  Then go another 7 days, etc.   My family and bf and close friends know and are so supportive. But it's a leap of faith TBH.   My dirty little secret is no secret anymore.  We all deserve a good and happy life.  I've put my body through so much already.  I owe it this.",

I was very hooked on the tea though, I had 5 bags 3x a day. It was the worst decision I could have ever made. I struggle with painful constipation, edema, bloating and my stomach doesn't seem to fully digest things anymore. I stopped all laxatives over the winter and am still really struggling. I blow up with water constantly and I feel stiff, worst feeling I've experienced. \n\nIf I had known 3 years ago that I would be struggling so much now from the side effects of taking them I never would have. I haven't been able to feel comfortable in my clothes in so long. I just feel like a big swollen water balloon all the time and nothing helps, coffee makes my body swell even more, same with any sort of diuretic like dandelion tea or green tea, it's terrible.",

Having to deal with that since the winter sounds brutal - but I will say that ~six months is not enough time for your body to fully heal and I bet it will get better. It\u2019s likely a hormonal imbalance, where your body began to overproduce the hormone that makes you hold onto water (forget what it\u2019s called). \n\nIf you can afford to see a naturopath and want to see one, I would highly recommend it. Either way, best of luck!",
