      "body": "honestly this is the reason I'm a stoner... any anti-anxiety medication or substance can make your mind less focused on your body, so for now, maybe consider talking to a psychiatrist to see if there's a medicinal way to help this for you. \n\na therapist would say that loving hunger is a symptom of many ED's. your dopamine functions are rewired to enjoy feeling hunger, because it feels like an accomplishment, like you're doing something \"right.\" psychology (reasonably) compares eating disorders to drug addictions (like an addiction to being hungry/starving/eating specific foods) because your mind is hyper-focused on anything related to food/weight/body. you feel irritated when you don't indulge in the addiction (being hungry). i don't know if this helps at all, but it's a kind of scientific explanation for your feelings that's helped me be more forgiving to myself when i hated feeling full.",

But it\u2019s basically a death sentence for me, because once I eat my stomach just feels so bloated and full that I\u2019m too sick to actually enjoy bowling, skating, or whatever other activity we had planned. \n\nWhen I go on dates with my boyfriend I always make sure we eat LAST so at least I can just go home afterwards, and not have to walk around or try to have fun while I feel so full I could throw up.",

Nowadays as I\u2019m closer to 30 than not, I realize I *also* hate it. And like the comments above, if I can, I walk. But several times in the past 6 months, when I don\u2019t even feel like I\u2019m thinking about purging, but after I have *overeaten* and feel full, I\u2019ll get this deep seeded nausea in the pit of my stomach that makes me purge, and feel like there\u2019s no other option. And Idk wtf that is.  Never saw that one coming. I just thought I\u2019d always associate fullness with joy. And this sequence of events ALWAYS puts me in a bad mood, because I was trained to think feeling full means good things. Because it feels wasteful to purge. Because now my teeth have that gritty feeling. Because now my eyes hurt. Because now I\u2019m just... empty.",
