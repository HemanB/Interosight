      "body": "All these comments are saying that you should drink something but actually your body is craving nutrients and energy. \n\nThis can be extremely difficult and probably needs some tries and work to actually get through with it - but you should allow yourself to have a healthy normal sized meal even after a binge. Of course only if you want to pursue recovery. This really helps once you get a hang of it. Frequent eating brings your metabolism to a more normal rate again. \n\nHaving a b/p episode does not mean that you are not allowed to eat afterwards. Your body needs it. Having a b/p episode does not equal having a meal. \n\nAllow yourself a time healthy normal sized meal after an episode and go for a walk afterwards or distract yourself from further cravings in some way. Also remind yourself that you are still allowed to eat later again - reminding myself that i can eat another meal later again helped me control my cravings. Even if all i could think about was my next meal and preparing my next meal. \n\nIt gets better. For me it got better and i believe it can get better for everyone. Be kind to yourself.",
