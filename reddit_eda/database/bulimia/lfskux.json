  "selftext": "I understand if what I'm going to say sounds farfetched or made up. There's no way for me to prove it unless I capture it on camera\n\nSo a bit of backstory here: I live in a duplex built in 1942 with my dad and stepmom. My room is the garage unit next door where I spend most of my time. Dad and step mom used to live here before moving to the main house and told me they encountered really weird stuff, particularly from 3-5 AM. They heard knocking and found things move with no reasonable explanation. The cat I used to have used to look up at the crawlspace door sometimes even though nothing was there. Sometimes I feel a presence, like my 6th sense is going off. Pretty weird shit. \n\nSo where does bulimia factor in my situation? Well sometimes (not all the times, I've only notice this happen after violent and loud purging), I wake up to my desktop webcam either moved to the right or facing down on the right. The other unexplained occurrences other than the webcam are waking up to my mini fridge ajar, waking up to my CPU unplugged, and my music on YouTube unpausing itself while I showered. Whatever is moving these things seems to prefer to move the webcam after I b/p. \n\nI think my purging upsets them. Maybe they care about me or they're just excited? I have no idea. I'm still in shock of this happening. I'm thinking of setting up a camera or somehow leaving the webcam to record and try to catch anything. \n\nJust wanted to share, I'd love to hear any similar experiences.",

Feel free to ignore, I'm just curious!\n \nThis is so odd but years ago when I was relapsing hard I *also* thought my apartment was haunted. Multiple items moved around, in big ways too, like from upstairs to down in the living room (not as noticeable as your case though). Long story short I'm 99% sure it was my roommate's cat \ud83e\udd14 We even asked a spiritualist friend to come do a walkthrough low-key to cleanse the bad juju, that place had a weird vibe for sure. Back then I never wondered if my disorder might have some connection hmm\n \nIt's nice to think you have a ghost friend who notices you're struggling and is trying to help out! By moving your webcam? Lol. If you do end up with footage, people on the ghosts subreddit would definitely look it over and give feedback (if you're looking for that!)",
