  "selftext": "I don\u2019t want to, yet I still impulse buy binge foods. Every day. It never stops. I\u2019m not in control at all. \n\nI know I am slowly getting better, my binges are smaller than they were and less frequent. I used to b/p up to 20+ times a day and I am down to 2-3 and up to 7 on bad days. I know it\u2019s an improvement but I just want to kick myself in the vagina and say \u201cC\u2019moooooon stop doing this. This is crazy. Insanity, honestly. \n\nSo repetitive,  boring, absurd. I\u2019m in my own food world and it\u2019s gotten worse this pandemic. My girlfriend\u2019s been a huge support for me, I feel like I am disappointing her every time I throw up, but she says I don\u2019t. \n\nIt\u2019s making me cranky in my day-to-day because I am continually annoyed with myself. So in my own head too. Writing this out has helped a little as re-reading some lines makes me cackle, darkly. \n\nCan you relate at all?",

I highly recommend picking up \"intuitive eating\" book (the latest edition) (DM me for more info on this if you need it).\n\nIve been in BP cycles for the past couple years, and I've relapsed back to my old ways again and again and again. I can say that that book gave me a mindset change. Do i still have bad days? Have I still B/P? Yes, but never in my life have I been so committed to recovery. That book gave me a new perspective on my struggle, one that has helped me choose recovery way more often than I have ever done in my life.",
