I've tried taking less of those so I could buy more food but then I have no energy to ride my bike to work and then do the work once I get there.  I haven't bought new clothes in years aside from what was absolutely necessary.  All so I can buy food that I'm not even going to keep down.  It's so stupid.  How my husband doesn't get it is beyond me",

My paychecks get eaten up because of the loans I took out and I've downgraded to a small bedroom that I share with my large dog & cat. \n\nI'm trying to save in order to afford something I've wanted for a very long time and it has been my dream, but it's so hard. Don't be like me. \n\nBest wishes.",
