People aren\u2019t naturally equipped to deal with this sort of thing, and relationships are a two-way street. Our trauma/ED doesn\u2019t excuse our obligations in that regard imo. Not trying to pass judgment on you, you\u2019re obviously hurting, just kind of what I\u2019ve concluded after years of being ED\u2019d and finally being in a supportive and loving relationship during it. I realize after having someone who loves me, that it hurts to see me hurt myself. And that can manifest in weird ways for ppl who have no idea how EDs work or why we do the things we do. \n\nOrrrr he\u2019s an asshole that doesn\u2019t give a shit.
