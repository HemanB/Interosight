I moved back in with my parents so it was harder to do without them noticing, my mum found out and she is a nurse who works on an eating disorder ward lol so she was immensely supportive and gave me all sorts of good advice. I also moved further away from my boyfriend at the time who would always comment on my weight. I took up new hobbies also (tennis) so I didn't spend all my time thinking about my next binge. The stars aligned pretty well for me",
