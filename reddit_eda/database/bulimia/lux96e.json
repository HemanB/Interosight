Maybe go for a walk or have a nice workout tomorrow too? You can deal with however many calories you ate tonight but I\u2019m afraid if you purge it could throw you back into the infamous cycle. You have all of our support, we are sending you good vibes and wishing you wellness. Please be gentle to yourself and know you didn\u2019t do anything wrong.",

Like a comment earlier said- you are allowed to eat and drink beer. If you slip don\u2019t be hard on yourself. This disease thrives when we focus on our imperfections. You can make it through this and keep going! Keep up your amazing progress.",

      "body": "I'm like 6 months into recovery and it's so crazy how my thinking about the \"inevitable purge\" has changed. You know how when you used to binge or think you ate too much or feel any shame and it just clicks that you will purge, that's it, no stopping the purge train? \n\nNow, I have those same guilty associations about eating plenty of times, but the follow-up feelings are maybe 25% resisting the urge to purge and 75% really intense fear that I might slip back into that autopilot. Does this make sense at all? I literally have nightmares about purging now, and wake up incredibly relieved that it was a dream. \n\nYour feelings right now may be similar--yes, digesting a big meal can be emotionally taxing, but you might also be processing some fear about ending up back where you used to be, because a life without bulimia is so much better.",

      "body": "It seems like whatever feeling triggers you to purge (whether that be physical like the feeling of fullness, or mental such as the feeling of anxiety) was definitely activated during/after this meal, and thus it is perfectly normal to have urges. Remember that a thought or feeling compelling us to do something is just that, a thought or feeling. I know when triggered to purge I feel so awful and overwhelmed I just want the feeling out of my body, but the thing with anxiety is that if you are able to sit with it it will eventually go down. You will not feel this way forever and if you are able to sit with the feeling this time around imagine what you can manage to sit with in the future. I'm sorry you are struggling at the moment, I do think that the fact that you posted on here and didn't just engage in the behavior is commendable. I hope you have a good rest of your night, perhaps engaging in a relaxing activity or possibly something to distract? Or if you have a trustworthy person in your support system who you can talk to or spend time with?",

Break it down piece by piece, find the triggers, make new or smaller challenges you can survive. You are perfect the way you are and can only grow stronger. If you made it through this difficult time, you can learn something. If you purged, that\u2019s fine too, you can also learn from that. I wish you the best \ud83d\udc96",
