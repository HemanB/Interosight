  "selftext": "After a ~10 hour binge, I felt so sick that I was about to throw up without touching my throat. (Usually it's very hard for me to vomit) I went to the toilet and purged so much and the toilet clogged. After 15-30 of trying to unclog it, the water got to the top and vomit water spilt all over the floor. This is at 1am mind you. My two siblings and parents are sleeping rkght now. I tried a plunger and snake but neither worked. I ended up scooping the water into the tub, cup by cup. When that was almost done, I stuck my hand in the brown water and pulled the paper towels out. (Yes I know very dumb on my part; we are out of toilet paper) This what such a miserable expiernece and I am so ashamed of myself. While I wish I dcould say this was a wake-up call, and I've been trying recover, I am losing hope",

Recovery isn't linear, it's scary and really hard, and trying, STARTING recovery is the one of the hardest hurdles to overcome. I'm proud of you for trying, and it doesn't mean you failed. please be kind to yourself, rest and drink water \u2764\ufe0f",

I\u2019ve never had exactly your scenario happen, but I kinda chuckle to myself every time I get splashed in the eyeball by puke or other vomit mishaps. Then I imagine laughing and making fun of myself to friends, then I\u2019m like oh wait\u2026 no one can ever know about this\u2026 \ud83d\ude43\n\nAlso you sound way too young to have seen Trainspotting (cult 90s movie) but there\u2019s an iconic scene really similar to this but so, sooo much worse (the movie is about heroin addicts) \n\nAnyway hope that\u2019s not taken in any way negative. Better luck tomorrow!",

Just know u aren\u2019t alone and can get better. You aren\u2019t too far gone. Back then when I was in the situation it felt like I would always be like that but now I\u2019m almost completely recovered. I wish you the best!!",
