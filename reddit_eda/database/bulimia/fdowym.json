  "selftext": "Yesterday, I didnt b/p until 6pm. Which was INCREDIBLE!. Today right now, it is 7:10pm and I have not b/ped and dont plan on it.\n\nToday might be the first day I have not b/ped in TWO months. Ive been taking walks to coffee shops after school to spend time out and getting my homework done instead of going home and binging immediately. \n\nRecovery is possible, and I'm going to end up on top , eating even better than I ever have in my life, I promise. I'm taking control of my health.",
