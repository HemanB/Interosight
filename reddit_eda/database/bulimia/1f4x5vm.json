      "body": "I agree with most of this, but will say that the 10kg weight gain can be fat gain. over a period of weeks and months of keeping down 2k a day can and will lead to weight gain if you\u2019re underweight and in a severe calorie deficit. Being underweight changes the way your body metabolises food. And likely also means low muscle mass, which is one of the primary forces behind metabolic rate.\n\nSo if underweight, you can expect that eating 2,000cal a day will possibly lead to faster weight gain than normal. If you are very active this could be your maintenance. But initially you may see the scale go up faster because your body is starved of nutrients and it just absorbs a lot for a period of time until you are weight restored\n\nI don\u2019t want to scare you about recovery, but this is something you will need to go through if you are not keeping any food down and are underweight. That weight gain is necessary to recover in body and mind. You can do it.",

I\u2019ve searched far and wide for a definitive answer on whether any macronutrient (generally, carbohydrate) can actually be absorbed into the bloodstream through the mouth, and I really can\u2019t find anything clear-cut. So I guess it\u2019s possible that some minor amount of carbohydrate may be absorbed through the mouth. But the vast majority of macronutrient absorption happens in the small intestine, and whatever amount may be absorbed through the mouth is negligible. Honestly I find it difficult to believe that any meaningful amount of carbohydrate can actually enter the bloodstream through the mouth as most of the reliable sources I\u2019ve read on this make no mention of it\u2026 but I might be wrong lol, I\u2019m not an expert\n\nThis is a very minor thing, but I want to be clear that digestion is not the same thing as absorption. Digestion = breaking down of food into its energy- and nutrient-containing substituents, while absorption = crossing of these molecules from the GI tract into the bloodstream where they can eventually be used for energy. Yes, carbohydrates begin to be broken down into simple sugars in the mouth. Digestion happens all along the upper GI tract. Absorption happens in the small intestine.",

It took me a while to work out how many calories I could comfortably eat a day to maintain a lower end healthy BMI, but I\u2019ve had to do this again because that bmi (around 19) was not high enough to reduce urges to binge.

Being underweight changes the way your body metabolises food. And likely also means low muscle mass, which is one of the primary forces behind metabolic rate.\n\nSo if underweight, you can expect that eating 2,000cal a day will possibly lead to faster weight gain than normal. If you are very active this could be your maintenance. But initially you may see the scale go up faster because your body is starved of nutrients and it just absorbs a lot for a period of time until you are weight restored\n\nI don\u2019t want to scare you about recovery, but this is something you will need to go through if you are not keeping any food down and are underweight.

          "body": "I agree with most of this, but will say that the 10kg weight gain can be fat gain. over a period of weeks and months of keeping down 2k a day can and will lead to weight gain if you\u2019re underweight and in a severe calorie deficit. Being underweight changes the way your body metabolises food. And likely also means low muscle mass, which is one of the primary forces behind metabolic rate.\n\nSo if underweight, you can expect that eating 2,000cal a day will possibly lead to faster weight gain than normal. If you are very active this could be your maintenance. But initially you may see the scale go up faster because your body is starved of nutrients and it just absorbs a lot for a period of time until you are weight restored\n\nI don\u2019t want to scare you about recovery, but this is something you will need to go through if you are not keeping any food down and are underweight. That weight gain is necessary to recover in body and mind. You can do it.",

          "body": "It really depends on factors that are separate to bulimia and mostly related to genetics, age, height, ethnicity etc . You can use a BMR/TDEE calculator online to give you a general guideline of how many calories you should be eating - but it really is a process of trial and error. It took me a while to work out how many calories I could comfortably eat a day to maintain a lower end healthy BMI, but I\u2019ve had to do this again because that bmi (around 19) was not high enough to reduce urges to binge. So now I\u2019m eating more and figuring out what my weight does. It\u2019s a very anxious process\u2026 it doesn\u2019t help that I have no idea where my scale is atm lol but basically the more muscle mass you have, the faster your metabolic rate - no one really quite understands the mechanism behind why some people with muscle mass seem to burn more than they should (science says that muscle mass doesn\u2019t burn that many more calories), but evidence shows that it seems to be an interplay of factors happening in the body that work together which can\u2019t really be measured accurately. \n\nBuilding muscle mass is your friend when gaining weight, because the weight you gain will be mostly muscle rather than fat, which looks VERY different.",
