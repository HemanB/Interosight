I turned 13-14 and all of a sudden for my height I was the right weight about 130. But I still saw that fat obese gross 11 body and still do to this day now that I'm 25 and have had a kid. \n\nMy mother changed my doctor after that one, her looking me in the face saying I wasn't playing enough wasn't eating good enough at 11. It destroyed any thought I ever had good about myself. Even when I should have seen I grew into myself as I got a few years older.\n\nI wouldn't let any doctor tell me what the scale said anymore going in. Id warn and say please please read nothing outloud. \n\nI wish they heard you and I'm wicked sorry .",
