  "selftext": "I binged\u2026BIG TIME. I mean I really did it, probably like 8000+ in abt 12 hours. I slept in between. I wanted to do my purge-y weird compulsive 10 mile walk, but instead I took a bath. I sat there and cried and sobbed, and screamed ngl, but I did not take that walk. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a win, because I still binged, but I didn\u2019t purge. So yeah I\u2019m probably going to gain a shit ton of weight and I\u2019m scared shitless, but hey fear is okay, fear is life, fear won\u2019t hurt me. Okay and so I gain 5lbs, my life goes on. NO ONE DIED, my life isn\u2019t over, my cat didn\u2019t get crushed by a car. I HAVE A ROOF OVER MY HEAD, IM GOING TO COLLEGE, I AM GRADUATING HIGHSCHOOL IN TWO WEEKS, MY PARENTS LOVE ME, I AM HEALTHY, AND IM HEALING!!! I just thought I would share that win, because it felt pretty cool to realize this. Although I want to sit here and cry and cry some more, I am not going to. Well I am, but then I am going to get back up, and keep going. Also\u2026when should I weigh myself again? So I can see the true damage. \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79 ",
