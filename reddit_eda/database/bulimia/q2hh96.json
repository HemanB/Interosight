  "selftext": "My 2nd lapse in 2 weeks makes me feel like recovery is impossible. I've tried so many times to recover and it never lasts. Bitch B keeps pulling me back into the safety of her porcelain arms. \n\nMy binge today consisted of literally 6 bags of sweets. About 10 giant cookies. Half a peach cobbler meant to serve 24. A bag of potato chips (gotta balance it with some savory right).\nI tried to purge as I ate constantly for about 3 hours. All that came up was little bits of super sickly sweet liquid. \n\nNow, as I lay in bed, I feel the sugar coursing through my veins creating streaming rivers of glucose that fill every pore and settle into lumpy pockets of cellulite just under my stretched out skin. \nMy heart is screaming.\nMy head is spinning.\nI hate myself. I want to tear my flesh off. \nWhy does food have me in such a strong chokehold that I often forget to breathe......",

Eating disorders love to use lapses as evidence that we can't recover. Your ED wants to zoom in on the bad stuff, and ignore all of the good. Do not let it convince you that you can't recover. You 100% can recover.\n\nTry to focus on what's been going well. What are some wins that you have experienced lately? Is there an area where you are making progress? Did you use to binge more often? When it seems like recovery is impossible, try to zoom out and look at the whole picture. There is always something that has either gotten better or changed in a positive way. No matter how small it is. Be patient with yourself. Keep going. You can do this. \ud83d\udc9c",
