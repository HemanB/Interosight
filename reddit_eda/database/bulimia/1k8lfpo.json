Like, what the hell is wrong with me?\n\nAnyone else in the same boat? I feel so isolated in this mess. It\u2019s bad enough dealing with the guilt and shame, but now I\u2019ve got money problems on top of it all. How do you even deal with this? I could really use some hope right now...",

I know other people who did the same who also have recovery now. \n\nI have 4+ years of recovery now! I had about a year off of not doing it, then started again, and since 2020 have stopped and it\u2019ll be 5 years in September. That shit is like a demon. It really is a drug, I just could NOT stop. It\u2019s like this isolating, highly addictive behavior to the food, the purging, the intense self-harm of it all. I didn\u2019t think I would ever ever ever EVER stop again. It still blows my fucking mind that I stopped. To be honest I went to a 12 step program and it finally helped me, which makes sense because really it was bigger than just this addiction to binging and purging. It\u2019s something about using it to cope really how alcoholics use alcohol to cope. It\u2019s so fucking hard though because you still have to eat food to survive every day, you can\u2019t just cut it out like drugs or alcohol. Stopping b/p was THEEEEE hardest thing I ever ever did, but it\u2019s the best thing I ever did too. I just needed a support group like a 12 step program to do it and other people who understood what it was that I was struggling with because of their own lived experience of it too. \n\nI can put a link here to speaker recordings of people who also have recovery. There\u2019s also a link to find meetings if you ever want to go to one. I\u2019d just recommend to go into it with an open mind and listen for similarities rather than differences because it can be strange at first especially if it\u2019s something you\u2019re not used to hearing. If you go to the speaker archives, you can see who specifically struggles with bulimia too.

All my money went to that and tbh I found other ways to find food so I could fuel that addiction, really. I know other people who did the same who also have recovery now. \n\nI have 4+ years of recovery now! I had about a year off of not doing it, then started again, and since 2020 have stopped and it\u2019ll be 5 years in September. That shit is like a demon. It really is a drug, I just could NOT stop. It\u2019s like this isolating, highly addictive behavior to the food, the purging, the intense self-harm of it all. I didn\u2019t think I would ever ever ever EVER stop again. It still blows my fucking mind that I stopped. To be honest I went to a 12 step program and it finally helped me, which makes sense because really it was bigger than just this addiction to binging and purging. It\u2019s something about using it to cope really how alcoholics use alcohol to cope. It\u2019s so fucking hard though because you still have to eat food to survive every day, you can\u2019t just cut it out like drugs or alcohol. Stopping b/p was THEEEEE hardest thing I ever ever did, but it\u2019s the best thing I ever did too. I just needed a support group like a 12 step program to do it and other people who understood what it was that I was struggling with because of their own lived experience of it too. \n\nI can put a link here to speaker recordings of people who also have recovery. There\u2019s also a link to find meetings if you ever want to go to one. I\u2019d just recommend to go into it with an open mind and listen for similarities rather than differences because it can be strange at first especially if it\u2019s something you\u2019re not used to hearing. If you go to the speaker archives, you can see who specifically struggles with bulimia too. All the love to you and if you have any questions at all feel free to ask and of course I\u2019ll answer. <3\n\nhttps://www.oalaig.org/laig-virtual-speakers-bureau/[https://www.oalaig.org/laig-virtual-speakers-bureau/](https://www.oalaig.org/laig-virtual-speakers-bureau/)",

          "body": "Wow, your story really touched me. It's so inspiring to see someone who's been in the same hell and made it out, especially when you describe the struggle so perfectly. That part about 'not believing you'd ever stop'? THAT'S SO ME.\n\nI'm in this rollercoaster of staying clean for a few weeks then relapsing even harder... It's fucking discouraging. But knowing you made it after so many setbacks gives me a tiny thread of hope, you know? Thanks for sharing the links. I'll give those groups a try, even though I'm scared. I need to try something different because doing it alone isn't working. <3",
