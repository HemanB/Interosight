      "body": "Such good lyrics! Those lines \u201cmy emotions hidden in the horse of Troy\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m broken, you cannot put in another token.\u201d Such beautiful imagery. \n\nAnd I know exactly how that feels. You lose yourself in this illness. You feel like you have to hide because that\u2019s what society expects of you, but you\u2019re done hiding. You are broken and don\u2019t think you can be fixed. But it doesn\u2019t have to stay that way. \n\nI love poetry, especially songwriting, and I wrote my story through song as well. But I won\u2019t share that here - I just wanted to say that I\u2019ve been there and I\u2019m glad that you can find an outlet through your art. \n\nNow - back to the hope. I\u2019m a recovered bulimic and binge eater. I\u2019m living in a freedom that I can write about without worrying if I\u2019ll lose it again. You can recover. \n\nFor me, it took coming to the end of myself. I had to accept I was powerless over my compulsive behaviors around food and I needed something outside myself - stronger than therapy or psychiatry, and lasting, not a diet or meal plan. \n\nNot everyone is powerless. Some can find recovery through the meal plan or group therapy or whatever it may be. If it works, go for it!\n\nFor me though, I was this chronic type of compulsive eater who could not leave food alone. Couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it, eating it, purging it. My behavior was addictive. And whereas others could binge eat for a season and then return to normalcy, I couldn\u2019t do the same. \n\nI am not normal. And I\u2019ve accepted that. It\u2019s ok if you\u2019re not, and ok if you are. What matters is that you get the help you need.\n\nI am here - if you want to talk about recovery, if you want someone to share your poems with who can truly appreciate them, if you are seeking something stronger that can help you overcome this illness, if you feel you\u2019ve hit your rock bottom with something that has become an addiction \u2014 wherever you are. I\u2019m here. Feel free to PM me any time. \ud83d\udc95",
