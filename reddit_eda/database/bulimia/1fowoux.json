(i told the damn man to wait a lil bit oh well)\nanyways\n\nit began there. i was.. 10? 11? but eating issues in general started way before that. familial eating disorder projection at its finest\u2026 from multiple members, bless them. \none of my earliest memories is hiding an entire load of bread in my \u201ctoy kitchen\u201d in mine and my young-mid teenage sisters room. i\u2019d run there when no one knew/was looking and scarf down pieces of bread, like i was starving. i of course got caught by her (she won\u2019t admit it today, but she had anorexia for a while, and my family suspects bulimia) and she\u2019d rip it away. it felt like i was being punished.\nthere are many other things but i wont go on\n\nthrowing up became a crutch for years. when i was 13 (or 14? don\u2019t remember), my father got diagnosed with cancer. we had a big move. by this point, someone at church, fellow kid, educated me on what it was. it\u2019s called bulimia. it\u2019s when you _____ so on so forth. i hadn\u2019t known any of this up until this point, i just threw up, and knew i didn\u2019t ever want to stop.\nage 15, my father gets the death sentence. by this point, i\u2019m purging multiple times a day, every day, and the only thing i\u2019m keeping down is alcohol.\n16, he\u2019s passed away, i begin dating a guy id met at school, and i slowly get sober, but can\u2019t kick bulimia. i also begin other forms of sh, but i wont go into it. but \u201cit\u2019s\u201d also a part of me until age 21. \n\ni just now, finally, have recovered. it was just a mental switch flipped this past june\u2026 it\u2019s also the same time i simultaneously began going to the gym, and learning catholicism/taking classes. i\u2019m sure both played their part in my recovery, but i personally feel i figured out my key to it.\n\nwhen i used to try to receive therapy, they\u2019d ask me what my end goal was. it for years was always \u201ci just want to be content\u2026 okay, fine with myself\u201d\n\nthe day i stopped feeling the need to purge, was the same day i gained a sense of self respect. i have a sense of love for myself, and understanding. all along, i had no respect for myself. reckless as hell. still am, but not that bad. there are many times people say there must be someone watchin out for me with how i got out alive. and im thankful. i\u2019ve had so many second chances in life.. but i can confidently say, ive figured it out. and i\u2019m slowly figuring more out day by day. \n\nbulimia WAS my personality. IT was ME. \n\nrecovery has been so much more than i ever would have expected it to be. i have interests.. hobbies.. personal opinions.. a voice.. i didn\u2019t know that. all i was, was my eating disorder. day in, day out, morning noon and night. don\u2019t forget in your sleep too. \n\nbut yeah. sorry for the big rant. this is the most i\u2019ve ever spoke about my recovery, first time confidently. you\u2019re a big organ wrapped around a lot of other organs, and it\u2019s all pumping and twisting for you. give it some good stuff.\n\nedit: key point to recovery was being single. he and i are still close friends.\nbut being single was necessary for me to finally find an identity beyond what my mind conditioned for myself over half of my life.",

Then, found myself restricting, becoming a bit obsessive with the calories burnt from my workouts, and sure enough, exercising to extremes to try and panicky offset my binges.",
