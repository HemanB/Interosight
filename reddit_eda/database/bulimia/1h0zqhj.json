  "selftext": "I want to preface this post by saying that this isn\u2019t a competition and I honestly have no desire to get into the \u201csick enough\u201d bullshit. Everyone with bulimia is suffering, regardless of how often you engage in behaviours.\n\nI\u2019ve been feeling somewhat alone even in ED spaces because I read about people with families, children, jobs, who are studying etc., and that is so far from my reality. My bulimia takes over my life. I b/p for 6+ hrs of my day and only stop to go and buy (or, shamefully, steal) more food. I have no time or energy for anything else. I have no friends or significant relationships and am on disability payments. My life is my ED. General ED subs seem to be filled with teens who are new to all this and still have lives outside of it, and adult-specific subs seem to be full of people juggling their EDs with having a family and employment or education. I wish I could connect with others with similar experiences to me. It gets so lonely here\u2026\n\nI\u2019m not sure exactly what the point of this post is. I guess I just need to hear that I\u2019m not the only one that\u2019s fallen this far into the hole. Is there anyone else out there with \u201cextreme\u201d bulimia?\n\nEdit: wow, I didn\u2019t expect to see so much solidarity in the comments. Honestly hearing all of you express similar thoughts and describe going through the same tortures as me has left me a little teary. This is such an isolating disorder. The thought of all these people scattered across the world binging and purging on repeat in small rooms and apartments littered with trash, all living the same life\u2026 it makes me so sad. I can only hope that there is a way out.",

Been doing this for seven years straight and it\u2019s finally catching up to me. All the side effects are now showing and I\u2019m only 23. I\u2019ll be lucky to have my teeth if I ever hit 28. This ED has taken almost everything from me and I quite frankly don\u2019t care what happens next to me. It\u2019s sad to say but I\u2019m nothing without bulimia.",

Except even with her we only end up sitting in silence for most of our sessions. It's as though she doesn't even know what to say to me. It truly feels like I'm beyond help.",

          "body": "Thanks, I hope to escape this too some day. I\u2019ve had about 8 years of therapy and countless inpatient stays. The urges are always too strong and I end up sneaking off to buy food, purging in secret, stealing food from the hospital kitchen, the list goes on. I become like a rabid animal when I can\u2019t b/p and I\u2019ll do anything to get my hands on some food. It\u2019s very isolating being surrounded by people with restrictive anorexia. I look the part but I\u2019m hiding this dirty secret.",

          "body": "Considering that you may have exhausted all other options, It might be worth seeing a psychiatrist for anti-psychotic, antidepressant or stimulant medication as you may have an underlying condition that is hindering you from moving forward like depression, anxiety, OCD, bipolar or ADHD etc etc (just a thought, I\u2019m just throwing ideas out there\u2026not offering medical advice at all) if you want to get better, and you\u2019re underweight, you need to put on weight to stop the constant BP voices. When you\u2019re in it that deep, it\u2019s really hard to stop the constant ED chatter. Sometimes medication is a good temporary (or permanent) measure to pull you out of it and stop the mind racing. Don\u2019t give up OP.",

          "body": "I do see a psychiatrist and have tried basically every antidepressant and a ton of antipsychotics. Nothing takes away the urges. I did actually get to trial a stimulant (I have a tentative diagnosis of ADHD - psychiatrist thinks so but I need a formal evaluation). It did work to some extent, at least better than anything else I\u2019ve tried. I\u2019m too underweight now to get back on it but it\u2019s definitely something that I want to try again in the future.\n\nI am very aware that a big contributor to my urges is the fact that I am malnourished and my brain is screaming out for sustenance. The problem is that every time I try a meal plan, or I try to keep food down, I just end up craving it even more. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve opened the gates and a single meal doesn\u2019t satisfy me so I keep going and end up back in the b/p cycle. It\u2019s so hard.",
