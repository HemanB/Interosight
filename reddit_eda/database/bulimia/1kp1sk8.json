  "selftext": "34F and for the past year or so I've been at the worst Ive been in a long time. Generally, I am a fairly clean person who has alot of clutter. There are things everywhere but I vacuum, mop, wipe shit down etc. Lately, depression and a new job with a long commute has had me doing the bare minimum.\n\nWell this weekend I decided I was going to buck up and do a deep clean. Im horrified.\n\nI had to remove a literal ecosysten from my sink drain\n\nI scrubbed my walls a shade lighter (how does it end up everywhere)\n\nI had to use a power brush on my toilet base...Several times. \n\nI know I cant be the only one who struggles with this but Ive had to take 2 cry breaks so far because its just so telling of how bad it is. So if anyone else feels like me know you arent alone!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
