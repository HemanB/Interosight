I\u2019ve also struggled with alcohol in the past as well.  Apparently it\u2019s not unusual for bulimics to have substance misuse issues alongside the eating disorder.  The bulimia has been a massive issue for me though recently, I would say in the past 5 years I\u2019ve barely managed to go a week without B/Ping. I honestly feel like I just can\u2019t stop it no matter how hard I try.  It sucks so bad.   We are all doing our best you know, it\u2019s not like anyone would choose this life.  \n\nAnyway, thanks again for your reply and not that I\u2019m happy to see another Scottish person suffering but it\u2019s also nice to meet another Scot on here, it\u2019s not often it happens ;) xx",

Why can't i just stop this!? But it really is VERY tough. I have battled alcohol problems in the past and have over come them and still have but Bulimia has been the toughest for me. I go periods where i can feel like i am recovering and then whack! Something stressful happens and you reach for the junk food to relieve it.\n\nI am assuming your in Glasgow (Username)? I am only 20 mile along the road if so \ud83d\udc4d\n\nAnyhow. Best of luck with everything. I hope you find some help and get yourself onto a path of health\n\nTake care",
