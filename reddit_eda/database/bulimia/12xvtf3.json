I'd time it, too, and was usually right on time. He'd usually come home to me cleaning the kitchen. Everything spotless- vomit disposed.\n..He caught me mid-purge once when he got home earlier than usual. He didn't see it as I was behind the breakfast bar. I told him not to come closer and he just ran to the bathroom saying \"whatever\"\nHe later admitted to me he knew I was purging in the kitchen when he and the cats were asleep :(\n\n\nSpecial honors goes to my fast food and gas station trips late night after work DAILY. I would buy enough food for 2 sessions. Oh yeah, when I was feeling shamless.. my frequent Walmart trips with cart FULL of shit. Multiple times a week. Sooo embarrassing as employees wherever I went wonder why I buy so much food since I look appear as a nice looking girl in nice clothes. I'm 28.. my car trips started at 20... I watch gas station clerks stare at me when I get to my car, so I don't dare take a bite until I'm on the road, which is hard to do. \n\nSPECIAL THANKS to my frequent trips to the dumpster disposing my puke bucket. Neighbors all around wondering wtf this lady has in a mop bucket \ud83e\udea3 that she can't carry in a single bag. The bag will burst on it's own... I've had it happen in front of a Neighbors apt. \n\nI get funny looks wherever I go unless I'm buying fucking water or like one thing. I hate people.",
