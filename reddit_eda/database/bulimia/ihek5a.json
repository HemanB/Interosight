      "body": "You can do it OP! Yep, the headaches are there. I think not as terrible for me, but it sort of lingers there the whole day which can also get pretty annoying. I'm thinking it's because of the electrolyte imbalance caused by the vomiting. You lose a lot of potassium. Maybe try drinking an electrolyte replenishing drink if it really gets bad for you. We all have good days and bad days and I wish you well on your journey to becoming free of your ED!",

In case you need to hear it, any 'slips' don't invalidate your strength and spirit. You can fight and you are strong. When I was first recovering, I couldn't (initially) go two days without b/p. I had to start with every other day, even if it meant I had a 'Day 1' several times a week. And that's okay.",
