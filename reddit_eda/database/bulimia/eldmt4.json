  "selftext": "Follow up to a previous post. I'm in my 30s, male, and relapsing into bulimia after 12 years healthy. I've been reluctant to get any help because of the sexual side effects I got on Prozac last time I went through this.\n\nBefore I had a chance to talk to my wife about my relapse, she caught me red handed. It was late last night and I thought she was sleeping. We ended up having a huge fight. I know she was upset, but it really hurt that her first response to finding out about my issues was to shout at me. I yelled back and we both brought up a lot of old resentments. I went for a walk to cool off (and finish purging to be honest). When I came back, she apologized and started crying. I cried too, which hurt my pride, but fuck, I feel like I've been bottling up so much and it was almost a relief to finally talk about it.\u00a0\n\nI really wish I had manned up and told her before she found out. Everyone who replied to me last time told me to tell her, but I was too scared and I thought I could get it together before she found out. I feel stupid for not telling her first. I think it would have been less upsetting for both of us and less humiliating for me. But we talked for a long time and I agreed to put my health first. I have an appointment with a new doctor to ask about Prozac and the sexual side effects. I also agreed to go to couple's counseling with my wife. We've both been under a lot of stress and it's hurting our marriage. It's not just my bulimia.\u00a0\n\nI want to be a good husband and a good dad. I've handled this before and I'm going to get a grip on it again. I don't know if it's going to be easier or harder as an adult trying to get support from my wife as it was as a teen with my parents. But I know I have to try.",

Just from the way you expressed yourself in this post, you obviously have a lot of determination to put toward recovery, and that deserves a lot of recognition. I hope your wife can come to a better understanding through couples' therapy. It must be hard for spouses. I'm also married (25F) and I know how much extra strain an ED adds into the mix. It's like fighting two battles at once...trying to recover while keeping your partnership healthy as well, not to mention being a dad. I feel you on Prozac, also. I had the same issues when I was on it. It seems like there are more options these days, so I hope your doc can find you a better fit for medication.\n\n  Reading posts like yours reminds me how hard it is for men with EDs. Allow me to say your struggle is just as valid as anyone else's. Great job getting the medical and therapy support into gear so quickly, and best wishes to you throughout recovery!",

All I can say is you\u2019re not alone, this struggle is real and it isn\u2019t a 16 year old girl problem. That\u2019s great you two are pursuing counseling together, I understand how a stressful and complex life can strain a marriage and bring up ED issues again. I\u2019m struggling having two young kids at home with me, but have a supportive spouse. Hopefully you can be a team together and alleviate some of the triggers.",
