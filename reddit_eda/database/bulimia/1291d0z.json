  "title": "i would give absolutely everything if i could go back in time and stop myself from purging for the first time.",
  "selftext": "i somewhat turned from anorexic into bulimic (i still have times where i only restrict for days or weeks) and i would give ANYTHING to go back. of course i\u2018d prefer recovery but i would stay anorexic for the rest of my life if it\u2018d mean i could stop purging instantly. getting out of this hell seems impossible. from the first time i purged this little voice in the back of my head has appeared and it\u2018ll never go away. how can i forget the knowledge i have now? no matter if i binge or eat one grape.\n\n\"why would u keep ANY food inside when u could simply get rid of it? why would u risk gaining when u know how to prevent it?\"\n\nit doesn\u2019t shut up. it doesn\u2019t leave me alone. it genuinely drives me insane. my health is deteriorating and i\u2018m not sure how much longer i can keep going like this. as suicidal as i may be, i don\u2018t want bulimia to kill me. i just don\u2018t. i don\u2018t want to be found hanging dead over my toilet. but recovery is absolutely terrifying and at this point i\u2018d still rather die than recover and gain weight. i also don\u2018t think i ever CAN. i can\u2018t shut the voice up. i just can\u2018t.\n\nwhat am i supposed to do? every option scares the shit out of me. it\u2018s like i\u2018m trapped in a burning building and every damn escape is on fire. besides one small window but THAT escape would be eternal and nowadays i\u2018m considering it more and more. i\u2018m just so tired. i\u2018m so done fighting when i lnow that i\u2018ll NEVER see myself as skinny and pretty no matter how much weight i lose. i\u2018ll never love myself, i\u2018ll never be happy. what\u2018s the freaking point?",

I (for one) am now about fifteen years free of eating disorders (I say 'about' 15, because it kinda left me gradually rather than abruptly.)\nI understand the lows, the occasional suicide wish, the despair, and the self-loathing. If you can, please keep in mind the future you...that strong person poised somewhere marvellous to you! Never give up on giving up. X",
