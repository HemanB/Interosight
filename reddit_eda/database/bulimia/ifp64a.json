The mind still has to recover though, and as I said before, the average recovery length is eight years; you spend most of that piecing your mind back together. Your mind is pretty much shattered, but you gained weight, so you must be okay! It just makes me so mad.\n\nIt's fully okay to still be struggling; I can't imagine what you've gone through and I'm sorry you're still struggling with this. It may not be much, I hope one day you can abandon this and live a life that's filled with all the love towards yourself that you deserve.",
