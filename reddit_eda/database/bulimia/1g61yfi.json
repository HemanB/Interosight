I woke up one day and was finished with it. I was sick of being sick. Lost all my friends. I was a recluse. Anxious. Depressed.\n\nA year later and I haven't purged in a year. I've reconnected with old friends. I spend time more then ever with my partner. I go out for meals and it doesn't phase me anymore.\n\nI won't lie. Recovery was tough. Those urges are so strong. Every minute of the day. Urges. Cravings. What helped the most was keeping my blood sugar stable. 3 meals and snacks. Never letting myself actually become hungry. If I let myself get hungry I would get horrid urges.\n\nAlso in recovery. Once your body starts to sense more food coming in. It goes crazy and you want to eat thousands of calories. I just gave in alot of the time and enjoyed a binge. You have to stay off your scales. Infact smash those poisonous devices. If your weighing yourself everyday sometimes numerous times then your setting yourself up for failure.\n\nProve this doctor wrong. Get your life back. Just to wake up everyday and feel fresh. No swollen throat. No bloated face. No depression and anxiety. Honestly that's worth it.\n\nI don't crave binges anymore. It's because my body is now nourished. It trusts me again.\n\nYou got this. Prove them wrong \ud83d\udc4d",
