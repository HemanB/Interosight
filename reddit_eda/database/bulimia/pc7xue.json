  "selftext": "So often I cancel plans / outings to purge instead. I could have an active life but for some reason as if I compare hang ing with friends vs binging and purging, binging purging always wins. Its so pathetic. Tonight I'm  supposed to be going to a party but now I'm consumed by the thought of ordering food. I know i have a good time if I go but im probably not going to.",
