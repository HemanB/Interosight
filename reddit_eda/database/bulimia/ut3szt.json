  "selftext": "Just dropping in to say fuck this disorder \ud83d\udc81\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nPost meal bloating is getting slightly better, wanting to scream from not purging is greatly subsiding, and I\u2019m sort of feeling like I can act normally after meals and NOT want to go into the fetal position and cry. What a crazy fucking disorder to cause all this chaos from eating a meal \ud83d\ude43\n\nJust wanted to share and mark the progress - hopefully this helps someone in the desire to stop purging. It has been scary, it has been difficult, but I do think it\u2019s getting less and less taxing. \n\nLove you guys! Wishing you all safe days!",
