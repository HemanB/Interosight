  "selftext": "I'm currently back and forth to the dentist. I'm having to have 6 teeth removed. I need 3 fillings. 1 root canal treatment and 2 of my teeth crowned. I use to have amazing teeth. I always got nice comments about my teeth. Even during being bulimic I tried everything to keep them good. It's impossible. Also. All this damage just seemed to appear so quickly aswell. I genuinely thought I was getting away with it. Nope. Apart from completely destroying my smile it's costing a fortune. I don't binge/Purge anymore but I've still done so much damage. \n\nTry and do everything in your power to stop. This illness isn't as guilt free as some seem to think. My digestive system is also completely destroyed. I had to use drugs and supplements and probiotics to get my digestion working properly again. Your also throwing your potassium levels off also. Not just potassium but every nutrient and vitamin needed to sustain you. I feel alot better since nourishing my body. If your using an anti depressant to try and fix your mental health your probably just lacking the nutrients to sustain your brain chemistry. \n\nThis illness will eventually make you lose everything from your looks to your friends and family. You just become a recluse that hides inside all day just to binge and purge. \n\nRecovering was tough but it can be done. I honestly thought I would never stop and I have. It took discipline and willpower but it can be done. Just gotta accept that you won't feel good until you finally nourish your body. You only get one chance on this planet and this isn't living. \n\nGood luck",

      "body": "Got my first dentist appointment since 2022 in December. Honestly dreading it. Been holding off due to bulimia and the fact my teeth have deteriorated. Even in recovery I'm mega self conscious about my teeth so I completely understand the sentiment behind this post.\n\nI think the problem is is that when you're deep in it you honestly don't care about how it destroys your body. Purging is a compelling behaviour and it tricks your mind in to believing it will help regulate your emotions. It's tricky, I wish everyone could see the light at the end of the tunnel and believe that recovery is so worth it. It can just take people a while to get there.",

We sort of tell ourself's that purging isn't that bad. We tell ourself's that being overweight is much more unhealthy. Carrying some extra fluff is 1000x healthier than being bulimic honestly. This illness isn't spoke about enough by doctors and even online. It's almost hidden.\n\nAre you suffering any issues yet? How is your daily mood? How is your hair skin and nails etc?\n\nWhat scared me was thinking I was getting away with it. I still looked good and it was like a light switch and my body failed so fast. I've also lost 50% of my hair. I need to spray hair fibres on everytime I leave the house.\n\nA horrible illness. I wish everyone could recover but it's a hard process.\n\nHave you ever tried to stop? If so. How did you get on?",

She showed me where all the damage had already started also. I didn't have a clue. I suspect most of us have this happening and have no clue tbh. \n\nIt's not just your teeth. It's your full body it's damaging. Get a bloodwork panel with hormones on it and have a look also. It's every cell of your body getting destroyed.\n\nI honestly thought I wouldn't be able to stop and I did. It's finding what works for you. The first few months are very rough I won't lie. The urges get so strong. Once you fight through them it all disappears. I can eat a meal now and not even finish it. During bulimia I could easily eat 5-7 thousand calories in one sitting. I could never do that now because my body is nourished and my satiety signals have returned.\n\nJust gotta battle that first part and then get into a routine and never let yourself start to slip again.",
