  "selftext": "It\u2019s been a long hard road trying to get to this point. I never thought that I would ever be able to even go a day or even a meal without puking.\n\nFor the last 7 years of my life I have puked at least once a day, on my worst days getting all the way up to 6 or 7.\n\nFrom being hospitalized more times than I can count, going into cardiac arrest twice, losing several teeth, losing a toe due to complications of my type one diabetes bc of my lack of control of my blood sugars from binging, isolating myself from all of my friends, not dating or having sex in 7 years, not having a period in 7 years, to literally sitting on the floor next to a toilet filled with my own puke, crying and wishing for it all to just stop. I am here to tell you that it is possible. Even when you have lost all hope, all purpose, all of your fight, keep trying. Keep fighting. \n\nRecovery is a bitch, literally the amount of times I have almost shit my pants and have actually shit my pants is insane, my digestive system is so screwed up, but everyday it gets better and everyday gets a little bit easier, and everyday I get stronger. My will to live grows every single day. I have hobbies again, I have energy again, I am excited about the future again. I have dreams again.\n\nKeep fighting, I promise you if I can do it, so can you. I never thought it was possible, I thought this would be the thing to take me out and now I\u2019m kicking it\u2019s ass. I believe in every single one of you.",

The cardiac arrests put me in a coma and in a ventilator for a week. But even after that I didn\u2019t stop. The power to stop does not come from an external force, it truly does come from inside. One day I literally just decided I was done, I decided that I was strong enough to do it and even though I knew that i wasn\u2019t, you really just gotta fake it till you make it and eventually what you believe will become your reality.\n\nThere is no concrete way to overcome it and I am still figuring it out myself. What\u2019s really helped is medication for my anxiety and depression, it has made such a huge difference in my mental health. Setting small goals rather than large, overwhelming ones. Each day is a victory with me, everyday I make a tally mark on my mirror to show myself how far I\u2019ve come and I can constantly look at it whenever I get the urge or feel bad about myself. Five years b/p free may seem like such an intimidating and unattainable goal, but being able to at least keep your dinner down seems much easier and much more attainable. \n\nI also just had to do it cold turkey. I couldn\u2019t be like \u201cI\u2019ll only do it today\u201d bc once I start I can\u2019t stop and I will continue to make excuses.\n\nThis is what has worked for me, it might not work for everyone but I hope that maybe you\u2019ll find this helpful.\n\nJust remember even when you think you can\u2019t, YOU CAN. We can be each other\u2019s cheerleaders. You can do it.",
