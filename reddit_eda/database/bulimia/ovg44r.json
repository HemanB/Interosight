You may see anorexics as having such great self-control to not eat and to fast but actually they don't have the control to eat at all. They literally cannot make themselves consume foods and they black out in public because they spent 2 hours staring at oatmeal before deciding they couldn't eat a single bite. \n\nWhat I can say, having had both, is bulimia is so much lonelier. It's not glamorized. There's no big pro-mia community. Purging is \"gross\" and bingeing makes you feel like a failure or like a pig. At least that's how I felt. \n\nNeither situation is permanent or hopeless though. I went from freshman year, constantly blacking out and having to be carried to the nurse and revived with orange juice in saltines, to senior year, wasting literally 10 hours a day binging and purging and failing all my classes, and now in my 20s I don't really think about food much anymore and I'm a healthy weight.",

Anorexia is cheaper, less bad for you teeth and throat. Bulimia still gives me energy enough to workout and function (with anorexia you live in constant fog), I can eat normal now with friends and family (so no purging).\n\nBulimia for me came after I disliked the weight gain after doctor and parents told me that I got to skinny. Its at this point sort of a hobby, which is bad. But as we say in Dutch, if you cant as it must, it must as you can - if that makes any sense ;). You can get some control of bulimia by planning your b/p. Dont stress about one sandwich, allow yourself to be normal on one day and be an idiot on the other. I wouldnt suggest going the other way.",

I also did therapy for a year when I was 18, but sadly I was very young and didn\u2019t take full advantage of it, so I didn\u2019t really benefit there. I think I just hit rock bottom one day. I was in physical pain, afraid of doing damage to my teeth (I\u2019ve always received compliments on them, so my body dysmorphia was in full force there - not a great reason to overcome an eating disorder, but just being honest. It was part of it), etc. I also worked out while being bulimic, but it wasn\u2019t a lifestyle thing. Now I eat healthy during the week with some treats, do cardio + weight training 6-7 days a week and just fully embrace the healthy/active lifestyle. I still have days where my BD rules me and I\u2019m tempted to backslide, but I can usually talk myself through those thoughts and get out of the mindset. The worst that has happened so far is me having a meltdown/beating myself up for a bit. Recovery is definitely not an overnight thing, but it\u2019s possible. Just takes hard work. I\u2019m still trying to master the mental aspect, but haven\u2019t gotten it just yet. :)",
