I know this is about bulimia, and I have had that too, but one thing that has really helped me in my recovery journey is growing the ability to \u201cwaste food.\u201d Meaning I don\u2019t HAVE to finish everything on my plate if I am full. \n\nI heard a woman once talk about how our bodies are not trash cans. If we are putting food in it once we are full we are treating it like that. If you put the extra food in the trash or in your body, either way the starving kids in Africa are not getting it. It\u2019s okay to not eat everything <3",
