  "selftext": "It\u2019s one hour until Christmas in my country and I feel a bit sad since right now all I can think about is all the food there will be tomorrow that I can binge on. It\u2019s just so crazy to me because I feel like a little kid excited for Christmas I\u2019m so excited for all the binge food that I won\u2019t have to eat in secret and can have for free all day long. It\u2019s kind of making me sad just because as a child I used to feel like this, but I was excited about waking up to presents and now I\u2019m excited to binge eat :/ \n\nI\u2019ve pre planned a few ways to purge at different times of the day, but I am having some weird thoughts related to it. I\u2019ve been on a really good streak with b/p lately and my binges have become less frequent and more manageable along with purging of course. We had a few treats tonight for Christmas Eve which I binged and then went off and purged but now since I have broken the habit a bit, it didn\u2019t feel so good to do it. Even the binging was something that I kind of forced myself to do and I didn\u2019t even want a lot of what I was eating. Then when I purged I found it super unsatisfactory. I guess that\u2019s a really good sign in terms of recovery so I feel good about it. But at the same time why am I so excited to binge eat tomorrow? I just don\u2019t understand how I can be in such a good place yet food is still controlling me and my feelings around such a special time of the year.",

      "body": "I guess you associate Christmas as a holiday to just let yourself go, treat yourself and because of that, it\u2019s like you can justify binging and purging. \u201cEveryone else around me is gonna eat more than usual so why can\u2019t I?\u201d kinda thing.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re feeling like this. I think, try and plan your day tomorrow by also thinking of what other things you might do? Maybe go for a walk with your dog/ family/ friends, plan a get together game time in the evening... Things that will get you away from the kitchen and the food essentially. \n\nIt\u2019s hard, it really is, so please don\u2019t make yourself miserable. Baby steps. If you can manage to get your mind off of it tomorrow for a bit, see that as an accomplishment. Also, feel free to dm me if you need to reach out to someone. x",

Try to understand that even if you eat a little more that you don\u2019t necessarily need to purge. \n\nI agree with u/cath1212 with the holiday association, you just need to find things to get your mind off of purging. That can be hard sometimes. Movies help me, but sometimes I feel I really need to vent about all the feelings that wanting to purge bring me, for that you can contact either of us! \n\nYou\u2019re not alone in your recovery ! I hope you have the best holidays !",
