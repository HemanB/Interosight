The impulsive behavior from ADHD stems from lack of dopamine, so the search is constantly happening. Binging and purging create dopamine\u2026so anyway, they are often comorbid.

I think about it like flipping it around. It'd be like telling a heroin addict \"ok, this is clearly fucking up your life in a lot of different ways but you also need it to live. You have to learn how to do *juuuuust the right amount* of heroin. Don't do it too much because that's really bad but you also can't stop consuming it because you will literally die.\"",
