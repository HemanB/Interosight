The waiters do not clean the bathroom, they have the janitors do it. I do clean up my purges afterwards because I hate leaving a mess for the next person\u2026\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nI was bp in one restaurant and wasn\u2019t satisfied, so i went to another one to bp\u2026\n\nIt turns out the waiters knew each other and said i was eating a lot in the first restaurant \n\nSo the waitress in the second restaurant came up to me and said \u201cwe know you bp. We know waiters from the first restaurant and there\u2019s no way a person can each that much\u201d\nThey also showed me a list of food i ordered\u2026 Shame on me\n\nI\u2019m now so ashamed of myself, i paid, dashed out of the door and began crying. I hate this illness, i hate this so much, i hate everything about myself. I don\u2019t even know myself anymore \n\nAt this point, I\u2019m pretty sure all the restaurants i go to all knows i bp\u2026",

They should have approached it more gently and less accusatory, though, imo.

They also didn\u2019t comment on the bathroom condition but rather how much she *ate*. I know all places are ran different, but I guarantee it wasn\u2019t the worst thing they cleaned or smelled in a bathroom while working there, lol. Would they ask someone to leave if they had diarrhea?? Most people have the decency to clean up after themselves when they use the facilities, too. OP doesn\u2019t sound like the type of person who purposefully leave a mess, but I guess there\u2019s no way of knowing for sure. I\u2019m the type of person who hates to use public bathrooms for anything but peeing & washing hands, but when I can\u2019t wait, I never leave a mess.",
