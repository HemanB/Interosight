I\u2019ve gained a lot of weight but I NEVER thought I\u2019d see the day when food was uninteresting. That day has come. I\u2019ve been in recovery for the past 6 months and I can tell you, you need help and support. I had an eating disorder coach. This WAS NOT easy. Trusting my body to go where it wants to go without my suppression of weight. I binged, purged, abused laxatives and over exercised so my body has a lot of healing to do. Please check out this blog post for encouraging, inspiring support:\n\nhttps://www.inwardlyrenewed.com\n\nAlso please watch YouTube videos by Kayla Rose, Follow the Intuition, and Tabitha Farrar. Watching videos by Kayla Rose gave me the courage to pursue \u201call-in\u201d recovery. Peace & blessings to you. You CAN do this!",
