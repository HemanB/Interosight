  "selftext": "My mood has more or less improved, I have more energy and I'm less fatigued, my skin has cleared up and I don't smell like vomit all the time. I now have enough energy to have a part time job and the brain fog from restriction is pretty much gone which makes school 10 times easier. I feel so good, better than I have been in a year and I'm so so happy.\n\nI wish I could tell people irl but I will share with you guys instead :) this is a very helpful community and I'm grateful for the continued support",
