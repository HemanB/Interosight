You're not really sure how it's being kept from falling by such a thin string or what the string is even attached to, but the focus is on the pain of the string digging into your skin to try to keep you from grabbing at anything.

I rendered them in a cartoonish style to show the way that food virtually abstracts itself and doesn't feel real during a binge. The realistic hand and severed fingers are a reference to The Creation of Adam, which is historically meant to symbolize humanity. But the cut fingers, gruesome and confusing, are meant to fracture the classic depiction of humanity. The blood dripping from the skin and onto the donuts is supposed to look almost similar to the glazing of the donuts, to show how food and flesh become one during a binge.\n\nThe middle is kind of a mix of everything! I was inspired by Saturn Devouring his Children, except here it's kind of me devouring myself, or the image of myself that I want to get to. It's meant to show the illogical irony behind mutilating the body that you're working toward achieving. I tried doing some crazy things to the figure, like spiraling it apart and melting the skin, to show how it's nearly impossible to feel sympathy for a body that has been put through so much - exaggerated dramatism to paint a sick kind of hopeless humor.\n\nHope that helped; have a wonderful day!",

The middle one related to me the most; I often get so frustrated with the daily \"should I, shouldn't I?\" debate that I end up winding myself up so much I just end up hating myself. When I'm restricting I feel like my stomach is eating itself sometimes and it can be quite a pleasant feeling. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wanna take art classes so I can better put what I feel down.
