  "selftext": "I wanted to share this with people I know and that care about my journey on my social medias, but every time I say anything about my ED on insta I get reported, good or bad, I get that stupid \u201cyou have a friend who cares\u201d. Last Thursday was 10 weeks and I was so freaking proud and my picture got reported. It\u2019s so sad because my post was just me being happy about all the positive changes I\u2019ve made and how it\u2019s been 10 weeks, so I don\u2019t understand. But I figured you guys would be way more understanding. I\u2019ve had some days where I\u2019ve wanted to relapse to punish myself. Self harm feelings have also been strong, but I haven\u2019t given in, and I don\u2019t plan too. I\u2019m going to try getting back on my meds that help with feelings of self harm and hopefully that will help. I hope you are all doing well and staying as strong as you can. So much love and hugs to you guys! \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96",

I go swimming a lot during the day (which is also a healthy exercise), I play a lot of video games, play and take care of my pets(they\u2019re one of my biggest reasons I\u2019m making change. I was getting really sick again and didn\u2019t want to go to a live in clinic because I didn\u2019t want to be away from my pets.  I basically would lay in bed at night with my phone listing reasons I wanted to keep mia in my life or why it had to go. The list of reasons it had to go were wayyy longer. Recognizing the things that make you happy and are worth living for really helps. The rate I was using my illness as a crutch was really bad and I also knew besides me it was hurting a lot of people in my life. Doing art really helps too, because when I do the art that I do, it\u2019s really time consuming and takes up all your brain use. One other thing is I\u2019m always using my money on more important stuff so I can\u2019t afford to spend $50 a month on laxatives like I used to, and not having them means I can\u2019t use them. TLDR: find anything in your life that makes life worth it to be healthy and happy! Keep yourself distracted with your favorite things in life. It seems like bullshit but it might work for you! \ud83d\udc96 I wish you nothing but the best on your journey to make yourself better. It takes time and patients but it\u2019s so worth it when you are in recovery and feel better not only mentally but physically!",
