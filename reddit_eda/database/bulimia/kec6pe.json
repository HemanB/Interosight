  "selftext": "This year alone I\u2019ve lost 60lbs. Only recently I\u2019ve opened up about my ED (which is severe restrictive bulimia). My parents know, therapist, and two friends. I still don\u2019t recognize that my body has changed. When I look at pictures or videos of myself that I\u2019ve taken, I can see that I look different, but when I\u2019m looking in the mirror I don\u2019t recognize the physical changes. Is this just how it is? In my mind, I tell myself that once I\u2019m down to xxx pounds I\u2019ll \u201cstop\u201d the purging at least. I think I\u2019ll have restrictive tendencies for a while bc my stomach can\u2019t handle all the calories I should be consuming daily. \n\nWill I have this dysmorphia forever? When I\u2019m down to xxx pounds will it keep going? I guess that\u2019s what scares me, withering away to nothing because even at a healthy weight I\u2019ll still feel fat. \n\nThis is scary, ED\u2019s are scary.",
