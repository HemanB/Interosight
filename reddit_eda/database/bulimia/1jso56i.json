  "selftext": "In the end of November I was admitted to hospital. Then my ed consumed me whole and my bmi was so life threathing low that doctor told me that it\u2019s only about luck if I\u2019ll make it.\n\nI did make it! I was in the hospital over 3months I gained 12kg and I was hopefull about my future.\n\nI relapsed right away, because of many triggers regarding my past. I was scared everyone will leave me if they found out. So I\u2019ve only been honest to my doctor, nurses and boyfriend.\n\nThis week My doctor told me, even now 4kg heavier than in November. I\u2019m more closer to death. This week I spent 3days and 2nights at emergency room. They asked there if I\u2019ll be willing to another admission but i declined.\n\nI was once again dicarged and continued to binge and purge about >!8-10k!< calories a day. I can feel my body literally shutting down Idk how to explain it. But something is wrong. Should I go to back to emergency room? I really don\u2019t want to. I have a feeling I\u2019m gonna die head in the toilet style. Maybe not in next weeks. But Idk how long my body can take. Maybe a month? \n\nI need help, I\u2019m just really bad at asking for it. And it feels impossible to let my ed go. \n ",

I had to just be willing to let go of how I wanted to control food and my body.
