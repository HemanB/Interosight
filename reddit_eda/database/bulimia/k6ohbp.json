  "selftext": "When I was anorexic I idolised bulimia. I was jealous that I couldn\u2019t purge, I wanted to be able to eat and get rid of it. I wanted the safety of a security net like that. \n\nNow that I\u2019m bulimic I idolise anorexia more than anything. I hate myself for not being able to be that way again because that was true control, not this. I miss feeling good at something, I miss feelings small. \n\nIt\u2019s like nothing is ever good enough. Its like I\u2019m constantly searching for some kind of a pattern or plan that makes me feel secure and safe and in control but nothing is ever good enough. Nothing ever makes me like myself more, if anything I like myself less. I tear myself apart because I idolise what I don\u2019t have. I\u2019m trying to find balance but can\u2019t. At the end of the day I just want to be anything but myself. \nThis all started because I wanted one thing that I could like about myself but I never found it and that breaks my heart.",

It was obnoxious and really sad and the weight loss rly never was enough. I rly thought i was huge and always uncomfortable. \n\nHowever back then i thought i was weak for not being able to purge lmao how the turntables",

Like the reality of both are awful and deadly, but people are so much more prepared to talk about anorexia. No one in my life is prepared to talk about all the nastiness that is bulimia. Hiding bags of vomit, fishing chunks of partially digested food from drains, permanent puke breath, plus all the shit I got for wasting money on food that literally gets flushed down the toilet. it's disgusting, and no one wants to talk or hear about it.",

(And especially so if maybe they are still missing something critical and essential that is in some perhaps more 'real', if less 'safe', foods and so they do not properly sate a hunger and one maybe has even more tendency to just continue to eat and eat and eat. (And then maybe even *still* not 'frow, because the 'food' is \"safe\".)\n\n(And then maybe even get sunk into almost an anorexic-style, still-even-partially-starving, form of even almost pica-esc BED\\*. And maybe this does not have a risk of happening to all types of attempting-to-recover hungry anorexics, but it certainly has at least happened to me.)\n\nEdit 2:\n\n\\* (And that's not to say, that perhaps some more typical sufferers of true, 'real food' BED, maybe aren't also starving of one/some dietarily scarce, essential micronutrients, and are simply lacking in any actually decent options for truly satisfying it.)",
