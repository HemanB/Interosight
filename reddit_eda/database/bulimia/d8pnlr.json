I have a few sites you can check out:   \n\n\n[Junior Scientist Power Hour](http://www.jspowerhour.com/) is my humor site, but I retired it earlier this year. There'll still be some occasional updates moving forward but they will almost exclusively journos from my Patreon.  \n\n\n[The Last Halloween](https://www.last-halloween.com/) is an ongoing horror adventure comic that I've been working on for quite a while! It's a three book series and it's currently partway through book 2.  \n\n\nIf you're looking for journal comics, I post them to my [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/abbyhoward), and then eventually share them to JSPH.  \n\n\nI also have a [portfolio site](https://abbyhowardart.myportfolio.com/) that contains links to all of the above and other projects!",
