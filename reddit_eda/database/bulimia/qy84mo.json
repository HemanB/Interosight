  "selftext": "I have been vomiting for 10 years almost every day, but today I celebrate 45 days without bulimia.  This is my best result and I continue to hold on!  I eat whatever I want and I don't overeat.  I just wanted to share it, because no one in my environment understands this. I dream of never doing this again, but sometimes it's so hard. I can induce vomiting very quickly and that is my curse, it would be better if I can't do it.",
