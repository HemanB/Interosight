  "selftext": "It is 5 30 pm and I have not binged or purged.  This is HUGE for me. I almost went home after school with a binge triggered in my mind, but instead I went on a walk and got coffee at Panera, I also read a book I've started. \n\nI'm at work and my mom is bringing me dinner soon. Healthy food too, lots of protien and vitamins. \n\nI also went to the doctor with my mom and got prescribed prozac and cognitive therapy for my bulimia today. I'm going to live my life freely, every day I'm steps closer to healthy living. \n\nAlso thanks to all the comments and support from everyone on my recent posts.",

And it keeps getting better too, especially when the face swelling goes away and I dont feel bloated!\n\nHope you can keep up the progress :)",
