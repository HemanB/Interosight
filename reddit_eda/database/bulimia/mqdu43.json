Plus I keep getting super fixated on certain foods and can\u2019t stop thinking about them, atm that\u2019s pancakes. I feel crap, I\u2019m exhausted and I don\u2019t know how to regain control. Any advice appreciated. \u2764\ufe0f",

That lasted till yesterday (so 10 days daily b/p). \n\nToday I finally broke the cycle, from today I'm back to my usual diet and I know that I won't be binging again.\n\nWhat helped me is serious talk with myself, going deep in to my brain. Figuring out that I'm actually depressed and lonely right now and I'm just filling that hole with food. Of course I'm still depressed and lonely but from today I won't be a slave of my own stomach.\n\nI remember how awful I feel after a binge. No matter how hard I crave something the craving doesn't feel as bad as purging after a binge.\n\nTry to eat not processed food and cook for yourself. After that just eat while thinking how that food makes you feel. Try to eat in kitchen, not in from of tv. Try to appreciate the healthy food you're eating. Stay strong.",
