  "selftext": "...people complimenting you on your weight loss when you KNOW it only happened because you are destroying your gut. I had a surge in my purging 2 years ago where I must have lost 50-60 pounds in a matter of a months from binge purge cycles alone while away for college. I had no idea, I still saw myself as \u201cbig.\u201d Returning home for a family wedding was a wake up call. People who I had not seen in months showered me with compliments and searched for answers to how I got so thin. It was confusing... I felt shame for treating my body so poorly but a slight feel of accomplishment knowing I did what I wanted without anyone noticing; to be smaller in other\u2019s eyes. This was the kick that made me really get into self awareness and recovery. Also I gained an awareness of just how much (women in particular) people comment on other people\u2019s bodies. I make an effort to compliment people now on their personalities and actions. I think those compliments last longer. \n\nThought opinions personal stories?",

      "body": "I totally relate to this; the fact is the people commenting on the weight loss don't even realise that their comments are just reinforcing the behaviours and it creates this toxic loop that nobody can break out of.\n\nThis is slightly unrelated but there is new advice on how we should compliment young girls. For example, you're less likely to compliment a young boy's outfit/hair as soon as you see them, so why say it to a girl? You should compliment what they have achieved and what they like and only compliment their clothes if they bring it up or later on because it stresses that what they look like isn't the most important thing about them; their actions and achievements are. I know it's only a little step and I dont know how many people are utelising this concept but it is a step in the right direcetion :)",

      "body": "I am bombarded almost constantly with comments like this. My coworkers, friends, people who work at stores that I go to every month or so. Congratulations and praise about how much weight I've lost and how good I look, how healthy I look. Of course, I don't blame a single one of them in any way, they have no idea what's happening. But it's always odd for me, that's the only word I can think of to describe how I feel. I know what I'm doing - and what I'm not doing - is bad and is hurting me. But with so much praise and love and attention, how can we resist the temptation? Finally, someone is acknowledging my body in a positive light. I'm so pretty! I'm so thin! And I know exactly how I got here; all my hard work is paying off. It's making it feel worth it, to torture myself and hurt myself. The damage my ED is doing isn't even part of the equation anymore; I just don't care. \n\nI think going out of your way to focus on the actions of people and compliment those is absolutely the right thing to do, try to shift the focus from physical things to just the way people are. Hopefully if we put that energy out, it will come back our way. Sorry for rambling, but the incessant comments about my body are both an enormous blessing and an awful curse. You are not by yourself in this. None of us are.",

I'm a legit healthy weight now (like 19 bmi) and was able to undo some of the damage. But damn...I still get comments from those who knew me then on why I gained weight, especially older men. I've learned to make it uncomfortable for them and directly say bulimia. Shuts that down real quick. I hate how society doesn't know what healthy looks like.",
