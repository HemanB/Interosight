  "selftext": "we all have our lowest points, so let me share mine. i got caught stealing binge food 4 times at this point. the last one however was the most tragically iconic. i left the store with a full bag of unpaid groceries, noticed someone following me and RAN for my dear life. i was trying to escape into the nearby forest but\na) i had HEELS\nb) i had a LONG FUCKING COAT\nc) some guy standing on my way caugt me\n\nanyways the rest was pretty ususal - owners asking me why and speculating i was a junkie, calling the cops, calling my mom. i cried so hard for those 2hrs, my mom made a deal with those owners to not report me and paid them around 300 dollars. we went back home with my \"groceries\"\n\nguess what i did when we came back\n\nI BINGED AND PURGED THEM WHILE MY MOTHER WAS CRYING.\n\ni know this story is not the most extreme out there but you gotta admit this is something\n\n(i had a manic episode during that time btw)",
