  "selftext": "So I was midway through a purge, and my kitten was in the bathroom with me as always (she always has to be in the bathroom with me and follows me everywhere I go in the house, she is currently under the covers at my feet in the bed), and all of a sudden she hops into my lap (I was seated, won\u2019t go into detail for tw purposes). I was taken aback, and just kinda stared at her, snot pouring out of my nose, tears running down my face. And...I stopped? It was so startling like, I just wasn\u2019t gonna purge with her on my lap but I didn\u2019t want to make her move? Anyway, I wanted to share with you guys, I hope everyone is hanging in there. \u2764\ufe0f",
