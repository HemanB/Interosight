      "body": "I was in a small shared flat with my family for a holiday, and I had eaten myself sick on cheese. When everyone was asleep I got up and purged into a bag in a dark storage cupboard because it was the only place where I wouldn\u2019t wake anyone. The smell was rancid, and there were several litres of vomit in the bag. It was so heavy it leaked when I lifted it. I had to sneak another larger bag to put it into before it split completely. It was around 2am at this point, and bear in mind we\u2019re staying in a mountain village in the middle of winter. I then stole out of the flat in my (pretty light) pyjamas and wandered barefoot around a strange town in a foreign country at the dead of night in freezing temperatures looking for a place to dispose of my sack of vomit. I will never forget that night.",

      "body": "I\u2019ve been pretty lucky with my health in that I haven\u2019t had any major health scares- but purging has humiliated me beyond belief sooo many times. \n\nOne of the worst times was in college, when I had a communal bathroom where I often got walked in on when purging in. My solution was to purge in my room (my roommate was abroad that semester). In order to do it, I would purge into a garbage bag and then throw it in the trash can in the hallway. I thought I was fine, until my ENTIRE dorm (3 floors and hundreds of students) got an email from admin describing the \u201cconcerningly large amounts of vomit\u201d (actual quote) they were finding in the hallway. Immediately I stopped, but the email got reposted on our school\u2019s barstool and everyone was talking about it for weeks. \n\nIf that wasn\u2019t bad enough, the worst was yet to come. I went back to using the bathroom, but the toilets were weird so sometimes 2 flushes weren\u2019t enough but I couldn\u2019t keep flushing them because they wouldn\u2019t fill up fast enough to flush again completely so sometimes there would be stuff left behind but our bathrooms were cleaned daily and my ED- mangled brain thought it would go unnoticed or would be chalked up to college kids partying too hard. I didn\u2019t think much of it, until months later when my class dean (who had met with me on a couple occasions because of unspecified concerns over my well-being) accidentally forwarded me an email chain between a bunch of admin, custodial staff and other staff at the school. The email was documenting every single time that they had found vomit in the trashcans (detailing the # of bags, amount of vomit, and the time), and anytime they had found residue of vomit in or around any bathroom in my building, or report of a student getting sick there (also with the date, and any other details about the incident). It went back MONTHS and I was pretty sick at that time so you can imagine how many days and times that included. Also within this email chain, they stated my name as being the suspected student responsible based on a report from my RA and their tracking of residents entering and leaving the building with their keycards. The chain included a discussion of whether or not I should face disciplinary action but luckily, the dean advocated against it and suggested she meet with me again before they pursued any actions, to discuss concerns over my weight/health and address the situation that way. I cannot express the utter humiliation I felt. I\u2019ve never been so mortified in my entire life, & I felt terrible for the impact my selfish actions had on the janitorial staff. The dean quickly sent me a follow up telling me to disregard & delete the email because she sent it by mistake, but obviously the damage was done. I didn\u2019t face any disciplinary actions, but I also ended up confessing everything to her and agreeing to meet with the school\u2019s nutritionist, and a therapist weekly because i knew that was probably the only way to take responsibility for everything I did. I also majorly changed my approach to covering up/cleaning my b/p episodes, bc even though I wasn\u2019t ready for recovery, I def couldn\u2019t allow the janitors to clean up my mess ever again. I ended up becoming super close to the dean & I almost think she sent me the email on purpose so I was aware of the seriousness of the situation but I\u2019ll never really know for sure. \n\nThat was only my sophomore year and for the rest of my college experience, I felt so ashamed and was paranoid that everyone who worked for the school knew who I was & what I did. I never told any of my friends about it, even after we graduated because of how ashamed I was. \n\nDef keep that in mind when you feel like you want to purge, bc sometimes your Ed can make the damage to your physical and mental health seem insignificant, but maybe the added potential social annihilation will discourage you\n\nif I had known that could happen, I would\u2019ve avoided the worst experience of my life.",

I had just ended a 7 day fast and binged with the intent of purging. I didn\u2019t even eat that much and still am not positive of what happened but I had the absolute worst stomach and chest pains of my life. I could t stand straight. Still tried to purge.

I have flashbacks to this more than I\u2019d like to admit. I\u2019ve never shared this story with anyone before. \n\nMost embarrassing was definitely when I was at a friends house and didn\u2019t want to purge in her place so I went outside to the parking lot to throw up in a trash bag. I thought I was hidden between cars and a half-wall, and when I was done purging I looked up to see people sitting in a car staring at me. I just looked away as fast as I could, threw my bag in the dumpster and ran away. I still feel so guilty about that, on so many levels. \n\nScariest times were all the times I really thought I was having a heart attack, but \u201clucky\u201d for me it turned out to be strained intercostal muscles. \n\nThe worst part is that I\u2019ve been purge-free for 7 years and my body will still kind of start to purge on its own if I am stressed and have food in me. How can I blame my body, though, when I betrayed her for so long? I just do all I can to make the right choices every day. \n\nFWIW my treatment was very\u2026DIYish and all outpatient, and I sometimes wish I took the offers for inpatient when I had the chance.",

Curiosity and a deep sense of dread pushed Sarah to investigate. She tiptoed down the hallway, the wooden floorboards creaking under her feet.\n\nAs she approached the kitchen, the voice grew louder, more insistent. \u201cSarah, come here.\u201d\n\nWhen she reached the doorway, she saw her grandmother standing by the stove, just as she had in life. But something was off\u2014her skin was too pale, her smile too wide.\n\n\u201cGrandma?\u201d Sarah whispered.\n\nThe figure turned slowly, its eyes black and hollow. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come, Sarah.\u201d\n\nBefore she could scream, everything went dark.\n\nThe next morning, Sarah\u2019s family found the kitchen empty, except for the old rocking chair, gently swaying back and forth.

      "body": "The storm hit the small fishing village with a vengeance, sending waves crashing against the cliffs and winds howling through the narrow streets. Daniel, a seasoned fisherman, had never seen anything like it. He was alone on his boat, far from shore, struggling to keep it from capsizing. The sea was merciless, and every wave felt like a punch, each one stronger than the last.\n\nAs he fought to steer the boat, Daniel caught sight of something in the water. At first, he thought it was just debris, but then it moved against the current. A dark shape, large and menacing, circled the boat. His heart pounded as the realization set in\u2014it wasn\u2019t debris. It was something alive.\n\nSuddenly, the boat jolted, nearly throwing him overboard. The creature had rammed the hull. Daniel scrambled for the harpoon, but another hit knocked him off balance. He fell hard, gasping as icy water surged over the deck.\n\nThe shape rose from the depths, and for a moment, Daniel saw it clearly. A massive, serpentine body, scales glistening in the lightning flashes, and eyes\u2014intelligent, ancient eyes\u2014staring straight at him. It reared up, and in that split second, Daniel knew he was facing something beyond human understanding, something the sea had kept hidden for centuries.\n\nThe boat lurched again, and this time, it didn\u2019t recover. The last thing Daniel saw before he was swallowed by the waves was the creature diving back into the abyss, dragging the boat down with it. Silence followed, save for the storm\u2019s roar, as if the sea itself had closed over the horror it had unleashed.\n\nBy dawn, the storm had passed, and the villagers found the wreckage washed up on the shore. But of Daniel, there was no sign. Only the twisted remains of his boat and the deep gouges in the wood hinted at the nightmare he had faced. The sea was calm again, deceptively peaceful, as if nothing had ever happened. But the villagers knew better. They had seen the marks and the look in the eyes of those who had gone too far out and returned with stories no one believed.\n\nNo one ventured far from shore after that. And at night, when the wind howled and the waves crashed against the cliffs, they locked their doors and whispered prayers, hoping the sea would keep its secrets buried deep.",

When I started high school I was very cautious of the time because I had to get up earlier than I would normally and I would always wake up in the middle of the night and would check my phone to see what time it was. This one night the same thing happened and I checked the time. I can't remember but I think it was about 4am. I went to turn over but heard shouting outside that sounded to be right at the top of the road outside my house. I opened my curtains and stared down the road and vaguely saw 2 or 3 people beating the life out of some other guy. I could hear him screaming for his life and I just sit there staring waiting for it to be over. When It was over I could see them clearly leaving the guy on the road most likely dead. It was then I heard my dad getting up for work because he gets up really early and I ran out to him telling him to look out the window. He looked out and there was nothing there. I couldn't believe it. It was like something out of a horror movie he had just vanished. I was absolutely sure he was there. My dad and mom never believed me but I know it happened.",

At the time my grandma lived with us and didn't have a very good relationship with my mother, and they were fighting when I decided to play. I grabbed two glowsticks from my bedroom and handed one to my brother, and it wasn't even dark, it just made it a bit scarier!\n\n I forgot to add that I'm the kid to listen to horror stories when I sleep, I just love the extra adrenaline rush! Anyway, of course I was it, so I counted to 60 and went on my way! My Grandma's room was off limits and my Mom didn't really care if we went in her room, so I checked in there first. (He wasn't there) So I went to my room next. Now to get the next part you're going to have to understand the lay out of my room. The door you walk through has a TV on the same wall to the right of you, on the right wall there was a bunkbed, in front of you another bunk bed, and to your left a bathroom.\n\nI walked into my room and my brother was obviously behind the TV, although what I saw next was the scariest thing I have ever seen in my life, and no I'm not schizophrenic! There was a head at the top of the bathroom doorway, it had a long neck and long hair, but I was more focused on getting out of there! Even though I was about to shit my pants I knew I had to get my crying brother out of the room, so I grabbed his arm and left the room! And yeah i slept in the living room that night and never saw that... Thing ever again!",

The next day I woke up and I realized I knew when I would die how and how others would so my best friend would die in a day from a car accident so I told him to stay in his house and he Listened. so then told the doctors the cure to cancer and it worked but the government needed to keep that classified I don\u2019t know why but they did.\n\nAnyway after I got a call from my best friend due to unknown causes he was perfect fine and in tip top shape. I guess he was just meant to die that day and i didn\u2019t even know for some reason.\n\nSo I was basically just a normal person and I decided to keep my power to myself unless there would be a situation that I could help with.

I guess my powers also gave me social skills too?\n\nAnyway we are all in an old warehouse keep in mind there is like 200 people in my town so it wasn\u2019t super crowded but then we were resting. Then I heard blood curdling screams of people asking for help I went over there and this guy was slumped over dead and people are dying left and right I just curl up in a ball in the corner and I ball my eyes out.  finally it all stopped.\n\nI look around they are all dead now I am starting to fade.",

I wear loose clothes, make my own food, and another thing that helps me is verbalizing my anxiety. Saying out loud \"i feel fat and disgusting. Eating this is hard,\" helps. But you have to counteract it with like \"yeah this cheese has fat, but the spinach has a lot of fiber and is nutritious,\" \"the starbucks barista would not sabotage me by adding cream to my drink cause she doesn't care enough to do that,\" and \"you can't work tomorrow if you take 100 laxatives tonight, cause you'll be vomiting.\"",
