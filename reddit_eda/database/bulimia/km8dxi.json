  "selftext": "so today its been 83 days since my last purge (sorry i know thats an unsatisfying number to celebrate haha). i no longer think about food constantly or have food control my life. i dont overeat and i dont feel guilty after a meal. i haven't really taken the time to celebrate this because i guess i kind of forgot how i used to be because its too painful to think about. TW - but i used to purge every night, often multiple times and it would get violent and disgusting and it controlled my whole life and i was so ashamed and scared because i had no control and no help. but my aunty (who i love so so much) took me in and helped me recover by having meals with me and talking me through my urges and now i live in a house with a roomate but im often on my own which i NEVER thought i could do because i would be unsafe if i had done that back when i was still bulimic it would have broken me and put my life in so much danger. anyway enough of that because im fully recovered \ud83e\udd70 and i can't believe that its honestly so surreal. i believe in every single one of you. heres a link to my other post which has some more advice and support: [other recovery post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/jddux0/11_days_bp_free/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) - you are all so so capable of recovery and one day food will not be an enemy i promise \ud83d\udc95 good luck to you all. my dms are always open if you need a chat and i mean that \ud83d\udc99 i might post on day 100 of being purge-free if i remember \ud83e\udd70",

As a 35 year old only finding recovery this year, I want to tell you how incredibly strong as wise you are for prioritizing your recovery now. Obviously, it's never too late, but I wish like hell that I could've cleared space in my life from the Ed when I was younger. Stay free and keep celebrating every single purge-free day, even the not-so-special sounding milestones. (although, yes, please check in on day 100!)",
