  "title": "Lost my girl friend to bulimia this morning and I don\u2019t know how to cope",
  "selftext": "My friend has been bulimic for as long as I could remember. She was the sweetest person to walk this earth. When people saw her they assumed she was just normal as she was around 5\u20193 and weighed about 46-49 kg (I\u2019m guessing). She was the best thing ever to happen to me.\n\nWe used to talk every single day. We would go on coffee dates, play bowling, talk about people in public that seemed weird. We were inseparable.\n\nLast night she texted me saying that she was feeling very upset as she binged on some fast food and couldn\u2019t get rid of it. I quickly went to her house (it was around 12am) to comfort her. I sat with her and tried to get her mind off everything and she seemed okay.\n\nShe usually has these breakdowns and I\u2019m always there for her. I love to be. I waited for her to fall asleep and went back to my apartment at around 5 am as I have work today. \n\nI barely got any solid sleep but still went to work at 7am as I have a 12 hour shift today. As per usual, I texted her good morning and waited for her reply for which seemed like ages as she always replies pretty fast since she wakes up early and she slept at 4:30ish. \n\nI waited a couple of hours and no answer. I decided to call her and she didn\u2019t pick up so I just texted her roomie who told me she was at the hospital. I went to the hospital asap and saw her in the ICU unit. \n\nShe looked sick. Very sick. She was pale and the doctors told me to leave a few minutes after as they needed to be alone. About 45 minutes later the doctors came out and told her parents she had passed away from heart failure. \n\nI am devastated. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to continue my life without her. I can\u2019t do this. I can\u2019t believe she\u2019s gone, I still feel like she\u2019s somehow going to wake up. I\u2019m in so much pain, so so so much. I honestly feel so sick right now. Sick in the sense that I can\u2019t even think straight. I am speechless. :(",

And more than anything, we just want the person back. \n\nI've been in recovery for a year, but I used to feel unexpected heart palpations at random. It's so easy to downplay \"little\" symptoms like that and never say anything even if they point to life threatening things like heart failure. She could have also had an extreme electrolyte imbalance at that time bc of all the b/p. You'll never \"really\" know. It's totally normal to ask yourself if things would have been different if you hadn't gone to work that day, but they wouldn't be because bulimia is a monster. It's the worst parts of ourselves grabbing us by the throat and you slowly over years start to feel it's grip.\n\nWhen you're bulimic, you're scared. You look up every possible bad thing that can happen because of the disease and do your very best to avoid them, but the reality is that you can't. Eventually they mentally start to get to you. You know they're close on your heels, but you have no idea how close. How many cavities will I have to have filled in the future? When will I start throwing up blood? When am I going to be driving and faint from an electrolyte imbalance and crash and die that way? When will my friends and family find out and judge me for something that is killing me? When am I going to wake up in a hospital and be told that they had to pin my esophagus back together bc it burst? How old are my bones at this point? It all catches up with you eventually. Honestly, I'm lucky to have made it out alive.\n\nThe one major thing I've learned about bulimia in this time is that it has both nothing to do with food and everything at the same time. Bulimia is an addiction, and food is just the drug of choice. The first time I made myself throw up, I told myself I would only do it once. Nope. There were 5 more years of it ahead of me. But then you start to stress about what you're doing to your body and how much money you're spending on the habit. You don't know what to do so it gets worse bc you shove your feelings about the disease right back into the disease. It's a vicious cycle of shame, discomfort, and secrecy. Literally all of us need a friend like you to just be able to share without judgement. That's truly rare to find when you're bulimic.\n\nIf you have any questions or need anything, please don't be afraid to ask <3",

You look up every possible bad thing that can happen because of the disease and do your very best to avoid them, but the reality is that you can't. Eventually they mentally start to get to you. You know they're close on your heels, but you have no idea how close. How many cavities will I have to have filled in the future? When will I start throwing up blood? When am I going to be driving and faint from an electrolyte imbalance and crash and die that way? When will my friends and family find out and judge me for something that is killing me? When am I going to wake up in a hospital and be told that they had to pin my esophagus back together bc it burst? How old are my bones at this point? It all catches up with you eventually. Honestly, I'm lucky to have made it out alive.\n\nThe one major thing I've learned about bulimia in this time is that it has both nothing to do with food and everything at the same time. Bulimia is an addiction, and food is just the drug of choice. The first time I made myself throw up, I told myself I would only do it once. Nope. There were 5 more years of it ahead of me. But then you start to stress about what you're doing to your body and how much money you're spending on the habit. You don't know what to do so it gets worse bc you shove your feelings about the disease right back into the disease. It's a vicious cycle of shame, discomfort, and secrecy. Literally all of us need a friend like you to just be able to share without judgement. That's truly rare to find when you're bulimic.\n\nIf you have any questions or need anything, please don't be afraid to ask <3",

Luckily i had a physical for some reason or another and my doctor called me in a panic because my potassium was so low, she said i could drop dead at any minute. It scared me but didnt stop me. I never knew why i felt so good except maybe it was the heart working away so hard and it was like the good/happy feeling you get from exercising.. You couldnt have stopped her or fixed it, im sure she worried about this stuff but just had no idea it could happen like that. I didn't, and back then i wouldnt have cared. It just made me drink more coconut water but not stop the habbit. Thank you for sharing what she went thru as it can help others just as its brouhht awareness to me.",
