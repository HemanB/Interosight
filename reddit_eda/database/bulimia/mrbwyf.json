  "selftext": "Five years ago I developed anorexia and although it was terrifying at the time and I wanted nothing more than to recover, I had everyone rallying around me begging me to get better, the doctors took me seriously, and before everyone else got involved, whilst I was still losing weight I felt like I finally had a way to escape. No more suicide attempts and I almost felt weirdly content. \n\nFast forward to now, post recovery and a raging bulimic and I\u2019ve never felt so close to the edge. Bulimia has destroyed me, I\u2019ve dropped out of university, moved back in with my parents who don\u2019t want me here, constantly self harm, feel as suicidal as ever and the only things I get any enjoyment out of are the binge in the moment and drugs. I have one friend but she\u2019s moved away now and I have no reason to live. I hate myself more than I thought was even possible and I want to get help but I\u2019m certain nobody will take me seriously at a healthy weight. This shit is awful.",

      "body": "Same here, diagnosed with anorexia 5 years ago and then \"switched\" to bulimia. I've been trying to recover for a few months and recently been trying a pseudo \"all-in\" approach. Pretty scary, but after all this time the only thing I want is a healthy relationship with food. These thoughts of \"I wish I was still anorexic\" come to mind often. Bulimia for me has also been much more traumatic than anorexia, but when I was anorexic I was still miserable. I try to change the thought to: I wish I could eat like a normal person again. No food rules, not thinking about food and numbers all the time, not destroying my body in one way or another, not feeling sorry for myself, not hating the way I look...  Sure bulimia is shit, but anorexia isn't much better. The only thought that is worth it is recovery, and it's the only one that will give you your life back. Sending you much love and strength <3",

      "body": "i feel like i could\u2019ve written this. anorexia is so appealing in theory, and it\u2019s so rosy in my memory because i felt the way i looked which was frail and childish, and people treated me that way too, which i admit i enjoyed. now that i look the part of a healthy adult, i\u2019m expected to act that way and complete school while working but in my mind i still feel like a stupid child, i have no idea what i want except being thin, and nobody is giving me a break. i binge and purge everyday and sometimes i don\u2019t even purge just to punish myself and push the limits of my self hatred. i gained like 30 lbs in the last month and people have certainly noticed. i just want to stop eating again. (but i don\u2019t even feel like i have the willpower, which is another thing that makes me feel shittier).",
