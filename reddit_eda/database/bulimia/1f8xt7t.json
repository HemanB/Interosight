  "selftext": "So I've gone 1 day and 17 hours without purging (almost 2 days). And because I had breakfast and lunch today and a snack, I literally feel like I've recovered and never had bulimia. To the point where I'm like...um, it's been ages since I last purged...and then I'm like but it was less than 2 days ago. \n\nEven just 24h without purging makes me feel like I never had the ED? And it's like I forget how it all works till I go back to binging again. \n\nLike, do you suddenly feel so disconnected from your ED? I had my meeting with the ED services when I was in one of these 'stable' periods (3 days purge free) and I suddenly felt like I was lying about the whole ED and how severe it was. And then when I'm back to multiple purges daily I feel like I'm drowning and desperately need help.\n\nDoes anyone else kinda get me?",

Sometimes I catch myself walking at the gym thinking wtf did I ever think I was bulimic, I'm a gym girl, doing her steps, cardio and eating good whole food. I think I'm a liar and I dont recognize myself in bulimia anymore. It even sounds weird to just think I have been bulimic. The difficulties with that is that I often reach the point to cancel my therapist appointments on days like this bc I genuinely think I was never bulimic. I feel ashamed that someone might think I am because I deeply think I'm not. It's like it has never happened and it was just a dream/nightmare. I can't believe someone else is experiencing this too.",

The feeling of triumph is so real and you feel invincible for a period. It all come crashing down for me when I relapse. It\u2019s extremely mentally taxing every time it happens\u2026 but I keep getting \u2018back on the horse\u2019 hoping, knowing\u2026 believing that one day it will be the last.",
