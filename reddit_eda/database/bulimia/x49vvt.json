Like if I eat something I shouldn't have, nothing will change about that if I purge and purging will lead me to have more binges. I find it a lot easier not to binge if I just don't purge. Just the feeling that I could be where I want to be physically more easily if I stop. Which makes total sense because the purging came long before I ever started binging.",

I was also getting sinus problems due to it coming out my nose I was choking and having throat issues all the time. And it was getting to a point whre I\u2019d be trying my hardest to throw up and nothing would come out I\u2019d be gagging for like an hour. I got so done with it I stopped compeltely. My body could no longer keep up plus not to mention the fact I was dying. I am currently in recovery n still have issues w restricting sometimes but for the most part I am trying my hardest and you\u2019ll find recovery to be challenging but also a weight lifted off your shoulder due to no more mental and physical exhaustion from purging.",

I convinced them to take it out if I ate and after that I told my bf at the time that there would never be a fucking tube in my nose unless I\u2019m 80 years old and can\u2019t eat anymore. During that admission I kept telling people that I was tired of fighting my ED voice so I was just going to fully submit and do whatever it said. But then a few days after I just got home I realized that it was just as exhausting to fight my recovery voice, so I might as well just submit to recovery. I was an adult but told my parents to make all my meals and not let me\nHave a say in what they were making. This helped so much.",
