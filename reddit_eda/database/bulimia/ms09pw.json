  "selftext": "I fucked up my body, because I cant control my ed. I've completely fucked myself over. All the binging and purging has ruined my skin, and now im obese in the 200s. I hate myself SO MUCH. \n\nThis past week I had to go to school for in person classes, and my campus is located at this beachy side of my town so all the girls are decked out in their cute clothes, and im here in my big ass winter coat. I've never felt so insecure in my life and I just want to ball up on the park bench, look at the ground, and ignore the cute girls in the spring time clothes that I wish I can wear. \n\nTo add salt to the wound, one of my classmates is apparently an Herbal Life hunbot, and gave me unsolicited advice to loose 10 kg by drinking those Herbal Life teas that she is selling. Not only that, another classmate of mine is encouraging me to get on the scale, and try the teas with her. I'm so ashamed of myself.\n\nI hate myself, I just want to die already, I want this anxiety and this ed to end.",

If you are, I urge you to reach out. You do not have to suffer in silence and there are so many ways in which a therapist, coach, or counselor could help you. It is so important to have support because ED's thrive in isolation. Many people with EDs have struggled recently with the pandemic, especially if they were in quarantine or lock down. If you can't afford treatment then even reaching out to a friend or a loved one will help. \n\nBody image is so hard. I'm struggling with mine now as I'm going through recovery and gaining weight. Think of a few things that you can do for yourself that would make you feel even the tiniest bit better. You could buy yourself something cute to wear that feels good to you. If clothes are too triggering then maybe a cute pair of shoes or an accessory. I got really into nails, makeup and jewelry because clothes are problematic. It doesn't have to be related to your appearance either. You could do an activity or project, go somewhere, talk to someone, pet a puppy, anything that you would enjoy. Even the smallest thing can make a difference. Our eating disorders want us to punish ourselves but we do not have to. We can treat ourselves with love and kindness, even if we don't believe that it will work or that we deserve it.\n\nThose people should not have said those things to you. You do not need to drink teas and you are a worthy human being regardless of what people are saying to you. Those thoughts of body hatred are coming from your ED. If a loved one came to you and said that they hated their body, how would you respond? You probably wouldn't say, \"you're right, you should hate your body.\" You would  say something kind and supportive. You can treat yourself with the same kindness, even when the ED is loud and overwhelming. It does not have to run the show, you have the ability to respond to it and advocate for yourself. I'm sending you lots of love and support. \n\nIf you are in the US, the national eating disorders association has a free hotline. \n\n1-800-931-2237 Monday-Thursday from 9:00 a.m.- 9:00 p.m. and Friday from 9:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m.",
