While I was setting up the procedure room for the oncoming patient, the anaesthetist who was working in the room that day pointed to my hand (which I try not to advertise or allow people to see plainly) and asked \"do you make yourself throw up?\" so matter of factly to me, I obviously responded with an over the top \"NO\" and tried to say I get dermatitis on my hands in Winter, but I think he knows ): he laughed and rubbed my back afterwards but holy heck, I can never look him in the eyes again. I feel so dumb and deflated and embarrassed as a professional who should KNOW better ):",

I was too smart for my own good and she told me she knew what I had told the kids. She was extremely boney skinny and I heard her being loud in the bathroom before. I really liked her so I feel awful. I hope if I was right she got some help cause she was impossibly thin, but I\u2019m so sorry about it too. I wasn\u2019t trying to deflect from my own bulimia I just felt so clever and in the know and couldn\u2019t control myself from telling others. I got karma in a way though cause there were some crazy rumors when I left school and about why I was throwing up all the time. I was the kid who stuck up for teachers when they got bullied so I didn\u2019t mean to hurt her at all.",
