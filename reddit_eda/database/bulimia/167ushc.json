  "selftext": "Yesterday I bp really bad and was feeling sick, but I thought \u201ctomorrow will be fine\u201d. And no, I almost died. \n\nToday I woke up and still feels sick, then I went grocery shopping my with mom, I feel like my heart was giving up on me, I couldn\u2019t breathe, my chest feels heavy, wanting to vomit(but nothing comes out), cold sweat. Then, the worst part, my whole arm and my hands became numb, I couldn\u2019t feel a thing. Fingers on both of my hands were twisting inwards, and there\u2019s no way controlling them. This went on and off for 30 minutes or so. \n\nThis has happened before (last year) but it wasn\u2019t that bad, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the dehydration or electrotype imbalance\n\nMy mom was freaking out and wanted to take me to the hospital, but I said no because I didn\u2019t want to be a burden. I tried telling her \u201ceverything will be okay\u201d and laid on the bed, thinking, \u201cI\u2019ll probably never wake up\u201d \n\nAnd here I am typing, still alive. I still feel sick but I\u2019m just so grateful to be alive",

Your brain is sending you real bad signals. It's not your fault, it's not a character flaw, you're not weak, you're not worthless. You are loved and you are important. \nThis is a medical emergency!!! How would you handle it if literally anyone in your life came to you suffering so much??? Your thoughts are lying to you bc your brain is glitching. Please tell your mom you need help. Please please please get help and keep us posted",

      "body": "This happened to me. The dr said it\u2019s anxiety. I thought it was related to my neurological disorder but nope. Apparently your body has fight flight or freeze. When we get intense anxiety (even for no apparent reason) our body can \u201cfreeze\u201d. It\u2019s like how a possum plays dead out of fear. It\u2019s out of our control. I thought I was going to be paralyzed. It happened in 5 min numbness and curling of my toes and fingers. Numbness all the way up to my jaw and it locked and I couldn\u2019t talk. Black dots, hyperventilating\u2026 take a deep breath. Sounds cliche but when your body doesn\u2019t get enough oxygen it can fall out pretty quickly. This happened to me after binging/purging in a hotel and I think it lasted longer than normal panic attacks bc I was depleted of energy, so getting back to a normal baseline was hard for my body. Drink LiquidIV and you\u2019ll be better after a few hours \u2665\ufe0f",

Or like, doing it like serval times in a row? \n\nI had a scary experience yesterday. I had actually eaten breakfast and lunch. But then afternoon came and I was alone so the urge to binge was just to strong. I only purged twice and after the second time felt this flushing sensation come over my body and suddenly felt like I may pass out. I didn\u2019t feel my heart racing or have chest pain but I know my adrenaline was kicked up because my flight or fight response was telling me I needed to call someone for help. I truly considered calling my boyfriend at work to see if he could come home. I didn\u2019t end up calling but rather took a shower, had a liquid IV and spent the rest of the day on the couch. I feel ok today. Not sure why I\u2019m saying all of this exactly \n\nTLDR: I hope you are doing better today. This d/o sucks.",
