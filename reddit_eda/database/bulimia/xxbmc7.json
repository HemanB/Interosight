  "selftext": "Today is 51 days and it feels good but I worry because I was a year and a half clean before and than I wasn\u2019t. In that year and a half I felt like I was truly free of it and I could never imagine it being a part of my life again and than\u2026it was. I relapsed on and off for a year and a half..not nearly as bad as I used to be before I stopped purging for the year and half clean period but still\u2026I was relapsed. And now I\u2019m here.. 51 days. I feel strong and like I\u2019ll never use bulimic practices again but \u2026I felt that way before and I\u2019m just scared.",

I believe in you, and just do it one moment, one hour, and one day at a time. I used the \u201cI Am Sober\u201d app to track my sobriety, and they also have settings for eating disorders.
