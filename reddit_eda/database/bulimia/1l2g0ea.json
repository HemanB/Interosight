I \u201cpurge\u201d through exercise and restriction, but i feel this weird twisted jealousy for people who throw up. it seems like such an easy way out. meanwhile i have to slave away for hours on the treadmill. i know i shouldn\u2019t *want* to throw up, and i\u2019m so grateful my disorder has manifested in a way which doesn\u2019t harm my teeth, esophagus, etc., but i\u2019m just so fucking jealous of people who can \u201cundo\u201d their binges with just a few minutes in the bathroom instead of sweating it out in the gym. i know i\u2019m definitely in the minority here but if there are any other non-purging bulimics, i\u2019d love to hear your thoughts.\n\nEDIT: wow, i didn\u2019t expect so many thoughtful responses. my jealousy has been \u201ccured\u201d. my heart goes out to everyone who purges. this really is a bitch of a disorder no matter how you slice it.",

I used to think the same way and I thought I just couldn't, but once I discovered I could it's gotten SOOOOOO much worse. I can't go a day without b/p-ing at least 2-3 times because I have this new \"Get-out-of-jail-free\" card. However, it doesn't get rid of all the calories, it's exhausting, the bloat is CRAZY, and worst of all you get splashed in the face with your own vomit most of the time. And it's GROSS. Not to mention the amount of health risks I am submitting myself to. I only started throwing up a few months ago, but I've struggled with over-excercising and lax abuse for a year now. I used to binge occasionally (no more than once a week) because I knew I would either be spending my hours on a toilet with my ass on fire or on the treadmill for the whole day.  Now, however, since I can just empty my stomach whenever I please, I binge at LEAST once a day (and I promise you that is NAWT fun). It has made me spiral uncontrollably and I cannot stop myself no matter how hard I try. So please, take this as your warning to not try it. I PROMISE YOU it is not worth it. My biggest regret in my short life is not listening to people who told me the exact same thing I'm telling you now. I KNOW how desperate you are and you say you don't care about the concequences and adverse side affects, but you will.",
