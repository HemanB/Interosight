  "selftext": "So tonight I ordered a takeaway. \n\nIt has been a stressful and upsetting week and so I am more prone to b/p than ever. Tonight I did b/p. But a lot less than normal. \n\nI over ordered by accident and was almost determined, but I stopped and thought about it. I stopped when I was probably a little too full. Instead of shovelling the rest of the food in regardless I got up and portioned the leftovers into 4 meals. Fun fact you can freeze Chinese and reheat it another time. \n\nSo instead of binging the rest, I will enjoy it a different time. :)",
