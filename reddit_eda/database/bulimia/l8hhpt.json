I know it isn\u2019t healthy, and I\u2019m not proud of myself for the reason I\u2019ve done it, but sometimes I just have to sit back and look at all the ridiculous bullshit I\u2019ve done.",

I'm perfect in getting along with this shit. I did so many heavy  disgusting things; a normsl person would be so fucking ashamed. But for me it's okay.

You try as hard as you can to get to a certain weight so that people can see you are sick without you even needing to say anything. This is why we sometimes feel like we aren't \"sick enough\" even though anyone with disordered eating is in need of help. I am not sure if this applies to you or your situation but I thought it was interesting. Best of luck to you in treatment!!!",
