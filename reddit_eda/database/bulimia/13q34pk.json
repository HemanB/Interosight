      "body": "I hope this is taken as helpful, rather than harmful, and won't be offended if the MODs delete this, but I wanted to share my experience.\n\nI've had an ED for as long as I can remember... ARFID before it was an actual diagnosis, then BN for almost two decades, and in recent (several) months, I dabble between AN and BN, because I find being full to be extremely triggering, so I have to make a really concerted effort to make judgements with every single bite I take, so that I don't trigger a B/P episode.\n\nYou mentioned that you weigh yourself after, to see if you're less than when you started.\n\nI'm sure you've been told this, but I'm going to reiterate it just in case you, or someone else hasn't...\n\nYou cannot reliably use your weight as a measurement when you are binging and purging. You are losing water weight, your body is clinging to the calories that it can, and it's not even remotely an accurate judgement of your weight. I know the numbers can be everything, but they honestly mean nothing. Unless you are weighing yourself once, max 2x a week, at the same time of day (first thing in the morning is best), you can not put any weight, no pun intended, into it meaning anything, as your weight can fluctuate drastically throughout the day.\n\nSo... the part I'm concerned about sharing. I have been working VERY hard at keeping food down in recent months, eating what I consider \"healthy, nourishing\" food, and using that as my justification to not continue eating, even if I do feel a bit uncomfortable, and in turn let it turn into a B/P episode. Because then my efforts are for naught, and my nutritious food went to waste.\n\nAnecdotally, when I started forcing myself to eat and not let it turn into a B/P (again, what I consider to be healthy and nutritious food), I was (am) trying to eat small portions, quite frequently, so I never technically had a proper \"meal\", which would absolutely trigger me, but that I was satiated and felt like I was doing my body some good.\n\nWhen I did this consistently, I actually lost weight. BUT - let me tell you why...\n\nI don't know if others are in the same boat, but based on some of the things OP mentioned, I think I'm likely not alone... when I go in on a proper binge/purge episode, I eat absolute shit food. Junk food, fried food, fat-laden food. Despite my purging efforts (and I have some tricks to make sure I'm as empty as I'm going to get, which I'm not going to elaborate on), my body, and everyone's, hangs on to some of that food. So essentially, we are consuming high fat shitty calories, that our body is desperate for, because at the end of the day, it's fuel.\n\nWhen I was making an effort to eat healthy food and nourish myself, I wasn't eating \"shit\" food. In turn, my body actually responded in losing weight. Now I am NOT condoning anyone losing weight, I'm just trying to point out that comparing your weight from before and after a binge is completely irrelevant in terms of what calories your body is retaining.\n\nFWIW, I had been at a fairly low point in my weight before, similar to where I was when I was eating healthier, but previously, I could barely function. I couldn't walk my dog, I literally couldn't do anything. After basically re-feeding, while my weight didn't skyrocket, my energy did, and I felt really good.\n\nTo be clear, I am not, and was not eating enough calories - YET. But I'm working my way towards it albeit slowly, so that I don't trigger myself and go back down that hole.\n\nI've been in your shoes. It's an awful place to be. But you CAN get better. I don't honestly believe we will ever be completely free of this disease, but I think you, and everyone, has the ability to fight back.\n\nAs my counsellor said to me not that long ago, which was a slap in the face...\n\n\"In the \\~13+ years I've been seeing ED patients, never once have I seen someone age out of it.\"\n\nThat's what I needed to hear, to realize no one can fight this battle for me, except me.\n\nETA: Whoops, sorry for the novel!",
