I felt bigger (fatter) than other girls around me.\n\nWhen I learned about eating disorders, I was like \"that's the solution!\" And it was always in the back of my head. \n\nIn 6th grade, I was eating a spoonful of peanut butter (popular snack for me back then) and my aunt said \"that will go straight there\" and poked my thighs. \n\nIt's all downhill from there. \n\nWhat I've found useful is meditation to in a way \"travel back\" to those moments where the adults in my life failed me. I picture adult me comforting child me, telling her what I needed to hear.",

I've never thought about having an eating disorder and now I suffer from being underweight and daily puking at the age of 20. That's not a life. The worst thing about it is being fully conscious about your actions, yet you still can't really do anything about it. Just keep in mind that you're certainly not alone and that things can change.",

Your organs can just snap out in an instant and then you're done for. It's honestly scary but the thought of dying somehow isn't really that chilling to me anymore. Maybe bulimia is a slow way of committing suicide in a cowardly manner. I don't really want to die, but on the other hand I'm apathetic towards that thought. I'm 20 years old and I can't comprehend that this is what life is all about. I hate it, I hate it so much. I really hope you pull through this. No one deserves to be inferior to such a stupid, yet so powerful disease. I wish you the best, I really do, as I do for the rest of our kind. I hate this, I honestly do.",
