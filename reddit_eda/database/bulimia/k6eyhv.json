It sucks. Sometimes I\u2019m so good about eating enough at the right times of the day to where I don\u2019t overeat but also don\u2019t feel hungry all the time, but there\u2019s always some time where it comes back awfully.\nI haven\u2019t vomited yet tonight, I told my cousin I wouldn\u2019t anymore and I want to keep to that, but it sucks so much, I wish I hadn\u2019t gone overboard",

I am in the same boat you are, fairly recently started purging. But I was anorexic in early high school, so I just have always had an unhealthy relationship with food and my body. It\u2019s SO good that you\u2019re trying to fix this now, and that\u2019s what my therapist told me, it starts \u201csmall\u201d and gets worse the longer it goes on, so it\u2019s so good that you realize an issue NOW. The way you talk about the need to purge, it\u2019s exactly how I feel when I\u2019m going through that. It\u2019s so nice to find people who GET it and know exactly what I\u2019m going through. Definitely, if you can, go talk to someone and you don\u2019t always click with the first therapist you talk to, so don\u2019t be afraid to keep trying until you find someone you truly can talk to.",

My tentative advice would be to hold it down if u can, and use this memory of how much distress u got and how much u had to do to hold it down without like ur world ending, as like a reminder to be more careful next time and like not so nonchalantly eat that last niggling craved thing. Anyway that's the advice that i would maybe tell my own past self.",

And yeah, that\u2019s what my cousin said, she\u2019s struggled a bit with EDs before and she says I should try to stop now. My parents don\u2019t know but they do suspect bc my mom had an ED as a teenager and they want me to see a doctor about it. So hopefully it won\u2019t be so bad. It\u2019s sucked so far lol",
