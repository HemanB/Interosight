And I don\u2019t even mean from physically making yourself purge, sometimes if I get a sudden wave of nausea and feel like i\u2019m gonna throw up I get the teensiest bit excited for the relief i\u2019m about to feel. Throwing up does not bother me in the slightest unless it\u2019s projectile and I can\u2019t make it to the toilet ",

Not a lot, just like shed a tear at how out of control I feel. Honestly, as conceited as it sounds, I feel bad for me.",

Pretty fast, I think about how I know have ruined my teeth more, my stomach, my salt levels and sometimes I have nightmares about my teeth falling out\u2026 so yeah maybe not love, but it\u2019s a nice feeling of relief to delete the binge, before the anxiety hits about how purging is equally is bad, or worse.\n\nHave you analysed what it is that make you love it? Like what is the root to this feeling? To get rid of the binge? Or just the action alone to purge? Like would you purge without binge because you love it? I\u2019m curious to dig a little deeper here!",

BE CAREFUL THOUGH because throwing up from drinking does indeed mean that you have alcohol poisoning",
