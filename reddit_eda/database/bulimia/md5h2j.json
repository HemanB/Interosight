The nose and mouth passage is just connected, they flow down through your throat then stomach so if you purge food out it can go out through 2 different passage either mouth or nose that you just can\u2019t control. \n\nI\u2019m bad at explaining I don\u2019t even know the right terms but yeah.. I literally blew my nose sometimes and see this bits of food like piece of rice or something lol",

I clean myself up with toilet paper and do a mirror check for splatters on my clothes. This is genuinely the only place I've shared this off-and-on 10 year secret. No one in my life knows.
