I have no idea how to deal with this; it's burdensome not only for me but also for my loved ones.\n\nI can't focus on what people are saying to me, and I can't initiate an interesting conversation myself.\n\nI feel so distant from others.\n\nAnd if I try to focus my thoughts on something other than my body, vomiting, or eating, every thought eventually leads to death.\n\nI no longer feel like a person.\n\n",

It was pretty scary and I had to realize bulimia has been there for me to help me get through things I couldn\u2019t handle. \n\nBut there are so much better ways to handle the unbearable than with bulimia, and there is so much more to life than being your eating disorder.\n\nIt\u2019s scary to \u201close\u201d your identity, and it\u2019s scary to break free from bulimia and built yourself up again.\n\nBut it\u2019s so worth it. Please go talk to someone if you haven\u2019t already. We can do it! Xxxxx",
