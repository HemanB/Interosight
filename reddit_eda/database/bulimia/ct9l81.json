  "selftext": "I do so well during the day. I make myself a good breakfast, healthy lunch, decent dinner, workout, then boom. Once it hits around 6-7pm up till like 5 am I can\u2019t stop myself from eating complete junk and I end up binging. I don\u2019t know why this happens. People are going to say it\u2019s because I don\u2019t eat enough but I eat even more than I should for my height and I still always feel hungry. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore..",
