I've always had a bad relationship with food, but my family always commenting on my weight/body made everything so much worse. I always feel ashamed to eat in front of them. They always talk about how \"weird\" I am because of my eating habits, I can't even imagine what would happen if they found out about what I do. And they also seem to be so proud when I restrict and \"eat clean\" so I feel like sh\\*t when I'm in a b/p cycle ... Nowadays they come at me with the \"how come you eat SO MUCH but never gain weight\" and it makes me want to cry because it just makes recovery almost impossible in my mind. I know I'm not mentally ready to hear what they'd have to say if I gain weight, especially when they see me eat so much and not restrict.",

Whenever I eat some sweets, she goes \"I see that you want to fatten yourself.\" And when I lashed out or tell her how hurt I am about it, she be like \"it's just a joke.\" and suddenly gets annoyed about how sensitive I am or completely shrugged my feelings off.\n\nWhat makes me feel worse is that when someone point out how my brother is getting bigger, she will tell them to not comment about my brother's body. She let my brother sulk about it and consistently asking me whether is he fine or not? has he eaten or not?\n\nGuess who is the least favourite child? \")",

      "body": "i totally relate to this. my ethnic background & culture involves a lot of \u201ctalk\u201d and emphasis on weight\u2014 that being, where i come from, skinniness is glorified. so as u can imagine, every time i go to any family gathering they\u2019re all talking about my weight. the thing is though, since it\u2019s america and it\u2019s \u201cunethical\u201d to talk about someone\u2019s weight gain to their face, they won\u2019t say anything if i got bigger. however if i lost weight, as i am rn, they will keep congratulating me or asking me \u201chow i did it\u201d and frankly it makes me very uncomfortable considering i KNOW how i did it (throwing up excessively) and them askin me and congratulating me feels like a constant reminder of what i find the most shameful about me and my routine. it\u2019s also uncomfortable bc i know when they don\u2019t say anything about me looking \u201cgood\u201d, i know they\u2019re secretly thinking that i got fatter, which starts giving me more anxiety about my body ...which leads to more purging once i get home. it really sucks. \n\ni\u2019d say my advice to you is to just ignore it. i know that sucks, but family members especially older family members are impossible to change. their beliefs and behavior are rooted in both culture and how they were raised. i know it\u2019s annoying and impolite how they speak to you, but trust me in their eyes, they don\u2019t know they\u2019re doing anything wrong\u2014and they\u2019re not \u201ctrying\u201d to be that way. you explaining to them that xyz makes you uncomfortable won\u2019t do much other than make you look dramatic or ungrateful. \n\nrmbr you\u2019re in charge of your own body and mind. it\u2019s not your fault that these people give you shit, but it\u2019s your responsibility to block out things that make you upset. it\u2019s similar to this commonly used situation; you are studying in a room overlooking the highway, and the noise of the traffic (e.g. honking horns) is unbearably distracting. you can\u2019t go out there and tell the cars to shut up, but you CAN choose to ignore it and work around the noise. sitting there and complaining about the noise isnt going to help anything. u have every right to complain and be upset., but in the end that will just harm you more. it\u2019s the same with your family and their comments. you have every right to feel the way you feel, and i\u2019m glad you came to reddit to vent. but your mental health is your responsibility and you should choose to actively block out the noise from your family members. don\u2019t let their shit get in the way of your happiness. you got this bbygirl\ud83d\udc9e",
