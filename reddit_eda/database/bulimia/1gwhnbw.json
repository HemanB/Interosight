  "selftext": "Me and my girlfriend are together for 6 years.  \n4 years ago I found out she has bulimia and I have been trying my best to be the supportive and understanding boyfriend that she needs.\n\nHowever for 4 years the situation did not improve even an inch.\n\nNow some details:\n\nWhen you consult the frequency charts her condition is **beyond extreme**.  \nShe does this every day, multiple times a day...  \nBasically half the day is groceries, cooking, eating and purging...\n\nThis is going on for years before we got together... around 15 years now... so by her words for at least 10 years  she is doing this every day, 3-4 times a night purging...\n\nThe situation is so distorted in her mind that all kinds of health issues she may have she is not even considering her ED to be a factor in it. One example is her teeth which are going increasingly bad due to stomach acid going on through them for 15 years, but she is just \"yeah i might need to do facets or something cause I got problematic teeth\"...\n\nAll activities we might do spontaneously are now source of frustrations cause spontaneous means the B/P schedule is disrupted... So everything has to be planned days in advance... so friends now call us for a night out to a bars or restaurants very rarely cause we always decline... Even if the planets align and we go out we need to be home early cause she needs to \"catch up\" so to speak...\n\nGroceries shopping is like buying for 8 people family. And then we constantly cook and we constantly don't have food and we constantly order tons of food to the point where we are now spending 4 times more than people usually do. So even financially we are not doing ok...\n\nWe had multiple conversations about this and me reading everywhere that I need to be supportive and understanding am not doing any ultimatums, not doing bad remarks, not picking up fights about all that.\n\nI asked her to go see a therapist and she did but the moment they went past the onboarding get-to-know-each-other and started touching the ED seriously she said it's taking an emotional toll on her so she stopped going...\n\nI am not even going to describe in details all the neurotic outbursts, and mood swings that are happening on a daily basis due to ED cause you know them better than me.\n\nI am not going to mention that because I spend all my spare time with her watching something while munching I occasionally slip myself and also do junk food but since I only do B and don't do P my weight got fucked up and I am now 40 pounds overweight...\n\nI am not going to mention her regular frustrations with me not participating with the cooking enough (which is cause I lost all excitement of preparing something for hours and then hear it being purged)...\n\nOr her regular frustrations with me not paying attention what and when to buy cause I don't think 2 people should do 4 grocery shoppings per week containing 4 big bags each time...\n\nFrankly all that doesn't even matter...  \nShe is just completely delusional about her health! It's really difficult to plan your life with someone who is in such condition but still insists what she does is still \"a little cheat\". She completely understand the severity of her condition but still refer to it as a cheat to not feel bloated after dinner. Which I think simply leads to the conclusion that deep down she is just ok with it.\n\nI think it's similar to if you live with an alcoholic. They know they have a problem but deep down they just enjoy that problem and are delusional about it. But yah if you confront them about it sure -> it's a problem... \n\n\"I am not purging everything, so I get plenty of nutritions, so don't worry about my health!\"\n\n\"I can stop for the pregnancy, so don't worry about the child's health!\" \n\nSo what are my options here?\n\nWe have to think about children, marriage, etc. How can we do that... On what baseline can we build?\n\nIf this is the situation currently then:  \n\\- How are we going to manage health-wise? We are not getting younger...  \n\\- How are we going to manage financially? What happens when our parents also stat needing extra help from us cause they also growing old...  \n\\- How are we going to, conceive and carry out healthy child? How are we going to parent it if we can have it at all? What kind of relationship with food are we going to show to it? \n\nFrankly the situation is absurd.... I have been very relaxed about her dictating the tempo and everything but the years are passing by, and we are getting older and nothing is improving... My \"understanding\" is just useful to her to avoid dealing with the problem...\n\nAt what point is ok to have an ultimatum? Cause I cannot live like that anymore....  \nI don't have any dreams about anything anymore...  \nI cannot imagine anything like \"we are going to get married and buy a house, etc\" cause everything is coloured in ED...\n\nPlease help me!",

I've been single for 10 years. I will be single for the rest of my life. \n\nIt is insane that she allows HER disorder to run YOUR life. It's even more insane that she is so open about these deeply personal routines - doing them out in the open, knowing you see it, knowing you hear it - I can't even fathom that. Making you fund her habit as well as buy and cook the food with her/for her is fucking unreal. \n\nYou have to start putting yourself first. It's like you said, you are living with an addict. You can't change her, and she is not ready to change. Frankly, if she's like me, she might never be capable of change, even if she so desperately wants to (like myself). \n\nIt's selfish of her to inflict her illness so openly upon you and so without shame. There's no way around that. Please start considering that it might be time to separate yourself from the situation for your own mental, social and financial health.",

      "body": "So, I was almost exactly like your girlfriend.  Always b/p when home, buying a lot of groceries to then purge (weekly), getting upset if we had plans because it delayed the b/p sessions.  Most of my blood work came back fine, my teeth were fine so I kept deluding myself that I was not causing any real harm.  My husband has been with me for ten years.  He has only known me with the disorder.\n\nHe had sat me down some months ago now and told me flat out he cannot keep doing this anymore.  Watching me harm myself on the daily, wasting money, etc.  Being afraid that if we continued to build a future that I would pass from the disorder.  \n\nI needed to hear it.  I needed to hear his feelings and really take them into account.  After all, this was the person I loved the most in this world.   It took me a couple months to also really want to recover for myself after he said it.  Without wanting it - I do not think I could do it.  He always said I loved my illness more than him.  I do not believe it to be true, but I knew I could not recover for anyone without wanting it myself. \n\nIt hurts to hear, but she needs to want it for herself.  I do not think there is anything you can do except be honest about your feelings.  I do not think an ultimatum would work.  Tell her you cannot continue to live like this - those are your true feelings. Maybe she will do some soul searching after that.  I did, and I am five months b/p free.  I still struggle with aspects of the disorder (fear of foods, food noise), but I am a lot happier.  I actually can be present in the moments with my husband.  I realized how much of it I missed due to always being preoccupied with my thoughts of b/ping.\n\nBest of luck to you both, OP.  It is truly a hard situation.  You deserve peace and happiness too.",

I think your girlfriend definitely needs some kind of professional help, maybe even rehab if she is that reliant on b/p sessions to cope. it is more of a coping mechanism or addiction than anything else imo. i also don\u2019t think it would be healthy for you to stay living like this for much longer as it definitely seems as though everything is taking a toll on you mentally, we can only go through so much. i\u2019m not saying break up with her, and i wouldn\u2019t recommend giving any kind of ultimatum but she needs to consider real recovery soon, for her health and yours! eating disorders are serious but it is not up to you to make her recover. i hope she chooses recovery and gets help though, but she needs to know she deserves recovery, she deserves a good life and so do you OP. but before you guys think about a future with kids or anything, you need to put health first.",

Leaving someone who was willing to \"put up\" with it or face a blind eye to it catapulted me into my own ultimatum. The past few months have literally been the longest period of time in my entire life that I've been able to eat like a relatively \"normal\" person and get back on my own feet. She has to do the same. \n\nEven if she can stop for a pregnancy it has WAY more to do with the influence that kind of mental illness would have on a child. It would still be so unfair to raise a child under the influence of disorder. It really is an addiction and addiction creates an atmosphere of hopelessness and despair that no one deserves to live in.\n\n If she can recover, she can develop the empathy and understanding to become an incredible mother, trust me, but one way or another there needs to be a mirror held up to her face about what's going on, and you don't deserve to have to feel guilty for being the one to hold that mirror up, trust me, it does reach a life and death point and her life itself will hold that mirror up along the way.\n\nYou seem like a very understanding person, even my ex wouldn't consult other people about it and treaded so lightly around it that it felt like a phantom or third party in the relationship the whole time, addiction always does. When he tried to bring it up a couple times I lied my way out of it and we both knew I was lying but that was better than talking completely honestly. It is really awesome that you have been willing to work with her to this point, if she can't see that in you then you do deserve better. \n\nNot becuase she can't BE better, because you can't live in that atmosphere of hopelessness. Because you seem understanding, I'm sure you can understand how uncomfortable it makes her feel, too, trust me being this old and still having to work through an issue that is typically associated with pre-teens is embarassing and makes me feel like a child, a failure, and unworthy of the kind of partner who would be so understanding. But that is not a reason to stay, she has to get herself to the point of feeling worthy of recovery. That also doesnt mean the relationship cant come back together in a way that is healthier and stronger, it just cant continue on the same path or it will ruin you too...",

Because you're right, how are you gonna raise children under an ED culture? how are you gonna show them a good food relationship? Also, doing BP over 15 years might have affected her system already and future pregnancy is already a risk. \n\nShe is in a comfort zone because you allow it every day by helping her to sabotage herself. She doesn't want to accept she is not ok because she knows you're there and \"nothing bad is going to happen\". It's important to bring an existing ED to the table because that's the kind of stuff an ED does: pretending it doesn't exist and is something necessary for your daily basis instead. So please do not ignore it and give her an ultimatum. It will be better for you and her.\n\nI send you all the best wishes and support for both. You know we're here for anything \u2661",

He is so emotional by seeing me hurting myself that this helps a bit.. \n\nThe fact that you are overwheight because of doing the rituals with her ecp. purging is really sad! \nYou NEED to tell her how much you suffer! \n\nBefore my bf was in my side, i had another partner which where understanding like you.. \n\nI bought so much food, cooked tons.. had dues.  \nWhen i could not purge, i ate chrisps and spilt it in the bag back. I lost 3 Tooths in the back. \nHe bought me the food, cause i was ashamed to had so much chrisps. \nAnd all of it got worse! \nMore foid, more pain, i almost choked a few times and my money was gone. \nThe pizza guy new my name . \n\nJust because my partner on the time let this happen and said nothing, i got sicker and sicker cause for me ther was no problem..",
