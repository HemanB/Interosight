  "selftext": "Y\u2019all I am trying so. hard. \n\nYesterday I had one of those low cal frozen pasta meals as part of my meal plan, challenged myself to eat something that I usually b/p on in a small quantity. Pasta is one of my go to b/p foods, I\u2019ll often go through an entire box in a day of multiple binges so it\u2019s hard for my brain to think of it as something safe to keep in. After eating this meal my binge urges were alarming, everything in my body was saying WEEOOWEEOO YOU ATE PASTA TIME TO STUFF YOUR GUILT AWAy wiTH A BUNCH OF ADDITIONAL GARBAGE FOOD AND THEN BRING IT BACK UP WEEOOWEOO but NO I sat with it and let my body digest it. Holy fuck. \n\nFirst time I\u2019ve eaten pasta and kept it in in like a year. Baby steps.",
