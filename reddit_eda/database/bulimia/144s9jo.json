      "body": "Oh god yeah. Friend's and family who know tell me, fairly often, that I'm a perfectly healthy weight,  but for goodness sake it isn't all about that. Dont get me wrong i sometimes purge a dozen or more times a day, but it's so rarely anything to do with weight loss. Anxiety, depression, a quick panic relief, all sorts of things. But this has haunted me for more than half my life, it began as a child, and even at the very beginning I dont think size or weight was the primary causation. It can be a \"good\" (and i wish I could extend those quotation marks ten times) way to relieve stress temporarily/immediately/quickly, and obviously I don't know how long this has been a problem for you but I am urging you to find a better way to deal with stress. Trust me, I understand entirely. But from what I've gathered this is an urge, a desperation, not so much a lifestyle, as it's become for myself. Not to mention that if it's irregular and *only* due to stress then odds are it may actually be easier to acquire help for it. Whoever it is are unlikely to focus on the ED first, more the causation of the stress, but nonetheless, it is very much in your benefit to seek some form of medical help before it becomes a day to day habit and not just stress relief.\nIt's difficult and it's embarrassing to come out with this stuff, but sometimes you need to just give it a slap and say 'Look, I have a problem and here it is, it's destroying me.' To get help soon is the best thing you can do for yourself. Try to take care and feel free to message me any time.",
