  "selftext": "My mum and dad were fat shaming my sister who is a chef and looooves food and always has. She is not overly obese but a little chubby. She has embraced her body and she has much more love for herself than i obviously do. She never compares herself to me and has been sooo patient wth my ED. I have told my parents on MULTIPLE occasions that fat shaming ppl and judging their appearances is not okay and they should learn to stop. This advice of course, goes over their heads.  Back to the story. Then my mum comments that since my sister drinks so much milk, she has grown(lit grew 3.5cm in height) and this way (elongating upward gestures wth both hands) and also this way(elongating width with both hands). Rude af. Then my dad adds on tht she should keep growing (copies height gesture) and stop growing (copies width gesture). Then he points to me and does the same. I blush and feel really embarrassed and angry. I am in the midst of recovery and have gained X pounds but nothing extreme.  Why do ppl push u to stop gaining weight but also dont want u to be anorexic?? Theyre like \"u look better! But pls stop growing xx\". They give me bullshit when i am too thin, they give me bullshit when im too fat. Pls stop ur causing so much fucking pain.",

      "body": "it took me a long time to start disregarding what my parents said. They tell me to lose weight but as an adult when I start losing weight they say I\u2019m relapsing, when I\u2019m just trying to do it in a healthy way?? Then I gain weight and they make even worse comments, which in turn makes me relapse!! It\u2019s a horrible cycle I\u2019m just starting to break, and I\u2019ve been able to maintain and be content with food a lot more ever since. They make no sense, and I realized my mom is insecure and my dad is controlling, that parents aren\u2019t always right and have their own issues to deal with, and to do what makes you happy and healthy. You are in recovery, please stay in recovery-Someone in recovery",

It sounds like you\u2019re a really really great sibling and she\u2019s lucky to have you. Even if you can\u2019t control what your parents do, if you regularly talk supportively w/ your sister, that can counteract a lot of internalized shit (for both of you).",
