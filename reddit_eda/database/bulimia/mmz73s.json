      "body": "If it helps at all, as a mother with an eating disorder, she's probably just projecting on you. I highly doubt she's grossed out, but I think a lot of moms end up trying to soften the blow of societal expectations by making sure no one has anything to make fun of you for. That doesn't make it mildly okay, but sometimes maternal feelings get mixed in with your own bad experiences, if you get what I mean? I'm sorry to hear that though. Again, that's not okay at all and I'm not trying to make excuses.",

She would make me wear long shirts to cover my butt now she doesn't care if I'm wearing tight pants and short shirts. Now that you've pointed it out, I do feel my mother was grossed out with me. That's sad asf",

AND you probably would have felt loved just as you are, and not developed an E.D. #sorry #notsorry\nMy daughter is a bigger girl and she regularly looks amazing, and I feel so proud of her when she rocks what she wants to wear!! I didn\u2019t get this treatment when I was young but she will never feel unpretty around me. Not one day!!! That\u2019s my unspoken promise to her. She is fucking gorgeous!",
