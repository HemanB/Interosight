  "selftext": "A quick note before I start - I know how controversial this can be and it\u2019s not a solution for everyone. But I want to start a conversation around the stigma of medical weight loss. Please be kind to me and others!\n\nI\u2019ve struggled with bulimia for over 20 years. I\u2019m 35 now. From the outside, I\u2019ve always looked \u201chealthy\u201d - skinny even - BMI around 19-21, fit, good habits. People thought I\u2019d recovered a decade ago. But the truth is, I never stopped binging and purging (b/p) It dominated my life - until this year.\n\nExactly one year ago, I started taking compounded semaglutide. Since then, I can count how many times I\u2019ve b/p-d on one hand. Even at my \u201cmost recovered\u201d in over 20 years, it\u2019s never been less than at least 1x/week. That\u2019s over 52 times a year. AT MY BEST. At my worst, I would b/p multiple times a day. And the worst part? I was suffering in complete silence.\n\nAnd now - for the first time in two decades, the food noise is quiet. Not silenced completely, but no longer running the show. No longer dictating my thoughts, my energy, my life.\n\nI\u2019ve done everything else: years of therapy (which I\u2019m still in), in-patient treatment twice, medications, support groups, workbooks, psychedelics, even hypnosis. And none of it ever truly worked. Nothing quieted the obsessive loop until this.\n\nAnd yet\u2026 I still see articles like The New York Times op-ed asking, \u201cWhat if food noise is just hunger?\u201d And I want to scream. Because if you\u2019ve lived with an eating disorder - bulimia, binge eating, or any kind of food addiction -you know food noise is not just hunger. It\u2019s not a rebrand. It\u2019s not a cute TikTok term. It\u2019s a constant, exhausting, suffocating obsession. It\u2019s heroin in the form of a cereal, cookies, ice cream, and whatever else you can get your hands on that will \u201ccome back up easily\u201d. It\u2019s planning, hiding, punishing, spiraling. It\u2019s your entire day, entire life swallowed whole by a thought.\n\nNo, this isn\u2019t an ideal solution. I didn\u2019t take this lightly. I\u2019m not using it to lose weight, I didn\u2019t need to. Did I drop 10 lbs from finally NOT binging? Yes, but my weight has been stable for 10 months. And it gave me a chance to build a life beyond survival. That\u2019s something every person with an eating disorder deserves.\n\nSo yeah, I wish I could shout this from the rooftops. But there\u2019s so much stigma, especially when you \u201clook fine\u201d on the outside. So I\u2019m saying it here: semaglutide changed my life. And whether or not it\u2019s the solution for everyone, it needs to be part of the conversation.\n\nIf you\u2019re struggling in silence, or scared to admit that this has helped you too, you\u2019re not alone.

Semaglutide has saved my life. \n\nFor those that don't know, semaglutide -- and other GLP-1 Inhibitors -- are being used in trials for addiction treatment. It has proven to help people who are addicted to substances including alcohol and COCAINE. So it's NOT just about food and hunger. For me it quiets that constant, rampaging voice in my head. I come from a family of addicts. Bulimia is an addiction. SG allows me to have the wheel. My greatest concern actually is the fact that is slows GI mobility.

      "body": "I just wanted to thank you for this thoughtful and very well-written post. It's important to discuss different approaches to managing this disorder--as we all know, as with all addiction disorders, there \\*is\\* no cure, just that time-tested one-day-at-a-time (and then another day and another) management.\n\nI especially appreciate the discussion surrounding \"food noise\", which has nothing to do with actual hunger, but which is a hallmark of addictive behavior: that low drumbeat in the back our mind that is always there, sometimes becoming loud and unbearable, needing to be quieted with another \"fix\".\n\nAs a 64-year-old who has suffered with this awful, soul-draining disorder since her late teens (when there wasn't even a name for it, and reaching out to a medical professional only resulted in being told \"You don't look like there's a problem--just eat a normal meal!\"), and who only became free from the BP cycles about seven-eight years ago, I will tell you, the drumbeat never stops, not even after months and years have passed since the last BP.  One has to acknowledge its existence, and then, every single day, make the choice to \\*ignore\\* the drumbeat and to listen instead to what our psyche is asking for: am I tired? Irritated? Having ghastly memories of abuse? Feeling deprived in some way, whether it's profound--being passed over for a promotion--or more superficial, like losing out on an eBay auction we really wanted? Bored? Overly self-critical of our appearance that morning (noticing gray hairs, feeling as though we hate everything in our closet, etc.), and on and on.\n\nWhat I'm saying is, in the state of recovery--absent the frenzy and fog of stuffing ourselves with comfort food; then being weighed-down with guilt and panic; then vomiting it up; then castigating ourselves for doing it yet again and promising it was the last time--there is freedom and release, of course, but the quotidian stressors will always be there for the recovered person. Just as they are for every other human being, whether or not they suffer--or ever suffered--from an addiction.\n\nSo, a vital part of recovery is rewiring one's own brain to address all these opressive, negative thoughts and feelings in a positive (as opposed to self-destructive) manner. All the clich\u00e9 self-care measures like checking in with ourselves; being kind to ourselves; writing down all the miserable things we say to ourselves in our heads and then reading them and realizing how needlessly brutal and hateful we are being to someone we know better than anyone in the world does and toward whom we ought to be loving and kind, not combative: our one and only self.\n\nThe \"food noise\" we all know so well came about because at some point in our earlier years, we fell into a maladaptive cognitive process: we dealt with abuse, sadness, frustration, boredom, grief, resentment, etc. by overloading our bodies with comfort foods (whatever those may be for each of us), and our bloodstreams with big blasts of sugar and fats, knowing we could eliminate at least some of the caloric damage by purging, and then--at least temporarily--being rewarded with blissful relief and peace.\n\nThe new studies about treating addiction disorders with GLP-1s are incredibly promising.  It may be that a year or two course of GLP-1s will help some BP sufferers quiet that food noise long enough for them to learn (or re-learn) the art and science of self-care, self-love, and ultimately, self-preservation. Which, no matter what path one takes to recovery, is the part of the road that is at once freeing and joyful, but also enduring and lifelong. Because the stressors themselves, as we all know, aren't going anywhere (especially right now).\n\nBe well, my friends.",

None of that even existed when I was younger, at least not unless you had $40,000 burning a hole in your pocket. We all know its years of recovering and you dont finish program and come out \"cured\". But still, the treatment she got had major flaws. It seemed so experimental, of course ED treatment is still in its infancy. One thing was the fact that every patient was not allowed exercise which I get but taking a walk everyday is healthy and good for mental health just as well. It wasnt allowed, even for patients who never engaged in strenuous exercise as part of ED. They had to finish 3 meals and two snacks daily or suppliment. We as a family have never really done 3 meals a day more than a few days of the week. Humans \"invented\" the 3 meal routine only in recent years, and its not because we \"finally have enough food to do so\". When she was in IOP we had to follow a strict schedule and provide and \"plate\" the 3 meals plus two snacks of course and the fact shes vegitarian (rest of family isnt) made options more difficult and I was literally exhausted trying to keep up. Shes doing better now 6 months at home. \n\nI look normal on the outside but the damage ive done to my body has been starting to creep up into daily life where I can't just be in denial anymore.

If she isnt willing to at least let me try it then I will keep asking till I find a doctor who will. Im at a \"normal\" weight for my height but just gained 15lbs in last year.

I am 47.\n\nI have twin girls who are teenagers, which is a miracle as they were born full term and healthy. For over a year now one has anorexia & bulimia. She was in patient twice, PHP then IOP. None of that even existed when I was younger, at least not unless you had $40,000 burning a hole in your pocket. We all know its years of recovering and you dont finish program and come out \"cured\". But still, the treatment she got had major flaws. It seemed so experimental, of course ED treatment is still in its infancy. One thing was the fact that every patient was not allowed exercise which I get but taking a walk everyday is healthy and good for mental health just as well. It wasnt allowed, even for patients who never engaged in strenuous exercise as part of ED. They had to finish 3 meals and two snacks daily or suppliment. We as a family have never really done 3 meals a day more than a few days of the week. Humans \"invented\" the 3 meal routine only in recent years, and its not because we \"finally have enough food to do so\". When she was in IOP we had to follow a strict schedule and provide and \"plate\" the 3 meals plus two snacks of course and the fact shes vegitarian (rest of family isnt) made options more difficult and I was literally exhausted trying to keep up. Shes doing better now 6 months at home. \n\nI look normal on the outside but the damage ive done to my body has been starting to creep up into daily life where I can't just be in denial anymore. The first 10 or so years was the worst of my bulimia, the last 10-15 years it wasnt every day anymore, but most. I am going to ask my doctor and show her your post. If she isnt willing to at least let me try it then I will keep asking till I find a doctor who will. Im at a \"normal\" weight for my height but just gained 15lbs in last year. This isnt my usual weight, and its caused my ED to get worse and im having a really hard time with it. As if getting older wasnt hard enough.",

I also acknowledge this is not a solution for everyone, but the purpose of this post was to help remove the stigma (which is something clearly you\u2019re still dealing with) as I was NOT underweight, but felt listing my weights could be triggering for people. I was 21 BMI when I started. And my provider honestly didn\u2019t even focus as much on my weight when I explained that I could consume 1000s of calories in a sitting multiple times a week. \n\nWhat you\u2019re saying is like going on a sub for severe depression and anxiety and commenting on a post that says \u201chey everyone this may not work for you but this drug saved my life! But everyone is judging me for taking it, so I want to help break the stigma!\u201d And saying: \u201cyour post is dangerous bc people could misuse it.\u201d \n\nI would say that 80-90% of this sub are people who suffer from binging, and this drug helps for binging. There\u2019s a reason I didn\u2019t post it in the general eating disorder or ano sub.\n\nThat being said, thank you for sharing your thoughts.
