Take it from me who lost 4 teeth and every other tooth need fillings or they were going to be extracted too you don\u2019t want the same thing to happen to you. The crazy thing is you could still lose your teeth. All my teeth started having problems AFTER I stopped purging. Take care of your dental health it\u2019s so important.",
