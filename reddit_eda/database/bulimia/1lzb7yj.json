I definitely feel excited and happy after successfully purging, and lately I've been falling into major restriction...now my therapist is starting all over again and I don't even know what ED I have anymore. \n\nOverall, I feel happy and excited about it. Watching numbers go down in the scale is what I enjoy. I need reminders that my body is literally not functioning properly at the moment. It's so hard right now. \n\nMy heart goes out to everyone who's going through this right now.",
