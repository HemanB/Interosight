This factors into the mortality rate, so keep that in mind.\n\nWith bulimia you also have some extremely brutal complications that can result such as esophageal rupturing, rupturing of the stomach, ulcers, tears, severe electrolyte imbalance\n\nA higher mortality rate doesnt make one ED more extreme than another.
