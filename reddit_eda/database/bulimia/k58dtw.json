I live alone & I'm not close to fam & I'm underweight so I just think.....if I faint I'm gonna die, and if I starve for a day I'm gonna faint the next day. Even though I'm probably slowly k1ll1ng myself anyway & I get su1c1dal ideations constantly. \n\nSo it feels like a lack of control if you get what I mean? Like the dizziness isnt something I'm controlling. I hate getting illl bc of that too bc it's not me that's in control of me puking.\n But yea I can def see why itll do the opposite",
