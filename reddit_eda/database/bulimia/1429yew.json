      "body": "I'm the same, I'm ana-subtype-bulimia, and I can not eat a full meal without it triggering a binge/purge - I can't handle feeling full. My attempt to remedy this was to just eat small amounts, often, so I never hit that threshold of discomfort. \n\nThis unfortunately leaves me far too low on calories, and often leads to a binge/purge that day, or the next.\n\nI cycle between full-blown B/P for a time, and then restricting/minimal food to avoid feeling full for a time. It's so frustrating when I'm wanting so much to be eating, but nothing is safe for for me in the moment. \n\nTo OP...\n\nMy one remaining trick to force myself to not purge, is to eat something I consider safe and nutritious, in a small but reasonable quantity, and then I go out. I'll either have plans made in advance, or errands to do, or when I have neither of those to do, I will literally take my laptop and go to a coffee shop and dick around on my computer for an hour or two. The goal being that I know I've digested at least SOMETHING nutritious and that will contribute to my health in a positive way, and usually any of those activities distracts me enough that I don't think about eating more, and I'm out of my home and not in a position where I even could if I wanted to (I'm a Celiac so can't eat anything at the coffee shop). \n\nIt may be uncomfortable the first few times, but I promise, it has become something I actually look forward to, and could become that for you. It could be particularly helpful for you in terms of you mentioning you can't go too long without eating - could be one way to tackle that time of day that you really have to have something.",
