Esophageal tears are common in those with bulimia and they can be fatal. \n\nThis is beautifully done artwork capturing a very disturbing moment. I love the colors and the emotions come through loud and clear. Scared, sad, disturbed, trapped, miserable, regretful. \n\nPlease take good care of yourself. \ud83d\udc9c",
