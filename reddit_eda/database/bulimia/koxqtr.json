I'm at the thinnest I've ever been and yet they will always think that I've gained weight? My parents don't make the situation any better and will add on how much I snack and eat in the middle of the night(usually to purge). This triggers me so much and is making my bulimia so much worse.",

Just tell yourself at one point in history people thought foot binding was beautiful, that it doesn't mean shit what the collective says is beautiful if it's wrong and harmful to you. The larger group can be completely wrong.\n\nI'm not trying to be obnoxious in saying this but 1) you are beautiful and a human being with worth regardless of exterior appearance and 2) the people around you can be completely wrong and still be decent people in other ways, if they seem wrong on something it's OK to know they are idiots on that issue and do your own thing. I really don't want to be a bad influence here but ugh sometimes you have to have an attitude that is like, fuck ya'll you are wrong.",

Parents constantly were \"concerned\" when I was under weight bc of my restricting tendency fueled by their fat shaming comments when I grew a chest and butt (bc puberty). Now they are shocked bc I gained weight in locked down. They don't even consider the fact that I have to eat their carb heavy meals three times a day and barely able to leave the house and walk around. I swear I began purging bc of lockdown. \n\nI hope your parents realize that telling these to your child only fuels to our anxieties and insecurities.They should understand why we continue to eat even when they tell us not too.
