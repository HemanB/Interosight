      "body": "Yeh I get the same feeling of \u201cit\u2019s already too much, might as well just binge\u201d.. but honestly I feel horrible after binging, even if I purge it.. if I slightly overeat without binging I\u2019ll still feel that guilt, but it\u2019s much better than the terrible feeling after I binge, and the guilt of consuming all of that to just purge it.. plus the physical damage I\u2019m causing my body when purging\u2014 so I keep that extra bite inside and do my best not to binge afterwards. I just keep on repeating affirmations of how what I\u2019ve eaten over what I planned won\u2019t do any harm and that it\u2019s okay.. yk",

Everyone overeats sometimes and most don't get fat, so why would I? Then I actually tried it and saw for myself how an extra few bites here and there didn't affect my weight at all (maybe from one day to the next, I'd gain weight but it would all even out eventually) :)",
