  "selftext": "This is the first time in 4 years that I didn\u2019t purge!! Feeling really proud of myself right now \u2014  I know on the grander scale it isn\u2019t much, but the little things feel good regardless. Ofc not to say I don\u2019t feel a bit shitty for having eaten a few pieces of pie, but still, it feels so good to have kept from making myself purge. It gets better slowly but surely!!  ",

You can feel mixed feelings about eating pie, but it's sort of a big feat when you do eat stuff like that and not purge and realize the world doesn't end or you don't blow up like a balloon like your ED has been telling you all this time. All of it counts toward healing. Good on you!",
