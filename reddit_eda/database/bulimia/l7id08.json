  "selftext": "I had relatively good skin until I started binging and purging. Now my skin is so so so horrible and I'm lowkey grateful we are in lockdown so I don't have to go out and face the world. I feel SO ugly that I can't even look at myself in the mirror. I avoid every mirror and window in the house so I don't have to see my face or my body. The thought of having to go back to university looking like \\*this\\* makes me sick to my stomach and keeps me up at night. I was already so insecure and self-conscious, this is the cherry on top. I'm trying to get an appointment with the dermatologist, even though I know it's useless because I know why this is happening but I just can't stop it.",
