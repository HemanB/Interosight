  "selftext": "Sorry if this is weird but i needed to vent. I feel like I've failed at having an ED. I know its fucked up , but I always think to myself that I would've been so much skinnier if I had Anorexia nervosa instead. I've been trying to recover but its so hard . It's so hard trying to recover from an ED when im not underweight. Id get so much compliments when I lost weight after restricting and purging , nobody cares if I recover.",

I often wished I could go back to anorexia, simply because it was more effective. The only way we can get rid of that kind of thinking is to eliminate our beliefs that we need *any* eating disorder to feel like we're good enough. That's a tough battle. I don't use bulimic behaviors anymore, but the ED thinking is immensely more difficult to get rid of.",
