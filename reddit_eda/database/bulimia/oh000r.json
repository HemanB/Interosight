  "selftext": "Hi everyone! Yesterday a patient came in to my clinic for an exam. Very sweet young lady. I did notice some acid wear on her teeth that indicated bulimia but because there were others in the room with us I only let her know that I\u2019m seeing acid wear and gave her general tips on how to protect her teeth from acid. Once the others left the room she did confide in me that she is suffering from bulimia. I am grateful that she felt comfortable enough to share this with me and I recognize how difficult it can be to admit it. I didn\u2019t want her to feel like I was lecturing her but I also want her to be aware of how bulimia is going to severely effect her teeth.\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to figure out is from the people that you\u2019ve opened up to about being bulimic, what do you wish they would have done for you? What would have been helpful?And any recommendations on what I can do to help without overstepping \n\nThank you!\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve gotten a few people ask about what to do to protect your teeth I figured I\u2019d answer here to make it easier to access. The main damage occurs from the stomach acid being in the mouth. It breaks down the enamel very quickly. Especially if brushing happens right after. Best thing to do is to swish with water/ get a mouthwash with fluoride and swish with that. Try not to eat or brush until a good 30 mins- 1 hour after. Drink lots and lots of water. Also, fluoride is going to be your greatest protector against sensitivity. You can have trays made so that way you can put prescription strength fluoride tooth paste in it to wear for 30 mins a day.",

Its difficult to help as a dentist anymore then just fixing teeth I guess. Its a mental thing and fcking up your teeth is just collateral damage. Im living in a country were you have insurance, one time I was already over the budget for that year and my dentist said we will fix these two for free. That is something I will never forget. But dont know your financial position, so dont feel obligated or anything. Props to you reaching out here trying to help a client more than just repairing teeth.",

It is very easy to get lost in the guarding and protecting of teeth, as that is literally our job. Can get a little tunnel visioned sometimes! Thankfully we aren\u2019t all the same so I encourage you to keep looking for a dentist that you\u2019re comfortable with. Let us help protect your teeth so it\u2019s one less worry on your mind.\nIn the mean time, if you have any questions or concerns feel free to reach out. I really don\u2019t mind.",

I've had people do that with me before, and the information is never helpful and comes across as condescending. Information about protecting teeth is super helpful though. Also, I hear that there's special fluorite toothpastes available, so maybe carrying them in your practice could be helpful if that's an option? \n\nI do give this advice as an adult already in therapy though, younger people or others who seem open to it might benefit from a discussion about their options for seeking help etc.  Honestly so long as you treat us with respect and understand that you won't fix us in an appointment, you'll be ok.",

      "body": "When my dentist was alone with me I told her about my bulimia and asked her not to put it on my record because it felt a bit too personal. She was very compassionate and understanding. For some reason I was scared she would say something about my weight but she didn't which was a relief. She asked how long I've struggled with bulimia, whether I was in recovery or if I was still actively purging. She also asked me if I knew what damage vomiting will do to my teeth, to which I answered that I knew very well so she didn't explain them to me. She encouraged me to seek help for my eating disorder, but I told her I wasn't ready. She didn't push the subject any further, except that she explained the benefits of *not* purging (instead of hammering in the damage that purging does).\n\nShe then gave me some very helpful advice on how to care for my teeth, both in general and immediately after purging. What I found especially helpful was that she asked if I had depression and if it made it hard for me to brush my teeth, which is something I do struggle with. She then offered me some advice on how to minimize harm when I'm too depressed to brush my teeth, like drinking water after eating/binging and swishing it around in my mouth before I swallow.\n\nMy overall experience was that I was very nervous and felt like a piece of shit before the appointment, but because she listened to me and showed me compassion I felt like things weren't all that hopeless. I truly didn't expect it to be this good to open up to my dentist and I am so happy that I did. It's had a big impact on my life.\n\nPeople like you who care about your patients are wonderful.

      "body": "Hi! Im actually a recovered compulsive eater myself, and happened to be looking for people to help as part of my 12 step work, and I just happened to read this post. I\u2019m actually a recovered Overeaters Anonymous sponsor, and follow the same 12 step program the pioneers of AA followed. The Big Book of Alcoholics may be a great resource on this subject, particularly the chapters The Doctors opinion and To Employers, because it can give you insight on how to help others that are suffering with a chronic compulsive eating illness, and how to bring up the conversation in a helpful manner. Also, I\u2019m apart of an OA fellowship that has weekly phone meetings, and I would love to pass on my information and our groups information so you can refer patients. I wish someone could have given me this information years before I ended up in OA. I totally agree with what others have said about being careful not to lecture the patient. There is such a misunderstanding about the illness, just like alcoholism. Chronic types are unable to stop on their own, and it actually has nothing to do with lack of willpower. They have actually lost the power of choice to stop and stay stopped. Just like the chronic alcoholic uses alcohol for ease and comfort, a chronic compulsive eater uses food for ease and comfort, or purges/restricts. Really the best thing you can say, is that you care, and tell the patient that if they are having a hard time controlling their behaviors with food on their own, that you know someone who could possibly help. I would love to help answer any questions you may have, you can PM me anytime. Here is the website to our fellowship. Feel free to pass this on as well!   www.oabigbooksolutiongroup.org",

I have avoided the dentist for years because I was afraid of being judged or shamed. Ideally I would want my dentist to focus on addressing any current issues and how to take care of my teeth in the future. One thing that is helpful to know is after vomiting, teeth should not be brushed for at least an hour to allow the acid conditions created in the mouth to settle down. If the teeth are brushed immediately after vomiting, acid is brushed directly into the tooth surface causing further destruction. It's best to rinse your mouth with water, mouthwash or a water and baking soda solution immediately after vomiting. \n\nYou can't stop someone from purging but you can treat immediate issues and help the person protect their teeth moving forward.
