  "selftext": "I was diagnosed when I was 20ish, but always knew I had some form of eating disorder since I was in the 3rd grade. To this day I can still hear one of my class mates calling me fatty everyday. He eventually started using it as my name. I still feel the embarrassment of being called fat girl in the middle of my fifth grade math class and my PE coach telling me I\u2019d feel better if I lost 60 pounds when I was 14. I\u2019m 24 now and have been working on my weight since I was 8. First it was periods of starvation, then throwing up, then a vegan diet in college (lost weight doing that because I was also a swimmer. I floated around 174-179). I\u2019ve had some therapy and was able to get rid of those habits, but now I have been going to the gym 8-9 times during the week. Sometimes 2-4 hours a day.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, I know I\u2019m overweight. I\u2019m only 5\u20197 and probably will feel better if I loose a good 70 pounds this year. That\u2019ll put me around 155. \n\nDoes anyone else feel like this? Do you have advice on how to overcome these thoughts?\n\nEdit: \n\nTo clear up some confusion (I feel that I may have not been too clear in my original post)\n\nI\u2019m completely aware of exactly what bulimia is and the nature of the disease (I\u2019m currently getting my Masters in Human Sciences - then PhD). What I\u2019m referring to and what I\u2019m seeking advice on is the FEELING/THOUGHT associated with having the disease and being considered overweight for you height and body composition. I know these thoughts can be normal for a person with bulimia nervosa blah blah blah... but what they don\u2019t teach you in school is how to overcome them.",

The criterion for annorexia nervosa begins at a BMI equivalent or equal to 17, however for adolescence it is by percentile to mark expected weight gain.\n\nYou\u2019re completely right about the binging being present in cases of BN, which separates AN from BN since the criteria for BN excludes a diagnosis if AN is cooccurring.  Regarding the binging: many psychiatric professionals or physicians will still diagnose BN in cases where binging is relative to what the patient typically eats (as in a binge may just be a normal meal for a patient who eats 200 calories a day) and not to what a typical person would eat.  Many would even diagnose in the absence of binging behavior (if there was even such a case that wasn\u2019t clearly severe) if they met the other criteria for BN but not AN\n\nI really like your generalizations for the diagnoses.  Part of these disorders are, of course, extremely low self worth, which I have seen manifest itself in thinking they don\u2019t qualify with (especially) ANs and BNs; for instance: \u201cI\u2019m a failed anorexic\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not a true bulimic\u201d which can make enabling them to seek treatment difficult.  Yours are clearly better than the one I made up, it\u2019s just important that everyone understands that these are disorders of the mind which merely affect the body.  Many BNs and ANs feel as though it needs to be affecting the body in severe ways to classify as a true disorder.",

I would occasionally 'binge' and purge when I was anorexic but the 'binges' were tiny, really, since as you say I ate less than 500 calories a day. \n\n\n Unfortunately bulimia has taken a far worse toll on my body than anorexia did - I think partly because my AN was never that severe. But I had just enough of a taster of what it's like to really be starving to understand that true anorexia, even if the psychological causes are similar to other EDs, brings a whole lot of other stuff along with it - I was really quite mentally unwell and losing touch with reality as a result of true starvation. Plus my fingernails started turning black and falling off and I was fainting in the street - good times... \n\nI have a good friend who suffers with BED and I know that even though the outward manifestations are different (her weight has gone up as high as 22 stone, around 300 lbs) and her binges are far more extensive than mine, the underlying psychological structures are very similar in each case. But the physical effects of each ED are different and they bring their own issues...\n\nI've never yet found any professional help that actually helps.\n\nArgh, I'm meant to be working, not falling down this rabbit hole :)",

          "body": "I\u2019m definitely seeing some confusion and misconceptions in this chat so hopefully I can help.  there\u2019s a big misconception about the difference between Annorexia Nervosa and Bulimia Nervosa.  Most people think that the difference is that those with bulimia purge and anorexics restrict, but this not the case at all\n\nThe only difference between the two is that those with bulimia are considered to have a BMI over 20 (healthy or overweight), and those with annorexia are considered to have a BMI under 20 (underweight).  There are subcategories within each disease which qualify wether the behaviors are binge-purge or a restrictive.  [Here is a link to a crash course video,](https://youtu.be/eMVyZ6Ax-74) explaining these things, if you are interested in learning a bit more.\n\nThe point is, feeling ashamed of eating normal amounts of food regularly is the main component of the disorder.  Binge-purge, restrictive, bulimia nervosa, annorexia nervosa, and binge eating disorder are just classifications and specifics.\n\nBigger than that, though, is to reach out for some help :)   It seems like you\u2019ve already gotten some, but relapses are normal and to be  somewhat expected - no reason to feel ashamed.  If you were coughing up blood, It shouldn\u2019t matter how much you\u2019re coughing up, how often, if a doctor has told you you\u2019re coughing up blood, etc.  Same goes with many psychiatric disorders!  Just start out by talking to someone who is trained in psychiatry, feel them out, make sure you like and trust them.  Not every doctor is a fit, so don\u2019t be discouraged!  When you feel comfortable with them, just open up a bit.  No need for any big commitments, just let them know what\u2019s up. If they make you uncomfortable, you can leave at any time.  \n\nGood luck, I hope you can get better :)\n\nHugs\n\nEdit: grammar",

          "body": "> The only difference between the two is that those with bulimia are considered to have a BMI over 20 (healthy or overweight), and those with annorexia are considered to have a BMI under 20 (underweight). \n\nMost of what you say is absolutely right, but I'm not sure those are the correct boundaries. My BMI is currently 19, but I'm still considered a healthy weight and not anorexic.\n\nI was only diagnosed anorexic when my BMI went below 17. \n\nAnorexia nervosa is now defined as being 'significantly underweight'. which I don't think would apply to someone of my size (BMI 18/19).\n\n> feeling ashamed of eating normal amounts of food regularly is the main component of the disorder.\n\nThis is also not quite right. One of the diagnostic criteria for bulimia is:\n\n> Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g. within any 2-hour period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than most people would eat during a similar period of time and under similar circumstances.\n\nThe same criterion is also applied to binge eating disorder, but is distinct from bulimia because in BED: \n\n> The binge eating is not associated with the recurrent use of inappropriate compensatory behaviors (e.g., purging) as in bulimia nervosa and does not occur exclusively during the course of bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa.\n\nSo bulimics and binge eaters will tend to eat a larger amount of food than normal, not just have shame over eating a normal amount of food.\n\nI think if you wanted to make a generalisation that applies to ALL forms of ED you'd have to look at something like:\n\nmental illness with behaviour and thought patterns that have a distorted, unhealthy, abnormal relationship to food\n\nI quite like the NHS definition:\n\n> An eating disorder is when you have an unhealthy attitude to food, which can take over your life and make you ill. It can involve eating too much or too little, or becoming obsessed with your weight and body shape.",

          "body": "Absolutely right on with those points, I was wrong in regards to my BMI statement.  The criterion for annorexia nervosa begins at a BMI equivalent or equal to 17, however for adolescence it is by percentile to mark expected weight gain.\n\nYou\u2019re completely right about the binging being present in cases of BN, which separates AN from BN since the criteria for BN excludes a diagnosis if AN is cooccurring.  Regarding the binging: many psychiatric professionals or physicians will still diagnose BN in cases where binging is relative to what the patient typically eats (as in a binge may just be a normal meal for a patient who eats 200 calories a day) and not to what a typical person would eat.  Many would even diagnose in the absence of binging behavior (if there was even such a case that wasn\u2019t clearly severe) if they met the other criteria for BN but not AN\n\nI really like your generalizations for the diagnoses.  Part of these disorders are, of course, extremely low self worth, which I have seen manifest itself in thinking they don\u2019t qualify with (especially) ANs and BNs; for instance: \u201cI\u2019m a failed anorexic\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not a true bulimic\u201d which can make enabling them to seek treatment difficult.  Yours are clearly better than the one I made up, it\u2019s just important that everyone understands that these are disorders of the mind which merely affect the body.  Many BNs and ANs feel as though it needs to be affecting the body in severe ways to classify as a true disorder.",

What you are saying is 100%, completely, absolutely, utterly, entirely the opposite of correct.\n\nDSM-5 Criteria for *Anorexia Nervosa*\n\nA person must meet all of the current DSM criteria to be diagnosed with anorexia nervosa:\n\nRestriction of food intake leading to weight loss or a failure to gain weight *resulting in a \"significantly low body weight\" of what would be expected for someone's age, sex and height.*\n\nFear of becoming fat or gaining weight.\u200b\n\nHave a distorted view of themselves and of their condition. Examples of this might include the person thinking that he or she is overweight when they are actually underweight, or believing that they will gain weight from eating one meal. A person with anorexia might also not believe there is a problem with being at a low body weight. These thoughts are known to professionals as \"distortions.\"\n\nThe DSM-5 also allows professionals to specify subcategories of anorexia nervosa:\n\nRestricting Type: This is a subtype that is typically associated with the stereotypical view of anorexia nervosa. The person does not regularly engage in binge eating.\u200b\n\nBinge-Eating/Purging Type: The person regularly engages in binge eating and purging behaviors, such as self-induced vomiting and/or the misuse of laxatives or diuretics.
