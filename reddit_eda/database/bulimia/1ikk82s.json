But the last few months I haven\u2019t even been able to read when I used to average three books a week, about 1,000 pages a week. And my bulimic side has been out of control for a few months now. And tho I\u2019m uw but my blood levels are deemed to be fine \u201cfor me\u201d quote my doc they are all out of range mostly. I think my brain is slowly being eaten. I can\u2019t concentrate can\u2019t find words and rarely find enjoyment. Not even food excites me now. So I b and p trying to maximize anything to give me a \u201cbump up\u201d if you will. I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t have good advice.  Recovering from our Ed\u2019s may be the only way. Will be think in g of you",
