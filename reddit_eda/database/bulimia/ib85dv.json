  "selftext": "Sunday will be one year rock solid with no binges or slips after a 20 year battle with few periods of recovery. I\u2019m no longer in twelve steps and want to give back so thought I\u2019d share some recovery here.\n\nI was a hard core, high volume, in debt bulimic. I almost lost my marriage. I was running long distance races and getting carried away in ambulances, having severe electrolyte issues. I was a mess. I always kept trying though. Therapy, nutritionists, meds, yoga, TMS, TM, ayahuasca I did it all. . . Some of that helped but really I just had to be ready to let it go. At some point the chore of being bulimic became greater than the pain of my feelings. I had to be willing to be present with the ugly truth of my feelings to get better. Once I did that it got easier fast. The feelings I had run from all those years got tolerable fast. They were definitely not worth the binging and purging I did. For a year, I put recovery first and I made my life baby easy. You\u2019ll be ready. If you are fighting with yourself or making promises you can\u2019t keep you aren\u2019t ready. No one can get you there. Ask yourself what bulimia does for you. Question it and be gentle in the meantime.",
