  "selftext": "I want to share this with some of you who are struggling. I didn\u2019t of course think of this while being bulimic for so many years. Started since I was 15 . Anyway, I now have what is called Barrett\u2019s Esophagus due to bulimia. Basically it is precancerous cells that have to be monitored ur whole life so as to not turn into cancerous cells. The stomach acids will eat into ur esophagus and start this issue. I just want u to know this bc I wish I had thought of all these problems . I hope everyone can find their way out and honestly the only reason I quit puking was bc  of this. \ud83e\udd74",

Good news is this is a very slow progressing cancer but bad news is that u may have no symptoms and end up finding out when it\u2019s too late. So I suggest anyone who has been bulimic for a few years get tested and keep an eye on it. The good thing is that I haven\u2019t thrown up since finding out amd now I make sure I just don\u2019t over eat . Which as u know can be difficult but now it\u2019s a must.",
