  "selftext": "Yesterday I had to have my first adult tooth out. I'm certain it's bulimia related, because I remember at my worst with bulimia, parts of it chipping out (and this was way back in 2018, although I've had bulimia since 2011), and it just got worse from then. \n\nThe tooth couldn't be saved in the end and I'm both ashamed and upset about it. I asked to keep it as a reminder to never let myself get to this point again. But I didn't expect it to be so big. I think it's a molar tooth, it was a back tooth, but it's huge. I'm now worried I'm going to get gap teeth. \n\nI'm in pain, all day yesterday I could just taste blood. Its throbbing, having it out wasn't pleasant, there was an awful amount of tugging and crunching sounds.\n\nPlease look after your teeth and see a dentist if you think they're starting to go bad. I wish I'd saved this when I had the chance. The dentist won't shame you. Please don't let it get to the point I have.",

The biggest reality hit was 8 months pregnant with my son losing a front tooth, now all the teeth the flipper (those are not cheap and not covered by some insurance) are wearing and needing replaced, along with some rebuilding due to no enamel and losing a LOT to chipping from binges. Once they start, it's a rocky road to maintain them. Best thing we can do is be mindful of our teeth, because they also effect our hearts, and use that as a goal to be well.",
