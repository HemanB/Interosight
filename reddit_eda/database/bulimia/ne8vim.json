On or off?\n\nBut a slow roll down a hill, getting slightly better over time.\n\nProgress isn't linear. It's okay to mess up. Just keep trying \u2764\ufe0f\n\nEdit: but if your progress was an on/off switch then that's great, I'm not trying to invalidate that. This is just my own experience.",

I manage my bulimia and although of course it isn\u2019t normal, I can live my life with it and I still work on it. It doesn\u2019t figure hugely in my life - not like it used to.
