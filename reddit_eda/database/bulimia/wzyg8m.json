  "selftext": "My local grocery store just rearranged everything, including the pharmaceutical/supplement section. I was running low on laxatives, so I went to look for them. I was looking throughout the weightloss section and couldn\u2019t find any. I was there for a good 15 minutes, until a lady that worked at the store asked what I was looking for. I reluctantly told her laxatives. And she went \u201coh honey, laxatives are never under the weightloss section\u201d and asked me if I was ok. Bless her but I had never been so embarrassed in my life",
