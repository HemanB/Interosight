It allows me to plan for my day, and keep me going through life when I\u2019m feeling sad about something else. It makes me feel a little less empty sometimes. I feel like it is a coping mechanism (maybe not a good one) but it keeps me from feeling suicidal. Does anyone else feel like this?",

I've had it for over thirteen years and to some extent, it will always be a part of me but I've structured my days and my identity around this disorder for so long that I wonder how much of it has shaped my interests, coping mechanisms, likes, dislikes, and everything else about me. It's scary to let it go and have the extra burden of rediscovering myself.",

(I have depression and most times I can\u2019t do these things ) . I kinda felt like I was losing weight and that made me hopeful about my future.But then I started binging 2 days ago I don\u2019t know how to feel right now. I don\u2019t want to do anything anymore ,just eat and sleep. It feels soo dumb but it\u2019s so frustrating.",

      "body": "I relate to this and it's usually what I fall back on when I feel low or empty... I find myself nostalgic for the worst times in my life and now I can see that it's because it was simple and structured. I literally had nothing to care about other than controling food and working out! It was incredibly sad and I messed up school and all my friendships ( and my health still to this day sadly) but it was ok buecause I had my miserable story going on.\nThe simple and clear goals can calm the existential dread that I think anyone who's slightly neuro divergent is filled with at least semi often when the world gets quiet. There's no clear meaning or path in life so to treat life like a weird sick video game quest arch feels easier. \nI'm recovered(ing) now and I've found that accepting the realities of the world and enjoying them is what has kept me going.. I can't say I don't weirdly get triggered and think about how being a BPD nut job who does drugs and doesn't eat is so ~sexy~ because it's the past! And craving that is normal. It's okay to talk about it this way because eating disorders are just coping mechanisms and it's okay to admit it",

It\u2019s not the eating disorder that\u2019s \u201cwrong\u201d but rather that other parts of life lack purpose and beauty and meaning worth giving up the eating disorder for. I\u2019m thankful for what my eating disorder gave me when I was in such a dark place. And I built up a life worth living without an eating disorder and now I\u2019m happy without it. But I don\u2019t think of it as the worst thing ever. It had a purpose and helped me at that time get through what\u2019s actually worse- feeling helpless, hopeless, like you have nothing worth living for.",

If I'm planning calories, then it's a distraction from other bad things in my life. I get a sense of achievement every day I don't binge. My exercise obsession gives me daily endorphin highs. Ultimate happiness for me is weight loss. Unfortunately that means weight gain is incredibly mentally difficult to cope with.\n\nWhen my mum got diagnosed with cancer, food was there for me, and I could numb myself with binges and switch off from the depression I felt. I dont know what I'd do without this coping mechanism.\n\nI'm trying to pick up some more hobbies because I don't want to look back on my life and think of all the things I missed out on. I think I'm getting better at making my ED more balanced with other parts of my life, instead of trying to get rid of it completely. It definitely gives me a sense of control over my life, which I think is pretty common amongst ED sufferers.",
