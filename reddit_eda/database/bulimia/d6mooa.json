If it is indeed true that we may feel less alone when seeing these kind of posts, on the other hand, they are not actually helping or being positive. \n\nIts not a positive thing to post these kinds of pictures and be like \"ah well i guess im gonna purge oops\". Because it does indeed make it seem okay, as it is being validated by peers.\n\nIts not okay. We are sick and we should all make an effort to be positive to one another and construct a positive reality where it is NOT okay to have this kind of behaviour in our lives. We have to learn to like ourselves more.\n\nThe other day i had a relapse and was alone. E freaked out. I came to this sub and posted about it. So im guilty of doing it too. But in hindsight probably wasnt the correct thing to do. Aren't there flairs in this sub where it mau be appropriate to post these type pf behaviour? \n\nWhy aren't we all more positive and supportive like people over at r/loseit? Where are the mods?",
