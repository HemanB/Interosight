  "selftext": "I am 3 days purge free after months of failed recoveries and not keeping anything down. I feel\u2026 clean. No puke on the sleeves of my clothes, acne clearing up, my skin is less dry, I actually leave my room and talk to my roommates, calling my friends and family just to chat, responding to texts and emails, doing my school work. I know it is only 3 days in, and I am having to ignore the urges constantly still, but all of these are reasons to keep going. I look prettier, like I am happier, despite the bloat I do have. I am just allowing myself to wear baggy sweaters and comfy pants, knowing it will go down and my body is adapting and healing inside. We can all do this.",
