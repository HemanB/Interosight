  "selftext": "Before I binge and purge, I always weigh myself. Whenever I\u2019m finished purging, I somehow weigh 3-5 pounds less than I did before the binge. I know it\u2019s probably just water weight, but Ed loves this. My brain tells me this is amazing. I can eat all this food, get rid of it, then weigh even less than before? Wow. What\u2019s the point of keeping any food down if I can just do this AND lose weight?\n\nI want to recover. I do. But my bulimia is out of control. It has taken over my brain. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong and what\u2019s right anymore, I just know what makes Ed happy. That\u2019s all I care about.",

      "body": "It\u2019s not real weight loss. I used to think this way too, but then the moment I started eating normally (even tiny portions) again, I\u2019d gain all of it back and more because your body wants to hold onto all that water weight because you\u2019re dehydrating yourself so badly. \n\nMy reasoning for it still being a net negative is that I\u2019d have to purge every day to see that (false) weight loss - and I care about the puffiness and size of my jaws/face, which swell, and my teeth, which could cost thousands in treatment if I continued. I\u2019m unwilling to purge every day for the rest of my life just to try to see an inaccurate portrayal of my weight (and if I tried to eat normally, have the scale go up like 5 pounds in a single day).",

Therapy is great, it made me realize that I'm not alone! And that bulemia can be resolved, please remember that you can overcome it! I never knew that.\n\nI don't know how things work where you live but can you get money back when you do your taxes? Again, so sorry that it costs so much and I hope you find a way to get help!",
