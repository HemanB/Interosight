  "selftext": "One of the main things I noticed that keeps me from not purging anymore is that I'm obsessed with the *feeling* of after I purge, because it makes me feel cleaner, and empty (obviously). \n\nAfter a binge I feel so bloated and gross so I always rationalize and purge. Then I rehydrate  and use mouthwash so my mouth feels clean too. \n\nIt's so tempting because in my mind I'm like \"girl, you know after you get rid of all this you will feel so much lighter and less bloated and after using the mouthwash you just won't eat again.\" \n\nDoes anyone else feel extreeeeeemly obsessed with that \"clean\" feeling? How can I cut this dumb rationale and stop once and for all?",

I'm on day 116 (almost 4 months) without vomitting and a week without laxatives - and I can tell you - it is totally worth it and i feel \"clean\" - because my body is now doing itself the things that I did \"for it\". The first month or two - I was still anxious, but kept in mind that THIS WILL PASS and talking to 2 other girls in recovery on a daily basis and keeping a journal helped me not to give in. Then I started eating more and more normal (i could eat out without knowing how many calories there are in the food, i could eat in front of other people, i could eat \"bad\" foods), and i started eating actual meals instead of 1 egg and a cucumber that would turn in a nightmare binge of a Nutella jar and ice cream. Finally I gave up laxatives as well which was THE hardest step of them all. And now - f\\*\\*\\* yeah - I can feel my body again. Like me and the body are in sync. Super awesome feeling, wouldn't trade it for anything.\n\nBest of luck, love yourself, take care and I hope you find your way out!",

And I like how you said that your body started to do what you were trying to do for it. To me that is so encouraging because I know that is my main issue with bulimia is trying to control how my body functions, which leads to all the bloat and grossness when the digestive system is shot. I hope to get to that level of not purging at all like you have soon! \n\n Keep on keeping on!! And thank you, I'll try my best to kick bulimia in the a$$! \ud83d\ude00\u2764\u2764\u2764",
