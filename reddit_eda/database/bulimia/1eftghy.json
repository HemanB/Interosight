Everything will be so much better without me.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for the negative energy, but I have no where to vent\u2026 and this is truly how I feel",

This won't be your forever, things will change. Even if the b'p stays, you will live your life, new things will happen, you will see new things happen to people you care about.
