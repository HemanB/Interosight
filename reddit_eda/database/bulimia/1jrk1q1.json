  "selftext": "Every time someone notices that I overeat, they don't find it concerning, they find it to be a silly little trait. Just me having a sweet tooth. Big appetite.\n\nThe worst is when I tried to tell my mom about my binging problem. She just said to just not eat so much, that I just need to tell myself no... Like... She keeps making comments about my overeating, even to others. And the absolutely worst is she keeps buying my fear foods AFTER I begged her not to. \"Just control yourself\" \"You don't have to eat it in one sitting.\"\n\nI hate how it's Not viewed as a problem, but the moment she found out I went a day without eating anything she became so concerned, telling me how dangerous it is, how I need to eat ASAP or I might collapse or develop an eating disorder (\ud83d\udc80).\n\nRestricting is disorded, but so is binging and I am so tired of listening to people talking about it as if it's just me being a little bit more hungry and not a problem. It is a problem.\n\nSo many people don't get help because of this...",

It\u2019s painful because you can\u2019t even control your own body, so it\u2019s not only physically but psychologically devastating also.
