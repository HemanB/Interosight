  "selftext": "I didn\u2019t purge my dinner. After a full day of bingeing and purging multiple times, I decided to keep my dinner down. I\u2019m struggling with the guilt hardcore right now and I\u2019m balancing between purging and just sitting through it. I definitely ate more than I planned but I\u2019m not uncomfortably full. I am uncomfortable with having food inside me and the numbers on the scale before going to bed, but I am sticking through it. \nFolks, this is hard. I\u2019m writing this to distract myself from a purge. I\u2019m reminding myself I did a lot of damage today, and it\u2019s ok to give my body a break. My jaw is killing me, I don\u2019t want to be in more pain. \n\nIt\u2019s hard. This is HARD, but I\u2019m going to be stronger than that voice in my head.",
