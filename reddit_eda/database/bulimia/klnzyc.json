And I was like you. In pain, but never enough to cause me to stop. (But tbh I had some other issues, and got hooked on DPH and would literally be high in my bathroom in agonizing pain, and throwing up with inability to feel my limbs. Each time I\u2019d say I\u2019d need to stop because a DPH high is the absolute fucking worst and yet I never stopped. Another story, for another time.)\n\nI think I gave myself a hernia (or a fissure or a hemorrhoid. Idek tbh) twice. One night I was just hunched over for hours and in extreme pain. I finally... finished.... my business and went on my way. Albeit in pain. The second time was significantly worse, even though it lasted less time (initially.) I remember literally counting being in the bathroom pushing for 5.5 HOURS. I definitely ended up with a hemorrhoid (or hernia? fissure?). Literally went to work in so much pain, and couldn\u2019t stand correctly because of how much pain I was in. That plus the fact that I basically just\npushed water through my bowel system for a few weeks in length, gave me the sensibility to at least ease up on the laxatives. I still take them if I have a bad purge. But definitely not daily anymore, and I\u2019m thankful for it. This year has kicked me in the rear.",
