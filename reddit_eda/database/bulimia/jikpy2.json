I feel so sad, ugly, fat and worthless.\nMaybe my bulimia is getting better, but my depression and anxiety are getting worse, because I overeat and without puking, I am gaining weight, and now I look ever uglier. I already sucked, now I am just awful and I cant snap out of this mood. Since I stopped puking, I don't go out, i don't take care of my self, I don't even shower. I spend my time in bed waiting for the day to end. And eating, obviously. It's my only source of joy considering I am lonely as hell. I want to die.",

      "body": "Eating disorders and other things sometimes work out a dynamic, and it may be difficult to pinpoint exactly what came first, but if something gets better, often something else will get worse. It\u2019s like some shitty live action wack-a-mole. There are things that I become acutely aware of when I\u2019m binging but not purging, like how puffy my face feels and how distended my stomach is. It\u2019s hard to rationalize that it\u2019s just part of standard bloating procedure with binges or overeating, and not a lot of weight gain, and that makes everything feel more shitty. I don\u2019t know if my anecdotes can be of any help, but, since you do not feel happy for going 15 days without purging, just for now I will feel proud and happy on your behalf.",

      "body": "Sometimes, forcing ourselves to get up and make the right choices is the only way to get ourselves out of the rut. Decide a day when you determine that this is the end of it, it won\u2019t be the absolute end because it doesn\u2019t work like that, but you\u2019ll make progress. Go for a walk, or talk to a friend. Actively make good choices and distract yourself, imo the best distraction is working for that feeling of accomplishment, be it through whatever- making a craft, cooking something good, or holding out till the end of the workout.  You\u2019re strong and I believe in you!",

A tip may be try to find out if you prefer showering in the mornings, during the day or in the evenings before bed, that can make a big difference. Your body deserves respect, regardless how you feel about it.",

But the truth is that once you build a healthy relationship to food, you\u2019ll stop emotionally eating and overeating and lose that excess weight. Right now you\u2019ve only stopped half of the bulimia, the puking, but the other half is the binging and compulsive eating. It\u2019s a process but you need to accept that eventually it will succeed and you\u2019ll be able to be ate a healthy weight and maintain it. Just remember that the way you\u2019re feeling right now is TEMPORARY! Feel free to reach out to me \u2764\ufe0f",
