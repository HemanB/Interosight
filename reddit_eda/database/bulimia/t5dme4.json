I see old pictures and think \"omg I looked perfectly fine\" but at the time I felt so horribly overweight. Honestly, it took actually becoming overweight to realize that I was fine the way I was before.  Thought distortions are real as fuck. I don't have much advice bc I'm still nowhere near recovered, but I want you to know that the way you feel about your body can absolutely change over time. \n\nWell fitting clothes help a lot- attempting to squeeze into clothes that don't fit anymore will make you feel way worse. Making sure your digital diet includes images of healthy and diverse bodies can be really helpful as well. It's hard not to feel overweight when all the images you see are idealized and edited bodies. Stay strong!! You're going to be okay, and you'll thank yourself later when you're stronger and healthier. There's definitely more to life than being skinny and obsessing about food!! I sometimes miss the way I used to look, but I don't miss the self loathing and anxiety. I felt a lot better about myself now, even though I need to lose some weight. You deserve to take some time and celebrate all the beautiful things about yourself OTHER than your looks \u2661",
