The most frustrating thing to me is people who are clearly not bulimic who are asking if their brand new binging and purging habit makes them \u201cvalid.\u201d The answer is no, and they should get told to stop. I\u2019m tired of seeing comments that are telling people they are \u201cvalid\u201d and thus encouraging behaviors that are not good for them.

What worked for me was kind of the opposite to most of the traditional parroted advice.\u00a0\n\n\nA **medical** professional and not a cheap one either, was **integral** to getting to this stage of recovery for me.\u00a0 What I spent on her was probably 1% of what I spent on binging over my life so it was worthwhile. Whatever she did got me out of well into extreme (for 12 years) down to mild (for the last 3). Even though that's measured officially in amounts of binging and purging, I also see their are substantial lifestyle and behavior differences.\n\n\nGood luck to you and anyone reading this.",
