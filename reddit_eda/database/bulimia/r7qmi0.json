  "selftext": "I had my whole day planned out, what I could eat for a reasonable calorie deficit while eating frequently, feeling satiated (in order to not binge) but never to full (to prevent purge triggers). I had it planned. My friends/coworkers wanted to spontaneously go out for beers and pizza at a brewery and I went but it threw off everything. I feel like I got sabotaged. Social situations make me feel like I'm not in control, restaurant food is so hard to track and the uncertainty of what I ate is stressing me out. I want everyone to leave me alone so I can do what I need to do in peace. I find myself resenting my friends and backing out of more social events and I hate it but i also hate how these events, which always center around food, make me feel.",

One thing that I\u2019ve started doing is still going to the gatherings but getting a soda water instead of alcohol. Especially if it\u2019s frequent (I had two friend hang outs this week). And going for coffee instead of drinks. It\u2019s weird at first, but honestly it gets more comfortable throughout the night as your friends accept that you\u2019re not drinking. Drinking makes me feel so out of control with my b/p, but I can still hang out with my friends and not miss out. I don\u2019t want my ED to completely take my life away and missing social events is a big red flag that it\u2019s taking over your life. It\u2019s ok to miss a few of course. I just tell my friends I have a busy day tomorrow but still want to hang out. It\u2019s mostly true and I don\u2019t want to feel like trash from a late b/p mostly. The food part is still hard and trying to figure that out slowly.",

I was planning my life around food and this illness, and resenting anyone who I felt got in my way. \nI found OA through a friend of mine and I am grateful every day, because I can honestly say I am free from the insanity around food that has plagued me most of my life. Working the 12 steps with a recovered sponsor not only saved my life, but it has helped me reach a level of recovery that allows me to go anywhere and do anything without fear, without needing to control my environment, and without having to restrict any foods.
