  "selftext": "Just spent $300 buying binge food to finish it all in a single episode. I feel like trash. Im broke, like this is money that\u2019s come from selling collectables Ive had since I was 8 and I still can\u2019t stop. \nI feel disgusting. $300 is over a MONTH of groceries for some people. I vomited everything until there was blood. This is going to kill me I\u2019m going insane. It\u2019s not even about the weight at this point. Make me 10 kilos heavier just TAKE THE BULIMIA AWAY. I\u2019m in outpatient treatment but we haven\u2019t really gotten anywhere. \n\nAnyways little rant over. If there\u2019s anyone in the \u2018beginning\u2019 of this- STOP IT. It\u2019s an ADDICTION. You WILL lose grip and go insane. \n\n ",

I think I only managed to shake the habit because I had to move back to the rural area my mum lives in and there's no delivery out here.\n\nThere's more time to question your life choices when you have to drive 15 minutes to get take away.",

And i\u2019m not rich or have money from anyone. I just have worked alot and unfortunately haven\u2019t saved anything yet. This eating disorder has only maintained or made me gain a bit over the last 6 years. It is not worth it. Also the reality of it is, if you are wanting to let whatever ed get you to a very unhealthy place, being very thin, very weak, fragile, fatigued, you need to have financial support and an environment and lifestyle that allowed you to get that bad. I\u2019m 21 and support myself, this ed already takes a huge toll on my energy, my immune system and overall mental health. Supporting yourself is already hard enough. I definitely wish I never started in the first place.",
