  "selftext": "We still live in a world where anorexia is kind of the \u201cgolden standard\u201d of the eating disorders in terms of MANY things and it\u2019s a prevalent issue that I\u2019ve noticed in eating disorder treatment centers as well. It always feels like it\u2019s automatically assumed restriction is always the main root of our other behaviors like binging... when that is not always the case. I wish there were more treatment centers that specialized in binge eating and bulimia and had actual separate tracks for that instead of combining everyone together because personally I find it quite difficult to relate with the community at times and it sends me back into restriction behaviors that usually aren\u2019t a main issue for me when I\u2019m not in treatment. Treatment centers always say they have \u201cindividualized treatment\u201d yet treat every case as a restriction-rooted disorder as if anorexia is the only disorder.. and this is a problem. I know all eating disorders can relate to each other in many ways but they are also quite different and should be treated in their respective ways that would be most effective and beneficial for the individual. If I go into treatment for thousands of dollars, I want to be in an environment that is actually healing, attuned to my needs and emotions, around a community I can relate to and be treated in modalities I can benefit from. Because damn it \u201cfood is medicine\u201d for you but could literally KILL me through rupturing my stomach RIGHT NOW.",

As frustrating as it may be, you CAN find freedom. It is not easy. And it isn't fast, perfect or pretty! BUT it is possible. I was sure I would die from a ruptured stomach from the force of puking one day. But here I am! No desire to binge! I can eat normal freaking portions of whatever I want and not even think twice! I can say no to desserts simply because I don't feel like having it! But I can also have it and not completely lose control.\n\nIts fucking amazing being recovered. Keep trying!!!",
