I also was able to finally sort out what foods I am okay with eating, & which foods trigger me & to stay away from, & slowly feel better about the things I am okay with consuming if I feel it's gonna make me healthier, ya know helpful, not harmful.\n\nIt's hard I know but when you are ready, it does get better, absolutely, and spirituality helped me a lot as well.
