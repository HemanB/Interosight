  "selftext": "Hey guys,I hope everyone is doing okay, so I've been trying to recover from bulimia for the past 3 months and nothing worked but today I binged and I had the urge to puke but I didn't give in. I felt disgusted and hated how my body looked because I felt like puking is the only way to be skinny which is stupid I know :( \nI want to know if I'm in the right track or not like is it good that i just dealt with the binging and did not purge ?",

If we can find a new basis for livingthat does not require eating or compensating for overeating to feel better, where we can find comfort that is lasting that we never got from food anyway-then we are getting outselves out of the hole. \n\nWhen I learned that I had a mental problem that caused my eating behaviors, and that I was powerless over it myself no matter how smart or hard I tried and had to find something outside of me to solve the problem for me, that was when I started making headway because the 12steps were the last option on the block. and low and behold they work beautifully when I work them.",
