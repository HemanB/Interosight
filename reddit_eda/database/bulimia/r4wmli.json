But after reading that thread about all the horrible health problems this can cause (thanks to the person who posted that) I think I found the willpower to beat this. I have two young daughters and I need to be alive for them and I need for them to have a healthy relationship with food. I\u2019m their example. So today is day one of me really wanting to get better, something I\u2019ve never felt before. I\u2019m removing the \u201cundo button\u201d as an option in my head. It is no longer an option. \n\nWish me luck.",
