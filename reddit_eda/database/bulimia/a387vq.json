  "selftext": "My mother made me eat a huge dinner and I felt super guilty. She was cleaning around the house so I couldn't purge there without being heard. So I got into my car and drove to my local beach. It was pitch black outside and very cold so I knew nobody else would be at the beach. I purge at the beach and it's so fucking messy. Vomit all over my shoes, my pants and my jacket. I smell so bad. All I have is toilet paper to clean myself up. It's not getting the job done. I panic and realise that I need to go home and shower asap. But I can't walk into my house covered in vomit because my mother will see. There's no good excuse I could give for how awful I look and smell. I need to get rid of the evidence somehow.\n\nSo what do I do? I walk straight into the sea up to waist level. It's close to freezing temperature so the icy chill of the water is physically painful. My shoes and clothes are soaked. It is completely dark outside and I'm standing in the sea, fully clothed and covered in vomit. Completely fucking insane. \n\nI go home and tell my mother I fell into the sea while taking a walk. She looks at me as if I'm nuts. If only she knew just how nuts I really am. Bulimia is making me do the stupidest things. What is my life? Why am I like this? And especially, Why can't I stop myself?",

      "body": "I used to sneak out as a teen after meals, into one of our fields (we lived in the country) and puke my dinner up, then bury it. It happened so often that one day, when I was outside with my siblings playing, my brother wondered what all the weird rotting piles were....so humiliating. There were literally over 50 vomit piles, poorly covered with pine needles and leaf litter, dotted about beneath the treelines.\n\nI get it, it's awful. The shame, the secrecy, the lying. Recovery is worth the effort even just to stop with those scenarios, sneaking away and doing weird things so you can purge safely. I've been dealing with bulimia personally for years and years and years. It really ingrains itself into our core the longer we suffer and engage in the behaviours/cycle, it's extremely difficult to stop, especially alone. The loneliness of the disease bothers me more than the actual purging/binging.\nBut it doesn't have to stay that way. You CAN get better, you have to start by making the difficult choice of telling someone. Be it a parent, friend, therapist or support group, find someone and keep them in the loop, ask for help. It's a cycle of anxiety that triggers eating, which triggers binging, then purging, then release...in other words it's an addiction as much as it's a mental illness. You should treat it as both, starting with being kind to yourself. I believe you can beat this animal!! On the days where it feels like bulimia is part of you, know that you're not it and you have the ability to attain your freedom, it just doesn't come easy, nothing hard ever does but it's worth it. \n\nFor what it's worth, we are strangers but you have my support xx",
