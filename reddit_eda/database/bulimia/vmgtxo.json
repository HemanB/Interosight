My mom yelled at me because she had just gotten home and wanted me to be carrying in groceries, and I fucking yelled back, \u201cI just shit myself\u201d. Lesson learned: do not take more than the recommended dose of lax. Ever. I\u2019m so embarrassed and kind of stunned. Eating disorders are sooo glamorous /s",
