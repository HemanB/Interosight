I would lose control and feel like I was possessed before I realised my stomach was straining from food, because they \"weren't that bad before\". So just remember a binge is loss of control and habitual, it can't be determined by the food itself.",

A \"binge\" to me personally is an extra serving at dinner, dessert, and maybe an extra snack in a day, all of which I purge. There are rare nights where I full on gorge myself at 2 am and eat everything in sight until I feel sick. These are more true \"binges\" but I totally understand what you mean. It's a nasty habit of categorizing every extra bite of food over my calorie limit as \"binging\" And I think this extreme attitude is what led to me purging. Super frustrating. I wish you the best!",
