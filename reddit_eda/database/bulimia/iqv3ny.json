  "selftext": "I turned bulimic in anorexia recovery. I\u2019m nearly at a healthy weight now, after years of being severely underweight. But I miss it. I miss being thin, I miss my bones, I miss being able to barely eat. I\u2019m just not capable of it anymore. I\u2019m just bingeing and purging and trying to stick to my meal plan and bingeing and restricting again. It\u2019s so rough. People on here are barely eating outside of binges but sadly I am. I\u2019m trying again to eat healthy everyday. And I fail everyday. I purge and then restrict but then I try to get back on track. Is this weird? Am I weird? Am I a fake bulimic? What EVEN am I? \ud83d\ude2d",
