Because it\u2019s not about weight, and we all know that. It\u2019s about being comfortable in your own hell. But there\u2019ll come a time where, TRUST ME, that hell won\u2019t be comfortable anymore. It\u2019ll burn, it\u2019ll be exhausting at the point you\u2019ll have no more reasons to live, being thin neither will be enough for you to continue with life. \nPlease listen to me, you\u2019re loved and nobody actually cares about your weight, nobody cares about your legs touching together, nobody. NOBODY. and you shouldn\u2019t either. You have so much potential, you can do so many things with your mind and your hands, why are you precluding yourself that. Why. \nI really hope to get better, step by step. I\u2019ve started taking meds three days ago for bulimia and BPD and it\u2019s an enormous step for me. I\u2019ve made the choice to start living. And you should too. \ud83d\udc9c\n",
