  "selftext": "I was you just a couple short weeks ago.\n\nYou might be reading posts where people warn that they can\u2019t stop, and think that won\u2019t be you. \u201cI just want to lose weight and stop hating myself, I\u2019ll be able to stop.\u201d\n\nWhat you won\u2019t see coming is the disorder will start to consume you much past your physical hatred.\n\nDo you feel lonely? Maybe something similar mentally? You\u2019ll start to feel intense comfort not letting your body feel full and physically matching the way you feel mentally. \n\nDo not underestimate how addicting the feeling of \u201ccontrol\u201d is in constantly purging out food.\n\nSuddenly, you\u2019ll find yourself on vacation where you had a couple drinks and a high calorie pasta dish. And when you go to walk back to your hotel, you can feel it in your stomach. Then you feel your heart rate speed up, and you begin to sweat, and you begin to run back to the hotel panicking and thinking only about how you have to purge ASAP. \n\nThen your vacation is spent crying on the bathroom floor over the toilet. \n\nAnd it\u2019s a lot harder to pretend you\u2019re in control.\n\nIf you\u2019re still in the stage where you aren\u2019t addicted, I know you probably won\u2019t listen to any of these warning posts. But I still hope you will. :(",

I couldn\u2019t write this better.. this is actually my first ever comment on reddit. never had the need i guess, but this just made me do it.. the feeling of the full stomach is something i think I will never get rid of. the constant thinking about purging even after a small snack. i wish i could turn back time and never get into this cycle. i pray everyday before sleep that i\u2019ll stop. However at the end of the day i always end up with my head in the toilet. i wish somebody would just help me, but at the same time i don\u2019t want help, because that would mean i have to recover and i\u2019m just not ready to do that",
