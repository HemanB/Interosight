  "selftext": "My son just made us a huge breakfast. He worked so hard and was so proud. He commented on how happy he was that I was enjoying it so much but the whole time I was just thinking about how I needed to cram as much in so I'd have a decent purge. I felt so guilty when it came time to lock myself in the bathroom just to waste all he had done to make everyone happy. Does anyone else experience this?",
