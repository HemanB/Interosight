If I hadn\u2019t stopped when I did, I would have ended up homeless within a couple of months. Instead I ended up being able to live comfortably and buy healthier foods, which helped recovery even more.\n\nI came across this thread though because I just relapsed. I haven\u2019t purchased anything to eat but my mum brought biscuits around a while ago that just sat in the cupboard for months, until now. It\u2019s crazy how quickly things can change, but at least now I know that there really is a way out, no matter how far down the rabbit hole you are.\n\nYou can get through this.",
