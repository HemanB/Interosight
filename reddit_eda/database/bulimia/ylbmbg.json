I had gotten to a very successful/happy place in life and was ruining it because of my eating disorder (was isolating myself, and frequently fighting with my partner because my mood swings were so bad). I had a team that included a specialized ed therapist and a dietitian that kept me accountable at the beginning and helped teach me tools to challenge some of the ed thoughts. It was a lot of hard work.",
