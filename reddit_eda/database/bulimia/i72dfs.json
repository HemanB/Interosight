  "selftext": "Once I threw up in a Mac Donald\u2019s paper bag on a train because no one was around but I carried it to the bathroom on the next carriage to flush and the bag split and vomit went all over the shoes of loads of people and they had to hit the emergency button so the train stopped and everyone had to get off and wait for a new train because an ungodly amount of vomit had to be cleaned up....\n\nI have hundreds of these haunting memories to keep me up at night. Looking back I can say why didn\u2019t I wait to do it somewhere private or even better resist the urge to purge all together....\nBut under the spell of my disorder, it\u2019s not that simple and I physically couldn\u2019t help myself.\nSo be kind to yourself and know you are doing the best you can right now.",

It took us days to realize that it happened because the broken pipe was in the basement of the house. So while I was silently dropping kilos of vomit in his toilets, trying my best to be discrete, those kilos of vomit were spreading all over the basement.It was August in Sardinia, so it quickly began to smell seriously weird. After some days, as  we were expecting guests for dinner, my father went down to check what is going on and what can smell that bad, and discovered this great surprise: a week of vomit, among the other stuff that usually go in the toilets... I was there with my (now ex) (but not for this reason) boyfriend, my brother, and other family members, none of which knew about my ED of course. I got the biggest panic when I realized what happened, and didn't find any other solution than pretending I don't understand and take my boyfriend for a tour so that he doesn't smell too much and doesn't ask too many questions.We in the end decided to have diner at a friend house instead, and I helped my poor father clean the mess down. Also he had to buy new pipes and pay someone to install them.",
