  "selftext": "I think I am in shock...as of this morning, I have gone 3 FULL DAYS without binging and/or purging. !3 DAYS! It has been YEARS since I have gone that long without a single b/p! I honestly can't believe it! Considering 2 months ago (before I went to hospital - not for an ED admission, general psychiatric) I was purging 3+ times a day... I am absolutely blown away that I have made it over 3 days without purging! When my psychiatrist told me she wanted to try a new medication to help with the bulimia, I was more than a little sceptical. Honestly, I had just resigned myself to the fact that I would be purging for the rest of my life...but maybe there is hope? Maybe it doesn't have to be the life sentence I believe it to be? \n\nWill I make it to 4 days? I have no idea lol. There is a good chance I wont...I'm trying not to put pressure on myself, but I have never been good at taking it easy on myself. It seems stupid to get so excited about a mere 72 hours out of my entire life, and so many of you amazing people have been purge-free for weeks, months, years! My 3 days seems a bit pathetic by comparison lmao.\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading! I feel like you all will understand what I am feeling better than anyone in my life can...and I just wanted to share it with some people who know what a challenge this has been for me.\n\nSending you all love, support, and strength \u2661\n\nEdit: because I can't do maths and count the hours in 3 days correctly hahaha",

I've heard nothing but success stories from people taking it for both ADHD and BED/ BN; hopefully with continued successes, it'll become more widely used and help more people!",

I've managed one day, on two occasions, years apart. I've also had an ED for most of my life, but B/P has been primary for me for the last almost 20 years. \n\nThree days is a massive accomplishment, and should not be downplayed. Even if it stops at three days, you now know you can, and next time you can go for four, if you feel up to it. \n\nI appreciate you sharing this, because to me it's a sign that I can maybe do it too, as you sound like you're in a similar position as I am. \n\nMay I ask what the meds are that you've started? I'm willing to try anything that could help, to be honest.",

I have faith that when the time comes, you too will make it 3 days b/p free. Then more \u2661\u2661\u2661\n\nThe medication she started me on is called Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine). It's an ADHD medication so we are also using it to manage those symptoms. It is also used to help treat binge eating disorder, which is basically half of bulimia. The goal is that if I am reducing/eliminating the binges, then there will be less purging. Apparently it works to not only reduce appetite (because its a stimulant) but also regulate impulse control with binges. It has taken me a little while with tweaking the dose but now I think the dose shes put me on is the right one for me. I know sometimes it can be a bit hard to get the script for these types of meds because they're highly addictive, but according to my psychiatrist the bulimia is so severe that we need to try some more unconventional treatment options. I hope you can find a doctor who can prescribe it to you because I genuinely think this has made a huge shift in my life.",
