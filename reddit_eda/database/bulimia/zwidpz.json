This is my first real serious relapse in about 3 or so years. I know what Im doing is wrong, but it's comforting to know I'm not alone. I hope we all get better, and if someone hasn't told you today, or you don't feel it today, I hope you get better, and I hope you take my advice, and I hope I take my own advice, you'll stop and you'll beat this like the times before. I just want you to love yourself I hope we both can eventually too xx",
