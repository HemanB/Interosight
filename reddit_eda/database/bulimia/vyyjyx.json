Deep down I feel like I\u2019d go back to it if all these other silly little coping skills stop getting me by.

I am so aware of how screwed up that is but this is what i feel. At the end of the day, i hate myself for being weak and fat yet zero resolve to actually lose weight healthily. However, that calm after a purge is addictive. As if i hit a reset button and everything is now ok. I can start afresh. The thing is I'm gaining weight, so i know it doesn't work, obviously, but knowing is not the same as feeling. It doesn't help that i perceive purging as an emotional reset button for other issues even non-food related ones. I know it is extremely damaging to your physical body, it is just that i don't feel like i have a solution to my real issues so i purge just to feel a sense of control and peace in that moment.

I know I\u2019d just feel so much better if I could just effectively throw up my insides. \n\nI know logically that even if it tried to throw up now I\u2019d still be retaining all the calories I\u2019ve eaten over the weeks, so it\u2019s pointless from a weight management standpoint. But I might feel so much better, assuming it comes up and doesn\u2019t get stuck or anything. I think if I\u2019d just been purging instead of holding it in, I might not feel so horrid right now. It really is so hard to beat.",
