  "selftext": "I never thought I\u2019d say this, but I miss my anorexia. Even though I was miserable back then, I felt like I had control over myself, I felt clean, and I loved being thin. Now, with bulimia, I feel dirty, disgusting, and like I\u2019ve lost the little control I thought I had.\n\nSince developing this disorder, I\u2019ve gained weight. Today, I\u2019m at a \"healthy\" thin weight now, but I feel horrible about it. I can\u2019t accept my \"normal\" body. I miss my sick body, the mindset that made me \"strong\" enough not to eat instead of losing control with binge episodes followed by purging.\n\nI know neither of these conditions is healthy, but I can\u2019t help missing that feeling of being in control.\n\nDoes anyone else feel this way? I\u2019m trying to understand my own thoughts and emotions, but it\u2019s so confusing and lonely.",

It's so important to acknowledge the pain and confusion behind this thought process, but let\u2019s gently challenge some of the disordered logic here:\n\n**ED**: \"Anorexia made me feel in control.\"  \n\n**Reality**: Anorexia creates an illusion of control, but it\u2019s the disorder controlling you\u2014not the other way around.

True control comes from making decisions that align with your health and values, not a disorder's demands.\n\n**ED**: \"Anorexia made me feel clean, and bulimia makes me feel dirty and disgusting.\"  \n\n**Reality**: These are moral judgments that eating disorders impose on behaviors, but eating or even purging doesn't determine your worth or cleanliness. These feelings often stem from shame and guilt, which are perpetuated by the disorder itself. Your inherent worth is not tied to your body or your behaviors.\n\n**ED**: \"I miss my sick body and the strength it gave me to not eat.\"  \n\n**Reality**: That \"sick body\" was not a sign of strength but of suffering. Your body deserves nourishment, care, and compassion.
