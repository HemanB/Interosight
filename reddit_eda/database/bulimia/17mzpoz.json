  "selftext": "I'm just curious, how long has everyone struggled with bulimia? I'm a 39 year old female and I've been bulimic for 26 years (since 13). I think the longest I've ever gone without b/p was 22 days. My worst periods were freshman year of college, 2 years ago, and right now. I'm also a recovering alcoholic (sober 3 years, after 13 years of daily drinking). I feel really trapped in the cycle, and I don't know what to do. I'm so sneaky. Lately I have spent an obscene amount of money on food that literally goes down the toilet. I'm not sure how much longer I can physically or mentally do this. I'm in AA and another 12 step program and I see a therapist. I honestly don't know what my problem is.",

      "body": "Started when I was 13, I turned 47 in September. So 34 years and counting. Longest I have gone \"clean\" was about 2-3 months which was due to the fact that I had cancer (late 2021-early 2022), in my sinus cavity, and the chemo and esp radiation to my face... I literally lost ALL taste. Dry mouth that caused sores, if I did eat I couldnt handle most things and involuntarily vomited. Very very rare type of Lymphoma (NK/T Cell).\n\nCauses? Nobody can say for sure. But, 8 years of horrible emotional and verbal abuse from my husband, seriously comprised my immune system no doubt. All the years with Bulimia and yeah sometimes the vomit goes up into the sinus cavity. Periodic drug and alcohol use (which is litrrally a given for the vast majority of us with ED) over my younger years,  then some. Perfect storm I guess. \n\nI have read many medical articles stating the growing prevelence of \"older\" women with EDs. Also, somewhere was mentioned that people with Bulimia have shown to have a much higher pain tolerance than those without any ED.",

      "body": "I\u2019m 20 right now and I\u2019ve been dealing with my ED for a little over 13 years, since I was around six or seven years old (can\u2019t remember exactly bc it\u2019s just been a part of my life so long I\u2019m not 100% sure when it started, but I know I was so young the first time I purged that I didn\u2019t even know about the gag reflex). \n\nI have begun to question if it\u2019s bulimia recently though because I don\u2019t eat in super excessive amounts, but I do drink lots of water and milk and other drinks after and during meals and that kind of does the same thing, and I\u2019ve messed up my intestines so much that a \u2018normal\u2019 amount of food makes me feel overfull so in my mind it feels like a binge. And I start eating knowing I\u2019m going to purge after. I don\u2019t think I restrict enough for it to be anorexia, at least not since high school, so idk where I fit in if that makes any difference as far as for what you\u2019re wondering. I just know that I\u2019ve never met anyone else who truly gets this experience, although it\u2019s not like I talk to many people about it lol. I often feel trapped and hopeless as well. The longest I\u2019ve been without relapsing was i want to say about 4 months just recently until two weeks ago. Honestly I often worry this is going to kill me. I feel like I\u2019m just a ticking time bomb and at any time I could just drop dead while purging or pass out after eating and aspirate. I often feel sick after eating even small amounts, and I get dizziness and headaches so this is a fear I struggle with a lot. I may have a heart condition as well, still have some tests to do and everything, but it concerns me how hard and fast my heart pounds at times, after purging especially. It often feels as though I will never be able to not live like this. I mean it\u2019s been so long that it\u2019s invaded every part of my life, and no one around me even knows because I\u2019ve been so secretive about it. It feels like giving up a part of myself. I haven\u2019t purged any of my meals in about five days, which is good, but I def feel bad about eating and just letting it digest yk. \n\nPersonally, my plans are to see a therapist as soon as I can get an appointment scheduled, and I\u2019m glad you have a therapist already, I would suggest being as honest with them about this as you can. They may be able to help with coping skills you may not be aware of, or offer more intensive treatment. I can\u2019t find many in my area, but depending on where you are, you could look into support groups for bulimia and/or EDs in general. There are also online ones as well. You mentioned AA, so it\u2019s sort of a similar type of thing, obviously a bit different, but still.\n\nI also have struggled with substance use, congrats on three years of sobriety btw!!! Especially after 13 years, that\u2019s a huge accomplishment, even if you\u2019re still struggling with bulimia. I only have about 3 months but I have been thinking about drinking again a lot lately. Not sure if I even have a problem with it yk, but I do know I need to be careful because I\u2019m at risk. Just kind of wanting something else in lieu of the harmful cycle I get into with my ED. \n\nAnyway, all that said, I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re struggling and have been for so long. It hasn\u2019t been quite as long for me, but I can still understand the feelings of being trapped and not knowing what to do. I hope you can find some peace from this soon but I know it will likely be a long road to get there. \n\nWishing you the best!\ud83d\udc9b",
