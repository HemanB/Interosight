  "selftext": "I preface this by saying I love my parents so damn much. They're wonderful. But I watched my dad spend his entire life dieting - four hours in the gym a day + cutting out sugar to the point of not eating bananas. We have a rule in our house - if I eat a \"high sugar\" fruit I can't have any dessert. My dad refuses to add salt in his cooking because it's \"unhealthy\". My mum won't eat bread from the supermarket because it's \"processed\". \n\nWhen I was a kid she used to diet me to the point where I wasn't happy unless I was binging - she caught me mid - binge once and called me a fat pig who was going to eat herself into the grave. Both my parents brag when they've fasted for the day - my mum tried to stop me from taking my prescribed vitamin meds to take her herbal meds from a priest in India. One of the side effects includes Diarrhea.\n\n I stopped seeing my nutritionist because all the foods we worked on and deemed healthy together - my parents made fun of it and made gagging noises every time I made it. Shopping is \"once you lose that last couple of KG...\" And \"Did you really need to eat as much as you did... Now this dress won't fit.\"\n\nNow I'm stuck. Can't move out. Can't heal with them. Binging and purging to a point of gaining weight. And no - can't talk to them about it either because that always results in a fight. \n\nI wonder if anyone else relates to my small rant or knows how to work through it or heal while living with parents like this?",

They were divorced, and when I went to see my dad I had barely enough calories to live on and was constantly belittled for my weight and choices etc. Famine. \n\nThen I would go back to my moms house who would lavish me with treats and comfort food. Feast. \n\nAfter setting me up solidly for binge eating and bulimia, they then both went on the offensive that I was too fat. I completely feel your pain. I unfortunately was only able to truly heal when I was out of the house, but there were some things that did help me when I was living with them: \n\n- journaling, free prose no holding back etc. Talk about how what they say and how it makes you feel. \n\n- adding in foods and things vs taking them away:\nAdding in volume eating of things like kale in a delicious lemony and pecorino vinaigrette with some pine nuts, baking cabbage, baking leeks shallots and cauliflower etc. Roasting veggies has changed my life honestly - the extra fiber also helped curb some of my cravings and they are so so much better when prepared in a bountiful way, vs in a \u201cdiet\u201d way. \n\nApples and fruits readily available, having the individual packs of Barney butter (almond butter)\n\nAdding in a 10 minute walk when I\u2019m feeling triggered and mentally telling myself - \u201cif you still feel like binging after this walk you can.\u201d It can take that little time to reset. \n\nWorking with a nutritionist was helpful, but can also be challenging if the goal is weight loss Vs Bulimia recovery. For me I tried slightly modified intuitive eating, which did come with initial weight gain, but then lost a lot of my extra weight from binge eating. \n\nI hope none of these tips feel unhelpful, but they were just some small things that worked when I had less control over my family situation.",

      "body": "My mom gave me my ED!! She has body dysmorphia and is skinny and always complaining about how much weight she's put on or rejoicing over how much she lost because of having diarrhea or whatever. When I was a kid I was a bit on the chubby side (now I can see I was not really fat or obese, just chubby) and she always commented on how my outfits made my rolls pop, so I had to use loose baggy clothes to avoid this, plus she made me feel like i was huge. To make things worse, her idea of nutrition was terrible, she served spaghetti with bread (carbs over carbs) or rice or a ton of carbs, and I had to finish the whole plate. so I ended up making myself sick in my bathroom after each meal. Later I was able to go to a nutritionist and my mom absolutely obsessed over the diet and she was the one strictly following it. She recently got really sick because of a gut bacteria problem and was almost hospitalized because of unyielding diarrhea for a month, she lost 5 kg and she was over the moon because of how much weight she lost. \n\nDon't we all get our EDs from our parents?",

You need to get out. I could never heal when I lived with my mum. Or if you can\u2019t move, you\u2019ve got to be so 100% on your recovery. Literally put blinders on, keep reminding yourself that your parents opinions are not fact, they are damaging and they will not be the medicine for you to heal. Do not listen to your parents. I find it helps thinking of them as kids. They are just big wounded children playing out the traumas they\u2019ve picked up and trying to pass it on to you. Your job on this earth is to be a cycle breaker. To not let this behaviour pass on to other generations. Please know your parents are not the norm and for you to get out of this, you must completely ignore what they say and trust in the power you have within you to be successful in your recovery and thriving as a human x",

She was overweight most of my childhood and refused to go shopping, do fun things with friends or really anything that wasn\u2019t a \u201cfamily\u201d function. We went shopping when I was around 8 years old and she was crying in the dressing room because nothing fit or she didn\u2019t like how she looked. She constantly had those magazines of lose weight in 5 days etc. She never told me to lose weight but it was always there because whatever diet she was on, we all were on. My grandma would always tell me how great I looked and I could see how it made my mom feel and then I slowly started restricting food and then would binge and purge. Didn\u2019t help that it was the 90s, all my friends were skinny and people called me \u201cthick.\u201d\n\nI think the worst part was when she actually caught on to how I would shower after dinner so I could purge but I\u2019d come up with an excuse and she\u2019d let it go. It\u2019s a battle I still fight but I\u2019m happy my mom has become accepting of herself (she lost some weight but over time) and now compliments aren\u2019t based on looks.

I was a little chubby as a kid but not too overweight but I have had problems with food for when I was about 10 maybe?

She never wanted (still) to be in pictures and was always so negative about herself. I hate that I do the same now it\u2019s such a bad habit.

She made it clear that everything in my life would be tied to my weight. I would be unemployable because no one would hire someone who was fat, I would never date because no one could really love a fat girl, and that any interaction I had which was not positive was directly linked to my weight. If I failed a test, I probably would have passed it if the teacher liked me more, but no one likes fat people etc. \n\nAll the while she was feeding me adult portions, and giving me no knowledge or skills to actually eat healthy. She was overweight and type 2 diabetic, and it is really clear looking back that if she had her way we would be going down together.\n\n She completely destroyed my self esteem/worth. By the time I was in my late teens early twenties I was so demoralized, and had no idea what to do to lose weight, I  started to binge/purge. That was 20 years ago now, but I still struggle with it every single day. \n\nIn the end I had to leave the country in my mid 20's and put in some serious boundaries in order to recover. I can only speak for myself, but I needed the separation in order to escape my mother projecting her own bullshit on to me. So much of what our parents do to us has nothing to do with us or our best interest. It can often be traced back to their own insecurities and feelings of inadequacy.\n\n In my experience no amount of talking to her helped, but that's not to say it wouldn't make a difference for someone else. \n\nI know you can't move out, but it might give you some freedom if you reframe it as \"I can't move out, yet\". Circumstances change and  you're going to leave one day. I wish someone had reminded me when I was young that nothing is permanent. That your parents are flawed, and you only think they know anything because you were/are a child. They are great, and they are also terrible in their own way. Just like every person. \n\nYour obviously old enough to know what's good for you, so focus on yourself. What you know to be true about recovery, and what your goals in life are. Tune them out the best you can when they don't support your healing, and just try and look to the future that you want.",

My stepdad at the time was a hard-core Bible beater alcoholic and said that Jesus would heal me. Not following Monday. Cops showed up, knocking at our door and took me to the emergency room of Texas Children\u2019s Hospital at which point I was admitted for the first time.

I had the healthiest relationship to food and my body as a child, I ate whatever I wanted and was active for the purpose of having fun. But then I got depressed because I lost a family member, so I put on a bit of weight 2 years ago, and she commented on it a lot and even compared me to my step sister - so I decided to go on a healthy little diet and boom. Within the matter of months I lost a shit ton of weight, developed bulimia and my weight dictates my day. Thanks mum.",

She has body dysmorphia and is skinny and always complaining about how much weight she's put on or rejoicing over how much she lost because of having diarrhea or whatever. When I was a kid I was a bit on the chubby side (now I can see I was not really fat or obese, just chubby) and she always commented on how my outfits made my rolls pop, so I had to use loose baggy clothes to avoid this, plus she made me feel like i was huge. To make things worse, her idea of nutrition was terrible, she served spaghetti with bread (carbs over carbs) or rice or a ton of carbs, and I had to finish the whole plate. so I ended up making myself sick in my bathroom after each meal. Later I was able to go to a nutritionist and my mom absolutely obsessed over the diet and she was the one strictly following it. She recently got really sick because of a gut bacteria problem and was almost hospitalized because of unyielding diarrhea for a month, she lost 5 kg and she was over the moon because of how much weight she lost. \n\nDon't we all get our EDs from our parents?",

She used to call me \"Thunder Thighs\" when I was a little kid, and made me feel foolish for trying sports etc because I was bigger so it made me look stupid to try. She made it clear that everything in my life would be tied to my weight. I would be unemployable because no one would hire someone who was fat, I would never date because no one could really love a fat girl, and that any interaction I had which was not positive was directly linked to my weight. If I failed a test, I probably would have passed it if the teacher liked me more, but no one likes fat people etc. \n\nAll the while she was feeding me adult portions, and giving me no knowledge or skills to actually eat healthy. She was overweight and type 2 diabetic, and it is really clear looking back that if she had her way we would be going down together.\n\n She completely destroyed my self esteem/worth. By the time I was in my late teens early twenties I was so demoralized, and had no idea what to do to lose weight, I  started to binge/purge. That was 20 years ago now, but I still struggle with it every single day. \n\nIn the end I had to leave the country in my mid 20's and put in some serious boundaries in order to recover. I can only speak for myself, but I needed the separation in order to escape my mother projecting her own bullshit on to me. So much of what our parents do to us has nothing to do with us or our best interest. It can often be traced back to their own insecurities and feelings of inadequacy.\n\n In my experience no amount of talking to her helped, but that's not to say it wouldn't make a difference for someone else. \n\nI know you can't move out, but it might give you some freedom if you reframe it as \"I can't move out, yet\". Circumstances change and  you're going to leave one day. I wish someone had reminded me when I was young that nothing is permanent. That your parents are flawed, and you only think they know anything because you were/are a child. They are great, and they are also terrible in their own way. Just like every person. \n\nYour obviously old enough to know what's good for you, so focus on yourself. What you know to be true about recovery, and what your goals in life are. Tune them out the best you can when they don't support your healing, and just try and look to the future that you want.",

I am trying so hard to sit down and have something with him even if it\u2019s not the same just to acknowledge a space for dinner together. I have managed to add in breakfast successfully but we don\u2019t always manage it together on school days when it\u2019s such a rush to get out. Reading your experience is so reassuring.",

I know I have said things about watching what I eat and counting calories and working out even though I hate the gym. I'm really grateful that he's a boy, not that cis males can't develop EDs but we all know the pressures on girls and boys are different. And he's naturally stick skinny like his dad, so I know he's not battling negative comments from his peers. But even though I do my best to hide my disordered thinking about my body and about food, I'm know I've let so much slip. I just don't want him to hate me for something I already hate myself for when he grows up. \ud83d\ude1e",

Don't restrict his eating, Don't stress about his food too much and keep calm. Don't beat yourself up about the way every self deprecating comment can be misconstrued. Actions speak louder than words - show him you want to encourage healthy behaviour by giving him the food freedom you never gave yourself. If/when he's old enough tell him about what you're going through so he knows to take what you say with a pinch of salt. And most importantly - remember you are a strong mum. You absolutely have the power to do this - I really believe in you. Your concern shows how much you want this. Keep going, I'm sure you will raise a wonderful son \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",

He's allowed to eat whatever he wants and I'm always offering him snacks and drinks. I have had conversations with him about my eating. He's 9yo, and when he was 8 he asked me why I didnt eat dinner with him at night and that's really what pushed me into quasi-recovery and harm reduction. I had mostly struggled with veryyy heavy restriction, I only occasionally b/p. But now I eat throughout the day. I always have dinner at the table with him. I eat a couple cookies when we bake together. I still count my calories and I know I still have some disordered eating, but I'm so much happier. And I've been pretty upfront, for a 9yo, about the fact that mommy wasn't eating right and that I'm eating better now and that he doesn't need to worry about food. I don't know if I'm doing it right or wrong. I know he's young and I don't want to put too many grown-up burdens on him. But he was smart enough to notice my food intake was wrong and so I feel like he's smart enough for me to be open with him to an extent.",

I used this a LOT when I was still at home as a teen. While it\u2019s ideal to follow along with an actually licensed person, there are a lot of CBT intro books online and worksheets. It can be really helpful in identifying triggers, figuring out what kind of thought you are having (catastrophizing, black & white thinking, assumptions based off of solely feelings vs trying to check back in with reality). I don\u2019t have a specific book in mind, but this article is an accessible article on CBT unique to bulimia. \n\nhttps://complicated.life/blog/5-powerful-cognitive-behavioural-therapy-techniques-to-use-for-bulimia/?amp=1\n\nI promise you can get better.
