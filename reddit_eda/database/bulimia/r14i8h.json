I am extremely shakey after every time I purge. I feel dizzy all the time. It feels like my body could give up at any moment now... I want to stop but I don't know how. Existing with this is HELL. \nIt is frightening to know that people have been bulimic for decades...  How do you do it? I feel like if I keep going with this I will die from it.",

(I can drink 1,5 liters of water after I purge lol) I also started supplementing with electrolytes after a health scare (potassium and natrium) I don\u2019t do anything physically demanding, cuz that\u2019s just makes it worse. I also make sure I eat vegetables afterwards, cuz otherwise I\u2019m getting really hungry and I\u2019d rather not b/p again. But yeah, all of this doesn\u2019t really prevent the damage that is causes. So it\u2019s best to seek help or at least get your blood work done. Take care! <3",

I\u2019ve never felt shittier in my ED than I do with bulimia. I also eat like trash and binge on exclusively garbage food, which definitely contributes.

Also pls get your heart checked bc I had no idea I had a 40bpm heart rate until I had an EKG. After a decade of this my main advice is to stop as soon as possible bc it is hell but a hell that becomes so normal you forget what it was like before.
