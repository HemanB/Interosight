  "selftext": "We moved the tv into another room which is where my bathroom is, my dad was watching TV and we had finished eating, I couldn't go to his bathroom so I didn't have a choice plus it was early so I couldn't wait for him to leave. I put the sink on and played loud music, I'm pretty quiet when I purge but I made the mistake of being a little too noisy towards the end. Eventually I finished and came out like I was just using the bathroom as normal. \n\nI sat down and he said without skipping a beat he said \"are you throwing up your food?\" \n\"No. Why?\" \n\"Because, I want to make sure. You know I've worked with kids like that for years\" (my father worked with juvenile corrections for more than 10 years) \n\"Yeah I know.\" \n\"You know the stuff that does to your body?\" \n\"Oh yeah I know, it's terrible\" \n\"Okay. I'm. Just making sure.\" \nHopefully my lying came off sincere, he's commented about how I've been losing weight before, the sooner I recover the better, I'm tired of lying to everyone.",

From the sounds of it, he might\u2019ve felt awkward about bringing up something so personal and hard for you. it might be helpful to consider telling him\u2014even if you don\u2019t tell him everything, just saying \u201cI tried it once and it was really awful. I know all the bad things it does to your body and I know how much better my life would be if I didn\u2019t at all, but it\u2019s just.. hard\u201d might make you feel better. imagine he really just listened and supported you and told you he was there for you and he cared! Already you know he cares enough to pay attention and ask, even if it means being a little awkward\n\nno pressure to of course, good luck with your recovery journey =)",
