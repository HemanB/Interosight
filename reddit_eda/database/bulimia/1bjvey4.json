  "selftext": "I\u2019ve wasted thousands of dollars on food, my wildest cravings, things I\u2019ll convince myself that after this last crazy binge it\u2019ll be my last one ever\u2026just to end up purging and feeling disgustingly ashamed that I hurriedly scarfed down a gigantic portion of whatever. And you know what?? It never satisfies me! I always eat whatever I want exactly and it never hits the spot. This ED seriously sucks. I haven\u2019t been purging very consistently but its become a multiple time a week thing if I stray from my diet and workout plan\u2014which I continue to do. The food is never worth it so why do I crave it all of the time? I think about eating all day long.  ",

I\u2019m willing to bet if you allowed yourself to eat freely and fed your body properly, those cravings will diminish. This disorder sucks so hard, and it sucks more than the extra weight you think you\u2019ll put on. I went all out when I started recovering, I bought bigger clothes so that I didn\u2019t feel shit about putting on weight- I really prepared myself. Interestingly, I didn\u2019t gain any weight so those extra clothes aren\u2019t being used but they are there as a reminder that I accept myself at any weight. \nThe food is never worth it- you are absolutely right.

      "body": "It's because it's a vicious addiction.    I remember this specifically with my eating disorder and with booze when I was abusing that too.   It's not just the food itself.   It's the ritual,  the reasons WHY.  At one point when trying to control my poor sick mind, I wouldn't even binge;  I would just purge nothing at all. \n\nThis is a crippling addiction.   Please consider outside help.  It is not quick or easy. I wish I could tell you the opposite,  but it took me 2 years to Recover from 3 decades long ED.    It's a slow and steady process. \n\nThere are a few ways to recover,  so if one approach doesn't work, change gears and try again.   Even if you don't feel you are recovering \"fast enough \" or \"correctly\", the pure fight against it will bring back your self-respect because you are trying to fight this Beast.    In the last year of my Recovery I was doing it  alone without a team and that was fine because I had the information; the tools.   At the beginning attempts I tried an ED treatment clinic (didn't work at all for my personality)  but then after 2 more dieticians and 2 more therapists...I found a \"team\" that worked with where I was, not just going off some pre-determined chart.   I then moved away from that state to one with poor mental health coverage, so I had to do it alone.    By then I wanted to relapse bad...but I had already had a taste of freedom,  and I found out I wanted freedom MORE than what the ED gave me!!  This was a vital point in my Recovery. Once you taste freedom,  you know there is a different way to live.\n\nHuge tips for me for that successful push:  ditch the cruel scale, or at least put further and further amts of time between weighing until you can ditch the effing scale.    And also while recovering,  get rid of ANY and all clothing that only fits a body using ED behaviors.   And how I started was eating \"safe foods\" and not allowing Purging to be an option...no matter what!   Then increasing safe foods qtys...sitting in the uncomfortable...digest.   repeat.   Then add in moderate scary foods.. sit in the uncomfortable,  digest,  repeat.    Trigger or binge foods came only at the end.   You can only handle so much at a time.  You gotta eat the food. You have to let your body do what it wants to.  Simple but hard...but factual. You have to surrender to the process.  Scream, sweat, Journal...whatever you need to do, move furniture....but eat the food, sit with it, digest the food. \n\nRemember to always forgive yourself.   A slip is NOT a relapse.   You are relearning a new way to eat, digest, you may get intestinal upset in the beginning...you may have to relearn how to carry a different body on your frame, and how this feels physically and emotionally.    This is not a short or quick process .  One step at a time.\n\nRecovery IS possible.    This can be done.  You may never love your new body, but the freedom is PRICELESS.   Come over to Recovery.   We can eat and digest cookies over here...chocolate without guilt, visiting a restaurant without looking at the menu first, and join our people when socializing; being fully there.  \n\nYou could start today.   But it's baby steps and you have to be 100% honest with yourself.   You know what triggers you, you know when you are slipping or cheating.    This is your personal fight.",
