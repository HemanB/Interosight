  "selftext": "I was brought to the hospital by ambulance Sat morning. I was driving when I started to feel weak, and suddenly my entire body cramped up so bad I was screaming in pain. I couldn\u2019t move and my sister couldn\u2019t even undo my cramped hands or pull my arms down away from my neck where they were stuck cramped up. I have admitted to my doctor that I struggle SEVERELY with BP type bulimia. My blood pressure is very low, 80/40. I\u2019m on IV potassium and fluids. I could have gone into a cardiac arrest. I could\u2019ve dropped dead. \nI\u2019ve been doing this for 6 years now. I\u2019m tired of it. Yet here I am sobbing because I just threw up the hospital dinner. This is the sickest battle and addiction to overcome.",
