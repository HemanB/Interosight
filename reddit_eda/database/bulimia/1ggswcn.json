  "selftext": "I know how idiotic I sound here, I\u2019m fully aware. But at this point, the only way to stop purging is to eat less. Eating causes me to purge. The only way to combat the purging is to eat less so I am not tempted to purge. And since I have anorexia that\u2019s a fucking stupid way to combat this. Anorexia with purging subtype is a special kind of hell and it\u2019s a confusing place to be where I feel like I am an anorexic food addict. Nothing feels safe anymore, even my safe foods. I only eat safe foods and things that I consider safe, it doesn\u2019t fucking matter, I will still purge those foods because I eat too much. There is no fucking winning and I\u2019m so frustrated I mine as well just give up and accept that this will be my life forever ",

But eating for me is never eating small portions. I have anorexia but I eat volume amounts of my healthy orthorexic foods. If I just ate a small portion of food once or twice a day I would be even more anorexic than I already am. So what the fuck am I supposed to do.",

Our blood sugar is a bit of a continuous balancing act, and the body releases insulin for the food that you purge.....so you may end up hypoglaecemic....something to be aware of - I've had a diabetic friend and her hypoglaecemic eating was v similar to how I experience a binge\n\nMight as well have written to myself, but these are my arguments when i have to force myself to eat \"preventative\" healthy but scary meals.
