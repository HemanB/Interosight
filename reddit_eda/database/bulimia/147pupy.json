  "selftext": "Well yet another incompetent doctor. Told her I was relapsing in bulimia which btw its nearly impossible to say out loud so I masked it like oh I\u2019m just afraid of weight I wanna lose weight and she goes ,,Do you really think that doing it like this helps you lose weight?\u2019\u2019 Ofc not you morron its not about weight its about not overdosing on benzos as a coping mechanism. She just seemed so butt hurt when I was honest and said that I was taking 4 pills of benzos per day. I did it to try and stop myself from purging and she was like ,,I dont like you doing that that hurts you\u2019\u2019 no shit sherlock I want to hurt myself. The cherry on top was when I said that I kinda have some suicidal tendecies and i take benzos and she goes,, Well you cant suicide from 4 pills\u2019\u2019. Try me bitch.\n\nSorry for my angry rant I just need someone to talk to I feel like nobody gets me, I just yelled at my mom on the phone because she was trying to force words out of me. Have been hospitalized for 2 times because of other mental problems but they didnt really care that I have bulimia too which made me feel more disgusting and insignificant. I haven\u2019t been so low in a while I just need to know that my feelings are valid.",

It amazes me in this day and age how many drs and therapists still don't get eds. \n\nWhen I was 18 and first starting with bulimia I reached out for help to a newly qualified nhs psychologist that I was seeing. I told her I was starting to b/p, and I cried. This was me literally asking for help, and she goes and says (whilst smiling) \"don't worry, many girls experiment with this at your age\" I'm so angry, because I became a full on bulimic that I still am struggling to recover from over 10 years later. I reached out and got made to feel I was overreacting and it wasn't a big deal. I never reached out much again after that.",

      "body": "I hate the medical profession as a whole because of how they treat eds - they really don't get it. I've had dozens of incompetent Drs, psychologists etc - I would recommend trying a naturopath if anything they tend to be less 'qualified' but wayyyy more empathetic. Iconic lines from Drs include 'wow I thought this was a case of anxious mother but it looks like you really do have a problem' 'have you considered imagining yourself blowing up like a balloon/frog and getting all your anxieties out in the breath out?' 'see, binging isn't bad look how much it takes you to gain any weight - you should try to do more of that.' and the general air of anxiety around most professional therapists is remarkable. I have encountered 4 people I believe in as medical professionals: 1 psychologist who seemed competent, another psychologist who I only saw once who also seemed competent but was head of team/very busy, 1 naturopath, and a hospital dietician who was the only non obese person on the ward and seemed far far more reasonable/knowledgeable than the rest of the team I was with. I had another therapjst/psych who I actually liked for a bit but he dumped me as a client because I seemed too complicated and I think also bcs I was female and he preffered working with men (?!?) .",
