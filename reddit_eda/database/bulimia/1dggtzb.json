  "selftext": "For the first time in a long time I actually stopped myself. I had just cut the loaf of bread, was cutting the butter about to spread it on and I had a moment of clarity, do I really want to do this? I\u2019m not hungry, I was actually quite full (does anyone else struggle with fullness triggering a binge because it\u2019s probably my biggest trigger at the moment) and I realised that wasting this food, binging until I felt uncomfortable was not going to give me satisfaction. So I put it all away, drank a glass of water and pulled myself away from the kitchen. I\u2019m proud of myself and I just wanted to share, and maybe give a little hope to everyone else struggling, we can stop the cycle and sometimes small moments of clarity or stepping back can be really helpful.

On other occasions I think I used to do things like go out for a walk, or have a shower, or clean  my shoes.   I'd also used to do outstanding tasks around the house  - like some decluttering, or deep cleaning one of the floors.  Finally, it also helped to brush my teeth so that my mouth felt fresh.   I found it really helpful to do something physical.   Nowadays  when I feel tempted to binge I will usually come up to my computer and do something with Photoshop - which is a major hobby of mine.   Once I start playing with photoshop I get completely absorbed.\n\nOne good idea is to make a list of distractions that would suit you.   Then when the urge to binge comes you would have the ideas all to hand.",
