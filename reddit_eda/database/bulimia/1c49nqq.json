  "title": "I suspect my 12 year old is purging - how can I best help?",
  "selftext": "My daughter has been acting oddly for a few weeks now, particularly around food and exercise. A time or two we thought we heard her throw up, so between that and the strange new fixation on food/diet/exercise I've been alert for any other signs of disordered eating. Tonight I was right next to the bathroom while she was showering and am 95% sure I heard her. \n\nI went into her room before bed and asked how she was feeling, because I thought I'd heard her getting sick. She said of course not, she would have told me, and besides it was just phlegm that she was coughing out. But I'm pretty sure she's lying. I stayed calm, didn't push her on it, but mentioned some of the reasons why someone might binge/purge, and some of the health risks that go along with it. We've discussed EDs before in a general way, but never gone too deep. I made it clear I was here to talk about it of she wanted to, then let her be.\n\nShe sees a therapist semiweekly for diagnosed anxiety/OCD, but has been doing well for the last six months...or so I thought. The therapist comes back from maternity leave this month, and I'll certainly mention my suspicions to her. And I'll talk to my own therapist about my feelings, which are pretty big right now. \n\nI guess what I'm hoping for here is advice from folks who've lived through this on what you might have hoped for from your parents early on in your journey. If she won't admit it to me, what can I do? I don't want to make her feel any more shame or embarrassment than she might already have, but I also need to keep her safe and healthy, as much as I'm able. I've searched for this question and didn't easily find many answers, but if there are any resources or other posts here on Reddit, I'd love some direction. Or comfort, or advice, or anything. \n\nThanks in advance for whatever folks are willing to share. This is one struggle I've not been through myself, and I'm at a loss for how to help my darling baby who's not at all a baby anymore but still needs me even if she thinks she doesn't. And even though we've been careful with the way we talk about food and bodies and all the rest, and I know in my mind this isn't my fault, I still feel like I've failed her somehow. I hope this post is an okay one to make here, and once again thank you for taking the time to read and respond. ",

So I would recommend keeping an eye on her weight without commenting on it (and I would strongly emphasise not commenting on it unless it's unavoidable) \n\nIt might also be worthwhile reinforcing the negative effects of purging on things that she may care about as a near teen (the appearance of yellow teeth, for example), but you'd need to be careful with that as sometimes the stress associated with the negative effects can perpetuate the behaviour too.",

I wished so much that my mom stepped in more. Of course at the time and when I was younger I just wanted to be able to eat how I wanted (disordered) and not have anyone question me. I think being so careful about how you approach and maybe educate yourself as much as possible on it. Slow and steady wins the race. Be patient. Open up that form of communication and trust..but please do not give up or ignore. It will only get worse and she will be dealing with it alone. That won\u2019t stop it. I have dealt with ED for the past 10+ years..or should I say suffered..it has ruined every aspect of my life. I am in my late 20s. It wasn\u2019t until recently that my mom did research and just came to me with a print out from each of their website giving contact info..a dietician phone # and therapist #. All she said was that she did some research and found some good doctors in the area that specialized in that type of stuff if I wanted she would get some sessions for me. This meant so much to me. It showed she cared..we didn\u2019t have to have any type of uncomfortable conversation and it wasn\u2019t forceful. When I was younger and she would try to talk to me about it I would just get more and more secretive because I didn\u2019t want her to worry, think differently of me, or pay attention to what I was doing/be found out.",

I suffered an ED and undiagnosed OCD growing up (first I had OCD and then my ED developed, I just couldn't see it at the time). It was very hard, especially not having a supportive mother, like you. This post made me really happy, in a way (healing my inner child, I suppose). \n\nNow, I think the biggest hurdles actually come AFTER that first conversation you (and hopefully your husband) have with her about this situation, because it has a sort of ripple effect. It affects everything, and as someone who chronically wants to feel in control, it can definitely rock your world and in a bad way. Hopefully through trial and error you'll all be able to figure out a way, maybe her triggers (if she's far advanced into her ED, things like trigger foods, food amount, measuring can be example of things but for now, just hol' up and talk with your daughter's therapist. they will hopefully know how to help and if not, consider finding specialist in the matter) and future systems that might work for her. \n\nAll the love. Good luck for you and your family. You're doing amazing!! \ud83d\udda4\ud83e\udd7a",

      "body": "Thank you for posting! This is very long and I\u2019m sorry for that- if you have time, you might find this helpful \ud83d\udc9a\n\nThis is from my perspective so it might not apply here, but you asked what we hoped from our parents, so here\u2019s what I had hoped from mine:\n\nMy ED was/is a way to communicate. My parents didn\u2019t really communicate with me in the way that I needed. I wanted them to know that I wasn\u2019t doing well, but also that it didn\u2019t mean that I was bad. Of course they would have known this, but to me at 11-13 it didn\u2019t feel that way. They thought I was nice, smart, etc., and that left no room for being sad, anxious, and no room for trying new things that had any chance of failure. \n\nBulimia is about food only on the surface, so it might be worth exploring what she\u2019s feeling underneath. Family therapy CAN be great, although my experience with it was horrible. I\u2019d say do some serious review searching before committing to anyone if you decide to go that route. \n\nIn a nutshell though, emotions that are really strong are super important; essential for communication. Bulimia and other EDs, along with other clinical behaviours in general, numb feelings. The goal is generally to numb the ones that feel bad, but the good come along with it. If there\u2019s a need of hers that isn\u2019t being met, she might feel angry. If she\u2019s had an experience, in the past or ongoing, where she\u2019s felt threatened or where painful things have happened to her, or she feels unfamiliar with things and people around her, she might feel fear. If she lost something or someone important to her, worked hard for something that didn\u2019t pan out, or feels alone, powerless, etc, she might feel sad. If she\u2019s been rejected, bullied, criticized, betrayed, or negatively compared to others by people in her peer group (peers are SO important for teens), she might feel shame. And, if she\u2019s done or said something that she feels doesn\u2019t match her own value system, (or hasn\u2019t done or said something she intended or said she would do in accordance to her value system), or her values don\u2019t match up perfectly to someone very important to her, she might feel guilty. \n\nAny of those \u2018negative\u2019 emotions can pile up and become greater than the sum of their parts. Bulimia is overwhelming, and two important things are almost certainly present from that list: the general feeling of shame (which makes someone want to hide, like how she\u2019s not admitting what she\u2019s doing when asked), and the feeling of powerlessness (she\u2019s seeking to control her weight, which might be compensating for other aspects of her life that feel out of control). \n\nBeing a teen nearly always comes with shame and feelings of being out of control of everyone changing so quickly around you, and yourself changing, so it\u2019s so important to talk to her about this and let her know that she\u2019s not alone. ED behaviour becomes more than a coping mechanism, and moves very quickly to habit, and one that\u2019s so difficult to break. That\u2019s because it works so well and so reliably to feel better. If you can work together to find other ways for her to feel good, it can help her build the \u201creplacement\u201d mechanisms she\u2019ll need to ensure she doesn\u2019t feel like she\u2019s always going to suffer. Doing art/music/dance, going to social events (or counselling groups if she\u2019s anxious in front of people- it takes practice!), having quiet hobbies to herself, and having people to talk to when things happen- big or small (remember they pile up!) that make her feel angry, sad, guilty, or ashamed. Therapy is a wonderful start for this, and I\u2019d encourage you to do your best to get a feeling for whether her therapist is a good fit for her. The right therapist feels like a breath of fresh air when it\u2019s appointment time rather than a pain to have to wake up and get ready for. I know options can be quite limiting, so the best you can do is the best for her.\n\nI very very strongly encourage trying to increase your heart to hearts with her in general, because opening up doesn\u2019t happen in a day, and it can be so hard talking to parents as a teen when you feel like you can\u2019t even understand yourself half the time. Think about how you felt as a teen, and also how your parents might have felt raising you as a teen for some possible insight \ud83d\ude0a\n\nOne last note- DBT (dialectical behavioural therapy) is extremely helpful for those with eating disorders. Also highly recommended!",

(compulsion) making myself sick... (disorder) it's pointless and meaningless. The obsession is always something the person doesn't agree with... Its a meaningless intrusive thought that doesn't go away... So\n\n\nTake these words very seriously... Ocd is a monster and the more attention you feed it the bigger it grows.. I've been ocd free now for about 10 years I still get spikes sometimes but I put that down to it being a huge memory... Do not talk to her about ocd if she doesn't mention it..she has to learn to train her brain to ignore the bad thoughts that seem like they last forever. It's very hard... Took me five years or self care to heal... Any 'professional' will make her worse...ocd only dissapears when it's forgotten about. I'm here if you wanna learn more. I know more than any pro and I don't take people's fucking money. Ughhh.... Okay so... Let's say its not ocd...how can you assume its anything else? She may only be 12 which by the way is a normal age for this and that doctor knows it... I hope you're not paying him as he is rinsing you. Also... Are you up to date with current nutrition agreements? Is there actually any harm or does it just make you worry... Is she a healthy young girl just going through some stuff or is she dying from startavtion... You need to make sure what the actual problem is... If its ocd then I'm so sorry for what she is gonna go though. I can offer endless advice for free as I am a survive... I was once homeless on and off for 7 years and I still think being ocd free is my biggest achievement. If it is an eating disorder the best thing you can do is study nutrition and silently make sure than even if she keeps making her self sick for looks or wanting to be skinny... Its her body it's her choice... But make sure she is still getting the input she needs... So if its a mental disorder like ocd then I can offer advice and my heart breaks... If its a physical thing... Then back off and just keep her alive and as healthy as you can. Xx",

It affects everything, and as someone who chronically wants to feel in control, it can definitely rock your world and in a bad way. Hopefully through trial and error you'll all be able to figure out a way, maybe her triggers (if she's far advanced into her ED, things like trigger foods, food amount, measuring can be example of things but for now, just hol' up and talk with your daughter's therapist. they will hopefully know how to help and if not, consider finding specialist in the matter) and future systems that might work for her. \n\nAll the love.

          "body": "Thank you for posting! This is very long and I\u2019m sorry for that- if you have time, you might find this helpful \ud83d\udc9a\n\nThis is from my perspective so it might not apply here, but you asked what we hoped from our parents, so here\u2019s what I had hoped from mine:\n\nMy ED was/is a way to communicate. My parents didn\u2019t really communicate with me in the way that I needed. I wanted them to know that I wasn\u2019t doing well, but also that it didn\u2019t mean that I was bad. Of course they would have known this, but to me at 11-13 it didn\u2019t feel that way. They thought I was nice, smart, etc., and that left no room for being sad, anxious, and no room for trying new things that had any chance of failure. \n\nBulimia is about food only on the surface, so it might be worth exploring what she\u2019s feeling underneath. Family therapy CAN be great, although my experience with it was horrible. I\u2019d say do some serious review searching before committing to anyone if you decide to go that route. \n\nIn a nutshell though, emotions that are really strong are super important; essential for communication. Bulimia and other EDs, along with other clinical behaviours in general, numb feelings. The goal is generally to numb the ones that feel bad, but the good come along with it. If there\u2019s a need of hers that isn\u2019t being met, she might feel angry. If she\u2019s had an experience, in the past or ongoing, where she\u2019s felt threatened or where painful things have happened to her, or she feels unfamiliar with things and people around her, she might feel fear. If she lost something or someone important to her, worked hard for something that didn\u2019t pan out, or feels alone, powerless, etc, she might feel sad. If she\u2019s been rejected, bullied, criticized, betrayed, or negatively compared to others by people in her peer group (peers are SO important for teens), she might feel shame. And, if she\u2019s done or said something that she feels doesn\u2019t match her own value system, (or hasn\u2019t done or said something she intended or said she would do in accordance to her value system), or her values don\u2019t match up perfectly to someone very important to her, she might feel guilty. \n\nAny of those \u2018negative\u2019 emotions can pile up and become greater than the sum of their parts. Bulimia is overwhelming, and two important things are almost certainly present from that list: the general feeling of shame (which makes someone want to hide, like how she\u2019s not admitting what she\u2019s doing when asked), and the feeling of powerlessness (she\u2019s seeking to control her weight, which might be compensating for other aspects of her life that feel out of control). \n\nBeing a teen nearly always comes with shame and feelings of being out of control of everyone changing so quickly around you, and yourself changing, so it\u2019s so important to talk to her about this and let her know that she\u2019s not alone. ED behaviour becomes more than a coping mechanism, and moves very quickly to habit, and one that\u2019s so difficult to break. That\u2019s because it works so well and so reliably to feel better. If you can work together to find other ways for her to feel good, it can help her build the \u201creplacement\u201d mechanisms she\u2019ll need to ensure she doesn\u2019t feel like she\u2019s always going to suffer. Doing art/music/dance, going to social events (or counselling groups if she\u2019s anxious in front of people- it takes practice!), having quiet hobbies to herself, and having people to talk to when things happen- big or small (remember they pile up!) that make her feel angry, sad, guilty, or ashamed. Therapy is a wonderful start for this, and I\u2019d encourage you to do your best to get a feeling for whether her therapist is a good fit for her. The right therapist feels like a breath of fresh air when it\u2019s appointment time rather than a pain to have to wake up and get ready for. I know options can be quite limiting, so the best you can do is the best for her.\n\nI very very strongly encourage trying to increase your heart to hearts with her in general, because opening up doesn\u2019t happen in a day, and it can be so hard talking to parents as a teen when you feel like you can\u2019t even understand yourself half the time. Think about how you felt as a teen, and also how your parents might have felt raising you as a teen for some possible insight \ud83d\ude0a\n\nOne last note- DBT (dialectical behavioural therapy) is extremely helpful for those with eating disorders. Also highly recommended!",

          "body": "Thank you for posting! This is very long and I\u2019m sorry for that- if you have time, you might find this helpful \ud83d\udc9a\n\nThis is from my perspective so it might not apply here, but you asked what we hoped from our parents, so here\u2019s what I had hoped from mine:\n\nMy ED was/is a way to communicate. My parents didn\u2019t really communicate with me in the way that I needed. I wanted them to know that I wasn\u2019t doing well, but also that it didn\u2019t mean that I was bad. Of course they would have known this, but to me at 11-13 it didn\u2019t feel that way. They thought I was nice, smart, etc., and that left no room for being sad, anxious, and no room for trying new things that had any chance of failure. \n\nBulimia is about food only on the surface, so it might be worth exploring what she\u2019s feeling underneath. Family therapy CAN be great, although my experience with it was horrible. I\u2019d say do some serious review searching before committing to anyone if you decide to go that route. \n\nIn a nutshell though, emotions that are really strong are super important; essential for communication. Bulimia and other EDs, along with other clinical behaviours in general, numb feelings. The goal is generally to numb the ones that feel bad, but the good come along with it. If there\u2019s a need of hers that isn\u2019t being met, she might feel angry. If she\u2019s had an experience, in the past or ongoing, where she\u2019s felt threatened or where painful things have happened to her, or she feels unfamiliar with things and people around her, she might feel fear. If she lost something or someone important to her, worked hard for something that didn\u2019t pan out, or feels alone, powerless, etc, she might feel sad. If she\u2019s been rejected, bullied, criticized, betrayed, or negatively compared to others by people in her peer group (peers are SO important for teens), she might feel shame. And, if she\u2019s done or said something that she feels doesn\u2019t match her own value system, (or hasn\u2019t done or said something she intended or said she would do in accordance to her value system), or her values don\u2019t match up perfectly to someone very important to her, she might feel guilty. \n\nAny of those \u2018negative\u2019 emotions can pile up and become greater than the sum of their parts. Bulimia is overwhelming, and two important things are almost certainly present from that list: the general feeling of shame (which makes someone want to hide, like how she\u2019s not admitting what she\u2019s doing when asked), and the feeling of powerlessness (she\u2019s seeking to control her weight, which might be compensating for other aspects of her life that feel out of control). \n\nBeing a teen nearly always comes with shame and feelings of being out of control of everyone changing so quickly around you, and yourself changing, so it\u2019s so important to talk to her about this and let her know that she\u2019s not alone. ED behaviour becomes more than a coping mechanism, and moves very quickly to habit, and one that\u2019s so difficult to break. That\u2019s because it works so well and so reliably to feel better. If you can work together to find other ways for her to feel good, it can help her build the \u201creplacement\u201d mechanisms she\u2019ll need to ensure she doesn\u2019t feel like she\u2019s always going to suffer. Doing art/music/dance, going to social events (or counselling groups if she\u2019s anxious in front of people- it takes practice!), having quiet hobbies to herself, and having people to talk to when things happen- big or small (remember they pile up!) that make her feel angry, sad, guilty, or ashamed. Therapy is a wonderful start for this, and I\u2019d encourage you to do your best to get a feeling for whether her therapist is a good fit for her. The right therapist feels like a breath of fresh air when it\u2019s appointment time rather than a pain to have to wake up and get ready for. I know options can be quite limiting, so the best you can do is the best for her.\n\nI very very strongly encourage trying to increase your heart to hearts with her in general, because opening up doesn\u2019t happen in a day, and it can be so hard talking to parents as a teen when you feel like you can\u2019t even understand yourself half the time. Think about how you felt as a teen, and also how your parents might have felt raising you as a teen for some possible insight \ud83d\ude0a\n\nOne last note- DBT (dialectical behavioural therapy) is extremely helpful for those with eating disorders. Also highly recommended!",
