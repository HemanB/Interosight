You're not alone. It doesn't make you a bad person. You have a big heart and good intentions, but the eating disorder has a way of dominating even our core values sometimes. We can overcome this.

I still don\u2019t feel \u201csafe\u201d and I know the possibility of relapse is very real, but I just take it day by day, am way nicer to myself, and stay humble about where I\u2019m at with it all. I still have days when I really want to purge, but I know what that will lead to so I just don\u2019t do it. Then it passes. There IS light on the other side of the tunnel. I\u2019ve been struggling with this shit for so long (off and on for over 15 years) so if I can do it, you can too.",
