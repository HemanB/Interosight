  "selftext": "GUYS! I know this is so small, just 24 hours, but as someone who has been a slave to this constant lingering urge to purge, it feels so amazing to go an entire day PURGE FREE!\n\nYesterday, I met with a nutritionist and she gave me a list of low calorie, filling foods and we are slowly upping my caloric intake. For the first time in years, I ate and was satisfied. There wasn\u2019t any sneaky snacks or secret binges throughout the day, because I was genuinely satisfied. PLUS, when I weighed myself this morning, I hadn\u2019t gained a single pound! My body really did need that fuel and I feel incredible!",
