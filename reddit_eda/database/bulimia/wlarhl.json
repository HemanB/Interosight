Otherwise you wouldn\u2019t see severely underweight ED sufferers who b/p massive amounts of food daily. \n\nFrom my limited understanding of human physiology though, doesn\u2019t nutrient absorption start in the small intestine? Food is broken down in the mouth and stomach but I thought that you only started actually absorbing macronutrients (which are broken down into energy) through the walls of the digestive tract once it was in the intestine. Your body can\u2019t utilize food for energy much less store it as fat while it\u2019s still physically in chunks - anything that comes back up will not have been absorbed. Doesn\u2019t make purging even remotely worth it, though. The health consequences far outweigh any potential (some may lose weight, some may maintain, some may gain) weight loss even if 0 calories were metabolized. I don\u2019t understand where these statistics on \u201cx percent is absorbed\u201d come from though so I may be wrong. Idk.",
