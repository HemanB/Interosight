      "body": "Part 2:\n\nAgain, I have a massive sweet tooth. Nick\u2019s icecream literally saved me. It\u2019s lower calorie than halo top, and actually feels like read icecream (it\u2019s insanely creamy). I\u2019d eat the whole pint, which combined with my volume dinner, made me feel like I\u2019d binged and totally satisfied the urge. Only I hadn\u2019t, so I didn\u2019t need to purge it. Halo top also works, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as good, and I eat it faster. I\u2019d also make big bowls of cereal if I wanted something sweet but crunchy. I fill a bowl half full of frozen raspberries (crush them first), then add a cup of Frosted Flakes, two cups of unsweetened vanilla almond milk, and some stevia. Later on, when I could control my urge to binge better, I started buying a large bag of peppermint patties and keeping them in the freezer. Because they\u2019re frozen, they take awhile to eat, and the mint+cold satisfies me. I eat 2-3 a day.\n\nI use the app nomo to track how long I go without purging. It\u2019s really great, and you get badges for milestones. It was so cool to see that I\u2019d gone a whole week without purging, and then two weeks, etc! If I lapsed, I just hit \u201cfresh start.\u201d It\u2019s a really great app, and will also track how much money you\u2019ve saved.\n\nI\u2019m lucky to have a really supportive partner, so in the beginning, he stopped eating unhealthy foods, and anything he cooked for dinner that was unhealthy had meat in it so I wouldn\u2019t eat it. \n\nI started drinking a ton of water. I bought a bunch of those flavoring packets, and the sweetness from them helped me. My favorite are the sonic ones- they taste exactly like the drinks (although the amount of dye in them has probably shortened my lifespan lol). \n\nWhen I do lapse, I hold absolutely no judgement for myself. I expect it. I don\u2019t think of it as a failure, just something that will occasionally happen and is fine. \n\nIt was pretty hard at first. I had the urge to binge a lot, and I wouldn\u2019t resist it- I\u2019d stuff myself with whatever my \u201capproved\u201d snacks/food was. As much as I wanted. But because I knew the calories and logged them, I knew that I was \u201csafe\u201d and didn\u2019t have to purge, which made it so I didn\u2019t want to eat even more unhealthy foods to \u201cget my money\u2019s worth\u201d from a binge, if that makes sense. It still felt like a binge, but it wasn\u2019t one I had to purge.\n\nI don\u2019t eat out. Like, at all. It\u2019s a huge trigger for me, so I refuse to go to restaurants or order food.\n\nNowadays, the biggest motivator is looking at all the benefits I\u2019ve reaped:\n\nI have SO MUCH free time now. I can do whatever I want, because I don\u2019t need to plan it around eating or purging. \n\nI\u2019m super frugal, so money was also a big motivator. I\u2019ve saved thousands of dollars by not binging and eating out. I can buy more expensive foods (looking at you, icecream) without guilt because I\u2019ve saved the money. I buy myself treats (super into Korean skincare, and I collect pre-1960s Good Housekeeping magazines) as rewards, because it\u2019s money I\u2019d have otherwise spent on food. I also bought a theme park pass with the money I\u2019ve saved.\n\nMy skin is better. My sleep is better. I\u2019m not bloated. Because I\u2019ve lost my binge weight (not ED restricting, just a lack of the massive surplus of food when I was binging), my clothes fit again, and I can walk without pain. I\u2019ve stopped binge drinking. I\u2019m more clear headed, and I feel more energetic. \n\nAfter months of this, the urge to binge has almost completely disappeared. I\u2019m satisfied with a normal amount of food. I\u2019ve expanded my \u201callowed\u201d food list. If my fianc\u00e9 makes a previous trigger food, I eat a couple bites off his plate, and I\u2019m satisfied with that. He recently has started buying chips and cookies again, and I don\u2019t have the urge to touch them. I actually don\u2019t like potato chips anymore. I\u2019ve managed to have Oreos in the house for a full month without wanting to eat them.\n\nI know a big part of some recovery methods is to try to get over trigger foods, but that doesn\u2019t work for me. Avoiding them does, or letting myself eat a bit of it from someone else\u2019s portion works too, because I can\u2019t eat that.\n\nPride in my accomplishment really pushes me, too. I don\u2019t want to stop, because I\u2019m so damn proud of myself. This is the most recovered I\u2019ve been from my ED in literally 17 years.\n\nI really hope some of this helps you. Be forgiving of yourself- it isn\u2019t easy. If it happens, it happens, and the moment it\u2019s over is a new start to being free.\n\nNow my two recipes:\n\n>!I really love salad, so one of my recipes is an absolutely massive salad. I put a ton of spring lettuce into a mixing bowl (literally biggest mixing bowl I can find, like the huge one that comes in a set). Then I add browned onion, raw onion, an entire tomato, 3 egg whites and a whole egg, bolthouse farm\u2019s yogurt ranch, balsamic vinegar, some blue cheese, and some frizzled onions. The later two things satisfied the need for junk food in my brain. The size of this salad, plus the saltiness, made me feel like I\u2019d just binged.!<\n\n>!The other recipe is a huge pot of soup. I brown an entire large onion and add a shit ton of chopped carrots (I prefer the crinkle cut ones), then add 10 cups of vegetable broth (I prefer Better the Bouillon vegetable base). I add a bunch of Italian seasoning and a bunch of red pepper flakes and let it boil until the carrots start to soften. Then I add two sliced zucchini and half a block of cubed firm tofu. The red pepper flakes make it a bit spicy, so it takes me awhile to eat, and there\u2019s so many veggies that it fills my stomach. It tastes amazing, too (my fianc\u00e9 will always steal some). Because it\u2019s so low calorie, I know I can eat the entire pot, and it makes about a gallon of soup.!<",
