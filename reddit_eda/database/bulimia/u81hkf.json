  "selftext": "this is such a sad life. all ive been doing today is b/p all day on easter chocolate, mcdonalds, cookies, bread, ice cream every snack going. my teeth hurt so much i feel so tired, emotional and drained. i tell myself after each time that i'm never going to do it again, for it to repeat the next day. i always have a bit of money left over so i use that on binge food. no one has found out and its been going on for almost 5 years now, i'm such a good liar when it comes to it, i know my family's schedule, times they leave the house and return so i can fit a b/p in\n\nat first it excites me and gives me such a thrill as ive always loved food so i cant wait to eat but after purging i feel so sad again and its back to reality, its back to feeling how i always feel before b/ping just so alone isolated and misunderstood. my teeth are chipping away and are looking more yellow than ever that no amount of toothpaste and mouthwash can fix, i have no friends in the real world just online, my skin is so blotchy and dry, i feel and look so run down oh and the joke is im not even losing weight consistently just gaining and losing so no one would even notice whats going on anyway. the thrill quickly wears away and its back to laying in bed crying wishing my life was different.... im so tired thanks for reading",

I had pretty much nobody even for encouragement and definitely not attention. And I wanted it that way because again the shame. If I had it my way nobody on earth would ever have known. I'm just saying this because what other people think does not change the way we do. We need our own minds to change and then our behaviors follow. Mine changed when I realized I don't want to die. I don't want to leave a hole in my husband and families hearts. And for me I realized not getting better was actually a selfish act. All binging was about was \"feeling good\" for me.

Following those directions and working closely with a sponsor who has the experience of recovery has proven to relieve thousands of people from their addictions, regardless of the behavior. The origin of the problem is a thinking problem, and if you work the 12 steps it can straighten out the thinking so body and spirit can follow in tune. This is a program for people that have tried everything else, don\u2019t think there is anything else out there that can help, and are willing to invest time into working the steps in their daily lives.

I would check out your local 12 step groups and see if anyone fits this description-they have had a spiritual awakening as a result of working the 12 steps of AA on your specific problem behavior. Look up the 12 step group of your primary addiction (ie the specific substance/drug you use that is most likely going to kill you over the other).
