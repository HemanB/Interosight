  "title": "My list of \"why's\" for Quitting Bulimia.",
  "selftext": "It's June 27th, 2021 and this is the day after a slip up with bulimia. Today starts my streak of b/p free days. Sunday, July 25th will mark my 1 month streak.\n\nHere is a list of why I HATE bulimia. Whenever I feel urges to b/p in the upcoming month, I will look at this list for motivation. Feel free to comment and add your why's, or cons of bulimia to this list:\n\n\u2022puffy swollen salivary glands \n\n\u2022dehydrated\n\n\u2022 bad skin\n\n\u2022 Mindlessly eating as fast as possible when nothing even tastes good anymore. Not even enjoying the food or paying attention to flavor or texture and solely focusing on how much time I have before I need to go and purge. \n\n\u2022wasted money on binge food\n\n\u2022wasted time binging and purging \n\n\u2022Needing to save up to move out into my own apartment because my parents are overbearing and can get really toxic. I need my own space. They also trigger my b/p episodes and comment on anything I eat\n\n\u2022Need to save money for my own car \n\n\u2022Need to dedicate more time to school to finish this last semester of college strong\n\n\u2022self neglect/ lack of self care and hygiene because I waste so much time with bulimic habits\n\n\u2022Getting sick and calling off work often \n\n\u2022 Isolation myself/ avoiding meeting people my age bc I'm ashamed of my disgusting habits\n\n\u2022 Waking up super late and being unproductive because I spent the whole night binging and purging and cleaning up the mess. \n\n\u2022 Not working out or eating healthy/ nourishing food because I'm so caught up in eating and puking junk food.\n\n\u2022Sore gums and sensitive teeth \n\n\u2022 Smelling like puke and tasting acid in my mouth\n\n\u2022Ugly nails and dry/ ugly hands with knuckle scabs\n\n\u2022 Digestive issues\n\n\u2022under eye bags\n\n\u2022Being an indoor hermit and not getting fresh air or sunlight bc I'm spending hours inside binging and puking\n\n\u2022Never enjoying a cheat meal because it all turns into mindless binging and puking instead of a sensible sit-down dessert that I actually appreciate.\n\n\u2022I miss my kick ass workout sessions that gave me endorphins. Trashing my body and wasting time binging and purging took that away from me. \n\n\u2022Bloating \n\n\u2022That gross *here we go again* feeling when I am facing the toilet to purge after a binge \n\n\u00b0 The shame and guilt of binging and purging food that wasn't even mine and then explaining myself \n\n\u2022The feeling of loss of control when I start a binge, not knowing exactly how many calories I'll actually be able to purge.\n\n\u2022Anxiety after a day of binging and purging, thinking about how many calories I absorbed and what number I'll see on the scale the next morning. \n\n\u2022Hair loss because I'm eating crap and puking, never absorbing micronutrients that will help my body repair damages\n\n\u2022Anticipating people I love will just leave me alone so I can have time to binge and purge\n\n\u2022Losing control around food in public or in bad situations and then having to get creative about how/ where I'm going to purge.",
