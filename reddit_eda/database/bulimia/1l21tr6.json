  "selftext": "We all know skinny privilege is so large in EDs. \n\nI\u2019m staying at an all inclusive and I really wanted to binge, but I already had dinner earlier. I was thinking about how the waitress would make fun of me for eating twice. Then I realized im no longer that obese girl. I\u2019m a mid size, 6/8, but I\u2019m quite tall. She\u2019s not gonna think what a pig she\u2019s eating again. She\u2019ll probably not think anything at all. But if she did, she\u2019d probably just think I got hungry again. \n\nSame with buying binge food. Whenever I get self conscious about buying binge food, I remember that I\u2019m in a socially acceptable body and that unlike when I was obese, they won\u2019t think I\u2019m a disgusting fat pig. They\u2019ll think I\u2019m just having a cheat day, or going to a party or whatever. They\u2019ll never assume that I\u2019m actually consuming so much food because I\u2019m mid size. ",

      "body": "This is something I'm worried will happen if I continue gaining weight and surpass my heaviest weigh in again. I've rapidly put on over a stone since my lightest weight, when the binges started again back then I didn't care about what people thought of me when I ate abnormally large meals, went for seconds and thirds, or bought binge food. They wouldn't assume that I was eating like that all the time or that I had a problem with food. Heck maybe even some people thought I just had a fast metabolism and was lucky, and didn't see the disordered patterns. But as I get heavier I realise that people's perception of me doing these things might change, and that brings about so much more shame with this disorder :(",
