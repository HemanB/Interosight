      "body": "Great job, keep on going! Remember, there is a huge possibility that you will now be facing the back-and-forth phase. There is a possibility that you will collapse in these upcoming days. In those moments remember; it is not about black-and-white thinking as \u201cWell, I already failed today so I can aswell go all way to extreme BP\u201d. It\u2019s about being able to stop when you have once collapsed. That is where the great strength is practiced. It\u2019s not about how many days in row you can be without, it\u2019s about how many times you will be able to stop the urge. Hardest moments will be those if/when you collapse, so those moments are more important than any other moment to force yourself to stop. Mastering black-and-white thinking is one of the most powerful tools for self-discipline and control.",
