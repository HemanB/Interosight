My therapist looked totally unimpressed when I said \"look I have actually no idea except I'm spending $800-1000 a month on food. Maybe 40-60 times a month but I truly have no idea, I don't count them, I have to go off the grocery bill.\"\n\nIt's totally skewed as I'm buying less now but food is so expensive compared to a year ago and when you eat properly you buy better food, it's not exactly an accurate form of measuring. I think I spent $480 this month but only did that behaviour  maybe 3-4 times a week. Like in last year's prices it would be like $380 for a month.",
