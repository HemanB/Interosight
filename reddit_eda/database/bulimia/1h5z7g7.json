He must want to be skinny.\" No Cindy, its not about being skinny. Its about control and a terrible coping mechanism for chronic depression.\n\nJust because I hate my hips doesnt mean I want to be skinny or lose alot of weight. I'm just severely severely depressed. Everyones reasons are different but I hate how they assume im this way because \"yOuNg pEopLe AnD dUh mEdiYaaA\" shut up Cindy!!!\n\nBulimia doesnt always equal SKINNY IDEAL by default... sometimes were just miserable man.",
