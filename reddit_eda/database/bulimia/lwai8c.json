  "selftext": "I know probably lots of people do this I\u2019m just really panicky and alone rn.  \n\nI can\u2019t stop obsessing over my teeth. Every morning I get up and poke around my mouth in front of the mirror for ages. I keep getting convinced that my teeth are shrinking and dying even though looking at past pictures they don\u2019t look that different. Every time I get tooth pain from jaw clenching (thanks zoloft...) I panic that it\u2019s actually pain from a cavity that\u2019s going to make my teeth fall out. I\u2019m constantly googling photos of healthy teeth to try and work out if mine are okay, it feels like they\u2019re much thinner than they\u2019re supposed to be.  \n\nI\u2019m in recovery and have had only maybe 7-8 days of bad b/ping in the past 6 months. And even when I was really bad I was mostly only purging dinner every day, and I\u2019d try to wash my mouth out after when I could with baking soda and water. The last time I saw a dentist was a year ago back when I was full blown relapsed and they said my teeth were fine, but I still can\u2019t get out of my own head.  \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do, checking my teeth takes up so much time and energy every day but I don\u2019t know how to stop it. My teeth used to be the only thing I liked about my appearance and now I\u2019m constantly hiding them.",

      "body": "hi, i have suffered from b/p for about 8 years now and finally this year i have realized that my mouth and teeth feel different, definitely from decay and stomach acid:( i had to stop smoking weed actually because every time i do i panic and constantly think about my poor mouth and everything that could go wrong. \n\nWhat i\u2019m doing is trying my best to end purging and my teeth have become a very incentive to not get sick anymore. (easier said than done ik) but now i consistently use toothpaste that helps with enamel and gum repair and brush 2x a day and i really think it\u2019s all i can do in my situation without going to a dentist because i\u2019m too scared. \ni hope this kind of helps and i hope you know you aren\u2019t alone here :)",

      "body": "Go to the dentist if you can, it will alleviate a lot of stress. I went last Thursday after b/p several times a day for most of 2020. I was convinced that my teeth had been eroded to nubs, were completely transparent, and every small amount of sensitivity was surely the sign of some damage I\u2019d done.\nBut yeah, saw the dentist, told her about my ED history, and left with a clean bill of health and strict instructions to floss. Everyone in the office also said I had great teeth which helped alleviate a lot of paranoia that everyone who saw me was heckling over my see-through teeth.",

      "body": "Hey! This sounds like it could be a body dysmorphic disorder kind of thing, or another manifestation of anxiety (and quitting a destructive coping mechanism leads to high anxiety in the short term, of course). I struggled with both bulimia and serious but unrelated BDD about my skin/acne. Idk, I'd look into the symptoms of BDD and see if that fits how you feel about your teeth. Even if there were something wrong with your teeth, it seems like the anxiety/checking is disproportionate to whatever the problem is, which is the essence of BDD.\n\nDental stuff is hugely related to genetics also. Given the duration/extent of my bulimia my teeth should be garbage but they're okay?  Though it was in recovery that I first started feeling real panic/grief about how I treated my body, and like how could it still be working after all I'd done to it? I think those feelings are part of the recovery process, sort of coming back into this body that's been through a lot and really being present in it again.",

Years later I mustered up the courage to go to the dentist and it wasn't nearly as bad as I anticipated. I had to get a few fillings and this month am having a gum surgery, but my teeth aren't ruined. It's unlikely that your teeth are ruined either. I can assure you that the anxiety surrounding your oral health is probably worse than your actual oral. That being said, intervention for any dental health issues you have will serve you better the sooner you can get it.\n\nHang in there! You're not alone and it sounds like you're already on your journey to recovery.  <3",
