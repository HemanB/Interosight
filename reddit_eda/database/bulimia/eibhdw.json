It's the first time since October that I managed to last longer than 4 days and I feel so much better!\n\nMy muscles cramps are almost gone, but I still need to supplement potassium. I've been hitting the gym almost every day and that gives me motivation to continue. I could barely walk at my worst because of the cramps, and now I can do all of the workouts I wanted to.\n\nI still don't eat enough (I usually tend to restrict a lot when I don't binge) but I'm working on getting more calories in without feeling guilty, because I want to build some muscles.\n\nHow are things for you?",
