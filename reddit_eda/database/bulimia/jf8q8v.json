I don't feel at home in the r/AnorexiaNervosa sub because I have quite long periods of binging followed by quite long periods of restriction (about 3 months each usually). But yeah, I feel weird here too even though I technically have bulimia cause it's non-purging type.\n\nAnybody else like me here? :)",

I carried so much shame for so long.\n\nNow I'm fat again, but working out normally (no more than an hour, 3-5 times a week, whoo!), and mostly happy.  I am just trying to reign in my binge/purge (restrict) cycle.  Nothing is as extreme as it was back then, but I'm tired of the fucking yoyo!  It also doesn't help that OMAD is a trendy thing now - I did that for most of late 2017 and almost all of 2018 and 2019 trying to pretend it wasn't a relapse lmao.  I got myself back into therapy in October 2019 and stopped for the most part but giving up all compensation sucks ASS.  EMDR and mindful eating/journaling have really, REALLY been helping though.\n\nI hope I can figure out a balance and that you can, too.\n\n\\*edit dates because even though you're all internet strangers, I wanna be accurate lmao",

I had this light bulb moment haha",

I was literally JUST talking about how I've never been formally diagnosed, but I feel weird saying BED as a whole (even though I feel like that's what people assume if I mention binging in any way). I've had multiple periods of gaining and losing over a hundred pounds because of exactly what you just said. I would have months on end of low restriction and start to feel high on the feeling of being able to go days without eating and then I don't understand what would cause the shift, but I would literally go through binge periods so bad my bank account would be in the negative because I was wasting so much money on food. It's like there was no in between. I didn't start to work my way towards anywhere near \"normal\" eating patterns until I was 24.",
