  "selftext": "I hit a new low guys. I worked in the morning and then my bf picked me up and we went to my house. He was away at college and so we haven't seen eachother all week and won't see eachother again until next weekend. After like 2 hours at my house my binge cravings completely took over and I told my boyfriend I had hmwk and he didn't buy that bc he knows I'm failing all my classes from my bulimia and then I just told him I was upset and wanted alone time. I really hurt him but I didn't care, I couldn't wait for him to leave so I could binge and vomit. I love him so much and I can't believe these actions actually came from me. I feel so awful and upset and this is a new low. ",

It\u2019s important to remember these actions aren\u2019t YOUR actions, even if logically they feel like they are, they\u2019re the actions of someone caught in a physiological b/p cycle. I don\u2019t know how you were feeling in that moment, but it doesnt seem like the type of binge where you just wanted yummy food and kicked him out to eat freely\u2026 to me, it seems very physiologically based in this specific instance. That, despite wanting him there, you just NEEDED to eat. At this point in your ED, extreme hunger probably doesn\u2019t feel like normal hunger, it likely feels like you just \u201creally want that snack\u201d despite not feeling extremely hungry\u2026 and that\u2019s not only confusing but also encourages your brain to conclude you just wanted to binge, and it discounts all the physiological influences. In my experience with my partner, it has always been best for me to come to him after and transparently explain why I did what I did, and how I feel because of it. You know your relationship and what\u2019s best, but sometimes telling the truth to a safe person will not only resolve any misunderstandings in the relationship, but also take some of that shame off of your shoulders. Plus, to put things into context, I\u2019ve heard of non ED people kicking their bfs out for way worse reasons so please don\u2019t feel bad, you have a serious mental health condition",
