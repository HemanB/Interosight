I told my boyfriend I was extremely full and having trouble and he said \u201cthat\u2019s not even a normal amount of food people would eat, you could eat the other half and it would be ok\u201d and when I thought about that I was like wow this Shit really has a hold of me to where I\u2019m thinking this is a large amount of food lol. I used to bing big big big amounts and now a half a sandwich scares me. It\u2019s crazy.  I need to look through a different perspective when thinking this way for sure",
