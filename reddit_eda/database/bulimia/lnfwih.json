I don\u2019t have the fucking money to keep impulsively buying all this just to binge and purge but I feel like I completely separate from myself and snap out of it only after it is all over. I want this to all end.",

We just gotta take this sickness one day at a time. Of course you\u2019re going to fuck up sometimes. You\u2019re only human. Not only that your a human suffering from something mentally and physically MAJOR. Don\u2019t be so hard on yourself. Lets try again to stay on track tomorrow, and if you fuck up that day to, who freakin cares. We\u2019ll try again and again and again til we get it right. Sending you good vibes, babe\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95.",
