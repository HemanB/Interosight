  "selftext": "Quitting bulimia is not at all like quitting vaping smoking drugs alcohol etc. You can\u2019t go cold turkey on food. How am I supposed to go cold turkey with bulimia if I have to eat?? It\u2019s like trying to quite vaping but needing to take one hit a day to live. I fucking don\u2019t like food anymore it\u2019s not fun to eat I just have to eat to live. I have had anorexia and I can\u2019t help but go too far and pass out or some shit. I wouldn\u2019t love to live a life without food but it\u2019s a hell of a lot easier than eating something every day so my organs don\u2019t fucking fail. I can\u2019t \u201cavoid my triggers\u201d food IS my trigger, and trying to stop purging with that state of mind is like lingering right outside the crack house ALL THE FUCKING TIME while trying to quite fucking crack. I hate this shit. time to purge",

We need food in our lives its a human need, and the problem with bulimia lies with binging. Is all foods your triggers? maybe try buying completley new food that seems good to eat, theres gotta be something you can do. dont let yourself fall deep and deeper into the rabbit hole and do whatever you can to help yourself. hell, even try to just binge LESS. i think thats helped me.",
