I wasnt at an underweight bmi, but I did lose weight and i only had to restrict. No frequent binges. Now, after recovery, I overgained and Im now at an overweight bmi. Im losing some weight on this disorder (I started frequently purging not too long ago) and it is so exhausting. I have to make sure the door is locked, make sure no one is standing near the door, and make sure my fingers dont smell like puke once im done. I also have to spend 10+ minutes near the toilet. This disorder is messing me up so badly..",

In my experience, both are mental insanity that is focused on self-obsession, and trying so hard to be okay and acceptable, but using a very unhealthy means and very unhealthy rubrics of perfectionism and letting societal standards, instead of following my own path, rule  life. I wasn't ever religious, but I'm praying to become less self-obsessed so I can focus on whatever stuff I am here to do in this life, and pray that I have a body that is healthy and strong and that can enable to me to do the work I am here to do (however it may end up looking).
