I couldn\u2019t eat salad, i couldn\u2019t bite into a cold vegetable of any kind for a year!\n\nThe solution: (it\u2019s the only solution actually)\n\nROOT CANALS\n\nWhen teeth rot and go bad, they do not heal. They\u2019re done. They\u2019re dead. Root canals are our last option. Im being very serious.\n\nNow that i\u2019ve had 20ish root canals in the last 3 years, the pain is gone, i can eat easily, and going to the dentist is SO NOT SCARY ANYMORE! it\u2019s great! no pain! \n\nI also found that my body and pain receptors got used to the root canal procedures. It became less painful over time. Very odd, but very helpful! \n\nRoot canals only hurt in the beginning for a very brief time when they inject you with numbing meds. In addition to numbing your mouth, the numbing meds also have a relaxer in them which is fantastic. It enabled me to be less nervous, slow my heart rate, and relax in the chair.\n\nThe rest of the procedure is easy peazy. After all, it\u2019s not like we have to do the hard stuff! Imagine being a dentist/endodontist and having to make tiny holes and clean them out and not have shaking hands. That sounds impossible! So when i think of it like that, Im like so happy all i have to do is lean back and open my mouth! \n\nGood luck to you. You are young and should be able to use your teeth. \n\nMy BIGGEST RECOMMENDATION:\n\nDon\u2019t have a regular dentist do your root canals.\n\nGo to an ENDODONTIST which are dentists who literally only do root canals. They are better at doing these procedures because it is their specialty.",

Two back to back pregnancies, last ones being twins, threw up stomach bile until I delivered, even in my sleep! Now I have to spend a shit ton to fix my teeth. I don\u2019t really have noticeable decay besides some tiny black pet dot sized cavities. Imma need some root canals for sure! I just heard they can fail so I\u2019m on edge about it. I hope you\u2019re doing better \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96",

          "body": "if and when you get root canals DONT GO TO A REGULAR DENTIST!!!\n\nGO TO AN ENDODONTIST \n\nthat is literally a dentist who only does root canals. it\u2019s their one job, literally! i had no idea they existed but they are THE BEST way to have a root canal. i don\u2019t even have pain when they do it to me. Because they only do root canals and do them every single day, they are super skilled and fast and hurt you much less than a regular ol dentist would. please trust me on this. i\u2019ve had root canals from both types of doctors.\n\nSeeing an endodontist might be a bit more expensive than a regular dentist. They charge you based on the tooth, with front teeth costing less than back teeth because you have more roots in back teeth. I live in California and for me each root canal has cost roughly $1500 per tooth.",
