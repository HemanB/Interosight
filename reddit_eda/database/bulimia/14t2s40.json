  "selftext": "This is the lowest I have ever been. 2-3 weeks b/p and I\u2019ve gained back 5 out of the 8kgs I lost, I haven\u2019t b/p this past week with the expectation of P a little if I feel too full but no binging which is win. \n\nLast Sunday, instead of going to the grocery store to buy binge food like I have the past 2 sundays, I bought raw chicken. And I ate it. I ate it because I wanted to get food poisoning. I was praying I would get super sick and get skinny again. I didn\u2019t get sick somehow however I feel like mentally that was completely fkd and I do not think is normal.\n\nI went to drs after having a breakdown this morning and was given a referral to phsycologist for depression & eating disorder, I really want to be normal",

And you can lose weight without getting food poisoning...like...I mean, you know what I mean.\n\nAnyway, my own dumb comments aside, I am really glad that you did not contract something deadly.\n\nRaw meat can contain deadly pathogens; microscopic germs that can k![[ you, or, do enough damage to do so before you can get to the hospital in time. Permanent damage can also be done to the brain while you remain alive to carry out the rest of your days (ultimately making them worse.)\n\nThis was not a regular BP, this was a su!c!d\u20ac mission. One that you did not deserve. One that you thankfully survived.\n\nI am a [mostly] recovered survivor of a severe 10-year ED...\n\nAll I can say is that it is not worth it.\nAnd whoever has hurt you, deserves the pain that you are inflicting upon yourself. Not you.",
