  "selftext": "I feel like I've officially hit rock bottom. I thought I hit rock bottom a few times before but this is really it.\n\nFor starters, I've never had more than two intentional binge/purge sessions in a single day. Usually I'll have one around 11am and another around 4pm so that I can dispose of everything and clean before my parents and siblings get home (I live at home). Sometimes I also binge/purge at night if I don't have that second session but this is rare because I live at home and purging is, well, loud and messy.\n\nWell, today I had three binge/purge sessions. This has never happened before. I had to go to the grocery store after dinner to pick up some things for my mom and I impulsively bought a box of Cinnamon Toast Crunch and some Clif bars that were on sale. I got home and ate the entire box of cereal, the Clif bars, and three scones that my mom made. I wanted to purge so bad but the entire house was quiet and people would definitely hear. \n\nSo I brought water and garbage bags into the garage so I could purge into the bags, hide them in the garage, and throw them out later. The garage is obviously not the main part of the house so I figured I could purge in there and not wake anyone up. But then I became paranoid because my older sister has the room right next to the garage door and her room and the garage share a wall so maybe she'd be able to hear me purge. So I took my stuff into my parked car in the garage and purged in the backseat so that there'd be another layer of quiet.\n\nI'm literally thinking of this whole situation and I'm so disgusted with myself for purging three times in one day and also just by thinking of what I'm actually doing: I'm throwing up on purpose into garbage bags in the back seat of my car in my garage because I stuffed myself to the point of feeling ill because I don't know how to eat and I hate my body. Like what the actual fuck. How did I go from being a happy, chill kid who didn't give a second thought to what she ate to sitting in the back seat of my car throwing up into garbage bags. I don't even know where to go from here.",
