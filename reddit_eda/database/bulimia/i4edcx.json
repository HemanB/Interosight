  "selftext": "Ive been clean for 8 months now and it's the best decision I've ever made , I still fight the urge to B/P almost everyday. But I appreciate everything so much more now, I can eat out at a restaurant and not have to leave the table right after eating, I'm not dealing with a constant sore throat and my weight has been more consistent than ever, I just feel like a 100 pound weight was taken off my back and my mind is clear. \n\n I hope you all can experience this one day and change for the better, you deserve it",
