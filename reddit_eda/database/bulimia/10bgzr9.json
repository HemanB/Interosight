  "selftext": "i just have to get this off my chest\u2026.\n\nbackground: i have reached rock bottom. i didn\u2019t know i could get this low. i have had bulimia for close to 6 years now. EXTENSIVELY in the past 2 years. shit has been bad these past few months, blowing hundreds of dollars a month on B/P food. spending hours every evening ritualistically bingeing and purging. thoughts of food and B/P every other minute of every day. almost no food i\u2019ve eaten in the past few years i have intended to keep in my body. i must be surviving on the calories i can\u2019t fully purge away.\n\nhere it is- my big secret. i have destroyed not only my mind and body but my house too. i\u2019ve destroyed my plumbing system twice because of vomiting too much undigested food- it cost thousands to fix. so i stopped purging into the toilet and instead purged into bags that i used to dump in nearby dumpsters in the dead of night. that\u2019s right, i would put them in boxes in my car and drive them to dumpsters.\n\nonly i\u2019ve gotten depressed and lazy lately and so instead they\u2019ve been sitting on my floor in various rooms of my house, like a disgusting graveyard of my past sins. and some of them have leaked and destroyed my hardwood floors, carpets etc. my kitchen has so many wrappers and plastic and boxes that i\u2019m too depressed to clean up. tonight- i was boiling water (for B/P food) and all those wrappers next to the stovetop finally caught on fire. that\u2019s right, i set my kitchen on fire. by the time i noticed it, it was completely filled with smoke and the fire was climbing up my walls and had set a few things in the kitchen on fire. i ran and grabbed some jugs of water and put it out myself (oh yeah- unrelated but my water is messed up so i just shut it off rather than get a plumber, because i can\u2019t have anyone in my home because it is full of vomit). i had to put the fire out myself because once again, i was too ashamed to CALL THE FIRE DEPARTEMENT and let them in my home. my kitchen is half destroyed, my stove and oven don\u2019t work, i think i blew some electrical things too.\n\nand i can\u2019t do anything about any of it until i get rid of the vomit in my home. but i\u2019m too scared and anxious and ashamed to do anything. i\u2019m paralyzed in this graveyard.\n\ni don\u2019t need anything from anyone, i know how  fucked up everything is. i just had to say it out loud to someone just once\n\nEDIT: deep down some part of me feared posting this because I would get replies telling me what a disgusting freak I was and that I was too far gone for help and who knows what else. I should have known better that this community would show me love and acceptance and well wishes for the future, and stories about how they\u2019ve been there too\u2026 I can\u2019t share this shame with anyone but those of us that get it. You can\u2019t talk about habitual vomiting to anyone else and expect them to understand. So thank you, for making me feel seen and less alone\u2026 I love you all. I really do. All my fellow broken busted souls, we are connected in some deep way and I have love for you all \u2764\ufe0f",

When I was still living with my parent/s, I messed up the plumbing. There were weird maggot things that started appearing in the toilet. They tried to call me out on it. So I started using ziplock and plastic grocery store bags, they were in a cubby in my room. I had to get Raid/fly traps for my room at the time bc it had a nasty swarm, literal SWARM of fruit flies. Why the fuck did I do that?! Well, bc I love food and hate it, don't want other people to know my struggle and I have extreme body dysmorphia, also bc intense shame I feel about my actions... Sure I enjoy/feel guilty after my relief sessions, I also feel guilty bc food costs money and I'm metaphorically flushing money down the toilet. So wasteful. These days, I live with my bf, I ONLY eat or b/p while he's at work or when he's sleeping. Plus I have insomnia so I'm 'eating' any point between 11:30pm-1am, then recuperating from my sickness for a few hours, lay in bed thinking terrible shit and lying to myself for a couple more hours... Just waiting, then somehow I finally fall asleep from being exhausted. Or I don't sleep bc my life choices haunt me. I've gone to inpatient, outpatient, psychiatrists.

Can our bravery of wanting to be healthy overcome our debilitating fear of becoming healthy? The questions go on and are dark, morbid, scary...

There's a common thing with people with ED's. We crave control, control of our lives, what goes in our body and what even gets to stay in our body. But it all stems from 'trauma/s' that we had to go thru at some point in life. My father passed away when I was 2, I never got to know him. I was born without a thyroid (Congenital Hypothyroidism), As a kid...my family moved me to a new town, so I was maliciously bullied, I was abused and almost killed multiple times by my own brother who was always in and out of prison. My parents got divorced (stepfather) bc he was cheating on her, i lost my job bc I almost died there bc I was diagnosed with severe Epilepsy. My license was a bitch to keep cuz of the Epilepsy. Every boyfriend I've had was fucked up and cheated on me (except the one I'm currently with), my mother verbally and physically abused me (she has stabbed, punched/slapped, spit at me, ran after me with a knife, thrown heavy objects. She also consistently told me I was ugly, nasty looking, that any bf I have would be grossed out by my body), then I was a severely extreme alcoholic...I drank so much I didn't know how I ended up in another place the next day. With different men sexually assaulting me, I was raped. I lost so much will to go on. My drinking finally caught up with me and I was rushed to the hospital and had to stay for 2 weeks bc my pancreas failed and I was dying (yet again). I became sober (8 years now). There's more... But I'm sure you get it. All these things I've gone thru led to me feel alone, ugly, depressed, and like I have no control over my own life. And that where I always counted on my B/P. I know it's one part of my life, of myself, that I am in control of (even tho it's completely out of control tbh). Restriction, B/P, makes me feel like even tho everything else is terrible... THIS is MINE, I get to decide, I have the power over this one aspect. I'm not necessarily 'proud' of it, But I feel good having something ONLY I can change.",

I guess they have their own lives and I'm a lost cause they wouldn't know how to help if they tried. At this stage in the game, it's just what I do and they're probably tired of hearing about it.\n\nThose closest who know (ie partner), well, I still feel the need to hide at all costs there. I think it saddens and frustrates him. We both know he doesn't deserve to have to deal with this and to a degree, i think he's a bit scared of coming home to a heart attack on the sofa one day. \n\nThe shame is always there in our moments of weakness and every bp, whether meticulously planned or momentary compulsion, feels like weakness. \n\nI like to think the trick is to try and abstain a little longer each time and try experimenting with foods you like and can accept to keep in. If you pull yourself onto the first stepping stone, its easier to reach out and talk to someone. It also helps give that someone (who just doesn't get the problem) a point to pull you back onto.",

Get rid of the food wrappers, cover up floor stains or whatever you feel you need to do to call the plumber/ electrician/ whoever. Remember, contractors really don't give a crap about the state of your house, they're there to work and get paid. \n\nMore importantly, go outside. Break the chain of events, even if it is only for an afternoon spent by yourself doing something seemingly pointless. Change your environment for a few hours. If you can go spend time with someone, even better. If you can confide in someone, that's ideal. (If you can go to a doctor or shrink, do that too!)\n\nRock bottom is dreadful, but you Need to wriggle yourself back up before you rot down there! I've been there, it's hard, but you need to be your own slap in the face to make that first step. PM me if you want, maybe a sympathetic ear is helpful? x",
