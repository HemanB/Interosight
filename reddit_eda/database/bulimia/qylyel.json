Though I still hated my body, I still had the joy of being \u201csmaller\u201d. personally bulimia did something much more severe and intense to my emotional and mental state- i was on the edge of a cliff like 24/7 it was rougher than id ever imagine. \nbut i realized that if I went back to anorexia, it would just be this whole big cycle and id eventually be back to struggling with bulimia bc my body wouldnt last forever with the restriction. i know its hard to live with the struggle of bulimia but dont stop fighting to move forward!! its not worth it to move back to where you started\u2026 you are worth so much more than to continue living with an ED!! Theres always a way out, i believe in you!! I thought it was impossible but actually after finally recovering i saw that it was more than possible\u2764\ufe0f",
