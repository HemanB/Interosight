  "selftext": "i\u2019ve had bulimia for a while now. My parents have caught me throwing up multiple times and they said if i do it again i\u2019m getting kicked out, so i lied about stopping because it\u2019s straining our family. But really it\u2019s worse than it\u2019s ever been. My teeth hurt so bad and i can\u2019t get out of this cycle no matter what i do but i feel like i missed my opportunity for help because i lied when i should\u2019ve just been completely honest the first time. They don\u2019t think it\u2019s that serious they think it\u2019s just a bad relationship with my body and food, meanwhile i\u2019ve just been getting better at covering my tracks. I feel like i\u2019m losing my mind because i have no control over my binges and throwing up. If you\u2019re bulimic you know the rest of it i don\u2019t even have to explain: the guilt, being in the mirror for hours, isolating yourself, constantly thinking about food, it goes on. Do i just be honest to them even if they hate me for lying? do i just check myself into the ED clinic and leave? someone give me any type of advice please idc what it is",

      "body": "Heyah! Well to begin with. Its NEVER too late to get help. Unfortunately throwing up can cause rotten teeth (thats why ur teeth hurt). I dont know your relationship with your family but they should be supportive. Bulimia is an eating disorder....a sickness. They shouldn't make you feel worst than you already feel!\nNow in my opinion you have to think about yourself. Do you think it will help u if u tell them? Yes they love u to the moon and back but will they express their love in a toxic way? \nIf you dont want to tell them, choose a friend. Its good to talk about it with someone.\nI am not aware of your age but you should also go to a therapist. (It doesnt have to be one you can try many until you find the most suitable) \nNow dont get me wrong. A therapist doesn't have a magic want that will make bulimia go away. You will have to work HARD. Its a difficult journey but its worth it.\nThe first thing you have to do is think WHY and HOW it started. Most, started cause they wanted to loose weight but its not they only reason! Some also think that the addicting thing is the \"control\" you think you have over what you eat.\nHowever the truth is u r not free. You cant enjoy food and slowly but surely you will isolate yourself.\nBulimia doesnt fix ANY problems (like seriously it doesn't even make u loose weight) so ye.\nDetermination my friend. Many of us are going through it. Sending you all the support. (Also you can start watching youtubers who got over bulimia. Make sure they are healthy tho because if they are \"in the process\" of self-treatmen then their channel can work as a bulimia group where u compare what u eat to them. Watch the people who got better to see the happiness in their eyes. NOT to compare but to feel motivated.)",

      "body": "Hi. I\u2019ve experienced a very similar situation as you while still in high school, including actually being kicked out. I recognize your fear but it\u2019s likely that your family does not hate you. They are fearful because they do not want you to suffer. When people do not understand a scary situation (such as their child being bulimic), they resort to anger. I do not know your exact situation, but if you clearly explain to them what exactly you\u2019re struggling with, your parents will probably help you. It\u2019s about simplifying the situation, making it less of a scary unknown. If you think about food constantly, putting physical barriers may be a way to prevent binges. If you calmly explain to your parents the steps that could help you, such as putting locks on certain cabinets, or helping you by asking how your relationship with food has been every few days (kind of keeping you in check), they will most likely help you. However, you should definitely also consult a medical professional. For me, these steps never happened, which lead to 5 years of struggle and ruined relationships. I don\u2019t think you should sacrifice communication. There is no reason to continue lying.",

I told him when I was 19 and he\u2019s been trying to get me help, therapy, doctors, meds but nothing works because I am scared of change.
