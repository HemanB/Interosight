  "title": "The truth about bulimia",
  "selftext": "In the media, they show young, thin \u2014 often white \u2014 girls bent over a toilet, mascara smeared, ribs protruding, faces twisted in sadness. That\u2019s their version of bulimia. A cautionary tale. A broken girl who just wants to be pretty. They assume it\u2019s about vanity. About fitting into a dress. About being thin for the sake of being thin. They reduce it to a phase or a shallow obsession.\n\nThey think the fix is simple. Therapy. Food management. \"Just eat healthy.\" \"Just love yourself.\" Like it\u2019s that easy. Like a mantra or a meal plan can reach down into the darkness and pull you out. Some people are even disgusted. \u201cWhy would you *make* yourself throw up? That\u2019s gross. That\u2019s a waste. That\u2019s *weak.*\u201d Or worse, they offer pity disguised as hierarchy \u2014 \u201cWell, at least you\u2019re not *anorexic.* You still look... normal.\u201d\n\nBut what they don\u2019t see is the real disease. The one that hides in silence. The one that lives behind locked doors and under the bed. They don\u2019t see the self-loathing that hangs over you like a fog. They don\u2019t see the bruised knuckles, raw throat, cracked lips. They don\u2019t know about the jars, the bags, the bowls filled with vomit hidden behind the shoes in your closet, behind the stacks of books under your bed. The frantic panic of needing to *get it out.* Not because of weight \u2014 not always \u2014 but because it feels *wrong* to keep it in. Because the body feels foreign, bloated with shame. And you know the ritual. You know the release.\n\nThey don\u2019t see the moments leading up to it \u2014 the compulsion to eat, not even to taste, but to *numb.* To feel nothing. To fill the void, only to punish yourself for daring to do so. To cry on a bathroom floor not because you\u2019re sad, but because the act has become the only form of control you still own. The only comfort left.\n\nAnd they definitely don\u2019t see the way you function. The way you wear the mask so well. You\u2019re \u201cfine.\u201d You\u2019re \u201cnormal.\u201d You\u2019re smiling, productive, funny. You know how to be what they expect. \u201cYou\u2019re one of the happiest people I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d a client told me once as I rang up his groceries. I smiled back, the lie automatic. \u201cI try to stay positive.\u201d But he didn\u2019t see the night before, when I was on the floor of my bedroom, trying to save my carpet from the bucket of vomit that I accidentally spilled on it. He didn\u2019t see the war I fight every day just to seem okay.\n\nWhat did I do to deserve this?  \nThat question loops in my mind. Over and over.  \nWhat did I *do* to make my own body feel like an enemy?  \nWhat did I *do* to lose the ability to eat a meal without guilt?  \nWhat did I *do* to feel so empty that pain became a ritual?\n\nBut maybe it's not about what I did.  \nMaybe it\u2019s about what I carry.  \nThe expectations. The pressure. The silence. The need to be perfect. The fear of being *seen.*  \nMaybe it\u2019s about a world that praises thinness but shames the methods people take to get there. That glamorizes discipline but demonizes disorder.\n\nAnd maybe... just maybe... someone reading this will see past the stereotype. Will understand that bulimia isn\u2019t just about throwing up food \u2014 it\u2019s about throwing up pain. It\u2019s not about looking a certain way \u2014 it\u2019s about surviving in a way that makes sense to the chaos in your mind.\n\nWe are not disgusting. We are not weak.  \nWe are hurting. We are hiding.  \nAnd we are desperately trying to find a way out.",
