  "title": "Can I be bulimic and fat?",
  "selftext": "To preface this I always get this overwhelming urge to force myself to vomit after I eat a lot. It gets ESPECIALLY worse if I am on a calorie deficit and I fuck up by eating out or eating sweets. Usually after I vomit it helps quiet the \u201cyou\u2019re a fat pig in a trough\u201d voices. Even tho I really am lmfao. \n\nI always had this idea that bulimic people are super thin skinny or closer to what your stereotypical anorexic person looks like. \n\nBut Im 200+ lbs, my therapist says Im a textbook case for it but Im confused. How can I be \u201ctextbook\u201d bulimic if Im morbidly obese? Like if Im so \u201cdisordered\u201d how can I still be built like this? Isn\u2019t this an insult to girls who struggle to eat, put on weight, and keep food down? \n\nIf this is bulimia what works for keeping that noise away? If it\u2019s not could anyone here tell me what this is I feel like I\u2019m going crazy. I *know* its some kind of disorder but I cant say it\u2019s this. \n\nEdit: Thank you guys for all the support in the comments. I talk about this with my therapist too but I guess getting other opinions makes me feel better? Or more secure in not being like a poser or something?? You all made me feel valid, even if I know having an ED is a serious problem. ",
