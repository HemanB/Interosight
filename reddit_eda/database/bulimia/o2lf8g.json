      "body": "the only thing I\u2019ve found that gets me out of the cycle is forcing myself to eat regularly and it mostly works. it sucks but when you try to control binging by restricting you will inevitably end up binging again so they only way to stop it is stopping the restriction first and eating 3+ meals a day and snacks, and not denying yourself anything. I\u2019ve been working at it like that for about 6 months now and I\u2019m down to 1-2 binges a month at most instead of once every few days, it takes a lot of time but it is possible to get out of the cycle \u2665\ufe0f",

You know it\u2019s irrational but you are compulsively compelled to act out in these ways.\nAlso ED and OCD can be linked so I guess that makes sense?!\n\nWould love it if you posted some of your knowledge on a sub!! \u2026.just sayin\u2019",
