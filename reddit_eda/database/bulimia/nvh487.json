On the flip side of the coin, what do you know about your mom\u2019s history? Is there anything in her childhood or family relationships worth considering? I have had bulimia Is for 22 (!!!) years so I really don\u2019t give it any thought. But when you stop and really think about this disorder from the perspective of not knowing anything about it,perhaps she just can\u2019t wrap her head around it. You definitely need love and support, there\u2019s no doubt about that. Maybe your mom needs some literature to read and some time to process all of this too.\nThis disease is complicated in more ways than one. \nXOXO",

Because I used to eat so fucking much and be greedy with food just for them to find out I purged it. \n\nFirst thing I feel is shame then anger at myself. But I can\u2019t really make anyone understand why I do it without sounding lazy. \u201cI just don\u2019t wanna gain weight\u201d. I means it\u2019s obviously SO MUCH DEEPER than that but when it comes down to it that\u2019s why I literally purge. the fear of the food sticking to me. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you had to go through that but know that your mom is just confused and shocked. I hope that you find the way out and that you can heal",
