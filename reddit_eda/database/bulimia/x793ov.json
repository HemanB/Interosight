  "selftext": "I know many of us are in the same boat: restrictive eating disorder that eventually turned into binging and purging. \n\nI miss being anorexic, which may be horrible to say. Obviously I was miserable then too, and I\u2019m not saying restricting was good for my body at all! But y\u2019all know what I mean-bulimia is torture. I physically feel like I\u2019m dying sometimes after a violent purge or painful binge. The next day, my body feels utterly exhausted. My throat is sore. My face is painfully swollen. My neck aches from the angle of bending over the toilet. My hands look ugly and scarred (not hands free). Occasionally, I\u2019ll even come down with a fever and chills after a horrible BP session.  It just sucks. And I have nothing to show for it. I don\u2019t have the body I want and my mental state is worse than ever. \n\nAt least with anorexia, I didn\u2019t have to torture myself in such a violent way-it was more the choice to NOT do something (eat) than to actively choose harm behaviors (binge/purge). With anorexia, I had the body I wanted. I miss it. \n\nI hope this post doesn\u2019t diminish the struggles of people suffering with anorexia. I empathize and know it\u2019s not easy, I just needed to vent",

I am more tired and wilty when restricting, but I feel inhuman and unable to function in totality when I'm binge eating and/or purging. Restriction and anorexia wreak awful havoc on the body but the violence of bulimia and bed definitely feel quite a bit different.\nI hope you're able to fight through it and come out the other end. \ud83d\udc9b",

I know if it lasted longer than it did (about four years) there might have been long term damage, but I didn\u2019t feel nearly as ill and out of control as I do with bulimia \ud83d\ude15.\n\nI completely relate to every single thing you said about bulimia\u2019s effect on the body. The exhaustion, the throat pain, the swollen face, the neck and jaw pain. It\u2019s also made me worry about heart failure (after enormous, fatty binges) way more than I ever did with anorexia. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong- I would never ever want to be anorexic again. I had zero sex drive, hardly ever thought about anything but food, thinning hair, was freezing all the time, bones hurt when lying down, people gave me weird stares, struggled to find clothes that fit, family harassing me to gain weight etc. Still, I have to agree that it felt easier on my body.",

      "body": "I had AN for the first 2 years of my ED (been nearly 5 years now), and I have to say I feel the same way. I liked myself more and was a lot more confident when I was restricting. I stopped being hungry and food became something I used to stay alive rather than to fulfill a need. Stepping on the scale was euphoric every time I saw the number go down. I feel so disgusting and out of control now, but I\u2019m luckily in a more sustainable place with my ED. I\u2019m trying to maintain in a weight range that\u2019s uncomfortable for me so I can have a life outside of bulimia, but I\u2019m still b/ping multiple times a day. Mostly, I miss how my parents treated me when I was anorexic. I\u2019m constantly getting complaints about how wasteful I am, how I have no self control, how much money I flush down the toilet. Before, it was concern and begging me to eat. Everywhere I go I make sure to map out the nearest toilet and bring hair ties and a water bottle with me. People notice that I disappear into the bathroom for a long time at parties or family events. I\u2019m always worried that my breath smells like puke. I\u2019m constantly exhausted no matter how much sleep I get, but I have nothing to show for it.",
