  "selftext": "So I posted this before but I recently deactivated my old account bc it was too obvious who I was. Anyway, I wanted to share this with you all bc it is my story and I hope to help someone out there avoid it. I am now a 47 yo bulimic who started at the age of 15. I use to throw up like 20 times a day at my peak. As I got older and had children it all kinda faded but I would still puke on occasion if I got uncomfortably full, or weight conscious. Anyway, about a year ago I randomly went to the gastro doc for something completely different . He found that I have Barrett\u2019s esophagus which is precancerous cells that can turn cancerous as the years go by. He believes it\u2019s from throwing up bc it happens when acid eats away at ur esophagus. I am now on medication daily for it and keep it in control . But I have no symptoms and would have never known until it was too late. It can be a silent killer. So it may be something u check for. I just want you to be aware as I never in my wildest dreams would have thought of this. Good luck out there . I know it\u2019s a struggle daily . I have stopped fully now bc of this.",
