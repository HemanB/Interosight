So, I decided not to. Trust me I kept thinking about it but enough is enough, bulimia is seriously harmful and my whole body is tired of the back and forth process. I\u2019ve been purging every single day for 4 months and I am tired, life is too short to not enjoy the things you like :/ even if it means upping your calorie intake slowly you can do it.",
