  "selftext": "There! I said it! Maybe not to anyone I know, but I still acknowledge the fact that I love stuffing my face with delicious fatty foods. I\u2019ll also acknowledge the guilt I feel after purging, knowing there are so many starving people in the world who would be grateful to have the food I waste. Everyone in my family is a big eater so I never felt like I ate too much until after high school. I hate the way my brain works. Even after I push past the urge and occupy myself with something constructive, my mind always goes back to listing off all the food I have in the kitchen. I\u2019m never going to stop fighting my urges and I\u2019ll accept the consequences of my ED.",

I can choose exactly what I want in that moment, not what I should get. Also just in the act of binging when I can just do whatever the fuck I want. I can just pick up food and eat it without weighing and measuring and logging the caloric/nutritional content of every single thing. I much prefer being in total control of everything, but those hours with a total lack of control is a high.",
