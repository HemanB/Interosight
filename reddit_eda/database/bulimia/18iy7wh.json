  "selftext": "\nI feel mortified. I had dinner at my grandparents last night and purged in the toilet. The toilet is far away from the living room so I knew they wouldn\u2019t hear me from there. While I was purging I heard someone. I quickly stopped and when I came out of the toilet my nana was coming out of her bedroom (opposite the toilet). I was filled with dread, knowing she likely heard me. She didn\u2019t say anything so I convinced myself she hadn\u2019t heard. While I was at work today I got a message from my mum saying that my nana called her and that we need to talk. My heart dropped and I felt all the blood rush to my head. The whole car ride home from work I felt so sick as I knew what my nana had called my mum for. I had been eating freely for 4 days before yesterday and I saw how happy it was making my mum so I felt extremely guilty for relapsing. However, when I got home mum greeted me with open arms and was super comforting, I am so grateful for that. But I still feel incredibly ashamed and embarrassed. Being caught purging has to be one of the most stressful and shameful experiences for a bulimic no matter how many times it happens, well it is for me anyway. I really want to stop I hate feeling this way.",

They are embarrassed and hide it but they can\u2019t help but do it a lot.\n\nThey have done the plastic bag thing and I found the idea of the contents and smell gross and you can probably sense my reaction. I don\u2019t find the person gross or the act gross. I feel for them. I find the object and its smell gross. \n\nI don\u2019t want to add to their issues, like guilt, or shame etc. so I just give them space. I don\u2019t know if this is a good approach or not and they still have the issue after years. \n\nI know it\u2019s not something you can just turn off. It\u2019s not that easy. I wish it was. I don\u2019t know if this is the case but perhaps your husband might say same somethings that aren\u2019t exactly true because he\u2019s hoping it will help you. He might say things like just don\u2019t do it, like it\u2019s simply a choice, because he wants you to get better. He may know it\u2019s not that easy but it doesn\u2019t come across in what he\u2019s saying. Concerned for your health and your happiness. And your kid. \n\nFor me there has been times when it was a bad moment with us and I\u2019ve said things, like threatened to do or not do things, like less contact/support sort of thing. An empty threat I wasn\u2019t serious about but wanted to shock them to help them. It was probably the wrong move.\n\nI don\u2019t know your husbands truth, motives etc, but just giving my perspective for my situation that is somewhat similar to his. Which is basically don\u2019t know what to do, care for the person, want to them to get better and be happy, but probably do lots of things that aren\u2019t helping.",

I do totally understand where he is coming from but being on the receiving end is embarrassing and belittling. Holidays are especially hard for me as I have no family where we live besides my inlaws and my grandma who I was very close to passed away a year almost to this day so it is a lot to deal with right now.",
