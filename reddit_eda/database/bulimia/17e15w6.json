My pattern is staying up all night binging and purging and then sleeping all day. I didn\u2019t think she could hear me at all. I\u2019ve been doing this for years and thought I mastered the art of doing it all quietly, but I guess not. I feel like a garbage human being and can\u2019t even leave the room I\u2019m staying in to face her. I\u2019m so full of guilt and shame and all I want to do is binge and purge right now to cope. I feel pathetic",

She and I both cried as I explained how my bulimia works and she listened, hugged me, and was very understanding. She is so loving and supportive and was just frustrated in the moment and unsure of what to do, so she reacted as seen in the text. She is and has been very concerned, but wants to support me in every way and asked what she can do to help. I feel really lucky and grateful to have someone who cares about me so much. Thank you everyone for your support and kind words/advice in all of this. I appreciate every single one of you \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\n\nAlso, I tried to edit the post to write this and it didn\u2019t work so letting y\u2019all know here lol",
