  "selftext": "I was exhausted and my joints ached 24/7, getting tingling/tightness in my chest, and getting out of breath super easily. I kept dismissing it, but I worked a 10 hour shift on the 8th (Tuesday) and physically couldn\u2019t function afterwards. I set up a doctor\u2019s appointment last month but it was still over a week away, so I called the nurse line on my insurance card on Friday (the 11th) to see if they\u2019d recommend going to urgent care. When the nurse asked me about my symptoms, she told me to go to the emergency room right away. Turns out my potassium was 0.1 above hospital admission level. They had me get IV fluids/potassium and let me go home on the condition that I\u2019d do follow up labs on Monday. \n\nI feel amazing compared to how I felt before the IV. I didn\u2019t even think it was possible anymore to not feel wiped out and in pain constantly. I\u2019m still bingeing and purging every day, but trying to reduce it. I feel so guilty for not stopping but it just doesn\u2019t feel possible right now.",

      "body": "Been there!!! I\u2019m so glad you went to the ER and your doctor and got checked out. So many of us are guilty of ignoring all of these warning signs because we function on denial, amirite? I totally understand feeling like you can\u2019t stop, even when your body is telling you to. I think I probably b/p-ed every single day for 10+ years, and the last 3 years or so I was finally able to put some time in between binges. I would consider myself \u201cin recovery\u201d for the last two years- but even then, I\u2019m not perfect, no one is. I probably slip up 3-5 times a year.\n\nThe best you can do is harm reduction- if you\u2019re going to do it, start with only purging when you feel like it\u2019s absolutely necessary. Take your potassium pills early in the morning (or whenever they have the longest chance of staying in your system) so they actually get digested before a B/P event. Drink electrolytes afterwards and take a multivitamin everyday. Harm reduction focuses on lessening the negative impacts of a behavior, while still understanding that we are all human and not all behaviors can be instantaneously stopped.\n\nSome other things that helped me: Try breaking the cycle of binging by forcing yourself to go for a walk before allowing yourself to binge. If you get back home and still want to b/p after taking a walk, then you can do so, but most of the time taking that time to think about it beforehand will make you realize it isn\u2019t worth it. I hated going outside for a walk, but I hated the thought of mindlessly over consuming food just to throw it up again so that was really the only thing that got me out the door. One of my biggest problems was when it was bedtime/late in the evening after dinner and I got the munchies, one snack would turn into more snacks which turned into a \u201cfuck it all\u201d binge and purge sesh, and I had to completely cut myself off from eating after 7pm to stop that cycle. Practicing mindfulness and meditation shouldn\u2019t be disregarded, as hokey pokey as meditation can seem at times, it\u2019s truly helped my success and healing from bulimia.",
