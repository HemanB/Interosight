      "body": "*Random rant* (19y female) So I haven\u2019t eaten carbs in like 40-60 days and I just got so fuckin hungry out the blue (maybe cuz I\u2019m about to get my period?) and I ate a thick slice of bread w eggs on it and a packet of 3 in 1 Nescaf\u00e9. I am so fucking disgusted right now this is going to haunt me for the next few weeks until I starve again or drop another 10lb. I literally want to throw up thinking about it. I looked beautiful a few hours ago and now I look like a fucking beached whale and I feel bloated. I\u2019m so damn sick of my appearance and weight controlling my life. And I\u2019m so sick of my family/people in general commenting on how I look. Like fuck y\u2019all whoever was bullying me for being a fucking fat ass a few months ago and now I\u2019m starving to the point of passing out every day literally and my bones are showing. NOW THEY WANNA TELL ME TO PLEASE EAT??! fuck off with that shit like you weren\u2019t just fuckin bullying me for being chubby!!! People don\u2019t realize one single comment or \u201cjoke\u201d will heavily impact someone for weeks/months/years. I don\u2019t even want to look in the mirror I\u2019m just over here about to have a breakdown. And I love how I look with the lost weight but I\u2019ve been to the ER more than 10x in the past month or 2 & I feel like I\u2019m dying. I don\u2019t wanna die. Not this young and incomplete anyways\ud83d\ude2d But to me being overweight is the worst thing on earth. I cannot help my weight and food obsession it\u2019s literally a disease/OCD in my brain. I wish I was naturally skinny and didn\u2019t have a thick body type/bust my life would be so much fuckin easier. \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2dMaybe this all wouldn\u2019t have happened if everyone didn\u2019t fucking comment every time I lose or gain weight. Also some people know I\u2019ve been in the ER multiple times and I\u2019m sick and depressed starving not healthily losing weight and they say I look so good now? What the fuck? Like how can anyone promote this. Omg. I just can\u2019t rn\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f & I don\u2019t want to kill myself or anything at all but I feel like this is maybe killing me and it\u2019s definitely taking a big chunk of my health. But I just. Cannot. Fucking. Stop.",
