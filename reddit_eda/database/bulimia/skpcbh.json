  "title": "a trick i use to avoid binging",
  "selftext": "i know a lot of people probably know this trick, same with my trick to avoid purging, but i thought i'd share for those who haven't heard of it before, as it's been such a huge help in preventing me from binging. \n\nessentially, instead of telling yourself \"i won't binge\", you tell yourself \"i won't binge YET/i won't binge right now.\" sometimes i'll set a 15 minute timer. i don't know why, but \"i absolutely won't binge\" puts me in more of a panic/frenzy, while \"i won't binge right this second, i'll wait to see how i feel in 15 minutes/30 minutes/an hour etc\" helps to calm me down, until the urge to binge passes. \n\ni know this is also a coping skill that therapists teach to people who struggle with self harm/suicidal thoughts. \n\ni have a long way to go with repairing my relationship to food/body image, but i'm hoping that having these small tricks to disrupt the disordered behaviors is a good first step to recovery (:",
