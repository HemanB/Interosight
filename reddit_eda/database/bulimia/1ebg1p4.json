I chose to believe his reassurances, and was able to finally recover.   It was HARD, took me 2 years with one 3 month relapse in there, but my current husband was true to his word:  he loved me all the way through that hellish cycle and still does, with me in my recovered body.\n\nI'm sorry you have a partner who sounds like he cares more about finances than your health.  I hope you can find the strength to stand up for yourself in whatever way you can.   Then maybe you can also consider Recovery.   But Recovery has to be for YOU. 100%.  That's how it will stick.\n\nGood luck.",

I probably b/p once a day and the rest is restriction and over exercise. He's very good at not pushing, but at the same time not enabling the disorder.
