      "body": "Hello! I definitely feel similar to you when I eat a larger meal. But from what you've said in the message, calorie counting seems to be a big part of the problem, right? \nIt's obviously not easy to ignore, but I think that a way of starting to get better is leave calorie counting aside, and care about the actual food you have in your plate. I've never counted calories, so I don't know how far the obsession can get about it, but I know that 2000 cal a day is more or less what the average person needs to eat, so going 500cal over that some day is still near normal parameters.\nAlso, on the same note, going 500 cal less (ONLY) some other day is something that may happen sometimes, but please remember *it's something that should happen around casual consecuences, plans for the day and if you're sick or not* \nTrying to recompensate is also bad for you, we all know that, so please keep it in mind when you're triggered to try and stop yourself from doing it, get distracted, do something else, go outside, dance to music. Maybe some days it'll work better than others, but please keep trying <3",
