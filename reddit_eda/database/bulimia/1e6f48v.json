They usually would try to put down the image of a popular pretty girl but mentioning for a second and in a mocking tone that she has bulimia and then just brush it off as nothing. I know it\u2019s probably nothing but the disorder in me feels shame and often interprets it as \u201cshe cheated her way into being that pretty and skinny\u201d.

It seems to typically only portray the very stereotypical purging after a meal or maybe a binge/purge, but completely neglects any other types of purging, like laxatives or over-exercising. I'll never forget this one clip i saw on YouTube a long time ago, no clue what it was from, but it was this skinny little teenager excusing herself from the dinner table, going to the bathroom to purge, and then goes back to the table within like 5 minutes. It makes me angry when i think about it, because purging is gross, difficult, messy, and LOUD (i promise im not trying to shame anyone either, and by no means am i trying to insult anyone. I am bulimic and just can attest to the disgusting ways it leaves you and the bathroom.... IYKYK) Clips like that glamorize bulimia and make it seem like there are no consequences. And makes it look \"easy\" which i think is harmful. \nSorry that took kind a turn into a rant, my apologies for the length.",

There\u2019s only two episodes, but they are great. A quote that stuck with me from it was when she went into the eating disorder clinic and the receptionist said something along the lines of \u201ctoo fat to be anorexic, too thin to have BED, bulimia?\u201d \n\nThere\u2019s a show called \u201cWaterloo Road\u201d which features (seasons 11,12) a male character called Preston who suffers bulimia, triggered by emotional stress. Shows the lengths one will go to (eating out of a bin, stealing food) and doesn\u2019t glamorise it at all. Shows the near fatal consequences of it too, without spoiling the show. Thought it was very well done. \n\nOn Apple TV there\u2019s a program called \u201cPhysical\u201d starring Rose Byrne and she\u2019s a lifelong bulimic. Whilst the character isn\u2019t the most likeable, especially at the beginning, it\u2019s a decent portrayal. Quite graphic and triggering scenes, so TW. She\u2019s also, as the title suggests, addicted to exercise and uses it as another way to purge/ escape reality. \n\nAlso, \u201cInsatiable\u201d is a good portrayal of binge eating disorder.",

      "body": "True! And I hate that, while it\u2019s accurate that binging and purging feel extremely uncontrollable, lots of bulimic symptoms stem from the need of control. Controlling your body, your food, your life, your feelings. So I hate that media portrays it as a quirky thing teenagers with bad self control do, and that they just do it completely randomly like they don\u2019t show the emotions that lead to a b/p episode or what goes through your mind during and after it. It\u2019s just a random weight loss habit a silly girl does. And it\u2019s not really shown that it\u2019s so addictive. Like it\u2019s just a silly choice a character makes. \n\nI also hate that it\u2019s often shown as something that works, even though really the most of people with bulimia are within the range of normal BMI. Like bulimics are never portrayed being as skinny as anorexics but in movies they\u2019re typically somewhat skinny. \n\nI hate that eds are either romanticised or made fun of in media. Eds are not glamorous. Besides the obvious non glamorous thing (vomit), we also lose our hair, we might keep bags of our own vomit in our rooms, maybe pee in our pants (it can happen when you\u2019re really underweight), overuse laxatives, have toilet water splash on our face when our vomit hits the water, eat food we\u2019ve already thrown in the trash, become very irritated and like a shadow of your old self. We damage our teeth, our gastrointestinal system and mess with our electrolyte balance which can be fatal.",
