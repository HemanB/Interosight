I\u2019m so proud but also terrified. I\u2019m only making this post because I want to hold myself accountable for awhile so I don\u2019t purge every again if I can help it. I want to stop.

As someone who thought \u201cwhat\u2019s the point I\u2019ll never be able to have a normal, healthy relationship with food\u201d I can say you will! And your thoughts are lying to you! I was Bulimic and Anorexic for 5 years and I\u2019ve now been in recovery for almost ten years now. The last time I purged was over 9 years ago!\n\n\nI decided one day I was tired of lying, and the sore throats and ditching my friends all the time. I was so tired of being constipated and bloated. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s easy but every day gets easier! I had Bulimia and Anorexia and over the pandemic I got to the biggest I\u2019ve ever been as an adult, but decided I wasn\u2019t going to fall into bad patterns I had all but thought was done and dealt with.  I was a chubby teenager and decided Bulimia would be a good diet, please if you\u2019re reading this and are thinking about purging for a couple days and you\u2019ll quit\u2026 don\u2019t do it. It\u2019s a disease and lasts a lifetime. Recovery is the best thing I\u2019ve ever decided to do for myself! Good for you and take it one day at a time. Remember tomorrow\u2019s a new day don\u2019t beat yourself up too much.",

I preferred not to count the days in a row I went b/p free, but how many days out of the week/month I did.  Sometimes I think taking the AA type mentality of gaining certain day \u201cchips\u201d can be counterproductive - just because you have a slip up doesn\u2019t negate the progress you\u2019ve made.  I know how hard it is to overcome the beast of bulimia, I\u2019m proud of you.",
