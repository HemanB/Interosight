  "selftext": "I tolsld my mom i have bulimia. She laughed at me. She told me i'm eating like a cow because I want to. She said I should drink just water instead. She told me I'm crazy. I'm was bawling my eyes and i'm still and I think of killing myself. I wanted to receieve affection and love or at least sympathy. She told me she will put me in a crazy people hospital because I self harm too. She laughed and said she expected to hear something more bad than this. While I was crying she said Its my fault. I can't take it anymore.\n\nUpdate: She said I can resolve it myself, and that I do not suffer from bulimia..\n\nUpdate 2: This morning (last night I told her) she said that I should get rid of my obsession with my stomach and to be more self confident. She did my breakfast, and said it will be enough till lunch and gave me some ideas for lunch. I thought it was nice, but not everything can last. She made a joke about my cat having bulimia and it did ruined my mood and i'm curently going to sleep back.\nAlso, she doesn't understand what bulimia is. I told her bulimia is when you binge and do compensating behaviour after, like throwing up, excessive exercise, laxatives, etc. But she said this is not what bulimia is. Apparently, bulimia is when you binge and you throw up becaude you can't eat anymore ( involuntary). Well after hearing this I understood that I cannot tell my struggles to this woman. She did reaserch last night, and still doesn't believe I have bulimia. According to her I self-diagnosided and I just exaggerate. While I regret telling her this because she will tell my brother and father, I feel a lot free.",

She's lost her privileges!!!\n\nBut her understanding of your situation, and her lack of empathy, shouldn't make you feel bad. It's her issue.\n\nHope things get better",
