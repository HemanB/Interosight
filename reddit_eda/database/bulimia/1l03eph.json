  "selftext": "Hi all. Mods feel free to delete if inappropriate. \n\nThree days ago, I had purged and for some reason it triggered uncontrollable retching. I thought I felt fine after, but an hour later I felt the need to (uncontrollably, not self induced) vomit and it was about half blood. I was in denial. Until a few hours later, around 3am, I woke up knowing I was going to throw up immediately. Ran to my bathroom didn\u2019t even make it to the toilet but puked in the sink. I was absolutely HORRIFIED, TERRIFIED, of what I saw. A sink full of blood and huge blood clots. Imagine 20 giant red worms, double the size of your biggest finger. It sent me into absolute panic. I woke up my partner and while sobbing asked him to drive me to the ER. Once I was there, I threw up more blood clots. they did many many tests including an endoscopy and confirmed I had ruptured my esophagus causing stomach bleeding and the first thing they asked me was \u201cdo you struggle with bulimia or purging disorder?\u201d And I just sobbed and sobbed. TWELVE YEARS of purging and it happened. The thing that I was always warned about. It\u2019s been the most terrifying thing I\u2019ve ever experienced, I truly thought that I was somehow throwing up my intestines because the clots were so big. I would never ever ever wish that on another person. Mallory-Weise syndrome. On the way to the hospital I called my mother weeping because I thought I was truly dying. I had to spend 3 nights in the hospital while they did test after test, for a minute they thought I could possibly have esophagus cancer (my grandmother did) and I was so, so scared until I admitted my purging. Thankfully my partner was incredibly supportive (we\u2019ve been together 2 years and he had no idea of my purging past/current habits.) I am okay now, but I\u2019m so scared if I ever purge again. I\u2019ve had nightmares replaying the sink full of clots. I don\u2019t know exactly where I\u2019m going with this, but I am so scared that I won\u2019t be able to stop myself next time I feel the urge and it\u2019ll happen again. I just don\u2019t know what to do. This has made me want to be better and stop. But I don\u2019t know if I can, please all I am looking for is some supportive words. I was so terrified. ",

I can only speak for the effectiveness of that from others, because I was in inpatient and that didn\u2019t even really stop me. I know it\u2019s so fucking hard to have the care to stop. It\u2019s been my biggest struggle in life and it becomes so normal and habitual to you that it doesn\u2019t even feel like a struggle anymore. But I can honestly say, puking up a fuck ton of blood clots has never scared me so bad. My family lives far away, so I thought I was going to die without getting to hug them again. Never getting to see my friends again. Never getting to kiss my partner again. Never getting to feel the things I love in life again, like sun on my skin on a beautiful day or the sound of my favorite song or having a good stomach-ache-causing laugh with a friend, not that I have many of them, but those moments are what crossed my mind. Never getting to cuddle my moms dog again. It\u2019s cliche, again, but you\u2019re the only one who can truly help you. Losing a tooth is HORRIBLE, it happened to me last year, but if therapy and that doesn\u2019t make you want to stop, maybe like me, it takes that life or death feeling to understand what you are doing to yourself. Although I do truly hope it doesn\u2019t come to that for you. Whatever you can find to motivate you, I am sending you so much love and light and truly, truly hope you can overcome this. It is not easy. It is not fun. But I am rooting for you.",

It\u2019s one of those things where therapists and doctors tell you it can happen, but you don\u2019t think it\u2019ll ever actually happen to you. They did EKGs, X-rays, Ultrasounds, IVs, 2 endoscopy\u2019s, plenty of meds meant to anti-acid the stomach lining. They said if the tear had been even the SLIGHTEST bit bigger they would have had to put metal pins in my esophagus to keep it closed, which terrified me even more. I\u2019m feeling okay now, and I am really motivated to stop purging due to this experience, but I\u2019m just worried that my stupid brain will overpower that and urge to purge again. But I really don\u2019t want to after all of this. I\u2019m going to do my absolute best to stay strong and not get triggered.",
