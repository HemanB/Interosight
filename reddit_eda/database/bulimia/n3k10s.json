      "body": "26, male. Struggled with bulimia as a teen. Was in treatment for it, recovered. Relapsed last year right before the pandemic shut down lol. struggled with it all throughout quarantine. Was in denial the entire year until December when I finally decided to start going to a support group for it. At first I kept track of how long the last time I purged was, but I lapsed after about 3 weeks the first time? I don't keep track anymore. Keeping track of the days made me feel like a failure when I'd get the urge to purge. However I think the last time I purged was a week ago? I don't remember the specific day/night. I've been a lot busier with work & stuff lately so it's been easier to fill my time. \n\nIt was hard to accept it last year because it had been years & I didn't want to believe that I was in the same place I was when I was 16 (10 years ago) plus I don't live in my hometown so carrying this ED with me 10 years later as an adult in my new life/town, it just felt unbelievable. I honestly thought \"how do I go about forming strong connections with those struggling the same as me in a place I don't associate this disorder with?\" However, I think the worst part about this relapse was keeping it to myself. Keeping it hidden made me want to do it more. I realized that the more I talked about it with my support group & even close friends, the more I became aware of the reality of it, compelling me to want to stop. But that's absolutely just my mindset, in no way to I think talking about it is the full cure of an ED haha. However, I think opening up about it & being honest with the right people who understand, it may not \"cure\" you but it definitely makes things different in some way. We just need to surround ourselves with people who understand & won't harshly judge us or even judge us at all. \n\nBest of luck!",

Over the past year I actually managed to lose around 60 pounds just by dieting and exercise with only a few purges along the way (something I never thought would be possible). But the weight change (bringing me back down to my high school weight) triggered a lot of trauma relating to a rape I experienced when I was 16, and with this stress I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m on the verge of relapsing. It started with occasional purging when I was nauseous from not sleeping or just from stress, when I told myself if I could just throw up then I\u2019d feel better. Now I\u2019ve noticed that I\u2019m \u201cconveniently\u201d nauseous everytime I have a high-calorie meal, and still using that same reasoning that the purging is only for temporary relief, not a psychological need.

I started with restricting and using diet pills (might be considered bulimic not sure), to being underweight for a time period and only restricting (diagnosed as anorexic), to getting at a healthy weight and having cycles of binging, purging, and restricting. I\u2019ve been clean for a few months but I still consider myself to have an ED because those tendencies are still there. I guess I\u2019ve been severely restricting lately but I\u2019ve been immensely stressed so eating is just hard right now. But no binging and purging for now.",

My mom has struggled with ED her whole life and that kinda pushed me into that direction as well with her comments towards me and about herself, being weird about food and glorifying underweight models. She regrets it now seeing how bad I am going through it. But body dysmorphia and mental instability is hard to deal with and I can\u2019t blame her for it. As I got older my bulimia got worse and multiple times daily sometimes every meal. I want to get help and change but it\u2019s very hard because binging and purging is an eating disorder and a coping mechanism for me and I\u2019m almost scared to lose it. And it fuels it when people tell me I look like I\u2019m losing weight\u2026 (maybe this is part of the reason they tell you not to say that anymore lol) had times of just plain old not eating as well. On the other side of the toilet (lol) I\u2019m a barber, a musician, I ride horses and barrel race, I go to the river every weekend, and honestly enjoy my life with my boyfriend and dog. My boyfriend actually knows About my bulimia. He didn\u2019t for awhile and then he heard me doing it. He tried to push me to get help for a long time then realized it needs to be my decision. So he\u2019s my emotional support after the fact although I almost felt it was easier to deal with when nobody knew. \nThankyou for posting this. It makes me feel heard and happy I\u2019m talking about this.     P.s. we all know it\u2019s hard to get help, so in the meantime does anyone do anything to help their teeth stay ok?",

I used to be a scrawny kid who could eat anything and not gain wait until I reached 10 and became chubby because I suddenly started growing boobs. I hated my body from then on right up until I was 16, called all kinds of hateful names for being chubby like \u201cfat\u201d, \u201cfat bitch\u201d, \u201cshe shakes the ground when she walks by\u201d, \u201cgiantess\u201d, etc. I started going on a more extreme diet at 16, obtaining some herbal diet pills and really really abstaining from sinful foods. I became obsessed with losing weight and whenever I ate something bad like lasagna or cake, I would throw it up. I remembered once when I was eating a slice of chocolate cake and being so consumed with guilt I put my head down on the table and cried. Just sobbed and my mom asked me \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong!?\u201d all concerned like. I told her I felt so guilty for wanting to eat the cake. She told me it was okay to indulge and enjoy in cake sometimes. A little after that, once I couldn\u2019t throw up in the bathroom I shared with my brother because he was using it so I had to throw up in my parents\u2019 room. My mom saw remnants of my little escapade and she spoke to me. She asked me if I had been throwing up and I said yes, I started crying and I told her that I so desperately wanted to be skinny. She said \u201cBut this is not the right way. Lily, you could die.\u201d And in my tears I said \u201cI\u2019d rather die skinny than die fat.\u201d \n\nSuch painful memories. Just thinking about that time makes me so sad. I lost 7kgs at 16 quite rapidly. I became 62kg and many people complimented me. I cried nearly every night in bed. \n\nI gained it all back at 17. Lost weight again at 21 by completely cutting out rice which is our main energy/carb source. And when I say completely, I mean completely. Absolutely no rice whatsoever. I was starving constantly\u2026But compliments helped.\n\nI gained so much when I started working and had access to money and whatever food I wanted at 23. I ate and ate and was diagnosed with pre-diabetes. I was diagnosed with diabetes type 2 at 26. I tried to go to a slimming spa to help me lose weight but all it did was make me go so deep into credit card debt. I lost only 3kg. At 28, I dieted as hard as I could only relapsing once. I lost the weight again. Went from 80 to 70kg. \n\nI\u2019ve gained 4kg since with me yo-yo-ing up and down from 70 to 71 to 73 to 74 and you get the idea. I haven\u2019t actively purged from guilt since January this year.",

I started actually purging when I was 13. I was recovered for like\u2026 months. Like I was completely cured and then I did it again randomly, then again cured for months. And now Im here breaking my streak again lol. Im a bit of a health nut, I love exercise and eating healthy. But because of that I have these people (honestly fuck them from the bottom of my heart FUCK them) who pressure me to eat unhealthy everywhere bc they want me to stop being healthy I guess idk, they think its fun to break everything I work for and make me cave in to some sweets and fast food. Thing is though that, i can\u2019t just eat a little cookie here and there like EVERYONE ELSE CAN. No, i start binging, then I purge. But the people around me keep enabling me and im sorry I definitely went on a bit of a rant lol. \n\nBut yeah 15M and health and fitness crazy",

It was a stressful time in my life, as I was working on my third degree and it was extremely intense. I think I have a unique case of bulimia because my disorder isn't tied to food issues, body image, etc. It's rooted in anxiety. I don't binge because I want food. I simply binge because I want to purge. When I purge I feel like all the negative emotions temporarily disappear. It's a coping mechanism for my anxiety, depression, and PTSD. I've never been even remotely overweight (never been over 105 lbs in my life), and when I was bulimic I was very aware that I was very sickly and did not look well. At my lowest I was 78 lbs. Also, because my bulimia developed later in life, while typically (but not always) it develops sooner, it seems atypical. Is anyone else out there like me?  \n\n\nFortunately, since then, I have successfully recovered. I've maintained recovery for several years now. I'm back up to \\~90 lbs (I'm only 5' tall FYI, so this is a healthy weight). l. I love having boobs and a butt again. I love having energy again. Not having to wear baggy clothes to hide the fact that I'm basically a skeleton. Recovery is possible and it is so, so worth it!",

It's just my insecurity. Thanks so much for your courage and wisdom!",

I\u2019m scared what\u2018s gonna happen now that everyone knows, because it was my tiny little secret that kept me protected and helped me deal w the shit in this world. I don\u2018t know who I am without it as I spent all my teenage years walking from fridge to toilet and back. But I hope there is a better life ahead. I wish you the best of luck on your recovery journey. \u2728",

Relapsed last year right before the pandemic shut down lol. struggled with it all throughout quarantine. Was in denial the entire year until December when I finally decided to start going to a support group for it. At first I kept track of how long the last time I purged was, but I lapsed after about 3 weeks the first time? I don't keep track anymore. Keeping track of the days made me feel like a failure when I'd get the urge to purge. However I think the last time I purged was a week ago? I don't remember the specific day/night. I've been a lot busier with work & stuff lately so it's been easier to fill my time. \n\nIt was hard to accept it last year because it had been years & I didn't want to believe that I was in the same place I was when I was 16 (10 years ago) plus I don't live in my hometown so carrying this ED with me 10 years later as an adult in my new life/town, it just felt unbelievable. I honestly thought \"how do I go about forming strong connections with those struggling the same as me in a place I don't associate this disorder with?\" However, I think the worst part about this relapse was keeping it to myself. Keeping it hidden made me want to do it more. I realized that the more I talked about it with my support group & even close friends, the more I became aware of the reality of it, compelling me to want to stop. But that's absolutely just my mindset, in no way to I think talking about it is the full cure of an ED haha. However, I think opening up about it & being honest with the right people who understand, it may not \"cure\" you but it definitely makes things different in some way. We just need to surround ourselves with people who understand & won't harshly judge us or even judge us at all. \n\nBest of luck!",

I like to come on this forum and try to help others and share some tools/tips that I've learned. I know how difficult recovery can be, especially if you don't have professional help. I can link you to a great video that my coach did about overshoot weight. You can find her video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHhOUivBCMo).\n\nI definitely understand the temptation to go back to your ED and to lose weight. I relapsed last spring after gaining weight and not having the proper tools to help with body image. I went back to restriction which then led me back to bulimia and now I am climbing out of that relapse. Your ED is telling you that your body is the problem but in reality it's your eating disorder that is the problem. A big part of recovery is learning how to talk to yourself and how to accept your body. You don't always have to love it but you can accept it and treat yourself with kindness.\n\nThere is a great tool you can use to help with body image. Imagine a friend or a loved one who is in your position. They are in recovery and now they are struggling with their body image. What would you say to that person? I'm sure it would be something kind, compassionate and supportive right? That is your healthy self. When you are having ED thoughts about your body, try to respond to them in the way you would for another person. Your ED voice doesn't have to dominate your headspace, you have the ability to respond to it and to change the story you are telling yourself. I hope this helps! \u2764\ufe0f",

A YouTuber, who I really admired and related to, happened to also be a recovery coach so I reached out to her. I was lucky enough to get a spot and I have been making much better progress than I did on my own. \n\nTaking any steps, no matter how small, is a good thing. It could be reading books or telling someone or finding a therapist/coach, even coming on this forum. No matter what you decide to do, you will never feel 100% ready to recover. There is no perfect time or level of preparedness. You just have to make the decision and start taking steps.\n\nHere are some of the resources I used/currently use in recovery. \n\nBooks: [The Bulimia Help Method](https://www.amazon.com/Bulimia-Help-Method-Revolutionary-Approach-ebook/dp/B00PB7JI5A) by Ali Kerr and Richard Kerr, [8 Keys to Recovery From an Eating Disorder](https://www.amazon.com/Keys-Recovery-Eating-Disorder-Therapeutic/dp/0393706958) by Carolyn Costin\n\nYouTube: [WhatMiaDidNext](https://www.youtube.com/c/WhatMiaDidNext/featured), [Megsy Recovery](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCey1WBhNthBx0vDy-pHe9uw), [Binge Breakers](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9bGHx5Vr96hjaN5oDZlcFA)",

If you feel ready or want to get help, I would say to visit your doctor/nurse practitioner and ask for confidentiality and tell them what's going on and that you want to discuss situations for getting mentally and physically better. Even if you have to write it on paper and show it to them, that's okay. \n\nIf you have a family member or a friend, tell them. Ask them to help you through this and step up a schedule/plan that focuses on you gaining back the weight. Like little goals for over long periods of time, and if you miss  or mess it up, it's okay. This is a healing process that takes time. \n\nI know that this subreddit has information and guides on getting better. Maybe that could be your start.\n\nThere's also the national hotline for ED,\n\nhttps://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/help-support/contact-helpline\n\nIf you want to PM me, I'm always here to talk to.

We were raised to fear being obese or \"fat\" and we were raised with a fear of being unwanted. Out of the four of us, three of us were diagnosed with eating disorders and depression. My mother would use the disorder against us and mock us with it. \n\n I am by no means trying to create a sob story but I just don't know what a supportive mother would look like. I am the second oldest and my two younger siblings who went to get help would use me as support. And I loved that and I made our bond now very strong. However, they were in their teens and I wasn't their mom, I was their sister so it was different. I'm just worried that j will do something, or say something that will trigger them and that I won't notice. \n\nMy fear inevitably boils down to me not wanting my children to feel how I felt. I don't want them to have a broken relationship with food. I don't want to be like my mother. \n\nReading this really means alot to me and helps more than you know. \n\nI wish your family a life time of happiness.",

I like to come on this forum and try to help others and share some tools/tips that I've learned. I know how difficult recovery can be, especially if you don't have professional help. I can link you to a great video that my coach did about overshoot weight. You can find her video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHhOUivBCMo).\n\nI definitely understand the temptation to go back to your ED and to lose weight. I relapsed last spring after gaining weight and not having the proper tools to help with body image. I went back to restriction which then led me back to bulimia and now I am climbing out of that relapse. Your ED is telling you that your body is the problem but in reality it's your eating disorder that is the problem. A big part of recovery is learning how to talk to yourself and how to accept your body. You don't always have to love it but you can accept it and treat yourself with kindness.\n\nThere is a great tool you can use to help with body image. Imagine a friend or a loved one who is in your position. They are in recovery and now they are struggling with their body image. What would you say to that person? I'm sure it would be something kind, compassionate and supportive right? That is your healthy self. When you are having ED thoughts about your body, try to respond to them in the way you would for another person. Your ED voice doesn't have to dominate your headspace, you have the ability to respond to it and to change the story you are telling yourself. I hope this helps! \u2764\ufe0f",

I also read books and consumed a lot of recovery content on YouTube. I really wanted to be free of bulimia but I couldn't do it on my own, no matter how many books I read or videos I watched. A YouTuber, who I really admired and related to, happened to also be a recovery coach so I reached out to her. I was lucky enough to get a spot and I have been making much better progress than I did on my own. \n\nTaking any steps, no matter how small, is a good thing. It could be reading books or telling someone or finding a therapist/coach, even coming on this forum. No matter what you decide to do, you will never feel 100% ready to recover. There is no perfect time or level of preparedness. You just have to make the decision and start taking steps.\n\nHere are some of the resources I used/currently use in recovery. \n\nBooks: [The Bulimia Help Method](https://www.amazon.com/Bulimia-Help-Method-Revolutionary-Approach-ebook/dp/B00PB7JI5A) by Ali Kerr and Richard Kerr, [8 Keys to Recovery From an Eating Disorder](https://www.amazon.com/Keys-Recovery-Eating-Disorder-Therapeutic/dp/0393706958) by Carolyn Costin\n\nYouTube: [WhatMiaDidNext](https://www.youtube.com/c/WhatMiaDidNext/featured), [Megsy Recovery](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCey1WBhNthBx0vDy-pHe9uw), [Binge Breakers](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9bGHx5Vr96hjaN5oDZlcFA)",

We were raised to fear being obese or \"fat\" and we were raised with a fear of being unwanted. Out of the four of us, three of us were diagnosed with eating disorders and depression. My mother would use the disorder against us and mock us with it. \n\n I am by no means trying to create a sob story but I just don't know what a supportive mother would look like. I am the second oldest and my two younger siblings who went to get help would use me as support. And I loved that and I made our bond now very strong. However, they were in their teens and I wasn't their mom, I was their sister so it was different. I'm just worried that j will do something, or say something that will trigger them and that I won't notice. \n\nMy fear inevitably boils down to me not wanting my children to feel how I felt. I don't want them to have a broken relationship with food.

Ask them to help you through this and step up a schedule/plan that focuses on you gaining back the weight. Like little goals for over long periods of time, and if you miss  or mess it up, it's okay. This is a healing process that takes time. \n\nI know that this subreddit has information and guides on getting better. Maybe that could be your start.\n\nThere's also the national hotline for ED,\n\nhttps://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/help-support/contact-helpline\n\nIf you want to PM me, I'm always here to talk to.

You've been doing everything so right and she must be so blessed to have such an amazing support system. \n\nI reached out because unfortunately my mother was an enabler to my disorder, along with my siblings disorders. We were raised to fear being obese or \"fat\" and we were raised with a fear of being unwanted. Out of the four of us, three of us were diagnosed with eating disorders and depression. My mother would use the disorder against us and mock us with it. \n\n I am by no means trying to create a sob story but I just don't know what a supportive mother would look like. I am the second oldest and my two younger siblings who went to get help would use me as support. And I loved that and I made our bond now very strong. However, they were in their teens and I wasn't their mom, I was their sister so it was different. I'm just worried that j will do something, or say something that will trigger them and that I won't notice. \n\nMy fear inevitably boils down to me not wanting my children to feel how I felt. I don't want them to have a broken relationship with food. I don't want to be like my mother. \n\nReading this really means alot to me and helps more than you know. \n\nI wish your family a life time of happiness.",
