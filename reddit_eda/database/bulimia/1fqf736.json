One morning, after finishing all the opening tasks, I had about 30 minutes before the store opened. I was overwhelmed, and before I knew it, I started to binge. Panic set in because I was alone, and I knew I had to purge before the store got busy. In my distress, I made the awful decision to purge in the dish sink (I know, it was disgusting, selfish, and incredibly stupid).\n\nJust as I finished, I looked up and saw my coworker\u2014who already didn\u2019t like me and went to the same high school\u2014standing there, watching. The shame was overwhelming. I was terrified she would tell everyone at the mall and school. I didn\u2019t show up to work for a week, convinced that my secret would be out.\n\nBut to my surprise, she never said anything. In fact, she had often commented about how I never seemed to eat, so I think she understood I was struggling. To this day, I\u2019m grateful she didn\u2019t spread what she saw. That moment was traumatizing enough, and it stopped me from ever binging or purging at work again\ud83e\udd23",
