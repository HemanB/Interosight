This is exciting!  Forgive yourself all along the way.  Slow and steady is the best!!  They say \"21 days to make a habit\" so you are in the sweet spot for real change. I did it too!  Remember,  there is no such thing as Perfection,  even in Recovery.   If you slip...it's a slip, NOT a relapse!! There are several steps in Recovery,  so be gentle with yourself.  Celebrate each and every win!!!  You are a wonderful human, learning a different way to be.  Keep fighting for you!!  You are not alone in this Recovery Journey.   It can be done.",
