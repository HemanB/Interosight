For me it hasn't and I have been struggling with different EDs for 17 years. What worked for me was moving out on my own. I couldn't afford to buy food in order to binge or else I would have been living without the basic necessities. I got a job which required structure and didn't have the time to binge and purge. I kept myself busy. And most importantly, I had people in my life that knew about my struggles and supported me while keeping me in check. Having responsibilities is the best way to stop from binging, in my opinion. Best of luck to you!",

      "body": "Hi there, i know it's really hard to not think about food constantly and really I believe the only reason I have been able to move away from that is bc of medication I'm prescribed for my depression and anxiety. But the medicine has helped my mom which has helped me feel a bit more motivation to do other things and stay busy in other ways. like walking, journaling a lot, doing yoga (mindful little movements when i feel like its appropriate) I've tried fitness pal and food planning and that's only encouraged my ED. its only made me think and overanalyze the food i was eating more. i dont believe food is the problem with EDs, i think its our inner battles with emotions we dont work through. the energy in motion needs to be worked out of our bodies so we dont blame the binges/ restriction, ect. on how we feel. my advice would be to try just try bc i know its really hard to break cycles, but just try to do one thing after you eat a meal to distract. like after you eat breakfast, journal. after you eat lunch, make a doodle, after you eat dinner, take a walk or watch a documentary. distraction might not be the best long term copping skill but it works to initially break the pattern of thinking so much about food.",

I started filling my time with loads of hobbies... I started learning the piano, reading books, working on my career in my spare time, exercising, planning post-corona travel trips, online shopping... anything.\n\nAre you obsessed with tracking because it makes you feel like you've got control over life? It gives me a sense of achievement every day, i conditioned myself to get a mental \"pat on the back\" when i hit my calorie goal. So think of alternative, healthy goals and use the mental reward system the same way. \n\nThink of how you want your life to be in 5-10 years and start passionately working on that. It takes so much effort to recover from an ED but the shift in perspective is so important. \n\nAlso stop tracking and eat enough so you're not hungry. You can still think about food because food is great. But you need to think about it in a healthy, balanced way - not obsessive. Delete MFP! Freedom!\n\nTherapy is the best thing, the next best thing is reading books on ED recovery so you understand it.",
