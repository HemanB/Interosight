Since moving out by myself for my full time job it morphed into just having 0-3 sessions a day with a few hours usually between them. I think part of it was when I was at home and around roommates I was more secretive about it (even though my eating disorder wasn\u2019t a secret I just was ashamed of binging in front of others) and basically any time I was alone in the kitchen I would binge because I didn\u2019t know the next time I would get the chance. When I moved out I didn\u2019t have that pressure so I was able to control the binges more.",
