  "selftext": "I will normally begin a meal with absolutely no intention of either binging or purging. Normally, the thought in my mind goes along the lines of \u201cim not really in the mood to go through all that today\u201d. This thought lasts through til im done eating too\u2026but eventually maybe 10 minutes later I will think something like \u201cthis could probably come up easy\u201d and then go purge it all. Then, i walk away like \u201ci didnt think that would work out as well as it did\u201d. Rinse and repeat!! Every day!!??",
