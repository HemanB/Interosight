  "selftext": "Hi I\u2019m 21 years old and live in finland. I\u2019m so thankful for all help I have been given over the years and I want nothing else as much as to be free from this hell\n\nOnly thing I do is b/p. I often binge for 1-1,5h straight and become so full I cannot walk or keep my body up. After purging I start binging again and this repeats over and over again. I steal from stores. I keep spending over 100\u20ac a day to buy binge food. I\u2019m broke. My health is shit. I have osteoporosis bc i have been severely underweight and in life threathing BMI for years. I have no real teeth left because of purging and I have been out and in of mentalhospitals. I have Been kept there against my will for months even one year. I eat 15-20000 calories a day. I purge without my hands. It\u2019s too easy but it breaks my body and mind. I\u2019m so depressed I feel like there\u2019s no hope for me. But I really wanna recover for my family and boyfriend. They don\u2019t deserve this. I\u2019m in very intense outpatient program. But like i told you. It\u2019s no use. I can\u2019t eat without purging.\n\nI want to find people who thought they have lost everything to their eating disorder. But have not lost hope. I wan\u2019t to know if there\u2019s anyone who is going through same things as I. Please tell your story and how are you doing even if you are in almost exact same situation as me right now.\n\n",

      "body": "I can relate to this so much. I\u2019m 24 years old from Sweden, and I recovered the same year I turned 21 after being diagnosed with anorexia and bulimia specifically ANA-BP. The two years before my recovery were the darkest of my life. I spent them locked away in my room, binging and purging at least three times a day. I lost all my friends, dropped out of a prestigious university in Stockholm, was cruel to my entire family, and lost so much of my hair.\n\nAnd worst of all I was extremely suicidal.\n\nBut I can tell you this: You have already gotten through the hardest part, which is deciding to recover. That is a huge step, and I am so proud of you.\n\nI believe Sweden and Finland are quite similar in that you can get state-supported help for recovery, and I can honestly say that seeking help was the best decision I have ever made. After my time in a hospital, I found out I had kidney failure, and something about that realization changed something in my brain. I knew I had to recover.\n\nNow, I\u2019m back to my normal life I\u2019m studying again, I\u2019ve made new friends, and I\u2019m rebuilding everything I lost. Even thinking back to my 21-year-old self, consumed by my eating disorder, gives me so much anxiety. And knowing that you\u2019re going through this now honestly breaks my heart\u2014I could cry for you.\n\nBut please, listen to me: Seek help. Your life is worth so much more than this illness. You deserve to live. If You can get help through the state please tryt i get it. I  believe you will kick this illness in the butt and get you dream life, virtual hugs \ud83e\ude77\ud83e\ude77\ud83e\ude77",

Mine is so far gone now that there is no reversal of the damage done. \n\nMy spine is the worst affected according to the scans. I could end up not being able to move at all if it breaks in the wrong place. It\u2019s terrifying! \n\nThis awful disease takes everything. \n\nAnd how can we eat without purging when we can\u2019t cure ourselves by abstaining like an alcoholic or a gambler. \n\nWe need a magic pill. Something to block that part of the brain. \n\nI\u2019m sorry I have nothing but solidarity darling. \nMy hearts breaks for you and me and all of us.",

So please, if you ever need someone to talk to, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to me. I see myself in you\n\nAnd I want you to remember this illness is not your fault. It\u2019s an illness, and that\u2019s something many people forget. But those of us who understand it, who have lived it, know how much empathy and kindness are needed to get through it. That\u2019s why we have to lift each other up and remind each other that we\u2019re not alone.\n\nI know you will get through this. You will beat this illness. And one day, I\u2019m certain you\u2019ll look back on the place you are in right now, and barely recognize yourself because you will have rebuilt your life into something beautiful.\n\nEverything you dream of will come true. I remember something a doctor once told me: people with this illness are often perfectionists. And if we put all the energy we used on the eating disorder into something else, we could achieve anything. And that\u2019s the truth. You are capable of so much more than you realize luv.\ud83e\ude77\ud83e\ude77\ud83e\ude77",

          "body": "I can relate to this so much. I\u2019m 24 years old from Sweden, and I recovered the same year I turned 21 after being diagnosed with anorexia and bulimia specifically ANA-BP. The two years before my recovery were the darkest of my life. I spent them locked away in my room, binging and purging at least three times a day. I lost all my friends, dropped out of a prestigious university in Stockholm, was cruel to my entire family, and lost so much of my hair.\n\nAnd worst of all I was extremely suicidal.\n\nBut I can tell you this: You have already gotten through the hardest part, which is deciding to recover. That is a huge step, and I am so proud of you.\n\nI believe Sweden and Finland are quite similar in that you can get state-supported help for recovery, and I can honestly say that seeking help was the best decision I have ever made. After my time in a hospital, I found out I had kidney failure, and something about that realization changed something in my brain. I knew I had to recover.\n\nNow, I\u2019m back to my normal life I\u2019m studying again, I\u2019ve made new friends, and I\u2019m rebuilding everything I lost. Even thinking back to my 21-year-old self, consumed by my eating disorder, gives me so much anxiety. And knowing that you\u2019re going through this now honestly breaks my heart\u2014I could cry for you.\n\nBut please, listen to me: Seek help. Your life is worth so much more than this illness. You deserve to live. If You can get help through the state please tryt i get it. I  believe you will kick this illness in the butt and get you dream life, virtual hugs \ud83e\ude77\ud83e\ude77\ud83e\ude77",
