  "selftext": "Last night I had Taco Bell at 3am after a night of drinking. When this happens, usually my first response is to purge. And if I don\u2019t purge, I don\u2019t eat the next day and exercise like crazy. However this time, I didn\u2019t purge. In the morning I did freak out, though. My first instinct was to do a hard workout and not eat anything. But I took some deep breaths, made some coffee and breakfast and ate like I normally would. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve managed to do this in a long time. I\u2019ve been battling ED for 13 years and I\u2019m starting to feel like I might be getting closer to real recovery.",
