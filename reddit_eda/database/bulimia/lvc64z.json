  "selftext": "my mom has never officially been diagnosed, but it\u2019s obvious that she\u2019s suffering with bulimia. she purges by over exercising and has damaged her joints to the point that she now requires physical therapy in her 40s and has extremely low bone density. the joint damage has made her extreme exercise more difficult for her, but she hasn\u2019t stopped the bingeing so as a result she has gained quite a bit of weight over the past year or so.\n\nshe is constantly comparing my body to hers. we work in the same building and she will periodically come to my desk to measure my legs/ stomach/ arms/ hips and then compare it to her own. this morning she asked me to covertly go up to her office so I could look at one of her coworkers and tell her whether she was bigger or smaller than the coworker. \n\ni have been in recovery for a few years, and she knows this. we used to feed off of each other\u2019s illness but when I moved out of her house with my husband I started working on fixing that mentality and getting healthier. she, however has just been escalating. every morning before work she calls me to ask me if I weighed myself that morning and what the number was.\n\nit is a constant uphill battle for me to stay in recovery because she is always trying to drag me back down into my illness with her. codependence doesn\u2019t even begin to describe it. i did gain a lot of weight while recovering and am now trying to lose a few pounds in a healthy way without slipping back into the disorder but it\u2019s nearly impossible with her around. i can\u2019t just tell her to bug off because is my mom, and she is so so sick. but at the same time, the constant conscious effort I have to exert to stay in recovery is unbearable and feels very shaky at times.\n\nidk, I guess this is more just a vent than anything. this disease can really be so isolating.",
