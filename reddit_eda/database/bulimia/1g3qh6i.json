      "body": "A lot of trial and error. As is often the case in life, I was also extraordinarily lucky - I had a strong support network that could act as a safety net for me in my darkest moments. \n\nAs much as I would like there to be, there is no single miracle method for how I remain healthy these days; it is a combination of many different environmental factors and strategies that I have implemented over time. \n\nWhat I can say however, is that the only way to identify what will work for you is to either start keeping track of it for yourself, or getting someone to help you in that regard (i.e. therapy). \n\nIt also was also enormously helpful for me to recognise that if I wanted to stop the bingeing (which is what many of us eventually want), I needed to stop the compensating - and that there was a world in which I could be happy with my body, but only if I stopped that cycle (not just one part of it, but BOTH).   \n  \nBy turning my obsessiveness towards my (actual) health and wellbeing, rather than my eating, weight and shape, I found that I was actually able to look and feel better then I ever thought was possible. Taking the focus off of the latter and channelling it into self-care seems to have allowed it to come naturally; apparently, forcing the issue was not the way to go. \n\nIts also a constant journey - this is 207 days off the back of a relapse. My record stands at 402, and you bet I'm planning to beat it. But, that doesn't mean a journey of suffering - it's one of self-discovery, in which every day brings greater understanding of myself and how to exist in this world. \n\nThere is no guarantee that you will beat this thing, none of us have that, but we owe it to ourselves to give it our best possible shot. I wish you the absolute best in your recovery and thankyou for your kind words <3",
