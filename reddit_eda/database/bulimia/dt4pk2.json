  "selftext": "Bulimia is having purging just be a part of eating a meal like having a drink after.\n\nBulimia is trying to find other ways of purging when your gag reflex desensitises.\n\nBulimia is falling asleep, dreaming that you are binging and purging and waking up with vomit on your pillow because you made yourself sick in your sleep.\n\nBulimia is binging on so much food, you can barely breathe, throwing up, then binging again because apparently you already forgot how much it hurt last time.\n\nBulimia is being broke because you spend more money on food than you do on rent.\n\nBulimia is hopelessness.\n\nBulimia is buying laxatives from multiple different shops because you don't want them to think you weird for buying so many so often.\n\nBulimia is having 'annual leave' off food, literally using a week of your annual leave to starve yourself for a week and feeling like an utter idiot because the day your 'fast' is over, it's like something is triggered and the binge/purge starts all over again.\n\nBulimia is spending your life in and out of therapists offices and gp surgeries, always worrying that this time it may kill you or worrying about having a heart attack when you sleep because it's bad and you know that but after 17 years you have no real hope that it'll ever be over even though you are a Christian and you should know better.\n\nBulimia is shame, fear, humiliation, anxiety, feeling worthless, blaming yourself, a vice, a friend and your number one enemy.\n\nBulimia is the outward description of the mess that is your mind.\n\nBulimia is not yours, though it feels like it's all you have.\n\nBulimia is trying to hide it then tell people when you are just so trapped and seeing the disgust in their eyes and regretting ever trying.\n\nBulimia is lonely.",
