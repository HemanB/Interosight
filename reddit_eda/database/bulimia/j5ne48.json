  "selftext": "Did any of you see Freddie Flintoff's documentary 'Living With Bulimia'?\n\nI recorded my 5min reaction here: [https://youtu.be/TuG1oQYrQho](https://youtu.be/TuG1oQYrQho)\n\nFor non-UK people: Andrew (Freddie) Flintoff is a very famous ex-England cricket captain who has recently opened about his struggles with Bulimia throughout his career.\n\nHe is a real down-to-earth masculine bloke which is why his Bulimia is so shocking, as it fundamentally tests our stereotypes of the condition.\n\nThere were 3 main areas which especially resonated with me, because I saw strong parallels with my own experience:\n\n1. **Aversion to getting outside** **help** e.g. getting help means accepting being vulnerability\n2. **Exercise as an obsession** e.g. Freddie trains 9-10 per week, I used to train 12 times per week\n3. **Low body confidence** e.g we both do a lot of \"body checking\" via repeatedly pinching parts of the body\n\nDid any of you watch it and have other things which resonated?\n\nSending support to you all.",
