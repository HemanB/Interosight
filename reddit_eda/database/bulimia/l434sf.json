  "selftext": "Hey everyone! I've been a lurker on here for awhile but I've been a severe bulimic for around 5 years now, unfortunately last week I started to see the effects my body was enduring because of it. It honestly woke me up in a way I've never felt before and I decided I needed to try to change for the better. Trying to curb the constant feeling of wanting to binge than completely eliminating everything I had put in my body in a 7 minute period, its been so difficult not only that but telling my close friends and family about what I have been suffering with for some time now in desperation because I could feel my body dwindling away. To keep it short last week I had completely lost hope but I still needed to keep trying, as of today I have been able to fully eat 4 meals with water included and keep it down and I haven't felt this good in awhile. Normally I'd be way to nervous to write this let alone on a forum for others to see but if you feel like hope is nowhere in sight; you're wrong recovery is possible! Man it feels good to be alive today.",

Keep it up, and if something emotionally difficult/stressful comes your way try to reflect carefully, take a deep breath, and don\u2019t let it ruin all the hard work you\u2019ve done so far. Remember this amazing feeling you have right now and try to recall it when things get hard and trigger you to want to numb yourself in food.",
