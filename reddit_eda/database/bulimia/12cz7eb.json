He bought me a kids meal. \n\nAfterwards I went into the arcade next to this cafe, there was one toilet, like one large bathroom thing. \nI went in to purge and the splashback was so bad, I got it all in my fringe/ bangs. I have like a full straight cut Betty bangs type thing going on. Got puke all in my hair. Spent 30 minutes purging and washing my hair in the sink and then trying to dry it under the hand dryer.. then I flushed and the toilet got blocked and the water and vomit poured out into the floor.. it didn\u2019t go well. \n\nCame out and there was a queue of like 10 people waiting to use this one toilet. I look like shit, the bathroom floor is covered in water and puke. \n\nNever felt so humiliated.",

      "body": "One time I binged on a ton of food and was mid-binge frenzy and my senior dog fainted/had a seizure. He seemed to settle down but my mom and I rushed to get him in the car, and instead of going with to the vet I stayed home because I HAD to purge. My dog died and I didn\u2019t get to say bye because I was busy vomiting,\u2026 because that was more important. That\u2019s probably my guiltiest worst outcome from this illness. Other than that, vomit coming out of my nose, missing the toilet and getting it all over me, having to heave and like jump to get thicker food like bread out of me.. those experiences are always humbling. Plotting where you can purge and finding safe public restrooms and friends houses is depressing. I have been binging and purging on and off since I was 15, I turn 25 next year. I\u2019ve done lots of therapy and treatments, and my symptoms are down to maybe once a month I relapse compared to daily. My eating disorder has always remained, but fluctuated as I stacked on drug addiction and abusive relationships. I literally don\u2019t understand how I haven\u2019t had more medical repercussions. I really have only experienced extreme weight loss, gain, some minor oral health issues, puffy face, fainting, exhaustion, dehydration, sore throat and the soft extra layers of hair that grow when you are underweight, and honestly I consider that lucky. My heart goes out to every one of these posts. I can\u2019t even think about what medical issues I have that I don\u2019t know about or will have when I get older, and I just pray everyone gets through this disease and can save themselves and heal. From drugs to this, I don\u2019t wish bulimia on anyone and forever regret the day I managed to get myself to throw up. You can abstain from drugs, alcohol, sex\u2026 etc, anything with support and therapy, but food? You have to face that every day, forever. Bulimia fighters are the strongest people out there. Sending everyone hugs and strength. \ud83e\udd7a",

The texture when I purged was grainy and tasted like chemicals\n- in my lowest I drank borax to get myself to throw up because my gag reflex had worn off. Do not ever do this. First of all It didn\u2019t work. Second of all you\u2019ll most likely die of poisoning. All that happened was my mouth and throat were burning for hours and I thought I was going to die - probably almost did. \n- having a spaghetti noodle stuck right in the back of my throat for what felt like hours and it wouldn\u2019t come up or go down\n- have spent over $2000 in less than a year on binge food\n- have gained close to 60lbs in only 7 months\n- I\u2019ve gotten Bursitis on my knee as a result of bulimia (painful swelling and inflammation of fluid-filled pads, called bursae, that act as cushions to the joints). Some of the worst pain I\u2019ve ever felt. Doctors described it resembling how a dislocation feels. The pain was so gruesome I woke up screaming, fainted, and couldn\u2019t walk for weeks\n\nI\u2019m recovering currently after years of several eating disorders and never want to go back to that dark place.",

Well, I finished up and decided to go outside to smoke a cigarette (yeah idk now that\u2019s become a thing with me - smoking after an episode \ud83e\udd20).  \n\nAnyway, so it was like 9 at night and dark out and I was pretty disoriented after dehydrating myself to no end and I fucking tripped and fell outside, scraped my hand really Fuckin badly (like right near my knuckle) and a huge chunk of skin came off.  It started gushing blood & I mean GUSHING like so much that it dripped all the way down my arm & I looked like I came straight outta a horror movie.  So when I got back inside (mind you \u2014 I still fucking stayed out there to smoke with my hand gushing blood like a totally NORMAL person), I had to treat the big ass cut & because it was in such an awkward spot, the only way to keep the bandage staying on was to wrap my entire hand in medical tape.\n\nSooo needless to say, I can\u2019t bend my hand at all now & practically every customer at work asked in horror WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR HAND?!?  So I\u2019ve had to make up this nonchalant \u201coh yeah I tripped cause I\u2019m a klutz lol\u201d \n\nBut like yeah\u2026 pretty sure this wouldn\u2019t have happened if I wasn\u2019t b/ping for three hours straight!!!

It looked like I was growing an alien specimen.\nI've also done this once in my bedroom closet but it only sat a few months.\n\nI've smuggled a shopping bag filled with smaller zip lock bags out of my house at 3am for a walk of shame to dispose of so no one in my house would catch me.  Well the fucking busted open in my garage bin and soaked it in vomit.  You could smell that shit outside my house for WEEKS.\n\nAlmost choked to death alone at my boyfriends house and dug my own throw up out of my throat thankfully. Scared the piss out of me. Proceeded to have a mental breakdown then binge and purge again later that night.\n\nBacked up plumbing at both my home so badly a plumber had to come in and unclog our pipes and it lead to my mom confronting me about \"being too lazy to walk downstairs to throw food out and not flushing it anymore.\"\n\nClogged my boyfriends shower tub.\n\nI had 17 cavities in one fucking year.\n\nIt's gotten so bad I'll randomly just upchuck if I eat too fast or eat food that doesn't agree with me. Laxative abuse had caused me to shit myself plenty of times. \n\nIt goes on and on and on.  I started at 15. I turn 25 in October.  Almost 10 years of this shit and I regret the day I finally figured out how to make myself purge.   I'll cry and purge and cry and purge, melt down and hold myself in the shower from the pain it causes me, yet I can't stop. I've suffered from strictly binging and restricting but I swear, bulimia is the worst, purging is the absolute fucking worst.\nI just got back from the bathroom. \nThere's nothing beautiful about this eating disorder.  I cannot glamorize it.  It mortifies me. My friends hate going out to eat with me. My boyfriend is terrified to leave me alone.",

He seemed to settle down but my mom and I rushed to get him in the car, and instead of going with to the vet I stayed home because I HAD to purge. My dog died and I didn\u2019t get to say bye because I was busy vomiting,\u2026 because that was more important. That\u2019s probably my guiltiest worst outcome from this illness. Other than that, vomit coming out of my nose, missing the toilet and getting it all over me, having to heave and like jump to get thicker food like bread out of me.. those experiences are always humbling. Plotting where you can purge and finding safe public restrooms and friends houses is depressing. I have been binging and purging on and off since I was 15, I turn 25 next year. I\u2019ve done lots of therapy and treatments, and my symptoms are down to maybe once a month I relapse compared to daily. My eating disorder has always remained, but fluctuated as I stacked on drug addiction and abusive relationships. I literally don\u2019t understand how I haven\u2019t had more medical repercussions. I really have only experienced extreme weight loss, gain, some minor oral health issues, puffy face, fainting, exhaustion, dehydration, sore throat and the soft extra layers of hair that grow when you are underweight, and honestly I consider that lucky. My heart goes out to every one of these posts. I can\u2019t even think about what medical issues I have that I don\u2019t know about or will have when I get older, and I just pray everyone gets through this disease and can save themselves and heal. From drugs to this, I don\u2019t wish bulimia on anyone and forever regret the day I managed to get myself to throw up. You can abstain from drugs, alcohol, sex\u2026 etc, anything with support and therapy, but food? You have to face that every day, forever. Bulimia fighters are the strongest people out there.

      "body": "I know this is a while ago, and I hope you are doing better. I was bulimic for 6 years and its been 2 months of recovery and low on iron, vitamin D lots of infections in my mouth, always got sick with flus,  colds and anything that was going around I got it. 3 UTI'S in the space of 2.5 months since I decided to recover and I am already  noticing small changes and it's only been 2 months on Thursday and some days are harder than others but with being positive I know recovery is possible and reading others stories from their recovery I know it is possible. I have palpitations, racing heart at times but i used to feel it 24/7 now it is becoming less and less. My iron was critically low for a while coming up over a year but at first I fainted, felt weak that even walking felt like I was dragging my body and feeling like I would never wake up if I b/p again, and one day I just decided I needed to recover or else things could get worse fast if I didn't decide their and then that I wanted to healthy instead of the fear that my loved ones will soon have to witness and Bury me which is what ultimately led me to decide to recover. My point in all this is as hard as it is, recovery is possible, and my motto is taking it hour by hour, day by day but if I can do it, believe me you can too. Sending so much love and hugs. X\n\nI focus on eating 3 meals a day, and snacks as and when i needed to fuel my body. I still haven't got ym appetite back but i'm trying to nourish my body again, sipping 2 litres of water everyday, my kidneys badly needed plenty of hydration after all the abuse I put it through,  started probiotics for my gut and also my woman's area for the uti's, started the gym but going because I want to heal my body not abuse it. Stopped taking any  unnecessary pain medications because the longer I am in recovery I realised I am not in much pain as I once was, and if I am in pain I try alternatives for it before I resort to pain medications like hot water bottles, acupressure, yoga and all the natural stuff as possible and if all else fails then I will allow myself to take pain pills then. Its all a learning thing and learning to trust my own instincts.\nI am nowhere near done yet as I still have joint pain, still low in Vitamin D and Iron but i am working towards healing and with the help of my GP, and pyschiatry team I am so much closer than I was before I started recovery.\nP.s. All the symptoms whilst i was thick in bulimia was scary but I didn't care because I also was very depressed and anxious especially in regards to the health of others ironically not myself. But in recovery, I put myself first for once because I can't help others if I am sick. What helps me also in recovery is how I want to become a registered nurse in the near future as a focus and motivation to get better and a nurse that focuses on eating disorder recovery to help others who been through the same things I have.",

I\u2019ve felt the electrolyte imbalance drop and my body shake violently and sweat.
