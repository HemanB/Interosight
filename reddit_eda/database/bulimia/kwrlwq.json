This idea that I have that it\u2019s some kind of treat- when I am frantically shoveling food into me so that I can throw it up. Hiding and lying and trying to wash of the shame after. You are not alone. This thing is a freaking beast. We cannot let it shame us into hiding or believing we are the only ones. You do not deserve to be hated. I hate that we are experiencing this. Keep fighting the urges and know you are not alone.",
