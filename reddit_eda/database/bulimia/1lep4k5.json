  "selftext": " I\u2019ve tried to stop binge-purging more times than I can count. I used to think I lacked discipline or that I was just broken.\n\nThe last 4 days have been different. I didn\u2019t use more willpower. I didn\u2019t follow some magical plan. I simply\u2026 paused.\n\nThe urges came like always. But this time, I sat with them. I let them speak, but I didn\u2019t follow. I noticed that they don\u2019t scream forever \u2014 they fade. And I realized: I don\u2019t have to act on every feeling.\n\nInstead of punishing my body, I fed it what it needed. I paid attention to hunger. I let myself feel full without guilt. I even said \u201cno\u201d to that familiar \u201cjust one more bite\u201d lie.\n\n4 days may sound like nothing, but for me \u2014 it\u2019s everything.\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this and feel stuck, I want you to know: you don\u2019t need to be perfect. You just need one clean day. And then another. You\u2019re not alone. You\u2019re not weak.\n\nI\u2019m still scared, but now I\u2019m also proud. And maybe \u2014 maybe \u2014 hopeful.\n\nIf I can make it 4 days, maybe you can too. \ud83e\udef6",
