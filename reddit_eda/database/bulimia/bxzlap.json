You\u2019re a much needed light of hope in the realm of this sink hole of a disorder.\n\n\nIt\u2019s been known that recovering from Bulimia can be next to impossible to recover from by yourself, for most people who suffer at least. Assuming you got some support in your recovery so far, how did you cope with the inevitable periods when you were alone with your thoughts? What were the steps you took yourself to ensure you didn\u2019t relapse once you were out of the eyes of your support networks?\n\n\nThis is something that always trips me up when I am trying to recover.

I've had a lot of mental health issues before and have a BPD diagnosis but bulimia is by far the worst thing I have ever had to go through. My first attempt at a stationary Ed Programm failed and after 5 months I got even worse. Now I'm in one of the best clinics in Germany, waited half a year for this. I've been here for two weeks and really, the amount of food you have to eat here is just so so much.. I'm a little underweight (17.00 bmi) and need to get back to a bmi of 20.00... That's scary enough. But my body is so used to just getting all the food out again, I can't stop throwing up after every meal and this leads to me going back tk the supermarket buying more food. Binging. Purging... And this vicious cycle just doesn't want to end.. Not even here. It's like I lost my motivation. Before I for here I really wanted to make it and get better so much... But the good and the weight gain scare me so, so much... And this feeling of pleasure at the beginning kd a binge... Idk how to do this. How to Pick of the threads of the life I used to live before food was all my life was about. I don't know how to get myself back again. I'm very proud and happy for you. You're strong. I hope I can be too one dY..",

The hardest and most depressing conversation (and it was a necessary one) was that bulimia would slowly but surely make my life miserable and that even if the weight came on, it wouldn't matter because my mind was healed. (and yes I gained a few pounds and no i did not keep gaining weight til sheer obesity like I thought I was going too)  Being skinny isn't something special or something worth achieving.  your'e not some like mythical,  fragile little thing that needs to be protected. Youre lost. And desperate. (at least I was)  Find the underlying issue and also stop the compulsion to binge by eating 3 meals and 3 snacks a day (this is in no way ment to be a strict rule, just a reminder that the worst thing after a binge is to make up for it as u prob already know, and it keeps u in the cycle forever and ever) I know how scary weight gain is during the first months but through my recovery I opened up to so many people in terms of life struggles, love, desires, dreams, passions I have,  things I would have never been able to share because I was to ashamed when I was bulimic. I could feel coming back to life, I would interact with people in such a different way. \n\nIm not religious but:\n\nIm beautiful in my way \nCause god makes no mistakes\nIm on the right track baby\nI was born this way",

I cannot tell you how many moments I had when I literally thought this life is not worth living, how do I unfuck everything. To be honest, once I opened up to people and I went to a few group meetings It all sort of became a little bit easier. Find yourself a \"recover buddy\" that you can cry amd bitch with during the process so you dont feel so damn alone.  I wish words could describe this relentless cold pain that bulimia is once you realize you were coping to get through something else. And I wish there was a way to put feelings I felt into words. But I can't, it's too damn complicated and profound. Be patient, be bloated and be accepting and kind to yourself. Even though you might not see it now, I care and love you for even being interested in getting to start recovery, and so should you. As a human being, you know :)",

Youre in a clinic now and that's good! (hey, im actually from Germany :D) I have this overwhelming empathy for you right now, and it really sucks that I cant just be like \"yeah just stop throwing up\". It does not matter how well a clinic is programmed, because do you know who ultimately decides whether or not you start getting your life back together? YOU. and you only. I know this will blow your mind now, but I dont know how much I weight, I don't know how many calories I eat or how much I exercised. My BMI is probably well over 20. And you know what. My life is incomparable to how I felt when I was a little bit thinner and bulimic. Find yourself a personal support, people you truly truly enjoy spending time with that you can open up about.  The vicious circle start as soon as you get rid of the calories. Starving / binging is not something seperate, it is two halfs of one. You are more than your body, like legit I mean it. Food is food and emotions are emotions. On a good ending: The positive effect, this feeling as if life is \"slowly starting to get back to you\" is a reward that usually comes early in recovery and you will experience that too :)",
