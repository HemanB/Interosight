      "body": "I have purged since I was 14 years old, I am now 45. \n\nSince 2013 it has been really bad. At my worst I did nothing but eat and purge (I had anorexia binge-purge type) and could not get any sleep or rest, so sometimes I purged every hour for 24 hours. \n\nI was hospitalised several times and they tried to make me eat and gain weight, but as soon as I was discharged I lost weight quickly because I am so \u00abgood\u00bb at purging.\n\nThese days I purge between 1 and 4 times per day, but I manage to not purge when I am with friends or family. I have this \u00abrule\u00bb in my head that I can\u2019t purge food that is given to me by someone who loves me. \n\nOf course\u2026.I am quite unable to travel to places and live in the same space/apartment as other people, because of this. I can manage to not purge for 4 days when I\u2019m with others, but there\u2019s my limit. I get extremely tense and anxious as I can feel the food \u201csitting in my stomach\u201d. My digestion is not functioning well, due to years and years of restricting, binging and purging. \n\nI have managed to get myself weight restored, though. It was hell to go through it, but it has been worth it, since my body isn\u2019t in starvation mode as often anymore, and that means I bp less often now. \n\nIt\u2019s quite fascinating really (and a bit scary) how much the human body can tolerate and survive. I\u2019ve thought multiple times that if \u201chealthy people\u201d had to live my life (binging and purging mostly every day), they would not be able to function. \n\nSo\u2026. Please try and not be hard on yourself for doing what you\u2019re doing. Binging and purging is addictive and once the cycle has started it\u2019s really, really hard to stop. Know that for every single time you\u2019re able to postpone it or even not do it (in spite of strong compulsion to do so) you\u2019re in fact showing great strength and courage. \n\nNo shame\u2026 \ud83d\udc9b It only adds to the burden we\u2019re already carrying, and we deserve to treat ourselves with respect and decency, even when we feel that we\u2019re not worth it or should be doing better. \n\nI hope you have told someone you trust about what you\u2019re going through. Are you in therapy, or do you know someone else close to you that struggle with the same? Having someone good to talk to can make a huge difference in how you feel about yourself.",

Used to blame myself because I couldn\u2019t stop. Was even telling myself that today will be the last day I purge, when the following day came and I failed to do so, I was purging even more - as a punishment.\nUntil I changed my way of thinking. A friend of mine that has had intrusive thoughts every day, he would wake up and already set in his mind that he will have them. So he had them. Until he realised it\u2019s his perspective. If they happen they happen. We are humans.\n\nI tried doing that too, didn\u2019t work from first. \nAs an idea, i used to purge even 20 times a day. Right now (i have had stomach operation because of a bad bulimic episode- it\u2019s not something that happens early in the disorder, but can reach that. You don\u2019t have to. Just change your perspective.\n\nTo directly reply to you, don\u2019t tell yourself something you are not ready for. Start little. As an example, i used after o.p. To purge about 5 days. But i was waking up with the thought that I will purge. Then I changed my thinking when I\u2019d wake up and say: \u201cok, if I purge I purge\u201d .it didn\u2019t take me a day to reach this point, but from 5 eps it dropped down to 3, then 2 and now I sometimes have 1 or  2. Some days I have 4. So what? \nI hope you get my point, feel free to ask anything and I am proud of you for talking about this\ud83e\udd17",

I honestly just made a huge effort with will power, avoiding looking at sweets in the store and not going down the candy aisle for months. I started focusing my binges on more filling things with less sugar. It took probably like 3 months or so. On a daily basis, the sweetest thing I eat now is Frosted Flakes and brown sugar cinnamon oatmeal. I'm able to have candy or baked goods in moderation. When I do have candy, it no longer tastes as good as I think it's going to. I eat things sometimes at special events and think \"omg that's way too sweet\" which is something I'd never thought I'd say. But in short, the longer you go without it, the easier it gets. It was a huge feat for me and I'm very proud of the hard work I put in though lol",

Sometimes it\u2019s hard to tell if it\u2019s a heart attack. When I would purge it would take me a few minutes to recover, so I\u2019d lay on the floor. During purging my heart would flutter, I\u2019d be lethargic for the rest of the day. Some days I thought I was going die right there. Slumped in the toilet. I started begging God, Jesus Christ to help me. I really wanted me life. He sure has helped me, but the consequences are still with me. As I look in the mirror, the whole bottom row of my teeth are rotten. I have constant stomach pain. GERD. I\u2019m 36. I eat small healthy meals throughout the day, grilled chicken with veggies. Some white rice. I stay away from trigger foods. A year ago the only thing that would come up is acidic liquid. I really encourage you guys to try for your life before it\u2019s to late\u2026..",

Did you notice during recovery your face swelling went away?\n\nThese are things that encourage people to stop. The health consequences but also the vanity because the swelling is brutal.",
