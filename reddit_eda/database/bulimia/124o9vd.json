  "selftext": "Just wanted to share something today, something awfull. \n\nAt a pool party, our friend visiting from Germany was complimenting one of my friends about his weight loss.  His words being\n\n\"You lost all that weight and it transferred to him (me).\"\n\nAnd he said that repeatedly.  \n\nSo, out of pure depression,  I hid behind the resort,  and reignited my bulimia. \n\nKeep in mind, this German friend has the ideal body. Six foot five,  six  pack, everything. \n\nNow i feel like shit. Im scared that I'll return to my old ways. Vomiting everything i eat just to feel less pain than being compared to others. \n\nJust wanted to share  I'm not asking for sympathy or advice.  Just...sharing an unfortunate event. \n\nHoping you guys are faring better than me. \u2764\ufe0f",

They seem to view their bodies as more like a vehicle that carries them around. Bodies are more meaningful, private and sacred in American culture. \n\nI\u2019m clearly having a hard time explaining this observation, but it\u2019s no excuse for saying such a d*cky thing, let alone repeatedly. \n\nI\u2019m sorry this happened to you. Take your power back by choosing not to let a loser\u2019s words affect your progress. Giving in is not an excuse to give up. Start a new streak, but even better, stop counting and live your life. Best of luck to you.",

Don\u2019t beat yourself up if you slip up either. EDs are complicated and feel like the best coping mechanisms sometimes, even when we know better \ud83e\udee0",
