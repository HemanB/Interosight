God with the food prices, I don't think I'd be able to afford it anymore.\n\nIf disposable vapes get banned in Australia and I'm forced onto cigarettes ($40/packet maybe 2.5 days) it would probably cost just as much as binging and purging but the disposable vapes that I go through equal out to like $50 a week.\n\n So that's $200 a month when my alternative is $500 a month on binging and purging food.",
