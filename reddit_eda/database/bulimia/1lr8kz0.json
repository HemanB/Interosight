  "selftext": "I used to be 300 pounds when i was 16. Got bullied in high school that i just dropped out and did school online. Never had a girlfriend. Lost all my friends, and even the friends I used to have started to make fun of me. I thought it was because the way I looked. I mean I would get called \u201cfat fuck\u201d everyday by my bully in highschool. So I started losing the weight, I hit the gym everyday and would just starve myself. I would go a whole day and only have a small cup of coffee. No real food, no nutritions, nothing. I guess I developed anorexia from what I was told, then in about a year and half I lost over 140 pounds. I got so obsessed with my weight and my looks. I sheltered myself still after losing all the weight. Right now i\u2019m only 19, i\u2019m 6\u20191 and 158 pounds, I only wanted to be in the 150\u2019s so started to throw up my food to just maintain my weight. Now I\u2019ve been binging and purging my food and drinks for the last 10 months. I can\u2019t even drink a bottle of water without throwing it up. I feel like i\u2019m dying. I\u2019m going on year doing this almost everyday. i\u2019m afraid i\u2019m going to die. I\u2019m only 19 and feel like an 80 year old, i never have any energy, I can\u2019t sleep at night, my heart and stomach hurts as i write this. I went to 2 different therapists but it didn\u2019t work. I don\u2019t know how to stop this and i don\u2019t want to die. ",

I can\u2019t even imagine how heavy everything feels right now, but I want you to know I hear you and you\u2019re not alone in this. What you\u2019re going through is incredibly painful, and I\u2019m really sorry the world has been so cruel to you.\n\nI\u2019ve been through something similar being isolated, losing friends, and even being bullied by the people I once trusted. That kind of pain sticks, and it changes how you see yourself. I know what it\u2019s like to feel completely alone, like no one really gets it, and like your body becomes the only thing you can control. It\u2019s a really scary place to be in.\n\nBut I need you to know this: what you\u2019ve survived says so much about your strength. Seriously. Even if you feel like you\u2019re breaking, just the fact that you shared your story shows there\u2019s still a part of you that wants to be okay and that part matters so much.\n\nYou deserve help that works and just because therapy didn\u2019t work the first couple of times doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re beyond help. Sometimes it takes time to find the right person, the right support. But that support is out there.\n\nIf you want I can dig deeper and find something that works for you. I recently did in-depth research on eating disorders. \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb",
