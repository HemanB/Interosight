  "selftext": "I saw a dentist today for the first time in years. Before she started she asked if there was anything bothering me and I said I was nervous because I\u2019ve been struggling with bulimia and I was worried about the damage I was doing to my teeth. \nShe was so understanding about it! As I sat in the chair she asked me if anyone had told me I was beautiful today and I obviously started crying \ud83d\ude44\nBut honestly she was amazing, it\u2019s the first person I\u2019ve ever told and she was really supportive. She told me the first thing I needed to do was stop rinsing with bicarbonate of soda after I purge(!!!) and she prescribed me some toothpaste to try and help my enamel because the damage is quite bad. \nI was dreading going and nearly cancelled but I\u2019m so glad I didn\u2019t because it feels like a weight off my shoulders finally saying it out loud. I feel like it\u2019s the first step in a long journey but I\u2019m pleased I\u2019m starting it.",
