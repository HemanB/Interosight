  "selftext": "I stayed over at a friends apartment this weekend with my roommates. We all had a lot of fun but I didn\u2019t watch myself and had way too much to drink and ended up giving myself alcohol poisoning. My friends were taking care of me and in my blackout I told them that \u201cI\u2019m good at throwing up because I\u2019m bulimic\u201d i later came too after much more throwing up and they told me what I had said to them. I was so embarrassed. My friend told me we would talk about it in the morning but when the next day came I asked her to confirm again if what she told me I said was true. Once she did we didn\u2019t talk about it anymore. I feel conflicted about this, I don\u2019t want them to treat me differently because of my ED but I was glad they were worried enough about it to have a conversation. Should I bring it up to them again now that I\u2019m sober or should I just leave it alone for fear of looking like I\u2019m seeking out attention and their pity.",

If they are good friends they may ask how they can be supportive and it\u2019s ok if you don\u2019t know know. Let them know that you are the same person as you were before you told them and want to be treated the same. Best of luck!",

We had NO idea. None of her kids knew she\u2019d been numeric their entire childhood. What a shock. She went into 2 residential programs. They didn\u2019t know what to say or do. It\u2019s hard to know if we should ask about it. But we LOVE her and care for her wellbeing. We don\u2019t know when she\u2019s relapsing. But we care a lot. \n\nJust some thoughts. Sending love!",
