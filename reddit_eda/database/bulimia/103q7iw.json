Most are never at an uncomfortable body fat percent, they don't enjoy fruit, vegetables, rice cakes and stuff like that and really never have foods that just want 4000 calories of. Different hormones are released between other people as they're eating and the feeling of being full is painful to some and comforting to others. I've seen way too many cases of heavier people wanting to sleep after eating heavy in comparison to the hyperactivity or discomfort of leaner people.
