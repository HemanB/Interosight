However, recently, I've been binging and it makes me feel so disgusting that I can't purge.\n\nSorry, I just thought I'd let y'all know what's going on down here in Texas. I wish all y'all fellow Texan bulimics good luck...",

The situation won't last forever and however bad you feel, bulimia always makes you feel worse when you can't bend to it's will. In a way you're testing the strength needed to begin quitting but it's never easy to be forced into it instead of going through guided treatment. \n\nBig hug, I'm sorry it's not nice right now especially",

After a week my personal bathroom toilet got clogged and I couldn\u2019t use it for a week or so. I was binging and purging on the regular. I ended up purging in a bag, walking it down the street searching for a trash bin but couldn\u2019t find one. I ended up chucking it under the bridge where a lot of garbage was and when I walked back, a woman on her porch literally called me out and asked me if I just threw out trash over there. It was so embarrassing and I had to make up some insane excuse.",
