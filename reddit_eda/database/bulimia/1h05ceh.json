It\u2019s indignant, it hurts sometimes and the after part having to clean up your face full of vomit, the toilets and sometimes your clothes is a reminder of it all. But it\u2019s also part of the routine if you see what I mean\u2026\n\nAnyways I always have a few seconds of hesitation before purging but never really regret it once it started",
