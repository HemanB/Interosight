I\u2019m not binging heavily but still I can\u2019t seem to wait for my \u201d breakfast \u201d until the morning so even though I eat well over 2k calories everyday I still eat just about 1200 calories more as my 10pm breakfast before the actual breakfast next day lol. But it\u2019s better than binging and throwing more life away \ud83d\ude43",

But then like you said the purging makes me feel better and it\u2019s a never ending cycle. I have hope for all of us though that we will find peace one day!",

I know I didn't purge because I don't remember purging and because I woke up all bloated and with the taste of the food still in my mouth. But somehow it wasn't a problem. I vaguely remember eating the food and then just going to sleep and not caring. It was so weird. I may or may not be recommending this to people.",
