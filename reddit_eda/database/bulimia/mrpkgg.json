  "selftext": "Hi guys, I thought I'd share my little win with you all! My long term partner is usually a big help with keeping me accountable and busy on a night so I don't binge. He always talks about how proud he is of me when I have urges but don't act on them.\n\nTonight he took a night shift so I ate a balanced evening meal (fish fingers, a serving of chips and lots of carrots, peas and sweetcorn) alone. Usually if I binge with him in the house I go somewhere alone (i.e. the kitchen) when he's busy.\n\nSo not having someone to talk to and keep me busy, I watched some netflix, had a piece of a chocolate bar and made some protein ice cream ( I usually have this or airpopped popcorn as a dessert).\n\nIts currently 11.17pm here, I'm about to go to bed, I've had some urges today between meals and even now, but I've not indulged them and in a short while I will have achieved a small victory since trying to get my ED in order.\n\nThanks for reading guys, we can do this!",
