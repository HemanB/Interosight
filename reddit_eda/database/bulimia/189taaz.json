  "selftext": "i know this sounds dark af & that you cant choose ur disorder and this is probably my ed speaking but sometimes i wish i had anorexia instead of the gross puking one. bulimia is literally the most pointless disease to exist, all this suffering and nothing to show for it. ive been ed'd for YEARS (ednos -> bulimia) at this point and all im doing is losing & gaining the same 5 pounds. i mean i lost both my sanity and dignity so thats at least something, i guess?\n\ni am aware that AN is a horrible horrible illness but its the \"poster child\" of eds, the gold standard so to speak. other eds are basically non existent outside of ed spaces and if they are they get stigmatized as hell, especially BED.",

My last therapist told me she felt bulimia was probably keeping me alive. My husband's cousin died of anorexia, and the whole family still laments over her. They know full well I have this, and they enable me, because they don't even believe I'm ill. I've been turned down four times for treatment. I don't say this because I want anorexia- I understand that it's a terrible disease.

There was always this past trauma over my head that said \"you've eaten, now you'll get hurt.\" This is a thing none of my therapists ever attempted to understand. \n\nOnto the stigma, as I've been in recovery for several years, I'm working on getting my teeth fixed up. I went to this dentist and I was honest about my bulimia history (why not, I'm there for help), and he said \"you're a lost cause, you're going to lose all your teeth). I left the office crying and my husband stayed to talk to them. They gave me a referral and I fully believe he just wrote me off as a bulimic, recovery or not... because I made that referral appointment and they said your teeth are totally salvageable.\n\nHad I needed dental implants it would have been $30k. I also previously had the septic tank pumped from \"grease\" (it was my vomit) for $400. Bulimia is expensive.\n\nBut forced AN lead to my bulimia. I don't recommend either. Save your money.
