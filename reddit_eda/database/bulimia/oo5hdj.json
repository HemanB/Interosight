  "selftext": "5 days guys. 5 freaking days without bingeing or purging. I started to try to take initiative about 3 weeks ago. I\u2019d make it about two days, and then give in, and then make it another two. There are a few things I\u2019ve realized.. the bloating and cramping is still here, but it feels a little better with every day that passes. I\u2019ve had one bowel movement, and it was small, but it\u2019s progress. I\u2019m taking a digestive supplement and drinking a glass of prune juice daily. I wake up every morning relieved that I didn\u2019t give into the temptation the night before. It\u2019s a bit like getting sober off of alcohol, really. Which is what it reminds me of at least. I eat two meals a day and I\u2019m trying to eat foods that are easy on my gut and digestive friendly. When I have my meal around lunch time, I feel satiated, full, and finally energized. It\u2019s the evening meal for me that has really been difficult. The fullness feeling in my stomach doesn\u2019t feel satisfying and after finishing the healthy meal, I have an overwhelming desire to keep it going and head to a fast food joint or a gas station and eat until I\u2019m ready to explode. Driving around while I battle these urges seems to help, or meeting up with my boyfriend and having a face to face distraction. I panic a little when he\u2019s busy after my evening meal, because I\u2019ve been relying on his company to help get me through the evening. I feel like shit after purging and I want to feel relaxed and comfortable while I\u2019m with him. I had today off and I left his house around midnight last night. I very nearly drove to a fast food joint and pigged out, but I didn\u2019t. I laid in my bed waiting for sleep to hit battling the desire to binge for about an hour. I\u2019m proud of myself, but I\u2019m finally able to see how truly hard this is going to be. Food still feels like my mortal enemy. If I could avoid it and still have energy for the day, I absolutely would. I know it\u2019s only been a week, but it\u2019s felt like a long one. I just know this is a battle I have to keep fighting.",

Something that has helped me out a lot on my journey through recovery is having a journal. It\u2019s a good way to express your feelings and be able to change the way you speak with yourself. Be gentle and nice to yourself. You are trying so hard and you are doing such an amazing job!!!!",
