I just wanted to say to people that are actively recovering or just in general to people:\n\nDon\u2019t read all the posts if you can\u2019t handle it. There\u2019s a lot of triggering stuff and some people can handle it some can\u2019t. Some people mention trigger words, or something that can make you relapse (if you\u2019re recovering) or install that \u201ccompetition\u201d mentally. Please take care of yourself and remove yourself if you\u2019re not strong enough. For your own sake. \n\nI just want us to take care of each other.
