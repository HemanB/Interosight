  "selftext": "My husband touched at my stomach flab as i was sitting down. He didn't do it I'm a mean way but still made me feel like he looks at my body and sees how I'm not stick thin anymore...I was like are you pointing out how I'm fat? He said it's not that your fat or not it's more of like a spectrum. In the past he has told me that he'd rather I throw up than get fat. I don't think he understands how serious and mentally challenging it is to struggle with an eating disorder. I feel like I cannot recover fully and stop throwing up because if I do he notices that my stomach gets softer and also doesn't seem to care if I do it or not. He is aware that I have had anorexia / bulimia since I was 14 years old off and on. He knows that I have been in treatment and been hospitalized but don't understand why he would act like that. I feel a lot of pressure from him to remain in my eating disorder because he comments on other people's weight all the time including making gestures at me like touching my stomach.",

The part where he said he would rather you throw up is downright unethical from a mental health practitioner. I think if you can both go to therapy with someone who specializes in EDs (or just understands them at all), or if you have a therapist or counsellor who you go to who could do a session with both of you he might admit he shouldn\u2019t be saying those things . . . But I can imagine having doubt that his feelings about weight gain have changed even if he does change his behaviour. He really should know better, which in my opinion makes it more hurtful. Love is supporting the wellness and spiritual growth of one another, and he is literally trying to keep you small. I\u2019m so sorry to say it doesn\u2019t sound like he truly cares about your physical, mental and spiritual well being. Wanting to keep someone a certain size is, at it\u2019s core, controlling and in this case borderline abusive since he is encouraging self harm. If you have access to a counsellor or therapist I hope you get support in your journey of protecting your energy, recovery and power \ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97",

In my experience(and stories I also heard from other people I have known over the years) it is VERY common for a psychiatrist or therapist to cross boundaries in one way or another (especially male therapists) and I have had 15+ of them, I think I have only had two that were decent and never crossed boundaries, and at least seemed to want to help/care. I really don't believe I am some super unlucky person in this regard, I am convinced there is a terrifyingly high amount of shitty people working as social workers and therapists/psychiatrists.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's also very common for people with eating disorders to be in relationships with manipulative shit heads who abuse them either mentally, physically or both. Because 95% of people with eating disorders have low self esteem. For abusive people you're never good enough for them, and there is always something wrong with you. Too fat, too skinny, too outgoing, too shy, too many friends, not enough friend etc. It's true OP he doesn't love you, and you'll never be good enough for him. Also before you think ''I can change him'' people like that rarely change.",
