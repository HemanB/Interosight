  "selftext": "Heyyyy. So I\u2019m a popular influencer & many May know who I am. I have been bulimic for 7 years and I\u2019m over it. I purge every single day. There hasn\u2019t been a day I haven\u2019t purged since I started. My mom thinks I stopped and everyone around me has no idea. I am drowning in my head and feel like Im living this secret life. I vomit anywhere! Literally anywhere. In public bathrooms or anywhere I can. I can\u2019t keep food in because it\u2019ll make me feel sick. I don\u2019t know how to recover. \n\nSincerely,\nA Struggling girl",

Anything other than The obvious? \nJust wondering because they\u2019re so many YouTuber women who are stick thin, eat like shit but claim they just have a fast metabolism or randomly work out once in a while.",

      "body": "Beginning to recover for me was like ripping off a bandaid. I hadn\u2019t accepted that I had a problem but when my sister confronted me about it, I realized I could either deny it and keep drowning in it or I could just say yes, I have a problem. I chose to admit it and ever since then I\u2019ve been doing my best to recover. That was almost a year ago (April 26th, 2020). I cant exactly tell you how to recover because it\u2019s different for everyone, but the first step is admitting you\u2019re sick and deciding to save yourself no matter how hard it gets. Recovering is hard as hell but it\u2019s heaven compared to all those late nights crying and throwing up. You\u2019re already admitting you have a problem, so the next step is to decide to get help. This is probably the hardest part, but I believe in you! You CAN do this and your body and mind will both thank you later, I promise!!!!!",

Try experimenting w/ low density foods if you can. my food at home usually take time to prepare and eat so if i wanna b//p it takes effort + cooking.  \n\n\nsome low density foods that helped w/ my gastro included cereal, dried fruit like mango, and stuff like soup. dont have a drink with your food cause that makes it sit in your stomach. but like,,, keep in something everyday and it really improves your digestibility even if you still b/p sometimes , but now you have the option of eating if you choose to. in 3 months i still have b/p sessions but bc i eat a small thing of mango b4 i sleep my gastro is waaaay less noticible, so i can choose to eat some days if i dont wanna use b/p as a crutch for my anxiety and emotions.",
