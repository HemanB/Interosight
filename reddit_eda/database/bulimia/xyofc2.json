I had like 3 weeks or something where i felt i was really recovering, ate fear foods almost every day, i ate consistently throughout the day , i was happy and social again and then one mistake and i was back to my old habits and more miserable than ever which is where im at now lol.\n\nOne of the most important thing in recovery is to be forgiving towards yourself when you slip up but unfortunately it\u2019s what i struggle the most with.",

This year, something kinda just clicked (I have various comments in my history if you wanna see what I did). Since March I went from purging at least once a day to maybe once every few weeks. And when I slip, it\u2019s whatever. \n\nHere\u2019s how I think of it. One slip up is just that: a slip up. You wen x amount of days without purging, and now you know you can do it again. It might be longer this time. It might be shorter. But those are all days that you didn\u2019t purge. Those are all days that are a HUGE accomplishment. Those days are helping you. \n\nAt least for me, it\u2019s kinda like skincare. Most days, I do an extensive routine, and my skin loves it. But some days the depression hits, and I just.. don\u2019t. That\u2019s fine, because my skin is still all the better for it. Because I put so much effort into taking care of it all the other days, slips aren going to kill me. I know what works, I know that I CAN adhere to it, and I know that when I\u2019m ready, I will.\n\nObviously bulimia is more difficult and serious, but the concept still applies. Your body and mind are still reaping the benefits I all the times you could have purged, but didn\u2019t.",
