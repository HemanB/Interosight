      "body": "Hey! I totally feel you but restriction is often the main reason you\u2019re bingeing. On days when I\u2019m eating more regularly, I rarely ever binge - even though that\u2019s my biggest fear of what will happen when I eat normally. The urge is still often there but it\u2019s so much easier to resist compared to when you\u2019re starving. Getting adequate nutrition is a crucial part of recovery - from there dealing with any emotional binge/purge urges will be a lot easier because you\u2019re not fighting your basic biological instincts. You got this - trust the process and if, after a few weeks, it\u2019s not getting better you can re-assess. It\u2019s a complex illness but we can do things that make it slightly easier to beat x",

      "body": "I appreciate your point. \n\nFor me, the idea of a frozen dinner, a sandwich with chips or fast food isn't even part of the equation for me, for where I'm at.\n\nI can only manage small portions, which I try to do every 2-3 hours, depending, and I do my best to include 2-3 food groups per snack/meal. \n\nFor context, I get up around 6-6:30, but don't eat for the first time until around 10. I will have an energy drink (NOT Redbull or the like... we have a few here that taste just like Bubly, not sweet and sugary) within the first hour I'm up to help kickstart my ADHD meds. I don't drink coffee. \n\nFood wise, an example of a day where I actually *just* eat, and don't have a binge/purge episode:\n\n\"Breakfast\", which I have pretty down, is 1/3 cup granola, 1/3 cup protein yogurt, and a big handful of berries, with a tbsp ground chia and sometimes some hemp hearts.\n\nNext will be an apple with an ounce of sliced cheese, and maybe a small handful of almonds or cashews if I think of it.\n\n\"Lunch\" might be 2-3 oz chicken or tofu, with 1/4 cup crispy quinoa and a tbsp or two of dip (hummus, creamy parmesan dip, sweet chili, etc). The crispy tofu is just cooked quinoa, cooled, tossed with salt and a tiny bit of oil, then baked off in the oven until crispy. I'm obsessed with it, and I'm generally carb-averse, so it's a good way for me to get in some carbs without realizing it. \n\nNext, about a cup or more of sliced red pepper and snap peas with parmesan dip and some crispy quinoa mixed into it (I'm a texture eater). \n\nMaybe a popsicle somewhere in there to satisfy my sugar craving. \n\nNext, a repeat of the chicken/tofu- quinoa - dip.\n\nLastly, around 7, a piece of fruit (currently peaches, otherwise an apple, which I share with my dog). \n\nI feel on the brink of full basically all day, super uncomfortable, when in reality I'm not actually eating enough in terms of calories, but I've had an ED for more than half my life, so my gut hangs onto food like it's never going to be fed again, and also, has no damn clue how to digest anything. It just SITS THERE.  \n\nIt's SO HARD not to purge. Honestly, I think it's actually the biggest barrier/challenge to recovery, because we're basically trying to force ourselves to do the absolute opposite of what we are ingrained to do. \n\nFWIW, my dietician (who is an ED specialist) has said to me that if I can eat what I think I can handle, even if it's not enough, if it stops me from binging and purging, then to do it. And that I will eventually be able to increase my intake, but to do the best I can at this point in time, as long as it keeps me from B/P. I think she's got a good approach, to be honest. \n\n(For clarity, I'm not dangerously underweight. So take that as you will - it's not for everyone).",
