  "selftext": "This is a post dedicated to all those that think vent posts are pro-ana, bragging, unnecessary, stupid, or otherwise unsavory, and feel the need to belittle, ostracize, insult, \"harsh truth\", and be dicks about it. \n\nFirst off, you're wrong. Venting is encouraged and welcomed here, and does not break the subreddit's rules (unless it does). This is a fucking horrible disease where everyone experiences some of the same things, but also a lot of different things than someone else does. Those experiences aren't pleasant, they're probably not SFW, they're triggering. Amd that's okay, because people are allowed to vent about their problems, even if they don't want help. \n\nIf you don't like someone's vent, don't comment. If you want to comment because you don't like someone's vent, but are going to give them \"harsh truth advice\", mock them, belittle them, insult them, invalidate them, or anything else that is otherwise unsupportive, don't fucking comment. \n\nThis ENTIRE subreddit is under a trigger warning. It always has been, it always will be. Anorexia is a triggering subject. If you can't handle seeing triggering vents from people in the thick of it, ignore it and move on. If you can't handle seeing vents and can't control your urges to comment hate-filled, nonproductive, unsupportive things, this isn't the place for you and I'll escort you to the permanently closed door myself. \n\nI'm sick of it, and I'm not the only one. This is a support community. The amount of arguments, insults, unsupportive and outright *mean* comments I've had to remove just last night is unacceptable. This is not who we are as a community and I refuse to let this place go to the freaking dogs because a couple of you can't keep your unsympathetic mouths shut. \n\nWhile I can't control what people upvote or downvote, I DO control what gets removed and who gets permanently banned. Upvoting someone who's being an asshole makes YOU also an asshole, and downvoting those that come here for support and relatablity makes you a dick. \n\nGuys, this isn't highschool. The mean girls don't rule the school. The assholes are in the minority here, and the supportive community is in the majority. Don't stop posting here because of the people that decide they want to be dicks. The moderators have your back. If you see someone being a dick, report it. If you respond, make sure you're not breaking the rules or insulting them back, or your comment will be removed along with theirs. We can band together and *change*. We can drive out the people that aren't here to be supportive. We've done it before in the past, we can do it now. \n\nIf you don't have anything nice to say, shut the fuck up and don't say anything at all. If people start arguing in the comments, I'll lock the post and they can redirect their arguments into modmail where I'll be happy to converse with them. \n\nSincerely, a mod who's just about had it with those in the community that can't stop being dicks to others.",

I react to comments and votes and I question if I am doing something harmful or not, but you're right, not everyone who comments and votes is nice about it. I shouldn't focuss on them, but I still want to keep an open mind about my actions by relying on what other people think. It's just so hard to know when everyone has a different thought about things. I hope people will be less scared to vent here and actually feel safe to talk about their problems. Not everyone has support and help and not everyone can have support and help, even if they want to and it's horrible how some people have been harassing others for having problems from anorexia \n\nI still think I reacted wrong, I still feel guilt, I still feel horrible for what I have said despite being told what I did was reasonable. I don't know why I feel this way but- *sigh* I feel lifted up by so many people and being hugged, given support, I honestly don't know what to say. I want to say thank you infinity times to you and those who have been supportive. I really cannot thank you guys enough \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79\ud83e\udec2",

If you binge-eat at least once a week, plain and simple, you definitely have one of these conditions (or night eating syndrome, but that\u2019s similar and not the point). It can be a source of a lot of shame and turmoil to deal with these kinds of episodes, and there are people out there that can help you regain control, if you ever decide you want to. There\u2019s also a variety of antidepressants that can help you. The second issue in Bulimia is that you damage your body, because you have difficulty reconciling with the consequences of your binges, leading to tearing of the digestive organs, swelling around the throat, electrolyte imbalances, blisters on the fingers, hair loss, tooth damage, and all sorts of additional issues related to the compensatory behaviors.
