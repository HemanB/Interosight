Like, you *deserve* this for what you've done to yourself. \n\nIf it helps, your metabolism probably isn't ruined. There are not a lot of good studies on long-term metabolic adaptation; most studies show that metabolic adaptation is *substantial* when gaining or losing weight, but have less conclusive -- and certainly less dramatic -- evidence that it results in metabolic slowing even after one's weight has stabilized. \n\nIn particular, I remember reading a study on Gambian women who lost weight seasonally during periods of food scarcity, but whose weights were restored during warmer months -- consistently, within about a kg, for a period of 10 or so years. I'll try and find it later.\n\nObviously, I'm not a dietician or anything, but I think there's a lot of fear-mongering about metabolic adaptation.",

I'm weight restored and maintain on several times that amount now; yes, of course I put on weight while getting it back to normal, but the point of recovering from AN isn't to learn how to maintain an unhealthy weight.
