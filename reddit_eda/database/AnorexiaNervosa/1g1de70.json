  "selftext": "Edited the photo after mod contacted me :) \n\"Friend\" thats known I've been struggling with anorexia for the last 12 years. I made a post on Facebook stating that I'm in recovery and reaching out for support. He sent me this message asking me what I was recovering from even though he knows this has been an ongoing struggle 10+ years. (I also don't drink , smoke,  or drugs and he knows this .)\n\nAnyways this type of response is so invalidating and makes me sad. He's never been supportive, but I didn't realize how had of a friend he is, because I've grown accustomed to being treated like shit and never had real support until recently. \n\nAnyways, his response is so triggering and upsetting. He knows I'm very modest and conservative in my \"intimate life.\" And a SA survivor... He insults me by going to sex stuff after I tell him something serious and then asks how come I'm trying now ... \n\nWhen I get response like this,  ED tells me I clearly am not sick and am faking ... that I need to get smaller and then maybe I'll he taken seriously.... *sigh* I don't want to be friends with this terrible friend anymore. Very disgusting man ..",
