We are all suffering. We all have unique situations and experiences. Your thought process with this illness will be different. Your behaviors and how you respond to treatment and therapy will be different. Just because your illness looks different from another person's doesn't mean you aren't valid and you aren't suffering. We all are not supposed to have the same experiences. Because everyone is different.\n\nIf you are hurting enough to restrict your food intake, if you are sad, and if you start obsessing over your weight , you are hurting, and you don't have to prove you are hurting",
