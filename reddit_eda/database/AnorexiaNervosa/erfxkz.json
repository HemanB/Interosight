In those moments you fell better with yourself, relax and try your best not to fall again, when you do fall, everything will suck, you will be hopeless and you will believe that you will never be better, that it will never be enough, BUT THAT'S NOT REAL. That's the falling aching in your heart, when we do fall, it's normal to feel like that. But when it passes, try to remember that it was a moment, a bad one and that isn't who you are.(If I lack in English, it's because I am Brazilian).\nBe well, girl, always. You are loved and beautiful, smile a little after this loooong text and try to smile randomly even when some time has passed, make this world prettier with your happiness",
