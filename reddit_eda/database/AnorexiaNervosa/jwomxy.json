I feel like when I eat around people who know they're kind of like \"what, she is eating?\", and also that they are generally just more vigilant of every morsel I eat. I feel more pressure to restrict almost as evidence that I do have anorexia. I find it much easier to eat whatever around people who dont know, as I feel they notice less/if at all and are less vigilant of how much I am eating in general. \n\nIts difficult because letting people know can feel so freeing but then it also creates these difficult dynamics, generally with the people who are most important to you (hence why you felt comfortable enough to tell them about your anorexia in the first place).",

One day we were in a training together and i saw her take a cookie at the break. I was upset! I was like \"so she's thin WITHOUT anorexia? That isn't fair!\"\n\nI do kind of feel like my mother wants me to be like this. She is very competitive with her sisters-in-law and my sister and i weigh about half as much as any of our cousins. \n\nAnother thing, kind of tangentially related: i have noticed a big difference in the amount of general credibility i am granted while thin. When you are skinny, the things you say somehow have more value. People listen and take you seriously even though size has no impact on competence? It is like there is a sense that anyone who has enough discipline to stay thin clearly has ALL OF THE ANSWERS TO LIFE.\n\nThis is because-- in our society-- fatness is the absolute worst sin you can commit. If being fat is the worst thing you can do, that makes being thin the BEST thing you can do. \n\nI am not in recovery and this is not a coincidence",

I've seen you go weeks eating nothing but diet soda and then heard you have panic attacks and force vomiting all night when you didn't eat. I'd have to be fucking stupid to think you don't have an eating disorder when you eat more. You starve yourself and wind up ravenous. It'd be weird if you never ate some normal meals. I think you're just slowly getting better.\" \n\nFriend2 \"Actually I get more worried when you do eat in front of me cuz I'm f*kng scared you're gonna make yourself throw up later and I don't like the idea of your hurting yourself. I get really angry those nights worried I'm gonna get a call from the hospital that you burst your esophagus.\"\n\nFriend3 \"first of all. I have never seen you eat anything large enough to be considered a normal amount. The fact you think you've binged in front of me scares the living asscrap out of me and I wish I was there to hug you. Second. It doesn't matter to me how much you eat cuz I know you go through phases. When you eat more in front of me I get nervous cuz I know you're gonna stop eating completely soon. I never think you're fake or fixed. I'd say I'm concerned it can never be fixed.",
