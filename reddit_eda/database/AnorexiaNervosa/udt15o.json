  "selftext": "The amount of pressure and basically bullying I see people with anorexia nervosa get from for basically just being bony or posting their bodies in social medias is disgusting and I am part of it of those anorexics that deal with these. The only way to actually recover is for the person itself to agree with themselves that they have a problem and they should do something not people forcing you or bullying you for being anorexic. \n\nedit: I barely show my eating disorders struggles in the internet so sorry if this is unclear.",

I wish therapists and clinicians would focus more on the root causes behind the disorder, including harm reduction techniques and learning a healthier relationship with food, than forcing food intake and weight restoration. Yeah, there has to be a bare minimum so you don't die, but there's a middle ground between that and pumping you full of calories. You don't actually solve your issues or develop a healthy relationship with food that way. And that trauma is definitely part of the reason so many people with restrictive type EDs go on to develop orthorexia, ARFID, or binge type disorders.",
