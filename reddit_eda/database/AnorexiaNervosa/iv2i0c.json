Can I get that skinny? Am I really anorexic if I\u2019m not as skinny as her? And also, people suffering from anorexia look at those before photos and think they look good. We\u2019re not going to think you look healthier now or whatever, the anorexic mind is not a healthy mind. We\u2019re going to think you used to look great and now (that you\u2019re healthy and recovered) you look kind of chubby. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s right, I\u2019m saying that\u2019s how our minds work sometimes. I see those side by side pictures and I don\u2019t think wow she looks so healthy now, I think damn, I don\u2019t want to recover if it means I\u2019ll get like that. It\u2019s brutal, but that\u2019s how at least my anorexic mind works",

I've heard some people say that TWs don't work on people with EDs but that's not entirely true. Since I've been in recovery I definitely make an effort to avoid anything with a TW.

However, understand this: while we don't endourage or condone pro-ed behaviors, and do our best by removing rule 10 breaks, this isn't JUST a recovery subreddit for only those in recovery. We're a support subreddit for most everyone with this eating disorder or similar, and thus I feel that showing the stages of recovery are necessary for some people. \n\nI may implement a clause that says you have to post timeline posts as multiple photos, and with the fully recovered one first while making it OBVIOUS that that is you while recovered, and not a \"before ed\" photo. This way people can still have timeline photos but those that find them triggering have the choice between swiping through or not, and won't see it outright. \n\nWhile I understand that it may be harder not to swipe to the next picture, we try not to baby people on this subreddit. It should ultimately be your own choice and not everything remotely triggering should have to be taken away or completely censored. \n\nSorry if this makes no sense - I guess this is the prelude to the upcoming post.",
