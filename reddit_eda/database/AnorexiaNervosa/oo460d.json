  "selftext": "If the same doctors who want me to get help for my atypical anorexia nervosa are calling me fat and triggering me, why should I recover? I don\u2019t see the point. The doctors say that I am malnourished, have probable brain damage from the lack of nutrients, low blood pressure, and that I am just as severely ill as someone with typical anorexia nervosa, yet, they called me fat. Atypical anorexia nervosa is a cage.",

      "body": "Maybe it's because they think that with atypical anorexia it is okay because... It has 'atypical' in front of 'anorexia'. Maybe they are just insensible. \nEither way, they are horrible doctors if they say stuff like that. \n\nI have atypical AN too, and if I am honest, no one ever really told me what the exact difference is, in the clinic I went to they treated me no different from the other patients. \n\nWhat I can tell you: it doesn't matter what these doctors say. I think it is your decision what you do with your body; not theirs. They are only giving advice, and in a pretty bad way if I may say so. \nWhat matters is what you think. \nSo no, I am not saying you should not recover, because that's most probably not what you really want to live your life like. \nIt is the ED that makes people want to 'stay sick'. \n\nI'd recommend to you to try and recover from Ana. This does not necessarily involve weight gain. It's about coming to terms with food and your body. \n(It is still possible to lose weight in a healthy way afterwards if you feel the need to.) \n\nSo, why should you recover? To answer your question: You should recover for yourself, in order to be a happy, healthy person. Not because anyone forced you to. Recovery may be hard, but I believe it is worth the fight. It may have put you down, but even though the doctors were mean and super insensible, recovery is better than Anorexia. In the end, it's up to you what you will do with your life, and there's a lot of nice things in life to do. It's worth it if you really want to. \nStay strong, I believe in you. Hope you get better\u2764",

I\u2019m willing to admit that but, I am reluctant to recover because of the all of the horrible words and negativity in this hideously twisted world. I see so many ads on television on food and weight loss pills. I have had too many people make remarks on my size\u2014for all these reasons, I feel invalidated, I feel let down, I feel hurt, I feel like recovery would not work. I am a tall woman. I come from a long line of curvy women. I have a genetic condition that affects the muscle tone in my abdomen. Atypical anorexia nervosa is pretty much all I have known for myself mentally and medically since I was eleven years old. I\u2019m in my mid\u2014late twenties now. I have received no treatment that has worked. I was tube-fed once\u2014which was absolutely disastrous. Please understand, I\u2019m severely mentally ill\u2014that is why I consider my mind to be sick.",
