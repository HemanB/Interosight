  "selftext": "I\u2019m not sure if this is the appropriate forum, I apologize if not.\n\nI\u2019m 40 and my wife is 39. We\u2019ve been together since 2013 and married since 2018.\n\nShe\u2019s always been small, but it seems to have progressed recently. Multiple friends have expressed concerns about her well-being and it\u2019s made me more observant of her behaviors and increasingly concerned.\n\nHer mother just tells her she\u2019s \u201ctoo skinny\u201d and \u201cneeds to gain weight\u201d which obviously isn\u2019t helpful. \n\nFor those of you who are in recovery/got into treatment, how did family members/friends approach the topic with you initially?\n\nThanks and Love \n\n",

E.g. Purging, taking laxatives, over-exercising etc...)\n\nBinge Eating Disorder:\n- The person hides food\n- The person eats this food and purges it\n- The person eats food in secret \n(Binge Eating Disorder often goes hand in hand with bulimia)\n\nARFID (Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder):\n- The person avoids foods that aren't deemed as safe\n- The person seeks the same taste and texture in every bite\n- Often associated with Autism.\n- The person can be seriously underweight due to lack of nutrition.\n\nOrthorexia:\n- Focused entirely on health.\n- The same amount of exercise as calories\n- Only eating \"healthy\" food like fruit and veg\n- Stating that a certain food/food group is \"too unhealthy\" \n\nPlease offer comfort to your wife!
