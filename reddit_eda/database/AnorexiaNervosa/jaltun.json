  "selftext": "As I was peaking, I stared into the mirror for what felt like hours, my eyes tracing over every sharp curve of my body, every jut of my rib cage and my thin veins all too prominent against my pale skin. I saw how sickly I was, how little, how underweight. I cried. \nHow could I hate my body so much to ruin it? How could I let myself starve for so long? Why did I hate myself so much? \n\nI must've asked myself a million questions and all of them lead to the same answer; I loved to be in pain. Years of childhood trauma had led to my ED, years of restricting, purging and just treating my body like shit had led to this outcome. And I'm finally over hating myself. \n\nAfter my trip I've been eating consistently. Now I eat to feed myself. It's still difficult to eat but I like to think of it as I need to fuel my body and I take myself out of the equation. Your body is a simple vessel for your soul and both need to be nourished. Please eat something today <3",
