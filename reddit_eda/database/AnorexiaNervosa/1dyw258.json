I\u2019m really feeling the complications lately. Though, im still at the point where my brain works better when I\u2019m not eating but it\u2019s scary to think about the possible damage. \n\nThis is not meant to scare or shame anyone, I just wish I knew this went I still had the agency to fix it. My avocation is very cerebral so this really hits home. Anyway, hope this is food for thought for someone else too!",

I have Cerebellar Atrophy (this part of the brain controls balance and movement, the ability to swallow effectively, ability to speak, eye movement, etc.) due in part to my AN. This obviously isn't the same as the Cerebrum, but still horrible to deal with on a daily basis. It hasn't reversed, but I have been disordered for most of my life (since around the age of 5, and I am currently 30, I have had periods where I have been weight restored, but I struggle to stay there). From what I understand though, for most people weight restoration/eating reverses it.\n\nI hope you're able to recover one day. Take care.",

I have read about on here that others do, and, unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be one of those side effects that goes away. However, that depends on how long you have been on your meds as I've found it comes on soon after either starting to take them or after the dose gets up to a certain level or if any new meds are introduced. So it could be due to that. I've also been on antidepressants with the same effect. Only an MRI would confirm any loss of grey matter or increase of white matter so depending where you are and what your healthcare system is like and if you can ask for one, if you can and you are worried then it's worth talking to your specialist. The other thing that can cause brain fog is the perimenopause. Depending on your age. I think it's most common in your mid to late 40s. (I'm 47 and not quite there yet), but some women do start earlier, and some unfortunately do get early onset perimenopause in their 30s, although thats rare.

Gained more but doctors don't think it's gone. I recommend searching better info online, I try not to think about it currently. I don't have perfect info and know the related info is mentioned in the US very infrequently. In fact, I don't think it is an actual diagnosis here yet. Not positive. It can also apply to eating disorders beyond anorexia nervosa. \n\nBasically they resort to quality of life and methods like they use with people with suds, but they typically don't expect more than death in eating disorders, sadly (regarding harm reduction in specific types.
