  "selftext": "TW: mention of size/body dysmorphia\n\nToday was the day I have been dreading for months, praying for the lockdown to go on so I wouldn\u2019t have to go dress shopping. But today came anyways, and I\u2019m left with a feeling of both pride and absolute shame. \n\nMy best friend is getting married and I am one of 4 girls in the bridal party, and we are all very different shapes and sizes. We had 5 styles to choose from, and I got left with the spaghetti strap option. \n\nThere are no mirrors in the changing rooms so you have to go out in order to even see what it looks like. So I try on the dress in a sample size, the same size I wore to my sisters wedding last year, I walk out and realize it is about four sizes too big. Our consultant comes over and immediately clips me into it so it doesn\u2019t fall down and proceeds to measure me to find out what size I am....and it ended up being the smallest size they offer. \n\nI tried to joke about needing a bigger push up bra to fill out the dress, but I didn\u2019t feel the rush pride I once would have. Instead I am filled with feelings of shame and embarrassment. Ashamed that I let myself get to this point, embarrassed that I thought I could stop at any time, and now anorexia is controlling my life. \n\nI think I caught a glimpse of myself through someone else\u2019s eyes, just for a second, when I turned around I saw a woman in a child\u2019s body. I could see stares from other bridal parties, and whispers back and forth from mother to daughter. I have become the cautionary tale parents tell their children, \u201cyou don\u2019t want to end up like her\u201d.\n\nToday was the day I realized, I am way further down this rabbit hole than I ever thought.",

The hardship of today will pay off in the future if you remember what your own brain finally said today, even though no, none of us should feel shame or embarrassment. If I can tell you one thing, somehow someway try working on that shame, because it\u2019s not yours to carry. \n\nI hope you can still enjoy the wedding. At least you know you\u2019ll have your friends there, and I\u2019m 200% sure you look beautiful regardless \u2764\ufe0f strength is also beauty",

To be able to \"see\" myself clearly was really heartbreaking. \n\nI had my wedding dress made to measure, I was very open with my designer from the start, so she didn't finish the dress completely until just before the wedding. Also opted to go braless as boobs fluctuate way to much. \n\nSeeing you are stuck with the bridesmaid dress, look up \"huit 8\" bras, they do a push up which has removal air implants. These are great because when I'm not having relapse I just wear it without implants, it's less stressful than having sets of healthy bras and anna bras\n\nEdit: replied in wrong place sorry!",
