  "selftext": "I don\u2019t understand, I\u2019m still underweight, I workout almost every day and yet SOMEHOW my face looks like a chipmunk.\nMy cheeks are so fat I sometimes stand for HOURS in the mirror pulling my skin back and imagining how much better I looked before I recovered.\n\nMy jawline is non existent nowadays, my face blends into my neck and it honestly makes me physically sick to look at.\nI\u2019ve stopped showering, brushing my teeth/hair...\n\nI finally relapsed this week and lost a pretty large amount and I hate that I\u2019m actually pleased about it. It drives me INSANE how I see people who have recovered fully every day and they STILL HAVE THIN FACES!!!! UGHHH.\n\nI want to go back to how I used to look, I\u2019m looking into buccal fat removal surgery when I\u2019m 18 but it costs so so much, it would be so much easier and less expensive to just relapse completely.",

However, I want to point out that until you\u2019ve been weight restored for at least 6 months to a year, *you do not know how your healthy body will actually look when the weight redistributes*. When you first gain weight, it usually goes to your trunk/midsection and (you guessed it) your face. This is NOT necessarily permanent! Your body is in a state of flux. Weight redistribution is an honest-to-God real thing, and often you will look thinner at a higher weight after recovering than you looked at a lower weight while recovering. I know it sucks and is super uncomfortable...please try to be patient though.",

And now I'm about to be 25 in 2 months and my face has a more thin shape except when i smile and I'm about the highest I've ever been in weight in my life. The baby fat started to leave my face around the time i was 21-22 and if course i don't look like a model with the high cheek bones and all that but it definitely is less round than when i was in highschool despite me weighing more. It's ok! And a lot of people find it cute or tell me it makes me look younger. So i understand hating it but i wouldn't relapse over it. Your health comes first. And you may not mind the look later down the line :).",
