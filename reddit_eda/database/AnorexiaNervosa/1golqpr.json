  "selftext": "I hate this disorder so much. I lost this much hair in the shower after I brushed it and lost a lot right before as well. My hair has gotten so much thinner as I\u2019ve lost more weight but I\u2019m still not satisfied and am so terrified of gaining. I\u2019ve been trying to eat more healthy fats and keeping up my protein intake. In the meantime while I\u2019m still early on in recovery if anyone has some helpful tips that\u2019d be so appreciated. Also I\u2019m sorry I know the picture is gross but I really needed to vent about it. Seeing this amount made me cry because my thick curly hair used to be one of my favorite features. Now my hair is thin and so much flatter :(",
