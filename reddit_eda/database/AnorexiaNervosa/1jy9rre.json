  "selftext": "Exactly what the title says. I am not even underweight. I'm actually closer to being overweight than underweight and yet whene er I see a fat person I just shame them in my head.\n\nIf I am in a grocery store and a fat lady grabs any unhealthy my brain is like \"big back big back\". Or when I see a fat person sitting down I think to myself that they could use some standing up.\n\nMost of my family is fat. Today I was with my very overweight aunt and I was so annoyed by how fat she is and got so irritated because she walked so slowly. \n\nI used to feel so empathetic towards fat people when I was overweight. I am sad how cold and hateful I got towards others after developing an ED...\n\nI feel like if I were to tell this to anyone else they would think I am mean so I wonder if this feeling is common.",

I\u2019m over here feeling like my stomach is going to burst at any moment and honestly that can\u2019t be healthy, but I do think having curves and healthy fat isn\u2019t a bad thing!

I\u2019m trying \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb Also I think my PCOS/hypothyroidism are the reasons I gained weight and sometimes weight gain just happens to reasons unrelated to eating! Restriction is not the way to lose weight (for fat ppl who are suffering due to their size healthwise like me). Health at every size makes sense in theory, I just need to internalize it more \ud83d\ude0a",
