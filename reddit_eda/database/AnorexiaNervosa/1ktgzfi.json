  "selftext": "Why is it so normalized to hate on people with restrictive eating disorders? Daily i see people saying were annoying, were all fatphobic, we\u2019re privileged for choosing to starve ourselves, ive even seen someone say wanting to be underweight is pedophilic. Why are we seen as monsters who are all proana and hate everybody whos not underweight? Why is it normalized for people to make accounts simply to hate on us or to go into our safe spaces and shame us? People need to understand were not choosing a silly little diet going online calling ourselves \u201cbest ana\u201d. Were dying and everyones laughing at us for it.",

      "body": "I think most people simply don\u2019t know anyone with anorexia intimately enough to know what an ugly, damaging, and dangerous disease is actually is. They only see silly or dramatized versions of it in the media, or maybe even have a friend who is anorexic, but still don\u2019t see the daily struggles. The media usually only shows us  one very specific type of anorexic and it\u2019s easy to hate on people like that because who wants to feel sorry for pretty, acceptably thin, usually white, and middle to upper class young women.\n\nMy husband is a high school teacher. A couple months ago, one kid called another student a fat ass in class. My husband is pretty lenient with his students, but he stopped class to scold that kid about how harmful language like that is. He said he asked if anyone actually knew someone with an eating disorder because they are horrifying and only one person raised their hand and she looked like she was about to cry. I\u2019m not sure who she knows, but she obviously was familiar with how destructive the disease is based on her reaction. \n\nI think most of the people who know us well, those who live with us or see the shit we do to ourselves and how it affects not only us but the people we love, would never be so flippant about it. I know that even when I was fresh in my disorder, I still had a romanticized idea of anorexia as being mostly beautiful ballerinas or models with self-discipline; I would never had imagined that I\u2019d be 36 years old one day with my hair thinning, fighting with my husband about whether I lied about dinner or why I was too tired to go ride bikes with my son, hiding my sketchy ass gray market GLP agonists from everyone, or literally almost killing myself because I refused to eat in the triple digits even as my poor body was trying to repair itself after chemotherapy and radiation. \n\nTL;DR - It\u2019s extremely difficult to find any accurate representations of anorexia because anorexics are so good at hiding themselves and lying to everyone, including ourselves, becomes second nature.",

I definitely did fucked up stuff that I really regret when I had anorexia - I take accountability for my behaviour and know the responsibility ultimately falls on me, but I do also think that anorexia encourages you to prioritise yourself over others (or, to put it another way, to prioritise not eating). A memorable incident for me is ruining my friend's eighteenth birthday because I refused to eat. I was trying to be sneaky about not eating but it was incredibly noticable and ruined what should have been a really good party for her. I still think about that day sometimes. I was never intentionally mean or nasty to others, but just stuff like that still caused people pain. Since I had anorexia, it wasn't like I could 'just eat', and I wasn't trying to bring attention to the fact that I wasn't eating. However, it still ruined what should have been a good day for her. \n\n  \nI'm not saying it's good to shit on us, and i don't think it's fair, but I do also think that ED can cause people to do some shitty stuff, and it's important to acknowledge it.",
