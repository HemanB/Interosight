Yet the fear of weight gain and doing anything to not gain weight is pretty universal between both fitness and non fitness anorexics. Huge difference between burning off calories to lose weight from a meal of greens or fruits to avoid weight gain (athletica/anorexia)  vs burning off a high calorie meal full of protein, carbs and fiber  (healthy exercise and conscious eating). The reason they\u2019re separate and maybe I just had a shitty doctor, is mainly because of BMI and seemingly lack of deficiencies. I was toned, had no underlying physical health problems and pretty fit. He basically told me it was all in my head and that I need to form a healthy relationship with exercise, patted me on the back and sent me out of his office. People forget that anorexia is mainly psychological. The physical outcomes is the result of the psychological chaos.",
