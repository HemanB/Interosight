  "selftext": "I dont know why but i literally feel extremely sad when people around me start losing weight. I start envying them. i deep down wish that they gain all that weight back plus some more. i know i'm being very negative and i shouldnt feel this way, but even if i try to not think like this, i cannot help it. Recently i met two of my distant relatives after a year or two and they looked so much thinner. It triggered me and i dont know why i want them to get fat again. i seriously think i'm messed up in the head and i feel like shit right now. What should i do about it?",

      "body": "Eating disorders are extremely competitive, I believe you found out the reason why you hate other people losing weight: it's the ed comparing you to them and making you feel terrible. \n\nYou cannot control your immediate feelings towards something, I'd recommend just reminding yourself that it's the ed voice speaking and not yours, and that you never know what other people are going through that's causing their body to change. You are your own person and the changes others experience do not determine anything about you, not your worth, nor health, nor your beauty, and neither the depth of your struggles, nothing.\n\nDon't beat yourself too hard about this, I one hundred percent think it's the illness messing with you and not your own values making you feel like this. As long as you don't act with some kind of revenge or spite towards them, you are doing great. Thoughts when you have a mental illness, more often than not, do not represent your real beliefs.\n\nI hope you can find peace with these thoughts, take a deep breath and just accept that they are there but they are not you. In my experience, these kind go away gradually when you realize it's not you thinking them and let them go away without acting on them or giving them too much power (sometimes they might come back, but just repeat the process: breathe, accept, and don't act).\n\nHave a good day, you deserve it!",
