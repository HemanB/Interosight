  "selftext": "Lmao when I was 16 I would make eggs  in the morning before work but I would fuck them up and burn them 5 out of 7 times, even on low heat. I was raised evangelical and was convinced this was God telling me I\u2019m a bad person and don\u2019t deserve to eat, so I wouldn\u2019t pack lunch on those days either. \n\n\nNow I\u2019m 24 and back at my parents\u2019 house for the first time in 8 years. I cooked eggs and burned them yesterday. My mom told me I can\u2019t cook things on that part of the stove because that particular burner is bad. \n\n\n\nMy eating disorder began because one of my stove burners doesn\u2019t \u201cdo\u201d low heat. Can you freaking believe it.",
