  "selftext": "I apologise if this is the wrong sub but I'm not sure where else I could ask for advice.\n\nShe barely eats anymore and tonight I cooked dinner and got her to sit down and eat with us. She even ate a couple of shrimp while talking to me in the kitchen. I felt so fucking happy that she was feeling good, and that she was eating.\n\nMy two brothers and my little sister went to eat in the living room while I stayed in the kitchen to set some food aside for my dad, my brother apperantly threatened one of our pups because \"she tried to take food from the cat\". This is bullshit, because that dog never does things like that and my little sister later confirmed what I thought. When my little sister angrily told him to stop talking to the dogs like that he snapped and told her to, \"Go back to pigging out\".\n\nI went to my siblings to see if this was a good meal, and if it's worth making again, to see my little sister not in there and her plate on the table, with some of the food flung off as if she threw it down and ran.\n\nI went to our room with her food to ask what happened and she told me. I tried to give her the plate but she refused and told me she didn't want to eat anymore. I said that I knew she didn't eat anything today, and that the meal wasn't super unhealthy. She still refused. I started to tear up and I told her how much I worry about her. I told her that if she just ate the food I would go outside and jump on the trampoline a little bit, knowing she loves it when I'm outside with her and that she wouldn't be able to burn off all the calories from 30 minutes of activity. \n\nShe took a bite of shrimp and angrily said she was fine. I don't know what to do. My dad wouldn't listen, because he doesn't care. I'm lost and I'm worried about how to help her myself. I can't lose her. She feels like my own kid, in a way. I love her with everything in my being and she's honestly the only reason I'm here.\n\nIf anyone has any advice that would be great.\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for the great advice. I've decided to make healthier meals so she won't feel as much guilt eating. I've started doing relaxed exercise with her, and I'm trying to help her lose weight in a healthy way while also trying to show her she doesn't have to stop eating entirely. Every single one of you are wonderful for taking the time to read this, and for taking the time to give me advice. My heart goes out to all of you.",

If there is some way to make it clear that\u2019s really hurtful without outing her and potentially making her more of a target I would try it. \n\nIs there a parent aware of what\u2019s going on? Does your sister realize the issue? Can the two of you eat meals together that are outside of time\u2019s that she may be antagonized less?",

You sound like a really lovely older sister, and I can see that all you want is the best of your sister. You could perhaps talk to your sister about everything going on, and offer her a safe space to talk through her issues. I don\u2019t know how old she is but it could be a good idea if she was in a position to if you say down together and agreed on some meals you could make for her and yourself and sit and eat them together away from the rest of the family? \n\nSorry if none of those suggestions are any help, but honestly my heart does go out to you both, I would give both of you a massive hug if I could, stay strong. I wish you both all the best and I hope that one day soon your sister will be able to take the first steps on what will hopefully be a difficult, but rewarding recovery process.

I developed a severe eating disorder that has almost killed me multiple times. The only suggestions I have is to keep being supportive and stick up for her. Maybe find out what foods she feels comfortable eating and try to keep those around, ask her if she wants a snack when the other family members aren\u2019t eating. Early intervention is key to recovery. The longer you go without getting help the harder it gets. Unfortunately eating disorders are very powerful, you can\u2019t make someone change. They have to want to.",

Having food on our mind all the time is exhausting and eating something can produce guilty feelings or so. Being called on like that openly in such a negative way must have been brutal for her. It\u2019s like a reminder saying \u2018see what happens when you eat\u2019. She could have been feeling very negative about herself having those words repeating in her head over again. Just a suggestion but find out what her safe foods are and start there maybe. Safe foods are like good we feel okay to eat. Mostly it\u2019s something healthy or so. Don\u2019t try to force her to eat something she doesn\u2019t want cause it may lead to her feeling more guilty. Start small and work your way from there to help her. Since the goal is to lose weight maybe you can help her understand and do it in a healthier way. I hope this helps!",

She went through the same \"gain lots of weight in a short time as a child\" thing. And our little brother loves to comment on our eating habits, and brings up triggering topics out of nowhere too. He also eats a lot and says stuff like \"yeah, i can eat a lot and not gain weight, not like you two\"\nSo i can completely understand your situation, and i hope that your bond with your sister stay strong, and you'll stay there for each other \u2764\ufe0f",

I wish I had a sibling like you, what you are doing for your sister is incredible and even though she might not show it all the time, having you as her support probably helps her a lot. A few months ago I went a week without eating anything, was a constantly passing out and felt horrible, and I decided to make food for myself which took a lot of courage. I ate one serving of spaghetti and I was so proud of myself that I went to get a second serving. My mom (doesn\u2019t know about my ed) walked in the kitchen and started screaming at me for being such a glutton. Yeah, a glutton. Because I ate for the first time all week. It absolute broke me down when I was trying to recover and I\u2019ve been struggling so much since. The rude comments never stop. One time I was putting beans in a bowl for part of my meal I was making and my mom screamed at me for being selfish and eating too much and she took my bowl (while I was eating) and she threw it in a big pan for the whole family. I only had a serving size and she still took it and added a bunch of crap to it so I just ended up skipping supper. I honestly don\u2019t know how to even recover again. But you being there for your sister is the best thing you can do for her even if she\u2019s having a hard time. I have no one to support me at home and it\u2019s so hard.",
