      "body": "I'm so sorry to hear that :( I can relate. Last Christmas, my mother bought a bunch of used clothes in size child large, child xl, and adult s. She then got irritated when not all of the clothes fit me. Every day multiple times a day she kept saying, \"I can't believe it all didn't fit! Are you sure?? I spent $30 on it all and most of it is going to waste!\"\n\nI was about ready to give her $30 to stop talking about it. Thanks for shaming me, a grown ass woman, for not fitting into CHILD SIZED CLOTHES. I was so mad. And she knows I have eating issues. I think she meant well, but come on. She even went through all the clothes to fold them. Did she not notice the youth sizes?! Families just don't get it.",

I am completely broke too so a fag diet has been working for me but breaking out of these old habits man. \n\nTips: stress is terrible for weight loss, you plateau faster and it only triggers you more. \n\nCW105/48(?)GW0-currently SOS (scared of scale)",
