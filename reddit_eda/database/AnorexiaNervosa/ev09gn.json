For most people, these kind of comments only make things worse. I may get downvoted for this, but I think that this exact comment I'm replying to is disgusting. You do not get to assume someone is \"pro-ana\" because of their username and that you can't handle the fact that they, along with me strongly disagree with the point of view you are pushing. It is especially out of line to say that wannabe needs to get out of your face, when they never were. I can't say the same about you. \"Sweety\" \n\nJust thought ide let you know you spelled it like I'm sweaty from the gym... lol",
