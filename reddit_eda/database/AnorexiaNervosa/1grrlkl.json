  "selftext": "I\u2019m fucking tired.\n\n\n\nI will never starve myself again. There\u2019s no point. I\u2019ve wasted years of my life attempting to be anorexic again. What\u2019s the point? To waste my muscles away? To become emaciated? To be SMALL? Who fucking cares?\n\n\n\nMy mother and father instilled into me that I must be as frail as possible, otherwise I\u2019ll never find a \u201cgood man.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\nYeah, right. When I was sick, I\u2019ve only ever been abused by sick, disgusting excuses of men.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNow, I do have someone who loves me. And he loves me for who I am now. My personality. My thoughts, my fucking thoughts. I am known to be stubborn and loud. I have opinions. And he listens to me. He listens, instead of telling me to just quiet down and smile.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll never starve myself again. From this point forward, I\u2019m going to the gym and building back what was taken from me through my illness. I deserve a life. I\u2019m 22. I\u2019m not letting my youth slip through my fingers. I have real life goals. I want to be an actress. How am I honest to god supposed to achieve that when I\u2019m hiding away in my apartment every day, ashamed from my binges, purges, vomit stench, and faintness from laxative abuse?\n\n\n\nI swear to myself, I deserve life. I deserve to love myself. Surely I\u2019m worth love if I was raised by parents who hated me, who don\u2019t love me, and someone can still look at me and treat me like I am his whole entire world. Not that I need a man to prove any of this to me. But I see now. And I\u2019m just fucking tired.\u00a0",
