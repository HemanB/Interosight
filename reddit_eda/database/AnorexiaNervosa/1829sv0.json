I know I\u2019m supposed to nourish my body and enjoy food, but the amount of emotional distress I feel is insurmountable. I eat one thing and I fucking lose it. And I\u2019m trying to cope the best way I can but it\u2019s hard. Why does food torture me so much? I just want to be free. But I\u2019m also afraid to be free. I\u2019m sobbing in my room because I can\u2019t deal with it.",

I went to the Renfrew in Radnor PA.\n\nI thought they talked too much, made too many PowerPoints and handed out too many worksheets. There were not enough arts and crafts, which I found the most helpful. I got bored a lot, but the staff I worked with were very kind and easy to talk to. \n\nI personally think having a good experience at any facility like this heavily depends on the staff. Usually, you can't talk about personal stuff with the other patients. You can only vent privately to staff members, and if they aren't experienced or don't care you will have a bad time. \n\nRenfrew doesn't stand out to me much, but I think their system is beneficial. The staff knows what they are doing. The inpatient and outpatient didn't sound much different from what I heard from other clients. \n \nMy favorite inpatient was Clementine Briarcliff Manor in NY out of the three different inpatients I've been in. (I've been to a lot of psych wards too, but they are all horrible). \n\nI really hope this helps, I'm sorry I couldn't respond very quickly...",

I can\u2019t stand it, I don\u2019t like our dynamic BUT TBH, she (as she\u2019s told me in the past and is fully aware of) is prettier, is a better teacher, better with people, gave my parents grandkids, waited til she was older to have sex, etc. (so basically the perfect daughter) and I will be damned if on top of all this, she has a better body than me. I\u2019m still struggling but I was always smaller, that\u2019s the one damn thing I have.\n\nSorry for rambling. I\u2019m going to look out for my brothers gf from now on. Good call!",

I\u2019d be thinking \u201cgirl you do you and leave me be.\u201d It isn\u2019t helpful that your sister is in competition with you too when, as you said, she has a lot going on for herself anyway. I guess take it as a compliment even when people don\u2019t frame it as one. Life and people can be annoying sometimes \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude05",

I\u2019ve been told I\u2019m really oblivious and I am about a lot of things but\u2026 that\u2019s because I get ultra focused on things that (I assume) other people aren\u2019t noticing/thinking about.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t have even gone back and analyzed what has been happening, if you hadn\u2019t responded. You\u2019ve really opened my eyes and I thank you. \n\nI actually mentioned to my mom (who has anorexia) that I think my sister is trying to fatten us up (she bought us peanut brittle yesterday) and my mom thought about it and said\u2026 \u201cyou might be on to something. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s doing it consciously though\u201d.\n\nI don\u2019t know that she\u2019s doing it consciously. There\u2019s no way to know although I think she is. It was just nice that my mom validated my concerns a bit. And you\u2019ve made me feel validated to. \n\nI wish I knew you in person!",
