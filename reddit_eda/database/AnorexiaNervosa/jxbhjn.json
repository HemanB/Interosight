  "selftext": "I have gotten past the point of hungry to where I don\u2019t want to eat anything because it will make my stomach hurt/digestive system uncomfortable so I actually don\u2019t enjoy eating food anymore. Like it almost grosses me out. But at the same i find myself becoming food obsessed, looking at pics of carb-filled foods and dessert. What does this even mean and does this happen to anyone else?",

No matter how your stomach feels your body knows it needs food so it fixates on food so you\u2019ll eat. \nGrossly over simplified but that\u2019s why it\u2019s happening. You\u2019re hungry but your ques are messed up from Ana. \n\nIf it hurts/makes you sick to eat you need to start with broth or easy to digest food. Look up refeeding for more info BUT PLEASE go see a doctor or call one for advice.",

Admittedly, its a lot better than it was but the whole looking at food and recipes thing is still there and is extremely common for people with eating disorders. When I was sick(er), I would also obsess over what friends ate for breakfast/lunch/dinner, and try to subtly ask them about what they usually ate, how often they ate, anything about their eating habits. If food was on tv at all, even if it wasn't relevant to the show, or an ad about a car or something but someone happened to be eating in it.. i would just get tunnel vision on the food and think about every detail surrounding why they chose that food and how the actor ate it and what they thought bout eating it etc. It was exhausting. Made me feel even more greedy/fat etc but it was the STARVATION thoughts. You can only really look back and see just how bad it was once you get better :(",
