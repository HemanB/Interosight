  "selftext": "Before i begin, the title seems like i\u2019m a lazy piece of shit, but sometimes I can\u2019t even find the energy to get out of bed in morning nonetheless work out. I know majority of this community works out a lot but I\u2019m just too out of shape and it makes me dizzy to do it. So, I just stay in bed and don\u2019t eat. Yes, if i worked out i know in the back of my mind I would lose weight faster and that\u2019s the goal, but I can\u2019t find it in me to work out. But does anyone else do this or just me lol",
