She seems unaware of the monster looming over her as she is looking outward and not towards it, so she is in a state of blissful ignorance not knowing that the monster is there, and has always been there. The monster is tall and big, but thin, which illustrates to me the overwhelming weight and all consuming feeling of anorexia. Even though the monster does not take up a lot of space, it is entirely engulfing her and it seems like she isn\u2019t even aware that it\u2019s there and that she won\u2019t be until it closes in on her completely. \n\nJust my take",
