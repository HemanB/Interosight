  "selftext": "I had pretty severe ana for several years in my teens. I was hospitalized twice and had horrible experiences. Through hard work and a lot of relapsing I have been on a pretty decent path for several years. Obviously the feelings never went away but the restricting got much better to the point I gained a significant amount of weight. The other day I found out my husband had been using illegal steroids behind my back so we had a conversation about what led him to keep this from me, what feelings he was feeling, etc. he proceeded to bring up how much we have changed. How we have gotten older and our bodies are changing. He then mentions that I have gained weight and look different than when he met me. This is something I am obviously aware of but hearing it out loud was so emotionally devastating for me I didn\u2019t know what to even think. And for the first time in years, I am restricting again. And all the work I put in feels like nothing at all. My husband works out of state for months at a time and my brain is telling me how wonderful things will be now that I am restricting and am truly alone to do what I want. I don\u2019t even know what to do at this point. It\u2019s like every ounce of everything I put into trying to be okay is just disappearing right in front of me and the worst part is I am happier to be back to doing this than I have felt in awhile. And if a honest conversation where my husband acknowledges something I have known all along could cause me to break so easily then who was I kidding these past few years? Was I ever really in a better place at all? Idk. That\u2019s my rant for today. ",

It\u2019s not okay for him to project his insecurities onto you. I am so sorry OP, bodies are supposed to change and look different over time (even if some of us with ed\u2019s wish they didn\u2019t). He probably looks different now than when you first met, and I\u2019m sure you love him all the same! I\u2019m so frustrated that he tried to use you as an excuse to use steroids, that\u2019s awful.

Even without an ED history that\u2019s a horrible thing to do. Honestly OP, if it were me this might be a deal breaker. I don\u2019t know the history between you two, I\u2019m sure you could talk it out if you wanted to, but someone who is supposed to love me speaking to me like that is not something I think I could get over. I know it\u2019s hard, but you don\u2019t deserve to get punished for his assholery. Try to keep eating, you\u2019re doing so well and you should be so proud. It\u2019s so hard. One setback does not negate the years and energy you put into your healing. Nobody is immune to triggers, it\u2019s how we respond to them. Sending you hugs\ud83e\ude77",

      "body": "I hear you and I totally get where you're coming from. I know how devastating it can be when a comment hits that sensitive spot we all have about our bodies and weight. First off, I want you to know that your feelings are valid and understandable. What your husband said was tough to hear, especially given your history.\n\nBut here's the thing - all that hard work you put in over the years? It's not gone!! Recovery isn't a straight line, and this bump in the road doesn't erase all the progress you've made. I know it might feel like you're back at square one, but you're not. You've got skills and strength you didn't have before, even if they feel out of reach right now.\n\nI'm worried about you falling back into restriction, though. I get that it feels good in the moment - that sense of control can be so seductive. But we both know where that road leads, and it's not somewhere you want to go again. Your health and well-being are worth so much more than any number on a scale.\n\nI think it might be really helpful to talk to someone about this - maybe a therapist or counselor who gets ED stuff. And as hard as it might be, maybe think about opening up to your husband about how his words affected you. He might not realize the impact they had.\n\nYou're not alone in this. Please please reach out for support, whether it's to professionals, support groups, or even just friends who understand. You've fought hard to get where you are, and you've got the strength to keep fighting. Sending you all the support and good vibes <3",

      "body": "Oh boo to him for saying that. There are excuses that can be made like he wasn't thinking about your Ana, but every guy knows not to say something about a woman's weight. If he is taking steroids it could also be affecting his mood, etc. Even if it was an honest conversation, he's justifying doing things behind your back instead of telling you up front. And being triggered happens, don't beat yourself up. Maybe take some time to think, reflect, ensure that he isn't still using drugs- because please think of using steroids on the same level as doing other drugs, it's the same or worse in some cases - and talk to him again. Tell him that you have been relapsing and feeling bad lately. You don't even have to tell him why if you don't want to, honestly if you say why he might utilize that as an excuse not to be open with you in the future. \n\n I'm really sorry, sweetie. You didn't deserve that. My loved one telling me I put on weight would hurt so bad.",
