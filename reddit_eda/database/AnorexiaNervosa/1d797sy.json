  "selftext": "i never felt more like myself than when i was underweight, hospitalized, on a restraining bed and on 1:1. I miss being called gross, skelly, disgusting.\nI miss not being able to do anything, not being able to go to school, to go outside, just laying in bed all day. I miss when the only thing that was expected from me was to eat once a day, that was a \u201ca feat\u201d to my mum, now she expects me to go to school, get a job, get my drivers license, make friends, help her in the house, pass my classes, eat 5 times a day, etc. I miss feeling all my bones poking out. I miss seeing the low number on the scale and watching it go lower and lower each day. I miss being sick. I miss being underweight.",

I reiterated several times at the hospital when asked to describe my motives that I am desperate to be frozen in a helpless girlhood, to the point that they were curious about my attachment to the phrasing itself",
