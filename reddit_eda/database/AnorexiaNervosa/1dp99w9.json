  "selftext": "Do you guys feel like you\u2019re doing something illegal when u check the nutrition facts on food items while shopping or is it just me? \nI feel kind of embarassed and it\u2019s like everybody knows I have an ED when I do that. Especially when I stand in an isle for too long and compare several similar items to choose the one with the least ammount of cals\u2026it could be pickles or ketchups or whatever.\nAnd I also feel sooo judged when I only shop low cal items. It literally feels like im exposing myself to the cashier with my diet coke, zero sugar gums, cucumbers, mushrooms and zucchinis \ud83d\ude29",
