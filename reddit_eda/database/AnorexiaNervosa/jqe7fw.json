I\u2019m extremely underweight, and still feel like I\u2019m not underweight enough for recovery.\nRemember this, you are worthy for recovery, at any point. You\u2019ll always feel like you aren\u2019t, but believe me you are. Don\u2019t make it worse, you won\u2019t feel better.\nI fainted for the first time today and after hitting my head had hallucinations and blood was coming out.\nLet someone help you, please.",
