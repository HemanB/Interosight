  "selftext": "So today my cousin made lasagna and I only ate the piece she put on my plate. She looked at me and I know she assumed I didn\u2019t like it- which couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. It was the best lasagna ever and I could eat 6 more pieces but I just can\u2019t deal with the ED voice. It\u2019s easier to please it than to fight it.\n\nI was about to tell myself \u201cjust one more piece won\u2019t hurt\u201d and I SWEAR I heard a voice telling me \u201cno- you can\u2019t give up now you\u2019re doing so good. Just a few more kilos and this will be done. Just do it my way\u201d \n\nSo now I\u2019m hearing things. The eating disorder talks to me- I feel like such a freak saying this- but it gives me boxes to check and it says it will be done with me and I\u2019ll get my freedom (kind of like Meg in Hercules haha). I\u2019ve reached every unhealthy goal post but a deathly bmi and it\u2019s trying to get me there and I swear if I could get there right now just to be done with it I would. I wish everyday my family would stop forcing me to eat so this anorexia could just kill me already- like I said it\u2019s easier to listen than to fight it. It\u2019s taken so much from me already and the only thing that makes me stay is that I can\u2019t give up when I\u2019ve put so much blood sweat and tears.\n\nI just really really need someone to talk to, someone who gets it (hence me going to my favorite people on reddit hehe)",

      "body": "The first step was hospitalization. I honestly didn\u2019t think I could stop listening to the voice until I was hospitalized and nourished/ stabilized enough to think straight. I realized that my brain was just stuck in a crazy illogical survival mode that could only submit to the voice. Yes, I still had the voice (very intensely) but I could reason with myself. \n\nAnother big reason was someone I met in hospitalization. I was 17 during my time there, so I was put on the pediatric eating disorder floor. About halfway through my stay a 10 year old was admitted and she was so sick but still so brave. She was the one that helped me realize that the eating disorder wasn\u2019t me, actually. She did this by giving everyone a tip during group. She said \u201cI call my eating disorder a boy so it can be just one step farther away from being me\u2026So I remember it\u2019s not me.\u201d She was struggling so much, yet she was still so hopeful. I saw my younger self in her. I remembered when I was her age and doing the same thing. Neither of us deserved such cruel punishment. We never did anything truly wrong. Living and breathing and making mistakes is nothing to be tortured over. \n\nAfter hospitalization you\u2019re on your own. Even if you have family or friends supporting you it\u2019s still all up to you. You HAVE to do it. Any way you can. Drink meal supplements for every meal if you must. (And work your way up to solids) Have someone else make your food. Only order from restaurants so you don\u2019t know what\u2019s in the food. Get snacks that you\u2019re comfy with and other snacks to challenge yourself. At the end of the day you must get weight back (if you\u2019re underweight) on and you MUST eat way more than you\u2019re used to. \n\nAnother helpful thing was the long term online eating disorder program I was in. Online was very helpful b/c I lived very far from any inpatient rehabilitation. My specific one was called Equip. They give you a dietician, a doctor (for meds + vitals), a psychiatrist (for meds), and a therapist. They help you through every step and are FBT oriented. Even though I lived with my ex-girlfriend and her family they still worked w/ them to tell them how to better support me and treated them as my family. There are many other online programs, with different methods and lifestyles. If you need help finding one I can help you here in this comment section. \n\nLife isn\u2019t worth living with anorexia. The struggle to get through your eating disorder is so worth it because you get back your life. Anorexia has the highest death toll of any mental illness. If you don\u2019t fight it, it will eventually take you. There is no other possible outcome. Please remember that you can do hard things. Recovery is HARD! \n\n(Btw, hospitalization is not only for people that are underweight or severely underweight. It\u2019s for people w/ compromised vitals from malnutrition. I met many people in my unit that weren\u2019t underweight and looked \u201chealthy\u201d from the outside. Please consider hospitalization and talk to your doctor about if you\u2019re eligible. If not, there are many houses and programs that are helpful.)",

Before the realization I thought myself to be \u201can anorexic.\u201d That name made me forget that I didn\u2019t want that for myself. My body didn\u2019t want that for me. It seems like you\u2019ve mostly discerned that, and for that I\u2019m proud of you. \n\nThe ED voice is vile. It\u2019ll make you trudge endlessly into treacherous solitude and leaves you there to die. The reason you NEED to stop listening to it is because of the \u201cblood, sweat, and tears\u201d you\u2019ve put in! Anorexia has NOTHING for you! There\u2019s nothing! And you still feel like you can\u2019t stop! \n\nThe starvation stunts your brain and lets the illness fester and radiate through your whole body. Stealing away your life,, a disease. \n\nThe voice is abusive. You are not your ED. I know it\u2019s so hard to go against. The shame that surfaces when you go against it is immeasurable. It\u2019s extremely frustrating and I\u2019m so sorry that you\u2019re dealing with it. I hope things start looking better for you. The only way out is through.",
