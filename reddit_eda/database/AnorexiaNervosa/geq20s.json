I always clean it and put it away after using it.\nWell, today I found it used and left out covered in this weird sticky orange sauce and I pretty much had a mini mental breakdown over it.\nI know it's ridiculous... But I still can't stop thinking about it even after scrubbing it clean. All my safe foods that I usually eat out of it seem tainted now. \nDoes anyone else get this kind of thing? Wtf is wrong with my brain",
