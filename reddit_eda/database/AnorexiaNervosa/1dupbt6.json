  "selftext": "Been having a rough year, even if we\u2019ve been through just 6 months by now. I rapidly lost weight and it has been a struggle, but today my loved ones have been caring for me and my well being, and have gifted me lots of stuff. Including food.\n\nI am so happy to have them to support me through all these weeks, for checking out if I\u2019ve eaten or drank something already, and well I really want to get better. So cheers to me, I will be eating a slice of my Dairy Queen birthday cake with no regrets!!",
