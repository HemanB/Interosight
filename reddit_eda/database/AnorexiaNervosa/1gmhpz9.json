My routine and eating was still god awful and very disordered but I had to eat because I was doing more and needed the energy. I had to focus on other things so I couldn't spend all day absorbed in ED thoughts either. \n\nI left my last job 2.5 years ago and everything just got so much worse. This is the worst my ED has ever been and I've gone down to my LW ever, ended up under the care of an ED team and almost been hospitalised twice. Every now and then I think I should try get a job but I honestly have no idea how I'd manage that. I have no energy, I'm exhausted all the time, I can't think, focus or concentrate, my memory is terrible, I'm in constant pain just from sitting down, my legs feel like they're going to give out from under me just from going up one flight of stairs! I'm trying to recover and atm that means trying to stick to a more structured eating routine but I'm still only able to have foods that feel 'safe' to me so it has to be the same things at the same times everyday - I don't know how I'd fit that around working either. Eating always leaves me feeling really uncomfortable and full for ages afterwards so I need to curl up with a hot water bottle on my abdomen, which might also be awkward or impossible to do at work! \n\nI have no idea how people manage to hold down jobs or normal lives with this disorder or how people manage to incorporate recovery into that.",

I'm medically signed off work and on benefits, but I'm an able-bodied 24 year old woman who lives with her mum and I feel insanely guilty every single day. yet, I have no job so have no sense of purpose and that is the feeling the ED feeds off",

I\u2019m a PhD student and I can\u2019t stop my program, but I\u2019m sick of working on my PhD (and job) from ERs, hospital rooms, and treatment centers. \n\nThe only thing that keeps me eating \u201cenough\u201d to get through my workday without completely crashing out and getting fired/dismissed from my PhD program is that I am a single mother of a little boy. I don\u2019t get child support and have no family nearby and also not really any friends nearby. This child has depended on me since day one financially, emotionally, etc. I work myself nearly to death every semester, which is not a good situation but it\u2019s not like I get FMLA, but I HAVE to for my son. If I dont meet certain requirements for work/education I don\u2019t get paid and don\u2019t receive benefits/assistance for childcare, food, and insurance for him. If I\u2019m so ill that I\u2019m barely lucid that means I can\u2019t attend my WIC meetings to make sure he gets extra food at no cost and then be able to grade papers. I have to wake up at the ass crack of dawn and immediately launch myself into childcare, then pivot to work, then to be completely honest my body gives out and I just have to lay down for a few hours every day. I do a lot of work from home, in bed, from my phone or ipad. The graduate school has DEFINITELY threatened to kick my ass out/end my assistantship if I am \u201ctoo ill to meet the standards and requirements of an assistantship\u201d which means immediate loss of income and immediate loss of assistance/benefits. What would happen to my little boy? \n\nAll of this is to say Im getting through work 1) because I have a two year old depending on me for everything and 2) not well. I feel like I\u2019m dying every day. I\u2019ve had several NG tubes as an outpatient because I literally cannot lose my job and don\u2019t have other options besides \u201cgo to hospital and get tube, enter refeeding period, do NG feeds to stabilize\u201d all the while teaching and trying to teach my kid shapes and numbers and shit. Do not beat yourself up. This shit sucks so bad. Be more gentle with yourself. I don\u2019t know how any of us do anything suffering from a disorder that is mental hell and physically killing us. I\u2019m living my life technically and I\u2019m doing my best to actually stay living but my potential and seemingly impending death has been discussed at length multiple times in the last two years, even so far as me having discussions with my team and my family about who would raise my son if I passed. I want to be alive and healthy for him so I fight, but I am mentally and physically barely surviving sometimes. \n\nA quick note in case anyone decides to be not very nice: I worked my ass off to have a healthy pregnancy and my weight/anorexia was stable for a bit postpartum. It was almost like not having an eating disorder at all. I was just happy at home with my sweet little baby and eating to make sure my breast milk was sufficient for him. I suffered a severe and unrelenting relapse when I had to go back to work and got sexually assaulted. I have not been the same since.",

Every now and then I think I should try get a job but I honestly have no idea how I'd manage that. I have no energy, I'm exhausted all the time, I can't think, focus or concentrate, my memory is terrible, I'm in constant pain just from sitting down, my legs feel like they're going to give out from under me just from going up one flight of stairs! I'm trying to recover and atm that means trying to stick to a more structured eating routine but I'm still only able to have foods that feel 'safe' to me so it has to be the same things at the same times everyday - I don't know how I'd fit that around working either. Eating always leaves me feeling really uncomfortable and full for ages afterwards so I need to curl up with a hot water bottle on my abdomen, which might also be awkward or impossible to do at work! \n\nI have no idea how people manage to hold down jobs or normal lives with this disorder or how people manage to incorporate recovery into that.",

For me, since I live with family and I'm on social assistance and I don't eat much so I don't have to spend much money on groceries, I'm not really worried about having a job. Plus, my future goal is to be a stay at home parent, so it's not really necessary in order to achieve my dreams. But my very toxic family member that I live with is always pressuring me to get a job even though I'm not in a state where I could handle it. And calls me lazy when I tell him I'm not interested in the job programs he recommends to me.",
