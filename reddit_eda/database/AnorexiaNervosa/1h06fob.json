  "selftext": "Im genuinely curious and feel alone on this because i noticed most people always say theirs is because they need control in their lives or its a coping mechanism etc. I think mine started because i was scared to gain weight after i went on this weight loss journey. I lost the weight healthily (and it was A LOT OF WEIGHT) but a lot of the compliments from coworkers, my dance friends, family i guess got to me? Now im scared to get fat and ugly again and losing weight just feels safer for me now. The goal weight just keeps getting lower. Idk\u2026 i hope at least one person relates to me in this community so i dont feel so alone. \ud83e\udd72",

Being perceived as fat, or putting on weight is punished either very explicitly, or we see others punished for it or people withdraw their reinforcement.\n\nThis is basic behavioural psychology here. What\u2019s rewarded is repeated!!\n\nBut eating is a basic bodily need, so all this introduces a helluva lot of conflict into our lives.\n\nThen add the addictive nature of restricting, the high from running on adrenaline, and the sense of control it can give us over our lives, any autism or adhd with those tendencies, sensory difficulties\u2026 \n\nIt\u2019s no wonder so many people end up struggling.",
