  "selftext": "I have this friend in my school that also has severer anorexia and also has episodes where it comes and goes. While I get exhausted and low in energy and even faint and don't talk to anyone unless I have to, she just is the complete opposite when she restricts.  \nShe acts hyper and laughs hysterically and uses this high-pitched voice and talks a lot.  \nWe both act childish, which may be the only common thing about our behavior and energy levels when we restrict.  \nI wonder why it affects different people so different?\n\nedit: Just remembered that starvation can make you feel euphoric/hyper and nervous because your body runs on adrenaline and there is a mechanism from really long long ago, that makes you move a lot and be hyper, so you can go on to search for food. That's why some of us also have troubles with sleeping (like me waking up due to pain).",

It\u2019s a cruel thing, because eating is something you have to do - not like an alcoholic or drug addict who can just not take the thing they are addicted to. We all need to eat, and when the issue is disordered eating, it can be a life long struggle. It is possible to recover, and I was helped by the love of a very good man. He has now been my husband of 25 years, and we have faced lots of trials together. He was the only one I trusted to be honest with, and we celebrated together when I got my period back! I hope you find someone you can trust, but you must learn to trust yourself, over that betraying voice of the ED. Thoughts are with you. Be kind to yourself.",
