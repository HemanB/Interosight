I have to say though, I don\u2019t really believe I need help on some level because I\u2019m still normal weight. And it\u2019s that warped mindset my ED has. That I\u2019m fine or that I need to lose weight and it\u2019s fine because I\u2019m normal weight. Does anyone else struggle with this?",

Weight isn't the only thing that measures if you have anorexia. I myself am slightly underweight , but i don't look like what the media portraits ana's to typically look like at all. So, my advice is for you to try your best at recovery mentally, the body will follow. You can eat healthy and exercise, but if  the mind set doesn't change, nothing really will.\n\n\nThere's no glory in anorexia. \n\nLeave it as fast as you can.",

My weight is at its lowest right now than ever before, and my bmi is still 4.3 higher than it \"should\" be. It really fucks my mind up.
