  "selftext": "I guess friends you meet in treatment have the possibility of dying but you don\u2019t really care when you click so well with them, you know? She was the first person to talk to me during my first meal at inpatient- the first one to make me laugh after I had the worst day, having been admitted on Halloween. She was the one to encourage my recovery, even when she wasn\u2019t getting better herself. She relapsed over and over again, in and out of ICUs and treatment centers but it never stuck. I stayed mostly weight restored for a while before starting to relapse. \n\nTwo days ago, her heart stopped and she went into cardiac arrest. Thank goodness her mom was there to do CPR, she saved her life. But she\u2019s still in the ICU and her heart could fail at any moment. AND YET she says she\u2019s not sick enough and she thinks people will think she\u2019s fat and fake. But she promised me she\u2019d go back to treatment, on her own volition this time. She has a will to live and fight for her future. \n\nI\u2019ve been struggling with my relapse but this made me look at my life. I never thought I was sick enough but if someone\u2019s heart can literally stop and they still say they\u2019re not sick enough, it\u2019ll never be *enough.*",
