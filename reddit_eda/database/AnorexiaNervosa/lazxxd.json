  "selftext": "She said it in front of people too lol. I wanted to beat her until her face started bleeding. She was a terrible roommate overall , but this is one hands down of the most fucked up things she ever said to me. I can never tell anyone in my personally life because the truth is I am suffering from anorexia and they would notice even more if I told them this story. \n\nIt still pisses me off to this day. Ignorant ass bitch. \n\nSorry to be so vulgar I\u2019m just annoyed asf. She was an awful roommate to me.",
