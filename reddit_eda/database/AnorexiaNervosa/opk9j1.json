  "selftext": "When I was a fat kid, everyone in my class would complain about being cold and I\u2019d say \u201cWhy are yall cold? It ain\u2019t cold at all!\u201d\n\nAnd now that I\u2019ve restricted and purged myself to this point, I\u2019m almost always either cold or okay. I haven\u2019t been hot without being in the bath in a while\u2026 \n\nSo whenever I feel warm in a T-shirt, I think \u201cwhy do you feel warm? You shouldn\u2019t feel warm unless you\u2019re getting fat or working out. You aren\u2019t working out and you\u2019d better not be getting fat!\u201d",
