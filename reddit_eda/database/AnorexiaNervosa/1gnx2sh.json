  "selftext": "I'm just DONE. It's not worth the pain. I don't want to be stuck my whole life with all this suffering just to lose a bit of weight. I've realized there are other ways that I can feel good about my body, I'll just eat healthy foods that I like and I'll try to exercise more and sleep better and that's all that's really necessary. I used to think that I had to be underweight to be attractive, but now that I'm in a better place and I'm in a relationship with someone who makes me feel loved and pretty, I am starting to realize that that's not true at all and there are much more important things that I could be focusing on. I'm not going to spend my whole life missing out on my favourite foods just to end up in some hospital again.",

But anyways, thank you for your support.
