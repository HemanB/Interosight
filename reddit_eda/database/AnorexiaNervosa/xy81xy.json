  "selftext": "Since im recovering from surgery, my mom is my caregiver for a bit. She keeps feeding me so much, but like, not too much? She doesnt shame me when im not hungry (which im not at all cuz meds) but she also makes sure i eat enough every day. \n\nIm usually terrified of cheese and pasta, but she gave me a huge bowl of mac n cheese and i ate most of it. Everything she feeds me feels like safe food \ud83e\udd7a\n\nMy mom is amazing yall i just wanted to gush about her lol",
