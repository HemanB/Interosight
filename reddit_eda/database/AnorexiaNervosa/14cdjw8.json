  "selftext": "I am what i would considered \u201crecovered\u201d. I work at the same place I worked at while I was really ill, so a lot of my co workers know my issue. So naturally when new coworkers started, the ones who have been there fill them in on the gossip. The thing about healthcare, a lot of them are females so i know how it goes. I\u2019ve overheard the gossip about me when they think they are whispering and you know fucking what? The fact that they think my ED is something to discuss is fucking disgusting. One of my newer coworkers thought it would be helpful to tell me about intermittent fasting, how she lost some kgs by doing it and how i dont have to starve to be skinny. I was taken aback and she isnt even thin, shes clearly overweight, which i have no problem with but i dont need your fucking weight loss methods. I always ate several times a day. I never went a day without eating even while at my LW. I know how to lose weight while eating. I know a bunch of diet fads and methods and i don\u2019t need your input susan. Why dont you tell one of our other coworkers how to lose weight? Why make me feel like i need to do this to lose weight? What weight should i lose? Are my legs too wide or arms too thick? Do i look fat? Like seriously shut the fuck up about how to lose weight you fat fucking bitch.",
