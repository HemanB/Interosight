I am nearly a week out of hospital for AN, and none of my family have offered or even asked me to eat a single thing and are all aware that i have not eaten since (do not recommend) but they are purposefully avoiding making me eat ect, and i know this because I\u2019ve just heard them ask my brother if he wants to come out for breakfast and they\u2019ve eaten dinner in front of me. Im not sure how to feel about it, they are aware of my habits and ED.. And i do but i don\u2019t want them to ask, because now i feel like they\u2019ve fully given up on me, which is making my ED have a party, but it kinda bums me out to know they don\u2019t care.. i turned to typing it out on here because i couldn\u2019t talk to my friends about it because they\u2019re have their own problems and i feel bad.",

Human beings need attention. It isn\u2019t a goddamn crime to want the people we care about to pay us notice.

      "body": "Hey :). This is gonna be a long post just so you know lol. Just wanted to give help from experience!\n\nI agree with the others who are saying some of these responses are harsh. I\u2019ve gone through something similar too when I was struggling with my AN as a teen. And some of these responses, even if they don\u2019t intend to be invalidating, can feel super invalidating right now. \n\nWhen my parents stoped trying, it felt like they were letting me die too. Like they all have given up and now cuz everyone else gave up on me, what\u2019s the point of even trying anymore. And I relate so much to not having any \"consequences\" now for not eating. I felt that way too that now I was free to follow the ED for as long as I wanted without restriction. But you having that push and pull of wanting them to say something and not at the same time is a great start because it shows some part of you wants to get better away from the ED! But there are many reasons why they may be doing this! Especially if they want to support you. And it\u2019s important to maybe try having a convo with them :). I know it can be scary. \n\nHave you and your parents had a conversation about what you need from them? Sometimes they just don\u2019t know how to best approach helping you eat so they think that avoiding confrontation may reduce stress on you and them as a whole. The thing they fail to realize is sometimes, especially when you are fresh out of hospital or starting recovery in general, you need that little nudging to help you eat. \n\nIf you and your parents haven\u2019t had a discussion on what would be helpful for helping you eat, I\u2019d definitely suggest that! Here are some things that I find helped me that they did:\n\n-Giving me permission to eat! \n\nSometimes the ED can make it feel like you don\u2019t have permission to eat. Or if the choice is up to you, it can be hard to do it yourself as the ED never lets you. Making it seem like you don\u2019t \"have\" to makes you not wanna do it cuz of the guilt and torment the ED puts you through for going against it. Having a parent say,\n\n\"Dinners ready, come try to have some with us. We will all eat together\" \nOr \"Hey, I know you are having a difficult time right now but we need to eat to feel better.\" \n\n\"Hey, I can tell the ED is really loud right now, but you are allowed to eat and the ED can blame me for helping you eat.\"\n\nThis can help just relieve you from making it seem like it\u2019s your decision/fault to eat and you can put the blame on your parents instead of you and tell your ED like \"hey my parents or therapist are making me do this.\" You can think of a line(s) that works for you. \n\n-Another thing that helped is them just making my plate for me when I felt like I couldn\u2019t cuz the ED was so strong. It takes that control away from you, which can be scary, but it also can reduce the overthinking your ED does when you are portioning things yourself! \n\n-Reminding me how proud they are of me for trying so hard. This is a hit or miss as sometimes you don\u2019t want to hear someone proud of you.  But if it helps it\u2019s a good thing to point out!\n\n-Providing or helping you think of things to do to distract you after a meal. This can look like watching a movie together to giving you ideas on things you can do for yourself! You can brainstorm ideas to try! \n\nKeeping an openness for reaching out to them for support or for comfort when you are having really hard thoughts. If you have s therapist, you can ask them if they can help you help your parents with supporting you better!!\n\nAnd yes, as previous commenters have said, it is your responsibility to eat. And I completely agree with that. The ball is in your court when it comes to recovery, and no one can do it for you. So you do have to put in the effort required. But I think that support, if your parents want to provide it, can go a long way in helping you recover much better and in a faster way as we all need that sometimes ! \n\nBut you also need to be open to the support! You gotta accept it and not refuse it ! I\u2019m not accusing you of having done that but sometimes it can discourage the people trying to help you the most ! \n\nKeep in mind that they are human too. They will make mistakes. They will not be perfect. Especially not at first. It took a long time for my mom and I to get to a place where she and I knew what I needed to get through my struggles. It takes time and experimenting and perseverance on both parts ! \n\n\nSo to summarize. My suggestions are:\n\n-Brainstorm ideas to distract/cope after eating (make a list somewhere to you can check off what does or doesn\u2019t work)\n\n-Think of lines/things that you think would be helpful for your parents to try doing to support you better and have that conversation with them. If you feel like you can\u2019t initiate it and have a therapist, I\u2019d suggest bringing this ideas to them and getting their advice!\n\n-Making a list of why you should recover! Keep the list close by so when motivation falls and the ED gets super loud, you can look back at the list of reasons why you began to recover in the first place to give you that motivation or nudge! \n\n\nHaving open communication between you and your parents during this time is so important to avoid assumed reasons for why they are acting like they are. \n\nIt is also good to remember that they can\u2019t do this forever. You can't rely on them to always give you permission to eat and get you to do those things. But it\u2019s okay to have that temporarily until you can get into a routine and build coping tools to start slowly trying to do it yourself! \n\nOnce you get to a place of making your own meals or portioning your own food, it can help if your parent supervises just to help you do it on your own before you do it without them there! But for now just focus on what\u2019s going on now :)). \n\nI wish you all the best!! And I really hope this advice was helpful. Even if just a smidge. This hit close to my heart and I really wanted to see if my experiences would help you feel less alone. :)\n\nTake care ! You got this! I know you can recover! \n\nDM\u2019s are always open too if you\u2019d like a little more advice!",

It\u2019s also valid to get mad you aren\u2019t eating. It isn\u2019t valid to completely shut you out and give you cold responses when you just got out of hospital. People generally develop EDs for a reason, and that reason clearly has not been addressed. \n\nI\u2019m sorry this is happening. I know you probably feel like you absolutely cannot eat now since no one is forcing you. Yes, you probably miss the attention, because for one reason or another, you felt like you weren\u2019t getting enough of it at some point in your life. Just think about how you want to move forward. Do you want to never eat again because they don\u2019t force you to? You\u2019ll stay locked in your room and become a lot more miserable and likely end up IP again. You *can* change this. Your ED is a part of you. It\u2019s not a separate entity. It\u2019s you. And that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s an illness. It doesn\u2019t make you a horrible person. Anorexia doesn\u2019t inherently make you a bad person, even if it\u2019s a selfish thing to do. That\u2019s fine. We can all be selfish sometimes. That selfishness is also an illness, though, and one you cannot fully control yet. You can choose to follow those habits or to diminish them (I know you cannot discard them right off the bat). It will take time, but you will be able to control it somewhat eventually. You are feeding into it right now by begrudgingly refusing to eat. That\u2019s a decision you\u2019re making. I would\u2019ve most likely made the same one in your place. \n\nConsidering the fact that this is all for you, you should also just think about what you want. Do you want to eat? A part of you is screaming no, but mostly you probably do\u2014especially since you were probably eating more in the hospital, and your hunger signals must be painful. Please just eat a safe food. You will feel guilty. But it will establish a precedent of independence and doing what you want that will be very helpful in the future. \n\nJust take care of yourself. That\u2019s a grand ask, I know, but you deserve it. You aren\u2019t inherently unable to eat or to care for yourself. This could be the first step of discovering that.",

It isn\u2019t wrong to expect or even want a favorable response even if you\u2019re not willing to recover. You don\u2019t have to be eating or to be well to expect others to WANT you to eat. You shouldn\u2019t have to *earn* empathy and compassion with any kind of action on your part. It\u2019s *implict* that the people who claim to love us express that in observable ways. \n\nAnd even if you DID want their attention just for the sake of it? Who *gives* a fuck? Human beings need attention. It isn\u2019t a goddamn crime to want the people we care about to pay us notice. The postmodern aversion to \u201cwanting attention\u201d is fucking absurd and based in a scarcity mindset: \u201c*I* don\u2019t get any attention and I don\u2019t expect any so you shouldn\u2019t either!!\u201d Like, please.\n\nTo prove the point, in my case, it isn\u2019t even just anorexia. I was in the ER a few months ago for unrelated issues and not a single member of my immediate family blinked twice. \n\nIt\u2019s not you. You\u2019re not wrong. You deserve better.\n\nBut the fact that you aren\u2019t getting the love and concern you deserve doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t deserve it.

It\u2019s also valid to get mad you aren\u2019t eating. It isn\u2019t valid to completely shut you out and give you cold responses when you just got out of hospital. People generally develop EDs for a reason, and that reason clearly has not been addressed. \n\nI\u2019m sorry this is happening. I know you probably feel like you absolutely cannot eat now since no one is forcing you. Yes, you probably miss the attention, because for one reason or another, you felt like you weren\u2019t getting enough of it at some point in your life. Just think about how you want to move forward. Do you want to never eat again because they don\u2019t force you to? You\u2019ll stay locked in your room and become a lot more miserable and likely end up IP again. You *can* change this. Your ED is a part of you. It\u2019s not a separate entity. It\u2019s you. And that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s an illness. It doesn\u2019t make you a horrible person. Anorexia doesn\u2019t inherently make you a bad person, even if it\u2019s a selfish thing to do. That\u2019s fine. We can all be selfish sometimes. That selfishness is also an illness, though, and one you cannot fully control yet. You can choose to follow those habits or to diminish them (I know you cannot discard them right off the bat). It will take time, but you will be able to control it somewhat eventually. You are feeding into it right now by begrudgingly refusing to eat. That\u2019s a decision you\u2019re making. I would\u2019ve most likely made the same one in your place. \n\nConsidering the fact that this is all for you, you should also just think about what you want. Do you want to eat? A part of you is screaming no, but mostly you probably do\u2014especially since you were probably eating more in the hospital, and your hunger signals must be painful. Please just eat a safe food. You will feel guilty. But it will establish a precedent of independence and doing what you want that will be very helpful in the future. \n\nJust take care of yourself. That\u2019s a grand ask, I know, but you deserve it. You aren\u2019t inherently unable to eat or to care for yourself. This could be the first step of discovering that.",

If you tell them exactly what you said here, which is that eating is easier when other people pressure or hold you accountable for it, I guarantee they will be willing to help hold you accountable while they help you get comfortable and confident in holding yourself accountable. \n\nI very much understand your position- I have had this disorder since I was 13, in recovery since 15, and relapsed this year at 18. I have *always* found it easier to eat when someone else reminds me \u201chey, you promised yourself that you would eat <X> amount of calories today. Go eat.\u201d \n\nI am lucky now to have a partner that understands and is able to help hold me accountable without putting too much strain on herself to \u201cmake\u201d me eat. That\u2019s the part you have to be careful with- when other people feel like they have to be solely responsible for \u201cmaking\u201d you eat, they burn out *very* quickly and it can make them sad, tired, stressed, frustrated, and even resentful at times.  \n\nMy biggest piece of advice? Create your own plan to eat. Create goals (\u201cI will eat at least two meals today,\u201d \u201cI will eat dinner today,\u201d \u201cI will eat <X> amount of calories today,\u201d etc.) for YOURSELF, and ask your family to help you hold YOURSELF accountable to it. \n\nAnd don\u2019t get frustrated or argue when they do it. Remember, they\u2019re helping you, but you\u2019re the only one who can really choose whether or not you eat, and whether or not you get better. They\u2019re just helping guide you down the path YOU chose. \n\nI hope this helps, and I\u2019m sorry if the tone is a bit harsh- I struggle with tone over text. You can do this<3",

Human beings need attention. It isn\u2019t a goddamn crime to want the people we care about to pay us notice. The postmodern aversion to \u201cwanting attention\u201d is fucking absurd and based in a scarcity mindset: \u201c*I* don\u2019t get any attention and I don\u2019t expect any so you shouldn\u2019t either!!\u201d Like, please.\n\nTo prove the point, in my case, it isn\u2019t even just anorexia.

They likely won\u2019t come back on their own, and when they do, they\u2019ll come back with a vengeance (or maybe they won\u2019t! some people don\u2019t experience this). You still need to eat because your ED isn\u2019t the only part of you. Even if it were, not eating forever would kill it. There\u2019s no ED anymore when you\u2019re dying. There\u2019s no anything. You don\u2019t want to face that dread even if you think you do. Dying from an ED is different than a lot of suicidal methods because it\u2019s so slow and will damage you even if you never get to your deathbed. \n\nYour ED is still valid if you eat something. It would most likely be fairly restrictive anyway. Think about how you got here. You were still eating some foods, but you were sick enough to be hospitalized four times. Hell, if it helps, I\u2019ve generally lost more weight while restricting than while fasting. Metabolism and all that (also exercise in my case but that\u2019s separate). I\u2019m not encouraging you to lose btw, just saying lol. \n\nNot eating for even longer will also increase the chances of getting refeeding syndrome. Trust me, you don\u2019t want that at all. You can find a middle ground between dying and feeling like a failure. You will feel very guilty at first, but that will subside eventually. You just have to get over the initial dread.  \n\nYour hospital is shitty btw.",

Anorexia doesn\u2019t inherently make you a bad person, even if it\u2019s a selfish thing to do. That\u2019s fine. We can all be selfish sometimes. That selfishness is also an illness, though, and one you cannot fully control yet. You can choose to follow those habits or to diminish them (I know you cannot discard them right off the bat). It will take time, but you will be able to control it somewhat eventually. You are feeding into it right now by begrudgingly refusing to eat. That\u2019s a decision you\u2019re making. I would\u2019ve most likely made the same one in your place. \n\nConsidering the fact that this is all for you, you should also just think about what you want. Do you want to eat? A part of you is screaming no, but mostly you probably do\u2014especially since you were probably eating more in the hospital, and your hunger signals must be painful. Please just eat a safe food. You will feel guilty. But it will establish a precedent of independence and doing what you want that will be very helpful in the future. \n\nJust take care of yourself. That\u2019s a grand ask, I know, but you deserve it. You aren\u2019t inherently unable to eat or to care for yourself. This could be the first step of discovering that.",

Maybe a school counselor?\n\nFind a professional, and they can help hold you accountable for eating. If you tell them exactly what you said here, which is that eating is easier when other people pressure or hold you accountable for it, I guarantee they will be willing to help hold you accountable while they help you get comfortable and confident in holding yourself accountable. \n\nI very much understand your position- I have had this disorder since I was 13, in recovery since 15, and relapsed this year at 18. I have *always* found it easier to eat when someone else reminds me \u201chey, you promised yourself that you would eat <X> amount of calories today. Go eat.\u201d \n\nI am lucky now to have a partner that understands and is able to help hold me accountable without putting too much strain on herself to \u201cmake\u201d me eat. That\u2019s the part you have to be careful with- when other people feel like they have to be solely responsible for \u201cmaking\u201d you eat, they burn out *very* quickly and it can make them sad, tired, stressed, frustrated, and even resentful at times.  \n\nMy biggest piece of advice? Create your own plan to eat. Create goals (\u201cI will eat at least two meals today,\u201d \u201cI will eat dinner today,\u201d \u201cI will eat <X> amount of calories today,\u201d etc.) for YOURSELF, and ask your family to help you hold YOURSELF accountable to it. \n\nAnd don\u2019t get frustrated or argue when they do it. Remember, they\u2019re helping you, but you\u2019re the only one who can really choose whether or not you eat, and whether or not you get better. They\u2019re just helping guide you down the path YOU chose. \n\nI hope this helps, and I\u2019m sorry if the tone is a bit harsh- I struggle with tone over text. You can do this<3",

Your ed lets you control people's treatment of you? Which could explain why you are feeling so negative now, because 1. It has always worked, and 2. You can't comprehend people appearing not to care about someone over that.\n\nI know for a fact that that was a reason why my ex's ED manifested even though she swore black and blue that it wasn't. She would let it slip, little hints, when she was fused. It took me ages to connect the dots (I am autistic and have a brain injury that affects my memory (both formation and recall)), but once I saw her doing it I was bewildered \u2014 it was so clear that everyone in her life cared about her *a lot*.",
