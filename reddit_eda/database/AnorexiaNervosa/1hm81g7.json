But, he, too, worried about me dying and not being able to have kids due to my eating disorder. This was after living w me for 6 months. We dated 2 more years and got engaged. The moment we did, I just knew it was over. I didn't want to be anyone's mother or wife.\n(I come from an abusive home and was parentified my whole childhood)\nI ended up telling him to leave. He moved out while i was at work and and took our dog. I see him now, in our small town, with kids and a wife. He seems really happy. I'm still stuck in this hell of anorexia at age 47.

I would spend the night before he came to see me, calculating all the potential food we would eat to make sure I could do damage control, it's actually mad.\n\nYou'd think cutting out meals would give you so much more time to do things but instead of being productive or enjoying life, I'd spend hours planning my next meal. I'd have more time if I just ate like a normal fucking person. \n\nI also regret how angry I was when I was DEEP in it. I'd have extended family compliment me, come home and my mum would go on about how I'm gonna end up putting myself in hospital if I kept going the way I was. I remember the pain and anger in her voice till this day and I remember how angry I was at her for saying that. It kinda hurts me now thinking back. I remember thinking \"everyone else is so jealous of me and thinks I look amazing, why can't you just be happy about that\". \n\nAll in all, I regret being such a bitch to everyone, in some ways it wasn't their fault and they were just worried about me, but on the flip side it's like, why would you say shit to me over the years then decide to be worried?",
