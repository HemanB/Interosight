  "selftext": "last night, whilst watching the walking dead & cuddling, my boyfriend of 3 years decided to have a heart to heart with me. this has only occurred a couple of times before, he even got a little teary eyed. he said that he wants to marry me but he has a stipulation. he wants me to get better, to recover before he thinks of proposing. he said i\u2019m sick & i need to take care of my health first. he was expecting me to be upset & maybe i would have been if it hadnt been something i needed to hear. i already knew of this stipulation though, i know he loves me but he shouldnt have to marry a person that cant properly take care of their own body. it was sweet & shows he cares, he rarely acknowledges my ED as a problem bc he knows its a touchy subject & he wouldnt know how to go about talking about it anyway. i\u2019m feeling motivated. hopefully that lasts though, bc it seems as if i\u2019m motivated at some point everyday then it all goes downhill lol. so, right now, i\u2019m pledging to eat a bit more & cease purging. i cant think about gaining weight atm, that would only be discouraging",
