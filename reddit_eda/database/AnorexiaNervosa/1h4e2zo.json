  "selftext": "I understand this is a serious illness but holy crap some ed havers are just cruel - I don't understand how anyone who struggles with body image can be so vicious about other people's bodies, knowing the inpact their words can have. \n\nHow can you be so viciously fatphobic you post other people's photos and shame them, and publicly announce how looking like them is your worst fear. How can you spend so much time ripping apart someone elses appearance. \n\nI seriously despise how arrogant some people with eds can be, how blind they are. I know I am sick but I'm not a monster. I don't glorify my illness, I don't think I'm better than anyone else. If anything I feel the opposite. I'm angry at myself for falling victim to society and the patriarchy and hating myself so feverishly I can't even eat properly anymore. I would give anything to be fat and confident and happy and thriving, I don't want this life. I think everyone is so so beautiful and unique and deserving and have so much compassion and love inside me all I want to do is protect and uplift others. \n\nI don't understand how anyone with this disorder could feel otherwise, knowing how terrible this illnesses. How could you ever stoop so low as to shame others so callously. Where is your humanity. It makes me mad, it makes me want to cry. No one deserves to hate their body and feel ashamed of their existence or be treated like anything less than worthy and inherently beautiful. \n\nI just. I really really hate people :( How can others casually be so mean and heartless I don't understand. ",

I wish it were true that all ED sufferers were able to have empathy for others based on their own experience and thus not be cruel, but alas there will always be ppl who do shitty things. You also have to bear in mind that a lot of the ppl who are bullying others online for their weight are teenagers; their brains haven\u2019t fully developed and they are probably struggling a lot mentally. Of course that is NOT an excuse to harm others but given the prevalence of bullying in the non-ED teen population, I wouldn\u2019t expect it to be any different. We also know how much malnutrition can affect behaviour and judgement, and it can lead to some kind of stunted emotional maturity in young people. Again, none of these things are excuses and I can\u2019t understand why someone would ever want to make a stranger feel bad, but I\u2019m sure it feels logical and justified to the perpetrators.",
