  "title": "I\u2019m worried that a girl in my apartment building will die soon",
  "selftext": "So I\u2019ve (25F) lived in my building for a few years and have seen this girl (25-30F) around for the last couple of years. She\u2019s generally very shy (it comes across as unfriendly) and only really interacted with me when I had my little dog with me. I started to make more of an effort to catch her eye and smile when I\u2019ve seen her in the elevator - I\u2019m almost certain she lives alone and I think she is foreign (we\u2019re in Australia). Possibly her mum visited her once about a year ago. \n\nBased off the times I have seen her around (and this is over two or so years) she doesn\u2019t have a 9-5 or any sort of regular job with colleagues. I have other theories about that but it\u2019s irrelevant to this. I\u2019ve only seen her with her own little dog but actually haven\u2019t seen the dog for the past few months. \n\nThis girl is rail thin. She\u2019s quite tall and striking looking but my housemate and I have noticed her steady decline in weight over the last year, particularly the last six months to the point where it is clear she is suffering from severe anorexia. She has the look - IYKYK. I went away over Christmas for a month and saw her today for the first time in five weeks - I literally stifled a gasp at her emaciated frame. Her skull was protruding from under her skin as was her small and round stomach. Merely walking through the carpark was clearly an effort and looked painful - she was walking very slowly. She is nearly at end-stage anorexia. \n\nI told my housemate and she explained that she\u2019d seen her in our apartment gym on Monday at 11.30am, walking on the treadmill. My housemate returned to the gym at 5.30 and the girl was still. walking. Housemate walked behind her to check and she had been walking for nearly six hours. \nHousemate very rarely uses our gym. I wonder how often she does this. \n\nI\u2019m really worried about this girl. I\u2019m worried she will just die in her apartment one day, that she won\u2019t wake up or something. I don\u2019t think she has a job where colleagues might become concerned about her mental and physical health. She has stopped smiling back at me the last few months and seems completely oblivious to her surroundings. Housemate said she was the same in the gym - people were staring and she was completely unaware. \n\nHas anyone experienced trying to help someone that they don\u2019t know? I don\u2019t feel as though attempting to befriend her right now will be helpful and in my experience with eating disorders, trying to talk to her will be about as helpful as walking a fish. She needs professional help and I don\u2019t think she is getting any. If she was, she\u2019d be an inpatient. \n\nDoes anyone have a suggestion as to how I can help her? Is there some kind of welfare-check I can contact or call for advice?\nI don\u2019t know what floor she lives on or even her name. I am in Queensland, Australia.",

Without going into too much detail I can kinda understand how this happened based on her job and it does look like she has cut off a lot of support. \n\nMy housemate, my partner and I are going to spend a bit more time in our apartment gym and pop down to our street during the times where we\u2019ve seen her in the past.

It\u2019s sad, but true. When I moved overseas, I rapidly became worse because nobody knew me and my close ones couldn\u2019t see me.

You can call to discuss people you have concerns for. I do not know whether they accept assessments from neighbours but it's worth a try. If you are in another state, look up on Google to see if they have a MH Triage Line.\n\nThis sounds urgent so I would suggest a wellness check or butterfly foundation for advice.\n\nThank you for caring about this person.

However, given her physical state, she is at high risk of deterioration due to her illness, which strengthens the right to section greatly.\n\nThere's also the other issue of ethics and it would mean that she would likely be involuntarily and that can involve things like mechanical restraint. It strips her of total autonomy and while a needed process - it's a violating one nonetheless. \n\nUltimately the choice is up to you. Personally as someone with anorexia, i would loathe being sectioned however, clinically it is warranted as there's no culpable way she is in her right mind. \n\nIf you need access to clinical guidelines about mental health sectioning i can provide them so you can see what will ideally happen from the ambulance perspective.",
