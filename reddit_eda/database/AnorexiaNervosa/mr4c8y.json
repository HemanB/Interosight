A big part of eating disorders is a desire to be \u201cperfect\u201d but none of us can ever be perfect. That\u2019s pretty much an impossible expectation. I recommend you seek help for your eating disorder, taking steps to recovery can be a lengthy process, but it\u2019s worth it. Good luck.",

      "body": "To piggyback on this I think finding a bathing suit that helps you feel a bit more comfortable might take off some of the edge and anxiety. Tummy control swimwear is a game changer and helps me feel more confident (and I am not generally a confident person). I remember reading about a study where the women wearing one piece swimsuits were rated as more attractive and the overall reasoning was because they seemed more comfortable with themselves usually because they weren\u2019t constantly readjusting or trying to cover up. I thought it was an interesting take and helped me rethink comfort over fashion. \n\nThe comment you made about starving yourself, obviously you know that\u2019s not the healthiest choice and I\u2019m not trying to make you feel bad about it, I get it. I just want to remind you that when you go a long time without eating, your body goes into starvation/survival mode and when you eventually do eat again, you body absorbs the food differently and stores it as fat just in case it has to go a while without eating again. Even though we think we\u2019re losing weight by not eating, and sometimes we do, it\u2019s not going to work long term because it basically comes back to slap us in the face by packing on more weight than it would\u2019ve had we eaten normally the whole time. \n\nBe kind to yourself and to your body. When you exercise, sleep well, and eat regularly you are being kind to yourself. Do whatever you have to in order to remind yourself of the good habits until you break the old ones. It\u2019s ok to make mistakes, don\u2019t throw away the progress you\u2019ve made because of one bad day or moment, keep at it. Talk to someone who can help you establish some better habits that work for you. Good luck with everything. Just take it one day at a time.",
