Why was I forcing myself to such limits to try and fit into a piece of cloth lol and I was super stunned. (By the way I was 18 trying to fit into smth from when I was 12). \n\nThe body obviously grows during this period of time. And I shouldn\u2019t be trying to stop that! \ud83d\ude0a currently about 1 year recovered and I do look back occasionally but more often than not I win over the unreasonable voices in my head :-)",

      "body": "This is something I constantly try to remind myself. You're *supposed* to gain weight over puberty. I *shouldn't* weigh what I did as an adult as I did in middle school, even if I'm only an inch taller. It's so hard to let go of the mentality that I should be the same, but that's how your body works and that's what it wants to be doing. I know many of my friends who also underwent those physical changes, including weight gain, and weren't fazed by it because that's literally what every medical text says is supposed to happen. \n\nI actually did one of those dumb \"ideal body weight\" calculators and realized that if I change the age from fourteen to twenty-three, the lower end of a healthy/expected weight is *significantly* lower for a teenager than an adult. When my doctor was worried because my weight hadn't been so low in nine years, I scoffed because I was still within my healthy weight range... but then realized that her concern stems from the fact that I *shouldn't* be weighing what I weighed when I hadn't even gotten my period yet.\n\nI always thought because I'm basically the same height still, I should weigh the same. I forgot to take into account that the body develops no matter its height and adds hips and bone structure and body parts and does the things necessary to prepare me for having a baby (someday). I was watching an old video of me from when I had just started restricting and realized I was almost completely flat-chested and had no curves. I was like, whoa, of course I should've gained weight since then. I think it's a common mentality in older females with anorexia, and it's such a trap.",

I think it is a way to express a fear of being an adult.\nI want to be as skinnier as possible but i dont want to look like a child. I want to be a skinny woman not a small kid. (I'm not shaming you, just trying to make you understand that maybe there's an explaination why you are trying your kid clothes while being an adult)",
