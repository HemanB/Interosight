Going private for 48h would deprive our users of the emotional support this comnunity offers, overall being detrimental to many. A protest isn't worth the mental health of our community members. \n\nHypothetically, we could close the subreddit and open the Discord. However, I am the one working on the Discord server. I have been on vacation the past week and have been unable to make progress on it in that time, and still have much to do. While it will probably be open by the 12th, I do not want to push myself when I have things to do offline during that time. \n\nHowever, we fully support the communities that *are* going dark, and can only hope that Reddit listens to us and comes to understand that their decisions are detrimental to the Reddit communtiy as a whole. \n\nIf you have any questions, comments or concerns, please feel free to either comment them under this post or to modmail them to the subreddit. We will answer them to the best of our ability.",
