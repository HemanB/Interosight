  "selftext": "I want to look sick so that people are worried. But I don't want to look sick because people might worry so I hide it. I want people to see me as beautiful and aspirational, but that clashes with the thing about looking sick. I don't want to eat, but I also DESPERATELY want to eat all. The. Time. I want my clothes to be too big, but I don't want my clothes to be too big because then I have to buy new clothes. And clothes shopping makes me feel fat. I don't want to talk about it, but I don't want to deal with it alone. I don't want people to baby me and walk on eggshells around me, but I also want people to understand just how vulnerable and low I am. I have no self control and all the self control.\n\nAnyone relate or have anything to add?",
