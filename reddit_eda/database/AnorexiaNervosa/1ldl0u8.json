  "title": "My girlfriend has an anorexia fetish and I kinda like it. I don't know what to do",
  "selftext": "I (22M) am severely uw. I\u2019ve struggled with anorexia for years. People usually stare, make comments, and I\u2019ve gotten used to hearing that I look like a walking corpse, I kind of am.\n\nI lost my job recently because of my health. I have Bradycardia, Hypotension, I get regular heart palpitations, my bones are aching constantly, I have a lot of hair loss and I'm at a risk of a heart attack (I've actually gotten one before, at literally 15). Couldn\u2019t keep up with the hours, couldn\u2019t stay on my feet. Most of the time I feel like I\u2019m running on fumes.\n\nThree weeks ago, this woman (20F) came up to me on the street. She just smiled and said I looked \u201chauntingly beautiful.\u201d We got dinner (well, she got dinner), exchanged numbers, and somehow now we\u2019re dating. We don't do sexual stuff since I'm unable, but she seems okay with just cuddling and dates. Doesn't want anything from me.\n\nShe\u2019s incredibly affectionate, especially physically. She touches my arms, my back, my chest constantly. She traces my bones with her fingers like she\u2019s studying me. A few nights ago we were lying on her couch and she asked, with this really excited voice, \u201cCan I feel your ribs while we cuddle?\u201d I said sure, not knowing what to expect, and she lit up. Just pressed her hand over them and stayed like that for a while, smiling. She looked so happy with me. \n\nShe also started buying me cigarettes, I never asked. She said, \u201cIn case you\u2019re feeling hungry or anxious, they\u2019ll help take the edge off.\u201d I didn\u2019t have the energy to argue. The only reason I wasn't smoking was because I didn't have the cash to spend - but now she's the one buying me the stuff so it's alright. She clearly likes that I'm so thin and I love that. I don't want anyone to force me to eat. \n\nIt should weird me out more than it does. Maybe if I were in a different place, it would. But honestly? I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be around that long. And she\u2019s the first person in a long time who looks at me with something like awe instead of pity or disgust. But at the same time I'm wondering if this is very bad for me and if I should try to recover instead. ",

It\u2019s far more easily hidden and there is a different shame attached.\n\nAnorexia kills much faster and is harder to treat- remember, you can get weight loss surgery, but you can\u2019t get weight gain surgery\n\nI am editing this to add a few things because after I posted this I did a quick bit of research: turns out that obesity *does* account for greater mortality and morbidity than anorexia, although anorexia is under reported- at least for many parts of the world. It can arguably be hidden for longer. \n\nObesity has a strong genetic link as well so is perhaps more likely in certain families. There is more research needed in this area regarding anorexia. \n\nObesity is not considered a MH condition, at least not in and of itself. With anorexia and other ED\u2019s associated with weight loss, there is also a psychiatric element that requires treating. Whilst there are often co morbidities associated with obesity, it is not itself a MH disorder and therefore doesn\u2019t always require the same multi-pronged approach.\n\nSorry if I rambled a little there- also I know this is an old thread",
