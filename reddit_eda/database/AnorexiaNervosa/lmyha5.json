  "selftext": "I fucking hate this disease. I\u2019m so sick of not being able to find a comfortable position to sleep in because of my bones. I hate that I have to sit on a pillow to be comfortable. I hate that I bruise so easily. I hate that I every time I need to eat it\u2019s a fucking battle. I hate the constant headaches from lack of nutrition. I hate that I faint. I hate having to buy children\u2019s clothes because nothing fits me. I hate that my hair falls out in clumps. I hate that my fingernails stopped growing. I hate the look my partner gives me when I don\u2019t finish all my food. I hate not being able to do things because I\u2019m tired all the time. I finally started to eat enough calories and was gaining weight and then I caught Covid and lost all the weight while sick. I\u2019m so fucking mad that I have to start all over, again, for the umpteentth time. I hate how dark the bags under my eyes are and how sunken my face looks. I miss having energy. I miss liking the food I was eating. I miss my whole life not being revolves around food. I miss being able to hike with my dogs and not feel exhausted. I\u2019m scared for my health. I\u2019m back to my lowest BMI and I\u2019m terrified. I don\u2019t want to fuck up my heart or brain anymore than I have. I\u2019m currently laying on the bathroom floor because showering took so much energy. I have to be to work in an hour and I just.... I feel like giving up. Will it ever get better? I feel so lost and out of hope. And deep down I know I\u2019ll feel better when I start eating again... why can\u2019t I just eat? It\u2019s been *years* ... why can\u2019t I just eat? I fucking hate this disease.",

      "body": "I totally relate. I hate how I can\u2019t sit in certain positions/chairs comfortably anymore because my tailbone sticks out too much and hurts, same  knees and so I have to put a pillow in between them when I sleep so they don\u2019t hurt or bruise each other anymore than they already have before. \nI hate constantly finding new bruises and being told by people that I look pale or that my skin looks like it has a sickly yellow tint to it (even in recovery, people tell me this a LOT and get concerned I\u2019m slipping back). \nI hate how I can\u2019t stand up without getting dizzy and a vision blackout, but at the same time if I *don\u2019t* get it then I feel guilty and like I\u2019m eating too much (even though I\u2019m literally in recovery).\nI hate my mind constantly being consumed with thoughts of food and being so hungry all the time but never eating enough/fully meeting my meal plan. I hate the excruciating feeling of hunger that never leaves. I hate being exhausted all the time and being told by people that my face looks \u201cgaunt\u201d and hollow. \nI hate that I\u2019m in college and wasting my early twenties away to a horrible illness that feels like I\u2019ll never escape from. I hate how it makes me so isolated and alone and apathetic in life. I hate that I tie so much worth to my weight. I hate that I\u2019ve been told by multiple guys that being so skinny isn\u2019t attractive and that weight gain would be good and healthy, and still my ed tells me no one will ever love me or want to be around me unless I\u2019m as skinny as I possibly can be without dying. \nI hate being so freezing cold all of the time and losing feeling in my hands and feet all the time. I hate how my fingernails are so brittle and my hair is so thinned out from when it was falling out from malnourishment. I hate that no matter how sick I\u2019ll be, it\u2019ll never be enough and I\u2019ll always want to lose more weight and I\u2019m ruining my life by letting my ed continue to consume me even when I\u2019m in recovery (albeit quasi recovery). \nThis isn\u2019t life, it\u2019s just barely surviving. It sucks.",

I cried through at least one meal a day for 6 months and got my weight to a point where the bones no longer bother me. I hope you can allow yourself to get to a more comfortable weight. The ED will probably still be there but at least you won\u2019t have to suffer so much. I hate anorexia too. It tries to draw me back down into the black hole almost everyday despite how fucking hard I\u2019ve worked. There\u2019s only one option and it\u2019s to keep fighting.",
