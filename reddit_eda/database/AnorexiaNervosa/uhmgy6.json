I hate the stereotype that people think anorexic people hate food. it's not true. anorexic people like food, but they have a hard time eating enough of it. If you deny yourself food, you start to become obsessed with it. you will constantly think about when your next meal is, what you will eat. if you starve yourself, it ironically makes you more obsessed with getting whatever foods you can eat. and at the same time, you are afraid of it. anorexia is miserable. it's so serious and I think people who think it is some kind of diet or that it involves willpower are ignorant. anorexia is torture, for the person with it, and the people who love the person",

It is the *only* mental illness in which the diagnostic criteria is rooted in physical measures.\n\nI\u2019ve deeply struggled with anorexia for 21 years now, but only met the weight criteria for maybe 5 or 6 of those years. I most certainly still suffered from anorexia for the other 15.\n\nI used to have a severely alcoholic friend with bulimia, and the differences between us was one of the most revealing things to me about my own disorder. She was skinnier than me; when we were both side by side most people would have picked her as the anorexic and me as the bulimic, as we were both underweight but I weighed slightly more, and of course according to the great and wonderful DSM bulimics are more likely to have a low BMI but not be severely underweight.\n\nThe differences in our own individual psychology where it came to each of our disorders were mind blowing. She didn\u2019t really obsess about her body at all. She didn\u2019t look at thinspo, she had much better self esteem, and she didn\u2019t really have body dysmorphia - she\u2019d always point out how extreme mine was. She didn\u2019t hate her body. And she had absolutely no issue with or fear of eating, she wasn\u2019t uncomfortable around food at all. \n\nIt was actually almost clearest by looking at our fridges/pantries. We both lived alone. My fridge, freezer and pantry were overflowing with food; I\u2019m always buying food, promising myself I\u2019ll eat it, and then just not be able to bring myself to. I throw out almost as much food as I buy.\n\nHers were completely empty. There was never any food at her house; like her fridge literally had 3 condiments and bottled water in it. As soon as food entered the threshold, she\u2019d consume it uncontrollably until it was all gone, often throwing up multiple times a night.\n\nFrom an outsiders perspective again, most would assume the skinnier girl with only mustard in the fridge was the anorexic, and the one with food overflowing from every cupboard was the bulimic. But nope, exact opposite. I surround myself with food and gain a perverse sense of pleasure and control from not eating it even though it\u2019s right there. Her measure of control and pleasure was eating whatever she wanted, whenever she felt like it, and immediately purging it.",
