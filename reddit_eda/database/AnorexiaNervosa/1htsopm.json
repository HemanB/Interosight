  "selftext": "reading posts ive noticed that a lot of females here want to achieve the thin but curvy womanly figure, bigger breasts and hips but a tiny flat waist, and that thats how the illness started. im here having the opposite ideal of wanting to keep my body looking childlike although i dont really consider myself anorexic, rather a high funcioning one as some people say (keeping the same underweight weight for years). i think it started because i was experiencing neglect thruought my whole childhood and now i want to feel small again. my body didnt even fully develop and when i noticed for the first time all of the girls my age looking different, having breasts and hips i felt insecure. now i have a different view because i found out what truly makes me happy. my feelings are also related to some sexual complexes i have, and i have no idea whats the root of them. ii would like for you guys to share ur experiences and to find out if this is a common thing or not",

For me there's definitely something in there about becoming invisible, or taking up the least amount of space possible as I was brought up very much, \"children should be invisible and not interrupt the adults' lives\", and there's a lot of trauma around that I'm still unpacking with therapists well into my mid-late 30s.",

Then grew up in a pious religious home where I was taught that sex before marriage was a sin. As children do, I internalized the transgression. So I grew up thinking I was dirty and going to hell.\n\nSomehow this was blocked from my frontal mind for years\u2026 but this is what shaped my life.\n\nI do remember as a teen, being very subconscious of my curviness. The hourglass figure, big boobs, and what I thought was too big hips. So I stayed overweight. (So no one would look at me? This was not a conscious thing.)\n\nThen, in my twenties, and more weight conscious, I was still too curvy for my taste, but still getting positive comments about my body from older men. Eww, I thought, but I still went out with a few. Nobody else was asking. \n\nThus, the body image tables turned. Being fat was no longer acceptable, skinny was what you were supposed to be.\n\nThat\u2019s how restricting started. Yada, yada. Full-on AN came on very late in life, but is something else to explore.\n\nED has been with me since I first understood what body image was, all those years ago. Since Twiggy first appeared and the world decided bone-skinny was how women were supposed to look in order to be pretty.\n\nI like how I look now. I still have boobs, but not as big. I have a bunch of bones I can feel. And my short legs look long!!!!!",
