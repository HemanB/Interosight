  "title": "A conversation with my friend, who was anorexic, that I have never forgotten",
  "selftext": "I had a very good friend who suffered from severe anorexia. I met her when I was hospitalized for my eating disorder. I related to her in lots of ways. She was an interesting person. I like art. She also liked art. I liked to write. And she liked to draw and paint. So we could have discussions about that. I could joke around with her, because she didn't take herself too seriously. We talked about a lot of different things, not just our eating disorders. I feel like she understood me and if I happened to be struggling with something, I could talk to her about it. And she could talk to me about something she was struggling with. \n\nBut one thing I remember about her is that she was very entrenched in her disorder. She was very sick. And she had actually been through more anorexia treatments that I had received at the time. She had struggled with her anorexia a lot longer than me. I could already tell that her disorder was really difficult for her to overcome. She had problems accurately seeing how she really looked. She believed, at a very malnourished weight, that she was fat. Some anorexic people have body image distortions where they truly cannot see how they look on the outside. And I think this was an issue she had, and it was really difficult for her to overcome it\n\nWhile I enjoyed our conversations and she was a very kind person, she also needed reassurance that she was not overweight. She believed that she was. Even though she looked emaciated to me and to others. And when I arrived at the hospital, she had been there much longer. She had also tried previous treatment centers before the one I met her in. And I guess she needed more monitoring or she kept relapsing\n\nI was watching tv in the day room at the hospital and she came up to me and the words she said made me feel very sad for her. She said to me \"Do you think I look fat?\" And I felt really bad. She trusted me enough to confide in me that she was struggling. A lot of people sometimes keep their feelings to themselves when they are struggling but she liked talking to me. I liked talking to her. I wanted to reassure her. I said she looked fine. But I do not think she believed me\n\nThe problem with this disorder is that it is a mental illness. Everyone around you sees you one way and you can see yourself as another way. My struggle with anorexia makes me attached to wanting to weigh a specific number and being afraid of the number increasing. I do not view myself as overweight. I see that I am thin. I am terrified of the thought of weight gain, not of the thought of becoming fat. But my friend believed that she looked fat, no matter how thin she actually was. And I think that she continued to struggle with low self esteem even after she left the hospital\n\nI stayed in touch with her for years after I got out of the hospital. I wrote letters to her. I called her on the phone. She was a very unique and intelligent person. She also struggled with a lot of pain. I never found out the exact reasons why she developed her disorder. But I remember her personality and how she was always very kind to everyone around her, no matter how much she was struggling inside. \n\nShe died of of complications of anorexia. She died at a younger age. She never fully recovered from it. But she did try to get better. I think about her a lot. I miss our conversations. Being in inpatient was a very lonely and frightening time for me and talking to her made me feel less alone. This is a tragic disorder. It harms your health. It can change how you view yourself. It is nice to talk to others who are struggling with this. I've never forgotten her. I want to work on getting better from my disorder. And I wish that she could have overcome this.",

I hope you can recover, I know the thought of weight gain is terrifying, regardless of if it comes from a place of believing you need to gain or seeing your body or not.
