  "selftext": "I'm supposed to be recovering to become stronger but whenever I eat more than I usually allow myself (today I binged on candy), I get this weird feeling around my tights like I'm gaining weight, getting cellulite and the gap between my legs is closing.\n\nIt's making me want to relapse, start tracking calories again, eat less for the next few days etc.\n\nAlso how do I stop bingeing on fear foods and eat a \"normal\" amount during recovery?\n\nHave a nice day, guys!",

It took a while, like several years, but now I only get the thoughts occasionally.  The disordered thinking is still in there but I just counter it with NOPE, really hard, and sometimes with humor. \n\nIt's 100% consistency, even on days where it just.. eats at you (excuse the pun), be compassionate to yourself and nudge your awareness in any other direction. Think about how you want to feel - healthy, happy, fulfilled, not counting anything or being preoccupied with something that keeps you from having a good experience in life.",

I\u2019m hypertensive and in the heat w/ certain BP meds cause my legs to swell. Same when I have Chinese food (LOTS of sodium there!). If you are newly in recovery, weight shifts. DON\u2019T mess with your meal plan for AT LEAST a year because it takes that long for your weight to level out throughout your body. TRUST THE PROCESS!  Good luck to you!  Recovery is HARD work, but it\u2019s GOOD work. You deserve a life without the ridiculous rules that eating disorders fill your brain with. Also, any treatment center will tell you to wear loose clothes because of all the changes your body will be going through.",
