I dont mean this as an insult but im getting myself checked and im on the waiting list but its made me understand so much about myself and why i became anorexic and my life long struggles with food as well as socialising and what not. \n\nThose who are bulimic or binge eating disorder go get checked for adhd because that is high in those eating disorders according to research. \n\nYou may find ypur being treated for the surface of your problems but the root has never been solved or at least been given help to make the root of your issues more manageable and easier on you as well autism and adhd cant be cured but i hope you get where im going at here.",

I can now accept that ok i only have one friend but thats ok , im me and i dont need to be like the others. And then you can learn ways of managing certain symptoms like SPD or the need for routine (so like schedules and to do lists and what not and make sure the family agree collectively). You can manage when you dont understand why somethings happened or why you have to do something by having someone else explain it to you rather then just yelling and screaming.what i mean in short is if you know the underlying disorder then you know the underlying symptoms and you can manage those symptoms better as they will never truly go away but they can become more manageable and therefore the surface disorder is more manageable or goes completely and is less likely to relapse.",
