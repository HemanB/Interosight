To see my body, try to figure out what I don\u2019t look or feel atrocious in, then just being uncomfortable all day. I hate it. I\u2019d rather just stay in my pajamas all the time. My mom always asks why I never put any effort in. Bc I\u2019m disgusting? And looking at myself makes me feel depressed? Anyone else??",

I don\u2019t wear tight fitting clothes ever. I have to look semi presentable for work (rarely full business formal fortunately), but I can get away with jeans and a fine knit wool sweater or button downs most days. This winter I wore two pairs of presentable wool trousers that both fit well enough with a belt that I didn\u2019t look too crazy, with very large and long (but nice quality) wool sweaters. It suggests the general idea of a professional-ish person, but renders it impossible to gauge the shape of my body. For spring I\u2019m in dark wash, wide jeans and big button downs. I find for work the trick to mitigate this hobo look is materials, cuts, shoes and coats as well as being groomed. I wear a-line or men\u2019s section coats without belts at the waist. For summer it\u2019s basically the same, only swap jeans for linen suit pants or similar. Colour is also important for looking put-together (and invisible), I have a lot of black and dark blues for bottoms and sweaters because it\u2019s so easy to combine. Trousers that fit me at the waist are usually too tight for my taste over hips, buttocks and legs, so I size way up and alter them at the waist. Probably wouldn\u2019t if I had to pay for the alteration, but I\u2019ve learned how to do it myself. \n\nIf I\u2019m not working it\u2019s very baggy, but nice clothes that I like. I\u2019m currently not in any zoom meetings (halleluja), and the past two weeks I\u2019ve been in just huge, nice heavy cotton t shirts that go beneath the buttocks and beneath the elbow and levi\u2019s high ribcage wide in the indigo wash. I look like a cartoon, but I actually like it very much. And a hooded, thin parka. I prefer clothing that\u2019s not cinched waists and such, I\u2019m sure that helps me. (I realize now I don\u2019t sound terribly chic.)\n\nThe safe hoodie is a hero! My favourite one went out of production, but I wore my last one until the sun and the salt from my persoiration had mostly bleached it from navy to a weird beige:) RIP hoodie (2014-2020)",
