  "selftext": "so much can change in less than a year. 9 months ago, i was close to death and struggling to eat anything but blueberries, protein powder, and oatmeal. it hurt to sit and lay down. i was always freezing and having to go to the hospital. not only that, but i was benched at the end of my school season and missed out on travel ball.\n\n\nnow i\u2019m eating cookies in the middle of the day and going out after practice for slushies. i\u2019m also going to be starting on my varsity team. i\u2019m so much stronger and so much happier, i feel like im thriving. before, i thought that i would hate my body when it was weight restored, but i actually love it and i feel so pretty and lucky to have a healthy body. it took lots, and lots, and lots of pints of ice cream to get where i needed to be before my next school season began, but i actually made my goal of being a starter. i regret all the time i wasted, but i feel like im so much more grateful for everything i have now. \n\n\ni remember joining this group to look for validation or somebody to tell me that i needed to recover. i related so hard to every single post about physical and mental pain. looking through this group now, i sympathize with lots of posts but do not currently relate to them. it feels odd looking through these posts because i used to be the person writing them. anyways, i\u2019m going to be leaving now and i really hope that the person reading this will also be able to leave someday, too\u2764\ufe0f",
