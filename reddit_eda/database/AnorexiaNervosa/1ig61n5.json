  "selftext": "I have always disliked the sterotype that all anorexics don't eat. Thing is, I DO eat. I have the restrictive over exercising type. I do eat, every day. I just heavily restrict my calorie intake. No sugar, veggies are my besties, ew cheese, yay sushi. Despite eating every day, I definitely have the physical effects of malnutrition that comes with long term anorexia.\n\nEdit: some of these replies are making me mad. Just because some of you have never heard that anorexics never eat doesn't invalidate my experience hearing it. Just because some of you have never heard people say/think anorexics don't eat ever doesn't make my post pointless. I made this post to vent my frustration over poeple not understanding anorexia is a mental illness, not 'choosing/refusing not to eat' and that it's more than 'just eat something!'. ",

When I grew up, possibly a few years earlier than some of you in here (?) we didn't even hear that it was a 'mental disorder' when taught about it in school. We were shown photos of a severe anorexic in her twenties that had possibly had it for all her life/adulthood, she was severely malnourished (it was a miracle she was alive).\n\nI was in 6th grade and was naturally thin, but the skinniest in class. And picked on for it, by girls that was jealous and also those who were 'concerned'. We were told Anorexia Nervosa was an 'obsession with dieting and getting skinny as possible', like obsessed with it, and that it was sad because most of those who did it was already thin. Pay attention to 'did it', that's what they said. \n\nWe were also told anorexics refuse to eat, and stop eating. Which meant I wasn't one right? Because I did eat, and I wasn't as skinny as the woman in the photo.\n\nIt can be triggering when people don't understand or aren't educated. All mental illnesses suffer from stigma and people not able to understand unless they have it themselves.",

Pay attention to 'did it', that's what they said. \n\nWe were also told anorexics refuse to eat, and stop eating. Which meant I wasn't one right?

Pay attention to 'did it', that's what they said. \n\nWe were also told anorexics refuse to eat, and stop eating. Which meant I wasn't one right?
