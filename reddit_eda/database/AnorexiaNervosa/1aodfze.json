      "body": "Howdy brother, no are not alone. Eating Disorders are complex and men are frequently underdiagnosed. Your condition and history is notably extreme, but the best thing you can do for yourself is to continue carrying on as you have been. For your reference, I am a 27 year old male.\n\nYou have been in and out of therapy presumably, but it's also important that you get to the root cause of your disorder. There is something somewhere in your life that is psychologically torturing you that you must come to terms with. Not only that, the physiological effects are having a tremendous toll on the longevity and quality of your life.\n\nI am currently on the edge of an eating disorder rn coming out, but I have never been on either side of the extreme spectrums. In fact, my problems were purely environmentally induced I think. Got put in a bad place mentally and I embodied that completely peering into my work and alcohol for comfort. I'd wake up, skip breakfast, morning session of work, workout instead of taking my one hour lunch, come back and worn until everyone had left, then come home to a tall glass of gin and sprite. I had no desire and an aversion to any food even though i would feel so great after forcing myself to eat anything. I would frequently pass out as if i were drunk when i went home almost as soon as i got back from work. This became my routine gradually over time across 3 years, and I am only recently bouncing back from the physiological effects it had on my body.\n\nUnfortunately, my body feels considerably weaker and I eat substantially slower than everyone around me... I first noticed this when a waiter at a restaurant came to me to ask me if I wanted the check or a to go box when I had mostly a full plate still.\n\nWhy do I say this? I want you to know that if my mild struggles had this much effect on my body, you sir will feel that substantially worse and it will be hard...\n\nMy recommendations:\n1) Get to the root of your demons and come to terms with them\n\n2) Start small because your body and mind won't be able to eat like you used to when you were a kid. If you are eating no meals or .5 meals a day on average, shoot for one solid meal with dense macronutrients. Potatoes, broccoli, rice, lean and well seasoned chicken, beans, beets, cod or tilapia, and spinach. Eat clean so your body gets the most out of it, you'll feel so much better.\n\n2A) Next, start incorporating small snacks throughout the day. Nuts, berries, high fat yogurts with fruit in it. Think about this: Bodybuilders don't binge eat to bulk, they eat clean and they eat a lot. Instead of three big meals, they eat 6-8 macro rich small meals. So take small victories.\n\n3) Lastly, don't beat yourself up. You will regress and it will be difficult, but you have to keep trying.\n\nYou are not alone in this, but only you can pull yourself up. Learn to love food again in a healthy way, and show yourself more love brother. It's not your fault whatever started it, but it is your responsibility to fix.\n\nGood Luck",

      "body": "Im 17 year old girl with anorexia and I had an uncle who had anorexia. He didn\u2019t develop his ed till he had a stroke one day. He lost most of his mobility. He didn\u2019t have one at first but my uncle is a big ego person so when he realized his body wasn\u2019t going to be the same again, he stopped trying completely. He told me his eating disorder was the only thing that made him feel he had control over. As years went on it got worse, he became very skinny and his colon and kidneys started to fail because he wasn\u2019t eating or drinking water, which eventually caused severe constipation. He also stopped walking permanently (his decision, he could still walk but he chose to use the wheelchair) Before he died he told me \u201cIt\u2019s never worth the suffering, you\u2019re stronger than me, do what I couldn\u2019t do\u201d I\u2019m not here to tell you a successful story I\u2019m just here to tell you that you\u2019re not alone. But the first step to recovery is wanting to change. Wanting to change is a strong enough thing to keep you motivated, when you relapse don\u2019t beat yourself up about it. Eat things that aren\u2019t as fulfilling, like nuts, applesauce, popcorn. Drink Gatorade and water. Water keeps ur body slim because it eliminates puffiness from sodium intake. The reasoning for my  anorexia is way different than most people but if you want me to share that with you just let me know.",

It has saved my life, it not only made me so hungry but it stopped all me fear around food. I now enjoy food and feel alot happier. I know some people don't like the idea of taking medication, but for me it was this or allow anorexia claim my life.

          "body": "Howdy brother, no are not alone. Eating Disorders are complex and men are frequently underdiagnosed. Your condition and history is notably extreme, but the best thing you can do for yourself is to continue carrying on as you have been. For your reference, I am a 27 year old male.\n\nYou have been in and out of therapy presumably, but it's also important that you get to the root cause of your disorder. There is something somewhere in your life that is psychologically torturing you that you must come to terms with. Not only that, the physiological effects are having a tremendous toll on the longevity and quality of your life.\n\nI am currently on the edge of an eating disorder rn coming out, but I have never been on either side of the extreme spectrums. In fact, my problems were purely environmentally induced I think. Got put in a bad place mentally and I embodied that completely peering into my work and alcohol for comfort. I'd wake up, skip breakfast, morning session of work, workout instead of taking my one hour lunch, come back and worn until everyone had left, then come home to a tall glass of gin and sprite. I had no desire and an aversion to any food even though i would feel so great after forcing myself to eat anything. I would frequently pass out as if i were drunk when i went home almost as soon as i got back from work. This became my routine gradually over time across 3 years, and I am only recently bouncing back from the physiological effects it had on my body.\n\nUnfortunately, my body feels considerably weaker and I eat substantially slower than everyone around me... I first noticed this when a waiter at a restaurant came to me to ask me if I wanted the check or a to go box when I had mostly a full plate still.\n\nWhy do I say this? I want you to know that if my mild struggles had this much effect on my body, you sir will feel that substantially worse and it will be hard...\n\nMy recommendations:\n1) Get to the root of your demons and come to terms with them\n\n2) Start small because your body and mind won't be able to eat like you used to when you were a kid. If you are eating no meals or .5 meals a day on average, shoot for one solid meal with dense macronutrients. Potatoes, broccoli, rice, lean and well seasoned chicken, beans, beets, cod or tilapia, and spinach. Eat clean so your body gets the most out of it, you'll feel so much better.\n\n2A) Next, start incorporating small snacks throughout the day. Nuts, berries, high fat yogurts with fruit in it. Think about this: Bodybuilders don't binge eat to bulk, they eat clean and they eat a lot. Instead of three big meals, they eat 6-8 macro rich small meals. So take small victories.\n\n3) Lastly, don't beat yourself up. You will regress and it will be difficult, but you have to keep trying.\n\nYou are not alone in this, but only you can pull yourself up. Learn to love food again in a healthy way, and show yourself more love brother. It's not your fault whatever started it, but it is your responsibility to fix.\n\nGood Luck",

He told me his eating disorder was the only thing that made him feel he had control over. As years went on it got worse, he became very skinny and his colon and kidneys started to fail because he wasn\u2019t eating or drinking water, which eventually caused severe constipation. He also stopped walking permanently (his decision, he could still walk but he chose to use the wheelchair) Before he died he told me \u201cIt\u2019s never worth the suffering, you\u2019re stronger than me, do what I couldn\u2019t do\u201d I\u2019m not here to tell you a successful story I\u2019m just here to tell you that you\u2019re not alone. But the first step to recovery is wanting to change. Wanting to change is a strong enough thing to keep you motivated, when you relapse don\u2019t beat yourself up about it. Eat things that aren\u2019t as fulfilling, like nuts, applesauce, popcorn. Drink Gatorade and water. Water keeps ur body slim because it eliminates puffiness from sodium intake. The reasoning for my  anorexia is way different than most people but if you want me to share that with you just let me know.",

          "body": "Howdy brother, no are not alone. Eating Disorders are complex and men are frequently underdiagnosed. Your condition and history is notably extreme, but the best thing you can do for yourself is to continue carrying on as you have been. For your reference, I am a 27 year old male.\n\nYou have been in and out of therapy presumably, but it's also important that you get to the root cause of your disorder. There is something somewhere in your life that is psychologically torturing you that you must come to terms with. Not only that, the physiological effects are having a tremendous toll on the longevity and quality of your life.\n\nI am currently on the edge of an eating disorder rn coming out, but I have never been on either side of the extreme spectrums. In fact, my problems were purely environmentally induced I think. Got put in a bad place mentally and I embodied that completely peering into my work and alcohol for comfort. I'd wake up, skip breakfast, morning session of work, workout instead of taking my one hour lunch, come back and worn until everyone had left, then come home to a tall glass of gin and sprite. I had no desire and an aversion to any food even though i would feel so great after forcing myself to eat anything. I would frequently pass out as if i were drunk when i went home almost as soon as i got back from work. This became my routine gradually over time across 3 years, and I am only recently bouncing back from the physiological effects it had on my body.\n\nUnfortunately, my body feels considerably weaker and I eat substantially slower than everyone around me... I first noticed this when a waiter at a restaurant came to me to ask me if I wanted the check or a to go box when I had mostly a full plate still.\n\nWhy do I say this? I want you to know that if my mild struggles had this much effect on my body, you sir will feel that substantially worse and it will be hard...\n\nMy recommendations:\n1) Get to the root of your demons and come to terms with them\n\n2) Start small because your body and mind won't be able to eat like you used to when you were a kid. If you are eating no meals or .5 meals a day on average, shoot for one solid meal with dense macronutrients. Potatoes, broccoli, rice, lean and well seasoned chicken, beans, beets, cod or tilapia, and spinach. Eat clean so your body gets the most out of it, you'll feel so much better.\n\n2A) Next, start incorporating small snacks throughout the day. Nuts, berries, high fat yogurts with fruit in it. Think about this: Bodybuilders don't binge eat to bulk, they eat clean and they eat a lot. Instead of three big meals, they eat 6-8 macro rich small meals. So take small victories.\n\n3) Lastly, don't beat yourself up. You will regress and it will be difficult, but you have to keep trying.\n\nYou are not alone in this, but only you can pull yourself up. Learn to love food again in a healthy way, and show yourself more love brother. It's not your fault whatever started it, but it is your responsibility to fix.\n\nGood Luck",
