  "selftext": "This probably sounds insane but I am scared to not be the \u201cskinny\u201d girl anymore.  A little context I am (22F) and have been dealing with anorexia since I was about 14 so it\u2019s pretty much all I know myself as. I\u2019ve realized pretty much all the attention I get from guys and girls is pretty much because of my size and if I am not the skinny one I\u2019ll just be the same and no one will want me.  I don\u2019t think guys find this attractive but it\u2019s at least cute and small is feminine and being uw is something girls I don\u2019t already know or just met will talk to me about so if I am just \u201cnormal\u201d or worse bigger then I won\u2019t have anything.  Is this crazy?",
