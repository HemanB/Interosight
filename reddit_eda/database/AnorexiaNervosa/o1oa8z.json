  "selftext": "Does anyone else sometimes use their ED as, like, self harm? I really do hate my body and most of it is about my weight and how I look, but sometimes if I\u2019m angry at myself for something or just in a bad mood I\u2019m general I tell myself that I don\u2019t deserve to eat or I don\u2019t deserve to be healthy or I don\u2019t deserve to have food and then it becomes really self destructive\u2026 I used to self harm in other ways but I\u2019ve been clean for a while but this feels almost like a new way to do that that I\u2019ve adopted.",
