  "selftext": "I've had a bit of a relapse over the past few weeks. My brain fog has been crazy, to the point where I was hanging out with my boyfriend today and simply struggling to keep up conversation. I had no thoughts. No opinions. Nothing to offer to the discussion. I felt so *boring*. It wasn't even like all I was thinking about was food, I just wasn't thinking about anything. \n\nFor me, the whole 'food is fuel' idea was never particularly helpful when it came to recovery. I didn't really care about my physical health. I'm not that athletic, I'm happy to be weak physically. \n\nBut mentally? \n\nWithout food, your brain is starved. How are people meant to hear all the interesting things I have to say, all the opinions I have - everything that makes me the person people know me to be, if my brain has nothing to run on? Who cares if I'm a little skinnier when I'm quiet and apathetic? I'm happier when I'm fuelled, and when I'm happier, I'm funnier. I'm more extroverted, spontaneous, chatty. I am the person I am.\n\nThat's why I'm going to eat. That is why. I don't want to be the person who has no energy to do anything. \n\n",

It\u2019s to the point where he voiced I seemed less interested in him/being around him. I know eating is the fix but I admittedly am still telling myself I can \u201cwork around it,\u201d I know I can\u2019t though. I\u2019m so glad you are taking this as a sign to take care of yourself. The people around you unfortunately do notice the behaviors changing, they just don\u2019t understand why.",

My whole life I've been considered 'ugly ' and after gaining weight aaah I can't tell you how ugly I feel everyday especially when you have pretty friends. So to me skinny is almost equivalent to becoming more beautiful and confident and actually feeling like I'm worth something. About memories and experiences ,i look at my old photos and just think about how fat I looked and what  other people must've thought about me after seeing me back then \ud83e\udd23 and how embarassing it was to be the ugliest there ( cause I was not skinny)",
