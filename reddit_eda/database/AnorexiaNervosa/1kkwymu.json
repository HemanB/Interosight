It's so fucked up. ProAna is awful, and while I don't have any personal hatred towards those who post it (because they clearly need serious therapy), I do think they need to take serious responsibility for it. They are accountable for messing up the minds of young impressionable people like myself 12 years ago. \n\nIf you are ProAna, or if you need a space to let your ED express itself, please make it a private page at least.
