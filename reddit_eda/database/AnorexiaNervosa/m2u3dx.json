I was alone in that whole experience, didn\u2019t know anybody or talk about it until I joined this sub a few weeks back. But even way back then, I had these exact apps and was addicted to checking them constantly. I didn\u2019t realize this was common, but maybe that\u2019s my naivety speaking. I wish you all the luck! This is a big step, I\u2019m proud of you. It\u2019s a positive. maybe one day if you ever re download this app, it will be for staying healthy and strong instead of counting calories and BMI. Until then, it\u2019d be wise to stay away for now. Much love to you xx",
