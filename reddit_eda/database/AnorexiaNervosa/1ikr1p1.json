  "title": "Triggered by an obese man on the bus",
  "selftext": "I take public transit. I was on my way home. A morbidly obese man got on the bus and sat a couple row ahead of me. THIS POST IS NOT TO SHAME THE MAN. I know being that obese is an eating disorder as well. He started eating takeout food he has and I just.... couldn't take it. Something in me just got triggered. My anorexia shrieked at me to move. I got up and move. All I could think of was the calories he was consuming. In my mind I was screaming at him. This was the first time I was triggered like that. Even from the back of the bus I could still smell the food. It was a very uncomfortable bus ride.\n\nAnyone else triggered by people eating around them? \n\nEdit: okay, since some people want to put malice behind my words. Let me repeat again, this post was NOT to shame the man. I would have been triggered if he was in fit or thin as well. I did NOT say anything to him and didn't tell him he was disgusting. I said nothing and quietly moved to the back of the bus. I get uncomfortable seeing my coworkers (who are fit) eat during lunch too but being triggered like this was different. I've never thought I could absorb calories by smelling the food. That's a new intrusive thought for me. \n\nYes, I get triggered by my coworkers who are thin/fit eating in the cafeteria but what makes it different is I can flee. On a bus, I could no flee. I felt like a trapped rat. ",

I wish I could eat what I wanted and experience all the flavours of foods that I miss, but it's then terrifying to know that I could blow up if I let my body control my mind like that. \n\nOne of the first times I was food triggered was by my father (obese) eating like a pig, really snuffling and stuffing his face, I think he has a binge eating disorder, but it was so revolting to me and any time I eat too fast, I'm reminded of how he eats. \n\nI think it's valid to be triggered by anything relating to food.

My worst nightmare is seeing a post like this and thinking it\u2019s about me if I had been a man on a bus that day. Thinking someone was disgusted by me for my weight and food choices. \n\nIt also perpetuates the stereotype that people with restrictive eating disorders are judgmental toward others. There\u2019s a difference between hating yourself and being an asshole and posts like these cross the threshold. A symptom of anorexia is low SELF esteem, this is just a lack of empathy. I would never make a post like this. This post could\u2019ve easily been rephrased to avoid potentially hurting people\u2019s feelings and triggering the shit out of an already vulnerable population. This was really sad to read. People in this sub\u2019s worst fear is being perceived like this man when in reality, most people just mind their own business. Poor guy was minding his own business, eating his food and is getting shamed for existing. \n\nTLDR- Fat shaming other people isn\u2019t an eating disorder symptom. Nothing to do with the illness. Plenty of people without eating disorders are disgusted by obesity and vocalize it. You are in the same boat as those other judgmental people, ED or not. Take this to a therapist to get over your anxiety over other people\u2019s weight. It\u2019s a different problem and inappropriate for this sub.",

I showed a distinct lack of empathy since I was a child but I am much more empathetic than I was. \n\nI tried to make it very clear in my post I was NOT triggered by the man's weight. I stated very clearly I was not shaming him for his weight. It was intake of calories that triggered me. I didn't say anything to him. I quietly moved to the back of the bus. Despite what anorexia was screaming at me, I realized he and I both have eating disorders. I'm no better than he is just because I am very underweight.",

Obesity doesn\u2019t equate to an eating disorder. Sometimes it\u2019s a medical issue with a lack of access to healthcare, sometimes it\u2019s medication that causes rapid weight gain and they are to figure out how to balance hormones. I had a friend that became overweight in 3 weeks due to chemo. You made an assumption. \n\nAnd yes, I think the \u201cthin person triggered\u2026\u201d would get less attention on this sub. Because the main symptom of this illness is a fear of gaining weight. And when you post about a regular man, at a higher weight, just living his day to day life without knowing his health status and then making it sound like you\u2019re disgusted by this person\u2026 how do you think the audience of this subreddit will react? I\u2019m not talking about the comments, I\u2019m not talking about myself. Imagine a fat (by bmi standards) person with an eating disorder coming across this post. Imagine how that would feel. \n\nYou\u2019re not the only person who has posted something along these lines and you won\u2019t be the last. I don\u2019t know how mods would implement a rule to prevent these kind of posts because everyone has their threshold. This crossed a line for me, personally. It\u2019s okay if it doesn\u2019t for you or anyone else. But I will express my opinion, just like others have.\n\nI don\u2019t know how this post could possibly benefit anyone, even to commiserate. This could set people back if their fear is eating in public. It just makes me sad because this sub is so vulnerable. I am mindful of that whenever I have posted or commented.",

It seems because I lack empathy that makes me less of a person to you. Good for you that you're naturally empathetic. I'm not. I know this about myself. I get judged a lot for not being a naturally empathetic person. It's assumed I am a bad person and some even have told me it makes me \"*born evil*\". I'm not a bad or evil person and I do try to be aware of what I say/post. I do have autism so that makes it much harder.",

The fact that you recognize that is respectable. I don\u2019t think it makes you inherently evil. But that is why I\u2019m giving you feedback and telling you bluntly how harmful this post is for so many people and all I can do is hope that you\u2019re receptive. You\u2019re not alone in your opinion just as I\u2019m not alone in mine. But just as you have a right to post your thoughts, I have the right to an opinion on your thoughts. And I told you my opinion, do with it what you will. I would hope you\u2019re receptive but you might not be and I can\u2019t control that. I\u2019m in recovery and I discuss darker thoughts with my therapist bc even the potential of harming anyone else is not worth the risk. I think that this issue in particular would be best to discuss with a mental health professional, not with people who struggle with weight issues. That\u2019s all I have to say.",
