I\u2019d expect that from a family member or friend but 2 therapist who proceeded to inform everyone I was being greedy. Hah gotta love them for it. 5 weeks later I was threatened to go inpatient as my heart was failing. That was in august 2020, to date it\u2019s up to 6 times threatening to go in. In 5 months. \n\nThen my eating disorder therapist didn\u2019t do anything apart from say want me to call the hospital, you\u2019re wrong, why you acting like that. Hey you gained, you must\u2019ve eaten a lot. Literally gonna run away from the clinic and play \u2018hide and seek\u2019. \n\nIf it happens again (unlikely cause I\u2019m on a new mental health therapist instead of an eating one) I\u2019ll run into the center and go into a place they least expect, a restaurant bathroom for example, or a diy shop. Cause why would a 16 year old female go into a building supplies store? Especially when a few doors down is a pet store w animals in?\n\nThis is a personal example, based on me and my preferences and location. My clinic is on the outskirts on a large town, 40 min walk from the centre. There\u2019s a retail park with a diy shop, home shop, mattress shop, pet store, bed shops... etc typically theyd go where you like, so pick a random place. The shop people also wouldn\u2019t know. I\u2019d personally say avoid food places as they might think it\u2019s a double bluff. Aka they might think you\u2019ll go to maccies as it\u2019s an unlikely place. Nah go really random.",

It hurts when they say something and you almost instantaneously  brace yourself for whatever cruel thing they may throw at you next.\n\nAnd that's called verbal/emotional abuse, queen. There's no other way around it. If it's a repeated  pattern that you've seen over and over, that pattern is called abuse. They won't do it in front of your friends usually, and they'll find subtle ways to punish you in public \u2014 but it's still abuse.\n\nI'm not trying to tell you to call the cops on yohr Mom, I just want you to know that (a) it is not okay how she treats you, (b) there IS help and a way out, and ( c ) what you're feeling is completely valid; you are not alone and it's 100% okay to cry.\n\nYour situation really blows. Really. I'm sorry you're having a rough go with your mom - especially while you're at a clinic. Again, it sounds like the combination of emotional and verbal abuse from her - which is all just used to put you down.

And you deserve so much better than this. \ud83d\udc96\n\nIf you get the opportunity while you're there, please reach out to a counsellor, therapist or group facilitator. The psych doctors tend not to be very helpful for dealing with the feelings you're experiencing, but I've had some very positive and heartwarming talks with, say, the art therapist and group counsellor who were on my unit. Even some of the other patients and nurses can lend an empathetic ear. You're not alone, queen. I swear.\n\nWorst case scenario you have us. \ud83e\udd21\n\nAlso: if you feel comfortable doing so... please mention your mother, the things she says, and how she makes you feel. Tell a therapist, a caseworker, another girl at the clinic... Anyone. tell anyone that you feel you can trust. \n\nBecause no one should be made to feel like they aren't good enough. And you are, sweetie. You are *so* good enough.\n\nSorry for the tl;dr, but I wanted to do justice by you! \ud83d\ude05 All my love and well wishes with the treatment, queen \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96 You can do this.",
