  "selftext": "Hi, I\u2019m scared to post this because it really is so gross but during the last few months i\u2019ve started to chew my food, and then spitting it out. It\u2019s become a way for me to literally devour as much food as a I want and take as big of bites as a I want while have all the enjoyment of food, but not feeling so guilty after. Has anyone else done this or have I gone too far?",

I gained weight more weight than I gained in the hospital doing this. It is actually what made me stop. But it also was bad on my teeth because I was constantly chomping on sugar and refined foods. Cavities were an issue for the first time in my life.  So what you are doing is not at all uncommon but there are repercussions of all kinds. Not to mention you are just spitting out money too.
