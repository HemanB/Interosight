  "selftext": "like once dinner hits i literally have no control. and i know how i feel after so you would think my body would be like \u201chey let\u2019s not deal with extreme guilt and feeling horrible for the rest of the night\u201d but no i eat until i feel sick. like easter dinner i could not stop eating. and it\u2019s probably because my body just wants food but even if i eat a little during the day i still eat so much food at dinner so in my head i\u2019m like well if i\u2019m just gonna binge at dinner eat the smallest amount you can during the day so you don\u2019t go over your calories. but honestly on most days i\u2019ll eat my regular food which is not enough for a person normally but for me i\u2019m full but dinner then hits and i binge. i don\u2019t know it\u2019s just annoying. does anyone else also have this issue where they just eat until they feel sick no matter what?",
