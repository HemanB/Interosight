My ED history isn't the classic definition of anorexia, more binge/restrict than total avoiding although periods of prolonged fasting after a binge was also a thing. So, fast food was very much a trigger to the point my heart got so bad I was allowed to miss at least 1 day of work a month to go to the ER. I was only 29. So getting to a mindset that broke the binge/restrict cycle and adopt a more morally neutral look towards nutrition, my body and sense of self is a lot. I am now 40 with a much more stable cardiovascular system. I can enjoy candy or treats  from time to time without worrying if I will go into a spiral or the hospital. \n\nDuring my time when I was working to stabilize my BMI and heart health my mom wasn't sure if I would want a birthday cake for my birthday. I said of course I would. It's a celebration and just part of making all foods normal. It's part of life. The more banal you can make something, the more likely you will succeed in that outcome.",
