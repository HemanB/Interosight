      "body": "Congrats on starting recovery!\n\nI think the need to feel/look sick enough comes down to needing a sense of safety. Starving is familiar, the knowledge that you have full control over an aspect of your life (food intake) is comforting and your body reflecting these efforts makes you feel powerful and capable. Once you start to recover, you begin acting against your perceived core beliefs which makes you question many things. Anorexia is very validating and when you deviate from familiar behaviors, everything becomes confusing. \nBut keep in mind that this will pass with time. The initial refeeding period is horrible, but you eventually get used to eating and eating enough and eating multiple times a day. Over time you start to find validation in other things, for example your accomplishments. \n\nWhat helped me was understanding why I still wanted to look/feel/be as sick as possible and then to find reasons why I can\u2019t be in that state anymore. So if you have access to professional help, please use it - it really makes a world of a difference. \n\nThis article from Psychology Today helped me put things into perspective when I first started to recover two and a half years ago: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/a-hunger-artist/201808/the-six-seductions-of-anorexia",

      "body": "First of all- amazing job working towards healing! I\u2019ve been in the kind of relapse-recovery loop before, and this time my recovery has lasted a while, and I\u2019m feeling optimistic. \n\nI think what helped with me to weaken my identity towards the ED was a few things: \n\nI made an effort to avoid ED related communities (although I absolutely agree there are benefits to some in some ways, sometimes. Use discretion). Doing this helped me to limit ED thoughts and open me up to replacing that time with other things: art, video games, movies, learning other things, etc. \n\nI also tried to place more emphasis on the benefits of any food I was eating, even if it was a \u201csafe\u201d food or not. Olive oil? Healthy fat now- great for hair and skin! Bread? Satiating boost of energy to power me though what I wanna work on!\n\nI also found it helpful to be intentional about who was around me when I was weaker and more likely to slip. Even people with good intentions maybe could trigger me into identifying with the disorder more when they\u2019d bring up supporting me in different ways. Instead, it was so much more beneficial to spend time around people who love me and knew about it, but managed to remain neutral about slips and successes related to my eating. This does add a need for accountability on my end, but the neutrality demonstrated that these people trusted ME to recover.  The more freedom I had to pace my own recovery helped me feel so much safer losing my ed identity. \n\nI also found comfort wearing loose clothes during weight restoration of recovery to make the body changes less scary.\n\nI also limited access and use of my scale.\n\nAs I shift my energy to other things, the voice just started to not come in anymore. I appreciate my healthy body and the things I can do with my whole heart so much more fully now. \n\nI recognize everyone\u2019s recovery journey is different, and these are just the things that worked with me, but I hope you can find hope in these things too. \nThe identifying with anorexia part was absolutely the hardest part for me too, and I believe in you!!!!!",
