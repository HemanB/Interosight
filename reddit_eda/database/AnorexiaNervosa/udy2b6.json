  "selftext": "I have severe enduring anorexia. and my doctor told me I may have the beginning stages of organ failure from untreated anorexia nervosa. she said organ failure is very likely to happen. I was told by several therapists, my nutritionist and my doctor that I would probably die. my parents are in denial. they say I am not going to die, but I truly feel so weak this is a possibility now. I cannot go back to treatment. I am losing weight without trying. my body is having trouble absorbing calories and nutrients from food. treatment wouldn't fix me at this point. this is scary and I am obviously upset and angry I didn't treat my eating disorder sooner. I do not want to be losing weight. I hate that I am so sick and underweight, but my body is now damaged. Anorexia nervosa is not a weight loss method. it is not a diet that you start. it is a debilitating mental illness that consumes the lives of the people who have it. people who have anorexia do not want to be suffering like this. we do not want to be in pain like this. it's not a choice. I would give anything to be healthy and happy and have my life back the way it was before. When I see someone saying they wish they had anorexia, I honestly want to cry. And I have cried a lot lately.",

You don\u2019t have to think any farther about doing anything more than that one small step. Once you call you\u2019ll have more information to inform your choices.\nI\u2019m just an internet stranger but I really want you to be okay. My sibling says there is hope for everyone.
