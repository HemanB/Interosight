My whole life revolved around arts and crafts and baking from the start, and well, i just practiced a lot, because i see my hobbies as a way of escaping bad stuff :) but to be honest, i failed at many things, like, i tried gargening but all my plants failed, and I'm really bad at studying, and sports too..Don't give up on finding an interest that works for you, it just takes a little time,I'm rooting for you! \u2764\ufe0fI'm not sure if I'm talented in drawing haha.. But i definitely improved from that time :) i could share more art if you guys are curious though! :)",
