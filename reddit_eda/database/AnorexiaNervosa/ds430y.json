  "title": "My wife is deep in a relapse and we have no options, I don't know how to stay sane and support her. I just want her to have the help she deserves.",
  "selftext": "My wife is anorexic, and I try very hard to be as supportive and encouraging as I can. She is relapsing extremely bad and she has no health insurance and though she's in therapy, the therapist has absolutely no experience with Eds. I try so hard to listen, and support, and be a positive influence when I'm able. I always remember that she is the one going through this, not me. \n\nBut y'all, I am fucking terrified. Last year my wife had a very similar pattern of relapse which ended in inpatient treatment and medical stabilization, but now that is not an option as far as I can tell. \n\nShe has this awful voice inside her, a monster and it's becoming so vocal that sometimes when we talk I can see that her eating disorder is talking to me, not her. The coldness and hatred of herself is so loud and clear and it breaks my heart. I tell her every day in every way how wonderful and kind and good and worthy she is of love and of food. That she doesn't deserve to suffer. That she will still be a great student if she doesn't have an eating disorder, and that no one will judge her or think she was lying about her eating disorder once she is in recovery. (These are reminders she has asked me to vocalize in order to help her)\n\nY'all I feel like I do BATTLE every single day - not as much as she does, bless her, cuz that voice ain't in my head, but... I have no idea what to do. I'm a wreck. I knew when we started dating, hell I knew when I was even CONSIDERING dating her that there was a chance she could die... And I accepted that risk, and I still do. I've told her time and time again that no matter what I will be by her side. But I don't want to lose her. She is a goddamn beautiful soul, a fuckin princess, my soul mate. I love her and I don't want to see her in pain, and I don't want to watch helplessly. \n\nI don't even know what I'm asking for in this post. Maybe it's just a vent. I love you all, and I believe in you, and you all deserve love, kindness, and peace from within \u2764\ufe0f",

All I can say is tell her she's beautiful every day. Luckily I have wonderful insurance and see a therapist 3x a week. But I know this isn't the norm because who can afford it. But my husband has said we would figure it all out and get treatment so I can get better and stable and not Relapse. I hope this helps but you are not alone my husband has even joined me at therapy sessions to understand the journey and what recovery is going to take. I hope this helps and I hope your wife recovers and doesn't Relapse.",
