  "selftext": "Like the title goes I crave and hate the food in the same time. Anyone here with the same or similar situation? The situation is so ambivalent. It feels like the two persons inside of me are fighting. I was fat all my life and now when I am finally thin (I have lost a lot, A lot of weight) - boom - the war broke out. I don't want to be fat ever again. I would rather die thin and emaciated than to be fat and have a large fat stomach and butt. By the way, I am male, 26 years old if that means anything.\n\nAlso, people are scared of me. They say that I now look like a skeleton. My hair is falling out, I did not have an erection for months now. Sexual drive is not there anymore. Oh and the thirst. I don't feel the thirst. All the water that I take in comes from my single meal - apples. Thank you Universe for the apples. Only three apples a day and that is all. No other food.\n\nI lie when someone asks do I eat. Plus hypotension. When I get up from a chair or a couch I get dizzy and blackness covers my eyes. I hit my head once like that. Almost died. Awful. But yet again I want to stay like this. I count every single calorie, I weigh myself every few days, write down food that I ate even if that food was just like I said - apples.\n\nI get hyped when I see that I lost more weight. Smile gets on my face. It feels so good.\n\nI had to take this from my chest...",

I was sick of not being able to see my belt, and yes I loved food but hated the fact that it made me gain a lot of weight by adding teasing that I received all the time.
