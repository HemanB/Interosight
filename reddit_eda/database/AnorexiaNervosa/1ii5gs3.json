There's also the \"tics\" of the tape measurer that distinguish what it is. \n\nI'm just saying my immediate first impression before I saw the caption was that it was hair. It looks great either way.  I think art can be rly cool when you can view it from multiple perspectives as well. So I wouldn't worry about what should have been done differently. It's rly not a detractor to me that I thought it might have been something else at first.",
