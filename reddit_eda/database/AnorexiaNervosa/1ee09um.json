  "selftext": "Hi everyone. I'm sure that some of you have noticed that we have an increase in trolls coming into our community and saying awful things to our members. As a result of this, we have set a minimum karma requirement for comments. This means that everyone that does not meet our threshold minimum will have their comments removed by automod. It is our hope that this action will prevent the vast majority of comments from these trolls, because as of right now they have been exclusively using brand new accounts and burning them after a few dozen messages, just to come back with a new one. \n\nUnfortunately, this action *will* prevent some well-meaning new users from being able to comment. However, hopefully (if I've coded it properly) this won't prevent them from making their own posts. We've added a note in the removal message that any users that require support while they grow their karma (it is a low amount, but larger than 0) should join the subreddit's affiliated Discord server (https://discord.gg/4jyQ7Zfr9P). \n\nIf some of these trolls slip past the new requirement, then the best thing that you can do is to immediately ***report*** the offending comment, and moderators will remove it as soon as we are able. Do not engage with the trolls. Not only will it only fuel their pathetic fire, but it will also cause more of a delay in us removing the comment as we then have more to read through. Don't engage, don't fight back. Just remember that they're pathetic no-lifes and don't deserve your attention. ***Report and move on.*** \n\nIt is an unfortunate reality of the internet that trolls are everywhere and are unending. Thankfully, new technology has led to us being better equipped to handle them more efficiently and effectively. Report troll posts and comments, and also any rule-breaking posts or comments, and we'll take care of the rest. \n\nIf trolls start to DM you, then report them to us through modmail and then report their harassing DMs to Reddit admins so they stand a chance of getting their accounts suspended or banned. \n\nThanks for reading. If you have any questions, comments or concerns, then please feel free to comment them under this post or modmail them to us and we will address them as soon as we are able. \n\n- r/AnorexiaNervosa moderators.

Rule 3: Anyone is welcome here - aka, you were being rude or threatening. And rule 6: glorifying the eating disorder, or glorifying other unsafe and harmful practices. \n\nSo as a recap, considering I doubt you read the reasons behind why your posts/comments were removed. Rule one is pretty self-explanatory as to why it was enacted. Participating in pro-ED behaviors means that you were either encouraging that other vulnerable people continue to slowly kill themselves, or asking for others to encourage you to do so. Rule three was enacted so we don't have a subreddit full of unrestrained dicks insulting, harassing, or threatening our community - and also so we don't have members invalidating others for whatever no-good reason. Rule six was enacted so we don't have people coming here and being further encouraged into their ED because all they see are posts and comments praising the eating disorder, claiming that it's the next best thing since sliced bread. \n\nNow, I'm sure that not all of your removed additions were meant to harm our community maliciously. However, the fact of the matter is that they were going to, so we removed them not to censor you, but to *protect this community.* It's understandable that a lot of people don't quite understand the reasons behind why we remove posts but trust me that there *are* nuances for many of our rules and we take them into consideration. We know what we're doing. \n\nNo one is holding a gun to your own, or your *friends'* heads. You're free to just not participate if you don't like our community. I won't miss removing your pro-ED, rude, or glorifying posts - those are the ones I despise the most, because they're just reminders that not only are some people incapable of following the rules, but some people are just bad people. I'm sure you're just a peach, though.",
