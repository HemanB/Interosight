      "body": "The DSM (even the latest one) doesn't really accurately represent the thoughts behind anorexia. It's a disease of thoughts that influence behavior so the thoughts you have about wanting food are normal but the thoughts you have about overriding that natural urge to eat is where the disorder comes in to play, for all of us! Basically, we all \"want\" food because it comes preprogrammed in our brains but the interfering / interrupting thoughts are experienced at all different degrees in the community...the interference is the disorder...i hope that makes sense. Basically your disorder is valid and its probably tricking you into thinking you don't have ED! <3",
