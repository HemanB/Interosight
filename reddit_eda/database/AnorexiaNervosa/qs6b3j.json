  "selftext": "I was in psychology class in my collage, (collage specially for psychology and similar) when teacher started telling hurtful comments about anorexia and bulimia. I won't tell all of it but one of the comments was \"I onice saw anorexic girl, she was just bones and skin and she was so ugly\". At this point I started getting triggered but I managed to stay silent UNTIL he said comment about need to have certain body to be considered anorexic. I snaped at that moment and started arguing with him. I told him that anorexia is mental illness and had nothing to do with being too skinny. You can be too skinny because of other illnesses like any type of cancer patients can end up being extremely skinny. And he had audacity to say \"so you're telling me fat people can have anorexia?\" and on top of that, whole class started laughing. But I didn't gave up, I continue with my arguing but he didn't even want to listen and just said \"Okay I don't know those medical words and I don't care\". \n\nTHAT SAME PEOPLE ARE TEACHERS. That person is teaching whole class that you have to look like you're dying if you want diagnosis and that you don't deserve one if you're anything by that. \n\nI had many stories about psychologists and psychiatric doing something so unprofessional that made me not want to go and seek help ever again. One of them told me I'm lazy waste of space for having depression. 15 minutes after that I wanted to kill myself in the hospital bathroom. \n\nThere is professional and good ones but there's so much stigma still going around mental illnesses.",
