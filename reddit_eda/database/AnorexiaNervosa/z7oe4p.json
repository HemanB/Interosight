  "selftext": "I have had really bad chewing and spitting for months. Heaps of it, and really gross. I won\u2019t go into what I would do but it\u2019s very shameful. Every day I would tell myself it\u2019s the last time, and every day I\u2019d do it again.\n\nYesterday was my birthday and I told myself I would go through the day without chewing and spitting as a gift to my family. I got through it yesterday without any of that, and even managed to eat some cake without purging. And today too! The temptation is very strong still, and I hope I have the resolve and strength to keep going. \n\nIf I can stop, even just for a day, it is possible for you. \u2764\ufe0f",
