  "title": "How do people without anorexia not worry about their weight",
  "selftext": "I generally wonder how people who are at a healthy weight, are able to eat healthy and eat enough food, without starving themselves, without obsessively checking the scale, without constantly thinking about what they eat and how it's prepared. How healthy people who aren't anorexic can just try a new food because it sounds good. How they go about their day, without constantly worrying about the number on the scale\n\nI know the obvious answer is they aren't anorexic. Some people who are not anorexic have disordered eating or they go on diets, but it never turns into anorexia. But I am mostly talking about people who are able to maintain a naturally healthy weight, while not starving themselves. They do not overeat or undereat, and they do not suffer health complications because of it\n\nThat used to be me, before this illness came into my life. I have been naturally thin, my entire life. Before my illness, I could eat what I wanted, without having to strictly monitor my food intake or constantly check my weight. My weight was just at a healthy weight. I never went above or below the number. Then one day, I decided to step on a scale and for some reason, couldn't stop losing weight\n\nSo now I am very underweight. And I miss how I was before. I miss not worrying about food or weight gain. But now that I am underweight, I am a lot more anxious than I ever was at my previously healthy weight. At my healthy weight, my mom always told me how pretty I was. But ever since I have been sick with anorexia, my mom always asks me what I am eating and is always worrying about me. She no longer calls me pretty. She sees how my illness changed me. No one in my family suffers from anorexia so it is a very isolating thing to go through. Also, I find returning to my previously healthy weight, the weight I once felt confident at, to be very anxiety provoking. Even when people tell me I wouldn't be overweight if I ate more and that gaining weight would improve my health and quality of life. I know I wouldn't be overweight if I ate more. But the idea of the number increasing is what bothers me. I know I would still be naturally thin. It's in my genetics. But the idea of the number going above where I want it to be is what I have anxiety about. \n\nThis disorder can change your thinking and how you view yourself. It is why anorexic people often do not stop losing weight, even when others approach them and tell them they are becoming too thin. I lost my freedom when I stood on the scale. ",

      "body": "(sorry for such a long comment, its hard to find words for this topic for me)  \n  \nI had anorexia for a period of time (before 18yo) and I fully believed that even IF I recovered, I would never feel positive about my body, my eating habits and what people thought/associated when they saw my body.  \n  \nI can now (I'm 26) say that I live a day to day life where my body size and what I eat are neutral things, its just like the color of my skin and brushing my teeth \u2014 I'm neutral about them, and think about them basically only in terms of objective health. Of course there are some practical aspects that annoy me like not being able to use a clothing item because it doesn't fit and I really liked it (big or small, its the same feeling). While in the past this would've made me spiral into a series of actions of self hate and control, now I start thinking where I could find another piece of clothing that I love and if anyone I know would like my item now that I'm not going to use it anymore. I can look at a picture where I don't feel like the angle/light flattered me and not feel disgusted, it simply is that: a non-flatering picture, that means nothing about my value as a person.\n\nI wish I had a step-by-step to how this change happened, but maybe its too personal/complex to be applied to everybody. I was heavily depressed while anorexic and while in recovery, and after recovery as well \u2014 turned out to be frustration and devaluation caused by untreated ADHD. When my anorexia started I was a little socially isolated and the friends I did have were people that cared a lot about how they looked, projected their frustrations and modeled this projection by commenting how others look and attaching value to it. I had been friends with them for years before this \u2014 this was my (perceived) reality.  \nWhen I changed schools I was in kind of a forced recovery because I was being closely monitored by a family member, however my mind was still completely focused on anorexia. Then the social scenario changed: these new colleagues didn't really care much about people's looks besides some comments on fashion / self expression. I noticed they were much more content with their lives, they had many more interests and hobbies and most of all, they showed me a reality beyond superficial value and I couldn't ignore anymore how shallow I had been towards myself: masked self-hate as some kind of need to adapt to a standard that whoever the fuck created. I started feeling a bit shameful of being so self centered, tried to model confidence (felt weird and forced for years, but \"fake it till you make it\" worked in the end) and never let myself be surrounded by superficial people again (not online and not in person either), made an effort to eliminate triggers from my life (deleted inspo accounts, deleted tumblr, actively rejected suggestions from my \"for you\" pages, tried thinking of myself as someone else to garner empathy because I could never be so cruel with others as I was to myself etc). At this point I still struggled but I did feel like a percentage of the time my brain spent thinking about body image was starting to be spent on other things that actually brought me joy/a challenge like trying new movie genres, meeting new people, finding hobbies, deciding next steps. Always trying to get away from what made me so sad, selfish and controlling. Eventually I could even workout again without associating weightloss to it, just strength.  \nI can't pinpoint where the tables turned but one random day (not so long ago tbh) I realized that I couldn't remember a recent event where I had felt shame/disgust/depressed relating to my body.\n\nAgain, I don't have the steps for it, but I like to think that if I had read something like this I could've found a little hope sooner.",

I guess other than people who are obese/other eating disorders. It\u2019s painful and I envy everyone around me . ESPECIALLY naturally skinny people who just somehow perfectly regulate their weight without trying + still eating fast food etc",

          "body": "(sorry for such a long comment, its hard to find words for this topic for me)  \n  \nI had anorexia for a period of time (before 18yo) and I fully believed that even IF I recovered, I would never feel positive about my body, my eating habits and what people thought/associated when they saw my body.  \n  \nI can now (I'm 26) say that I live a day to day life where my body size and what I eat are neutral things, its just like the color of my skin and brushing my teeth \u2014 I'm neutral about them, and think about them basically only in terms of objective health. Of course there are some practical aspects that annoy me like not being able to use a clothing item because it doesn't fit and I really liked it (big or small, its the same feeling). While in the past this would've made me spiral into a series of actions of self hate and control, now I start thinking where I could find another piece of clothing that I love and if anyone I know would like my item now that I'm not going to use it anymore. I can look at a picture where I don't feel like the angle/light flattered me and not feel disgusted, it simply is that: a non-flatering picture, that means nothing about my value as a person.\n\nI wish I had a step-by-step to how this change happened, but maybe its too personal/complex to be applied to everybody. I was heavily depressed while anorexic and while in recovery, and after recovery as well \u2014 turned out to be frustration and devaluation caused by untreated ADHD. When my anorexia started I was a little socially isolated and the friends I did have were people that cared a lot about how they looked, projected their frustrations and modeled this projection by commenting how others look and attaching value to it. I had been friends with them for years before this \u2014 this was my (perceived) reality.  \nWhen I changed schools I was in kind of a forced recovery because I was being closely monitored by a family member, however my mind was still completely focused on anorexia. Then the social scenario changed: these new colleagues didn't really care much about people's looks besides some comments on fashion / self expression. I noticed they were much more content with their lives, they had many more interests and hobbies and most of all, they showed me a reality beyond superficial value and I couldn't ignore anymore how shallow I had been towards myself: masked self-hate as some kind of need to adapt to a standard that whoever the fuck created. I started feeling a bit shameful of being so self centered, tried to model confidence (felt weird and forced for years, but \"fake it till you make it\" worked in the end) and never let myself be surrounded by superficial people again (not online and not in person either), made an effort to eliminate triggers from my life (deleted inspo accounts, deleted tumblr, actively rejected suggestions from my \"for you\" pages, tried thinking of myself as someone else to garner empathy because I could never be so cruel with others as I was to myself etc). At this point I still struggled but I did feel like a percentage of the time my brain spent thinking about body image was starting to be spent on other things that actually brought me joy/a challenge like trying new movie genres, meeting new people, finding hobbies, deciding next steps. Always trying to get away from what made me so sad, selfish and controlling. Eventually I could even workout again without associating weightloss to it, just strength.  \nI can't pinpoint where the tables turned but one random day (not so long ago tbh) I realized that I couldn't remember a recent event where I had felt shame/disgust/depressed relating to my body.\n\nAgain, I don't have the steps for it, but I like to think that if I had read something like this I could've found a little hope sooner.",
