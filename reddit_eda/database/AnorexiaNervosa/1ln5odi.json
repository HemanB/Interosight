  "selftext": "All my tumblr mutuals for YEARS have told me it is the single best ED movie in existence.\n\nI just watched it for the first time, and \u2026 I was pretty disappointed.\n\nThey hardly focused on the actual disorder at all. I\u2019m not saying they should\u2019ve done nothing but show ED behaviors but she does a set of sit ups twice and spits out some food, and that\u2019s it. \n\nThe majority of the movie\u2019s run time is focused on her relationship with Luke. \n\nThat man is the creepiest asshole I have ever seen!! He\u2019s clearly using her as his \u201cmuse\u201d and his \u201cjust eat\u201d attitude screamed \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about EDs\u201d so hard that I started to wonder if he faked the disorder just to chase down a pretty \u201cbroken\u201d person for his art projects. \n\nThey clearly were pushing for a narrative about mother daughter relationships but they just\u2026 didn\u2019t explore it. Like at all. Eli\u2019s mom feeds her rice milk and that\u2019s all that happens. \n\nThen she has a weird dream and she\u2019s magically cured?? \n\nThey create so many loose ends that they just\u2026 never address. \n\nThis isn\u2019t about the movie itself, but as a trans person, I find it incredibly fucking weird that EVERYONE who talks about this movie insists on calling Eli Ellen. She says several times that she hates the name. People call her Ellen so exclusively that I didn\u2019t even know she changed her name!! What the hell!!\n\nAs far as ED movies go, having now seen \u201cThe\u201d ED movie, I will tell you that Black Swan is leaps and bounds better for accurately reflecting the experience, and BS isn\u2019t even an ED movie! It\u2019s a psychological thriller! \n\nHonestly, the whole movie read to me like inspiration porn. Girl meets some creepy ass man and finds love and suddenly all her problems are fixed and her step mom magically loves her. I know it was made by people who have / had eating disorders but if it was not stated at the beginning I would\u2019ve assumed it was made by someone whose only experience with AN was tabloids about celebrities being too thin. It reminds me WAY too much of the movie Wonder (which is also inspiration porn if you\u2019re unfamiliar). \n\nSeriously. Why do people like this movie so much? (I hate to tear down the movie as I know a lot of people find a lot of comfort in it, but holy hell) ",

Bulimic woman was made fun of because she puked in the plants, and the one with BED, who was Black, was made fun of for overeating. Fucking fantastic that the only two non anorexic people/token Black character are treated as jokes! \n\n2. Yes, Luke was such a weird character. He showed absolutely no signs of an ED, was on pass/leave all the time meaning he wasn\u2019t exhibiting dangerous behaviours anymore, so why was he even there? For support? Okay fine. But why throw in a male character and not use it as a way to raise awareness for male EDs? Oh right so he can be a love interest \ud83d\ude12\n\n3. Lily Collins was told she didn\u2019t HAVE TO LOSE WEIGHT FOR THE ROLE. But she \u201cchose to\u201d to better fit the role.\nHere\u2019s a quote from an interview:\n\u201cI personally knew that this was something I needed to do to tell this story,\" says Collins, who struggled with both anorexia and bulimia. \"I wanted to be able to best exert my experiences on (Ellen) by going to the lengths I felt comfortable going to as an actor.\u201d\nYou NEEDED to be emaciated to tell the story of an eating disorder? Her already being a conventionally attractive white woman was already stereotypical enough (not hate to Lily Collins, just that we have enough media already of that exact character). Especially as someone who had an ED, she should know better\u2026\n\n4. And yes, she magically got better at the end. Just chose to get better suddenly. Had one meltdown then got it out of her system and went back and all was good. That\u2019s\u2026not how anorexia works.\n\n5. Of course they show her fainting! Because everyone who\u2019s anorexic starves themselves 24/7 and doesn\u2019t eat a single crumb, never slips up,  and has the energy to exercise all the time! Because of course!  \ud83d\ude1d of course, that\u2019s an eating disorder, but again, the most STEREOTYPICAL and OVERDONE representation. I also haven\u2019t heard of a a single person who acts like that and doesn\u2019t get SECTIONED immediately. \n\n6. Apparently, everyone (or the main cast/crew at least) working on the film had a history of eating disorders. What the hell? How could someone who knew the struggle would let this be made? It\u2019s a bastardization of ED struggles.\n\nThe same story that has told a million times already was told again. It wasn\u2019t revolutionary. Sure it touched on how childhood trauma/family issues contribute to EDs, but that\u2019s it.",

And usually it doesn't go anywhere. So you get Hollywoodised versions that happen in rapid montages, numbers flying everywhere, with Queen's gambit-esque hallucinations. It's trite.\n\n\nSimilarly, movies about ED fall into stereotypes because at the end of the day, it's a mental illness with mental gymnastics, bargaining, spiralling and obsessive thoughts, and often is very boring to watch, even when it's internally chaotic. So they have to fall to these \"I'm completely reformed!\" Moments, or show over-the-top behaviours that, while real for some people, are not necessarily the norm. EDs are day-to-day demons that become so commonplace that you're not necessarily having a meltdown over a sandwich. You simply just don't make a sandwich and have a diet coke instead.

She didn\u2019t have a dream either of being cured. \n\nI liked this movie bc I am similar to the protagonist and everything about it spoke to me. Like you said, the movie was made by people who had anorexia so it is accurate to **their** experiences. It isn\u2019t to a lot of ppl on this sub but it doesn\u2019t mean it portrayed the disease badly, not everyone can relate to smth even if we have the same illness and it\u2019s ok. I have bpd and I don\u2019t relate to Clementine from Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind nor do I relate much to the protagonist of Girl, interrupted while it\u2019s about bpd. I still love both movies.",

Sorry to say, but scientific or mathematical discoveries/breakthroughs are BORING to watch. They involve sitting in silence for long periods of time. Sometimes months' worth. And usually it doesn't go anywhere. So you get Hollywoodised versions that happen in rapid montages, numbers flying everywhere, with Queen's gambit-esque hallucinations. It's trite.\n\n\nSimilarly, movies about ED fall into stereotypes because at the end of the day, it's a mental illness with mental gymnastics, bargaining, spiralling and obsessive thoughts, and often is very boring to watch, even when it's internally chaotic. So they have to fall to these \"I'm completely reformed!\" Moments, or show over-the-top behaviours that, while real for some people, are not necessarily the norm. EDs are day-to-day demons that become so commonplace that you're not necessarily having a meltdown over a sandwich. You simply just don't make a sandwich and have a diet coke instead. The jury is fighting inside.\u00a0",

Like that would never fly the way they be watching you like a hawk in those units \ud83d\ude2d\nSome things were a little annoying, such as no one actually getting wet during the rain scene except for dapping a few water marks on Luke\u2019s shirt collar at the end of their trip to make up for everyone else being completely bone dry (no pun intended).\n\nI did find myself wishing the story dived deeper and didn\u2019t remain so surface level.\n\nI really appreciated Dr. Beckham calling out Eli in his office following the scene after the family meeting about how she essentially needs to \u201cgrow a pair.\u201d It doesn\u2019t always work, and timing is definitely crucial, but sometimes we can benefit from hearing something so jarring\u2026 being forced to look in the mirror with nowhere to run, even if it initially hurts.",

That said I still think they were going for one of those weird \"experimental\" programs that aren't traditional and don't use evidence based methods, cause it was really bizarre what they were doing for \"therapy\" and how the program was set up in To The Bone.",
