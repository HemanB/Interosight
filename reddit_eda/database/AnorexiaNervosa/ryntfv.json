  "selftext": "This morning I woke up and was punched in the face by the reality of my living. To go on like that was pure depression and bleak and I didn\u2019t deserve it. For the first time in *months* I had three full meals and I\u2019m not tired, my body has enough energy to keep me warm, and I\u2019m not starving! Just a Little win but the first step to my recovery.",
