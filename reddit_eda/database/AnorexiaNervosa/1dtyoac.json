EDs usually have some degree of a \"my body vs everyone else's\" competition mentality and they think they will \"win\" the competition some how (there is no way to win. Everyone loses). If they arent 100% doing it for attention, the disorder is pretty much tricking them into doing something they know will trigger them (in the same way that it will \"force\" you to body check when you know you're bloated). They know doing it will trigger them and others, but the \"rush\" of the bit of shock or praise is addicting",

But in fairness, I know people who straight up starved themselves to lose weight and went back to normal eating. I think it all boils down to not knowing what anorexia truly is. It's a mental disorder. It's not just a desire to be thin. It's hating yourself, it's being scared of food but also loving it and hating the fact that you love it, it's not being able to walk up a set of stairs because you have no energy, it's so much deeper than just not eating and it's not just an \"Oh yeah I wanna lose a bit of weight\" thing. That's not to invalidate anyone. Obviously starving yourself is quite unadvisable, but if you're able to do it without having a genuine fear towards food and/or define your self worth on however your messed up brain percieves your body then imo you're not exactly anorexic. Slightly fucked in the head? Sure. But not full blown ana. I'm not trying to be elitist or anything but let's face it, how many people with ana go out and advertise their disorder? Sure we all express signs in the early days. But later on it's just isolated misery. Perhaps I'm too empathetic but I always make a point to never say numbers to anyone. People who gloat and advertise these things on tiktok seem to either be in the early days of an ED, or are simply just doing it for likes/the pleasure of being a negative person.

      "body": "No don't worry at all, seems like we were both in the same boat \ud83d\ude02. I kinda fundamentally disagree with the concept of attention seeking both in regards to ana and self harm. It's all about despair. I know some people don't eat for attention. I know my sister was an attention seeker in different ways, she admitted it to me. But down to their very core, these conditions are far from attention seeking. \n\nIt's really interesting to read this from your perspective because as much as I know about fashion and what not, I cannot relate to the community that follows me. My taste in music and my personality could not be more dichotomous to the clothing I wear. Anyways, I completely agree. I think even in regards to sex, porn has created unrealistic standards of the act of love. It's vigorous, violent, and quite frankly promiscuity. One of my deepest regrets is how I acted towards my ex girlfriend when I was 16 (I'm 22 now). I have done a lot of drugs since then so I cannot remember everything down to its very core. But I remember condeming her for what she wore. I thought that because she wore midi skirts, which I considered mini, she was a slut. I can say this in hindsight now, I was an idiot for saying that. I am completely over her but I wish I treated her better. I feel that I was part of the problem. Actually I know I was. She wanted to look good, and I invalidated her. She told me that she used to get bullied. She had thicker thighs and was bullied for that. To think that I only added negativity to that really bothers me. I was completely and utterly addicted to porn and as a result of that I was an objectifier. Anyways. You raise brilliant points. Porn has created beyond unrealistic beauty standards. It's funny. I use Claudia Schiffer as an example to my parents. They say that they don't think I'll wear what I currently wear in my 50's, and I show them Claudia. It's my version of saying \"Fuck you, I am who I am\". But even then, I wonder if she is okay. To look that way at 50...that takes some level of dedication. To put it lightly \ud83d\ude05 \n\nYou sound really cool. I feel bad for you because presumably you are a woman? I'm a man, so the only thing I fall victim to is homophobia and transphobia. My trans friends commend me, because I'm a straight guy and I wear things like stockings, heels, jockstraps, dresses, and tight trousers. I just do what I want. But I carry myself in a manner that is stereotypically straight. I suppose I just have an androgynous personality. The masculine side really helps me. I can't tell you just how shocked bartenders are when I walk into a pub wearing the weirdest outfit known to man and I say \"Pint of Guinness please mate\". They are flummoxed but simultaneously reassured. I feel bad for the women who wear the clothes that I wear. Even though they don't weigh any more or less than me, they are more objectified. It's a fact. I understand why some women subdue themselves. Though, I disagree with your setting comment. I believe that every day is an occasion. What's stopping someone from killing me after I finish writing this comment? Absolutely nothing. Artistically I try to live every day like my last.\n\nDon't worry about the sexualisation comment btw like I get exactly what you mean. Completely and utterly \ud83d\ude4f. I suppose I am very bold and unapologetic but as I say, I live every day like it's my last. I think everyone should. Assuming you're a woman, I imagine you get sexualised a lot. I also get called the F word a lot. I just laugh because it is what it is. In the same way people call my scars ugly, people call my outfits ugly. And that is fine. They are allowed to think that way. It is all about self assurance. I have grown to like my scars and that is my reality. When my parents get scared by them, or my friends express concern, it doesn't bother me. Humans are naturally selfish beings, so why should I care about what people think in this instance? What is the difference between Mr Pearl wearing his corset every day and telling Dita Von Teese that she is \"Permitted to eat an apple a day\" and me cutting myself? Nothing. Because both are destructive. Only one of those is marketed to be more beautiful. Again, it all comes down to individuality.\n\nHonestly if it was a hate post against white men I wouldn't be mad \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I get your point. I know what you're saying and I know you don't hate them, though some are very condemnable. Marketing is literally everywhere. You can't even go on a walk without it being shoved in your face...",

          "body": "Y'know what's so funny is that I wanted to say a lot of what you touched on but I feared that I would sound like a perv \ud83d\ude02. You are spot on, imo. Speaking strictly objectively, most of the pornstars I came across when I would watch porn would be drugged up and UW. This furthers the sexualisation of anorexic women of course. I really like hyper sexual fashion and my fashion sense is very hyper sexual too, so perhaps women sexualising themselves goes right over my head. Women can do whatever they want imo. If I interpret it sexually then I think I'm the problem, not her. I believe that. My perception is my responsibility.\n\nI know I align with the latter in regards to expression. I accentuate my body and I wear tiny corsets. But I don't do it because I want to be someone's \"Thinspo\", I do it because it's my reason to live. I live to be artistic, it's all I have. I don't have any form of a social life. It just becomes a bit enigmatic in my case. Because even something like self harm as you say, that's something I've done but I didn't do it to please someone's fetish, I initially did it because I wanted to cut myself but I also like how it looks now. I absolutely love controversial art. That's why rockstars inspire me so much. They were fearless. I'm not saying I cut myself to look cool. But I am saying I don't regret it. \n\nRegardless, I think the patriarchy is far more rampant than we think. A lot of the people creating these beauty standards are the very ones who derive pleasure from it. It's creepy old men. People look at fashion as if it's a thing for women and gay men but in reality it's run by straight white men.

Speaking strictly objectively, most of the pornstars I came across when I would watch porn would be drugged up and UW. This furthers the sexualisation of anorexic women of course. I really like hyper sexual fashion and my fashion sense is very hyper sexual too, so perhaps women sexualising themselves goes right over my head. Women can do whatever they want imo. If I interpret it sexually then I think I'm the problem, not her. I believe that. My perception is my responsibility.\n\nI know I align with the latter in regards to expression. I accentuate my body and I wear tiny corsets. But I don't do it because I want to be someone's \"Thinspo\", I do it because it's my reason to live. I live to be artistic, it's all I have. I don't have any form of a social life. It just becomes a bit enigmatic in my case. Because even something like self harm as you say, that's something I've done but I didn't do it to please someone's fetish, I initially did it because I wanted to cut myself but I also like how it looks now. I absolutely love controversial art. That's why rockstars inspire me so much. They were fearless. I'm not saying I cut myself to look cool. But I am saying I don't regret it. \n\nRegardless, I think the patriarchy is far more rampant than we think. A lot of the people creating these beauty standards are the very ones who derive pleasure from it. It's creepy old men. People look at fashion as if it's a thing for women and gay men but in reality it's run by straight white men.

          "body": "No don't worry at all, seems like we were both in the same boat \ud83d\ude02. I kinda fundamentally disagree with the concept of attention seeking both in regards to ana and self harm. It's all about despair. I know some people don't eat for attention. I know my sister was an attention seeker in different ways, she admitted it to me. But down to their very core, these conditions are far from attention seeking. \n\nIt's really interesting to read this from your perspective because as much as I know about fashion and what not, I cannot relate to the community that follows me. My taste in music and my personality could not be more dichotomous to the clothing I wear. Anyways, I completely agree. I think even in regards to sex, porn has created unrealistic standards of the act of love. It's vigorous, violent, and quite frankly promiscuity. One of my deepest regrets is how I acted towards my ex girlfriend when I was 16 (I'm 22 now). I have done a lot of drugs since then so I cannot remember everything down to its very core. But I remember condeming her for what she wore. I thought that because she wore midi skirts, which I considered mini, she was a slut. I can say this in hindsight now, I was an idiot for saying that. I am completely over her but I wish I treated her better. I feel that I was part of the problem. Actually I know I was. She wanted to look good, and I invalidated her. She told me that she used to get bullied. She had thicker thighs and was bullied for that. To think that I only added negativity to that really bothers me. I was completely and utterly addicted to porn and as a result of that I was an objectifier. Anyways. You raise brilliant points. Porn has created beyond unrealistic beauty standards. It's funny. I use Claudia Schiffer as an example to my parents. They say that they don't think I'll wear what I currently wear in my 50's, and I show them Claudia. It's my version of saying \"Fuck you, I am who I am\". But even then, I wonder if she is okay. To look that way at 50...that takes some level of dedication. To put it lightly \ud83d\ude05 \n\nYou sound really cool. I feel bad for you because presumably you are a woman? I'm a man, so the only thing I fall victim to is homophobia and transphobia. My trans friends commend me, because I'm a straight guy and I wear things like stockings, heels, jockstraps, dresses, and tight trousers. I just do what I want. But I carry myself in a manner that is stereotypically straight. I suppose I just have an androgynous personality. The masculine side really helps me. I can't tell you just how shocked bartenders are when I walk into a pub wearing the weirdest outfit known to man and I say \"Pint of Guinness please mate\". They are flummoxed but simultaneously reassured. I feel bad for the women who wear the clothes that I wear. Even though they don't weigh any more or less than me, they are more objectified. It's a fact. I understand why some women subdue themselves. Though, I disagree with your setting comment. I believe that every day is an occasion. What's stopping someone from killing me after I finish writing this comment? Absolutely nothing. Artistically I try to live every day like my last.\n\nDon't worry about the sexualisation comment btw like I get exactly what you mean. Completely and utterly \ud83d\ude4f. I suppose I am very bold and unapologetic but as I say, I live every day like it's my last. I think everyone should. Assuming you're a woman, I imagine you get sexualised a lot. I also get called the F word a lot. I just laugh because it is what it is. In the same way people call my scars ugly, people call my outfits ugly. And that is fine. They are allowed to think that way. It is all about self assurance. I have grown to like my scars and that is my reality. When my parents get scared by them, or my friends express concern, it doesn't bother me. Humans are naturally selfish beings, so why should I care about what people think in this instance? What is the difference between Mr Pearl wearing his corset every day and telling Dita Von Teese that she is \"Permitted to eat an apple a day\" and me cutting myself? Nothing. Because both are destructive. Only one of those is marketed to be more beautiful. Again, it all comes down to individuality.\n\nHonestly if it was a hate post against white men I wouldn't be mad \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I get your point. I know what you're saying and I know you don't hate them, though some are very condemnable. Marketing is literally everywhere. You can't even go on a walk without it being shoved in your face...",

Don't get me wrong, I know I can pull anything off, but I'd love it if my white mascara also showed on my lower lash line. I don't think your style is basic. Take it from how you percieve me, which I imagine is quite unique (?), you sound really cool. You seem like someone I would admire. Most women are concerned about concealing their undereye and filling in their brows. Seldom do I see any eyeliner, let alone winged. Even when I do see eyeliner it's only half of the eye to accentuate the outer lids. I really appreciate you saying that I don't conform to societal standards. I have been trying to make it clear to my best friend that my anorexia is a mere mental disorder and is not me trying to fit in, but he just doesn't seem to understand it. It's a shame. I used to be, and in many ways still am a heavy drug user. Well I like to drink alcohol. But a year ago I used a lot of coke, ecstasy, oxycodone, and of course weed. I replaced this high with the satisfaction of shocking and pissing off others. I truly love it when people give me the \"What the fuck is he wearing? Wait, is that a he? What are you? Bloody libtards!\" expression. It fulfills me more than any drug ever could. It gives me life. And the irony of this all is that it furthers my career goals. Everyone who looks at me in the way I just described is confirming to patriarchal mentalities. I am trying to destroy those.\n\nI do hope that the realise that too, because this disorder is something I would wish on nobody. I would wish similar misery on particular politicians, but not the average human. I think most people are wilfully ignorant to the self hatred it entails. It is a dark and grimy road that only gets worse. It shouldn't be a trend but I suppose reality remains. The only thing we can do is ignore it and be concerned about our loved ones. These people have to realise this in their own time. Hopefully one day they'll realise how dumb and insensitive they are being.

      "body": "Yeah, good point. I just find it really difficult to express empathy to someone who says things that don't deserve it. There's way to say you're hurting without hurting others, and naturally I have a problem with someone hurting others.\n\nIt's very true. I think my regret shows that I've grown. I'm glad that I have but I do still have a lot of things I need to change. Idk. Well actually, I do know. From the outside, I seem like a passionate, motivated, driven, and hard working young man. People tell me that. But in reality I'm just a kid. Sure I am very passionate - but I genuinely do not consider myself hard working. It hurts so much to say that because I want to be hard working but I am addicted to instant gratification and a lot of my energy is directed to my ED and body image. But hey, it's better than being a misogynistic porn addict and hurting the women in my life LOL!\n\nThank you so much for saying that. I think that there are two people within us, our personal self and our artistic self. I can't say I love my personal self but man my artistic self is fucking sick. I admire that part of me. That's for sure. For me it's just a burning desire. I'm actually rather selfish. If I haven't spent ages getting ready and look outrageous then I am not fulfilled. It takes a lot of confidence, sure, but confidence is a practice. Anyone can achieve it, you just have to try. But I also get validated from insults so at that point I will acknowledge I do have a lot of resilience. I'm not sure exactly how old you are but I will say that I'm 22 and when I was a teenager I was significantly more insecure than I am now. Believe me, this will change. You will have this confidence one day or whatever you interpret it to be. It'd be impossible to achieve it as a child, imo. Also...funny you mention job interviews and jobs. I would wear the HUGEST earrings to my bartending job. It actually brought in more customers because they were intrigued. \n\nI feel you there on the control thing. It's so powerful. Logically speaking I know that when I eat I'm not gonna gain weight, but anorexia tells me that my face is now fat. This condition gives a dark and destructive sense of control. I hate how much I love it....\n\nSorry for taking so long to reply btw. I had a long day at work!",

          "body": "but a lot of it also comes from some anorexics sexualizing themselves as well, and there being a fetish for it--there are mainly two types of anorexic people, those who don't like showing off their body in any way and want to be invisible, and ones who sexualize themselves because they want attention and validation from others to try and help out with their low self esteem.  it isn't their fault though; there really is a market of creepy men into this kind of stuff.  for example, just about anyone who's spent time in self-harm communities have gotten dms from creeps wanting vids, photos, etc...  it's similar with anorexia as well.  and creeps like this also sometimes have power too, and can be in charge of many fashion lines, per se, and have only sickly thin women be lingerie models and what not.  even pornography often features very underweight women which further glorifies this look and anorexia as a whole.  although it doesn't seem inherently obvious that the media can shape our tastes and essentially dictate what we like and don't like, unfortunately, subconsciously, those same creeps are the ones setting the beauty standards for what is and isn't good without having our interests at all.  it's pretty depressing tbh.",

          "body": "Y'know what's so funny is that I wanted to say a lot of what you touched on but I feared that I would sound like a perv \ud83d\ude02. You are spot on, imo. Speaking strictly objectively, most of the pornstars I came across when I would watch porn would be drugged up and UW. This furthers the sexualisation of anorexic women of course. I really like hyper sexual fashion and my fashion sense is very hyper sexual too, so perhaps women sexualising themselves goes right over my head. Women can do whatever they want imo. If I interpret it sexually then I think I'm the problem, not her. I believe that. My perception is my responsibility.\n\nI know I align with the latter in regards to expression. I accentuate my body and I wear tiny corsets. But I don't do it because I want to be someone's \"Thinspo\", I do it because it's my reason to live. I live to be artistic, it's all I have. I don't have any form of a social life. It just becomes a bit enigmatic in my case. Because even something like self harm as you say, that's something I've done but I didn't do it to please someone's fetish, I initially did it because I wanted to cut myself but I also like how it looks now. I absolutely love controversial art. That's why rockstars inspire me so much. They were fearless. I'm not saying I cut myself to look cool. But I am saying I don't regret it. \n\nRegardless, I think the patriarchy is far more rampant than we think. A lot of the people creating these beauty standards are the very ones who derive pleasure from it. It's creepy old men. People look at fashion as if it's a thing for women and gay men but in reality it's run by straight white men. I am always surprised by the amount of finance bros I meet who don't know Bernard Arnault.",

          "body": "LMAO i was kind of worried about improperly expressing my opinion and making it seem like i   thought that a lot of anorexics were attention-seeking sluts and i didn't want to make it seem like i was blaming them for any of this--\n\nyeah what's even worse is that a lot of those pornstars are underweight but also have butt and chest implants, which just makes it impossible for you to win as a woman.  if you naturally have curves, you're \"too fat\" everywhere else.  if you're skinny, then you're \"too flat.\"  and if you're just normal... you're uhh, probably seen as a bit of both.  but either way, you won't be good enough.  only a very small percentage of women have a body like that naturally.  and as porn addictions are a problem for many men especially ones that don't spend a lot of time around girls irl, expect all women to have those \"perfect,\" unrealistic bodies and will shame normal girls for not looking like that, thinking there's something wrong with them.  imagine getting intimate with someone and then they point out a feature that doesn't align with \"the perfect body.\"  god... that would be traumatic.  this shit really poisons everyone's minds.\n\ni also like somewhat sexual fashion (not completely hypersexual tho, i personally like low cut necklines and mini skirts but nothing tooooo crazy), and think that women should be able to wear whatever they want, as long as it isn't indecent given the setting (like i don't think you should dress sexually around places meant for little children).  the only problem is when this type of stuff is being exploited by those pervy higher ups (again, like how that one body type gets sexualized a lot in pornography, lingerie/fashion modeling, etc...), which is when this becomes a toxic standard and everyone else is \"not good enough.\"\n\nand same here... i also like to wear fashion corsets to accentuate my waist, and sometimes wear shirts with a fairly low neckline.  i also do it because i genuinely like it and it makes me feel more confident in myself because i feel prettier that way, though i also don't do it to appease those pervy men's fetishes for validation (also just to be clear i wasn't trying to make it seem like all of the anorexics who don't wear baggy clothing are automatically wearing clothes to deliberately sexualize themselves for validation, it's just something that is fairly common along with everything else, and they shouldn't be blamed for it, i hope it didn't come off like i was stereotyping all of those people lol :')).  oh yeaa i also have SH scars btw, and i get what you mean about looking cool--a bit unrelated to the topic of ana but i almost  feel as though it gives me more character in a sense...?  i don't mind them for my own personal viewing, though i'm not as bold as you lol and it makes me a bit uncomfortable when others ask where they're from or when they say they're ugly and i'm a bit insecure in that regard.  and it pisses me off when people try and use my body to appease their sick fetish.\n\nbut yeah, the main consumers of fashion are supposed to be women and gay men, though in reality everyone's affected by those standards, just on a more subconscious level for some people.  as you say, those creepy white men at the top (also i promise this isn't a hate post towards white men LOL, i'm only talking about the creeps who sexually exploit women who are the higher ups running this stuff) promote whatever fetish they have--and exploit those women and ultimately influence our opinions on what's attractive and what isn't; as those standards get shoved in our face starting from a very young age.",

          "body": "No don't worry at all, seems like we were both in the same boat \ud83d\ude02. I kinda fundamentally disagree with the concept of attention seeking both in regards to ana and self harm. It's all about despair. I know some people don't eat for attention. I know my sister was an attention seeker in different ways, she admitted it to me. But down to their very core, these conditions are far from attention seeking. \n\nIt's really interesting to read this from your perspective because as much as I know about fashion and what not, I cannot relate to the community that follows me. My taste in music and my personality could not be more dichotomous to the clothing I wear. Anyways, I completely agree. I think even in regards to sex, porn has created unrealistic standards of the act of love. It's vigorous, violent, and quite frankly promiscuity. One of my deepest regrets is how I acted towards my ex girlfriend when I was 16 (I'm 22 now). I have done a lot of drugs since then so I cannot remember everything down to its very core. But I remember condeming her for what she wore. I thought that because she wore midi skirts, which I considered mini, she was a slut. I can say this in hindsight now, I was an idiot for saying that. I am completely over her but I wish I treated her better. I feel that I was part of the problem. Actually I know I was. She wanted to look good, and I invalidated her. She told me that she used to get bullied. She had thicker thighs and was bullied for that. To think that I only added negativity to that really bothers me. I was completely and utterly addicted to porn and as a result of that I was an objectifier. Anyways. You raise brilliant points. Porn has created beyond unrealistic beauty standards. It's funny. I use Claudia Schiffer as an example to my parents. They say that they don't think I'll wear what I currently wear in my 50's, and I show them Claudia. It's my version of saying \"Fuck you, I am who I am\". But even then, I wonder if she is okay. To look that way at 50...that takes some level of dedication. To put it lightly \ud83d\ude05 \n\nYou sound really cool. I feel bad for you because presumably you are a woman? I'm a man, so the only thing I fall victim to is homophobia and transphobia. My trans friends commend me, because I'm a straight guy and I wear things like stockings, heels, jockstraps, dresses, and tight trousers. I just do what I want. But I carry myself in a manner that is stereotypically straight. I suppose I just have an androgynous personality. The masculine side really helps me. I can't tell you just how shocked bartenders are when I walk into a pub wearing the weirdest outfit known to man and I say \"Pint of Guinness please mate\". They are flummoxed but simultaneously reassured. I feel bad for the women who wear the clothes that I wear. Even though they don't weigh any more or less than me, they are more objectified. It's a fact. I understand why some women subdue themselves. Though, I disagree with your setting comment. I believe that every day is an occasion. What's stopping someone from killing me after I finish writing this comment? Absolutely nothing. Artistically I try to live every day like my last.\n\nDon't worry about the sexualisation comment btw like I get exactly what you mean. Completely and utterly \ud83d\ude4f. I suppose I am very bold and unapologetic but as I say, I live every day like it's my last. I think everyone should. Assuming you're a woman, I imagine you get sexualised a lot. I also get called the F word a lot. I just laugh because it is what it is. In the same way people call my scars ugly, people call my outfits ugly. And that is fine. They are allowed to think that way. It is all about self assurance. I have grown to like my scars and that is my reality. When my parents get scared by them, or my friends express concern, it doesn't bother me. Humans are naturally selfish beings, so why should I care about what people think in this instance? What is the difference between Mr Pearl wearing his corset every day and telling Dita Von Teese that she is \"Permitted to eat an apple a day\" and me cutting myself? Nothing. Because both are destructive. Only one of those is marketed to be more beautiful. Again, it all comes down to individuality.\n\nHonestly if it was a hate post against white men I wouldn't be mad \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I get your point. I know what you're saying and I know you don't hate them, though some are very condemnable. Marketing is literally everywhere. You can't even go on a walk without it being shoved in your face...",
