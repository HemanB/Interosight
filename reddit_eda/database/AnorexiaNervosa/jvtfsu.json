  "selftext": "I posted in a terrible place months ago and I was distressed because I didn\u2019t want to live till my next birthday or face even a slice of cake. After 10 weeks of inpatient and outpatient care I am finally starting to come to terms with my healthy body and beginning to appreciate food again. I made a big, beautiful cake yesterday and had as big a slice as I wanted. It\u2019s three months late but I had that slice of cake for my birthday.",
