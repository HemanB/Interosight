But it feels like I did everything and gained nothing positive. I'm just fat now, I have no discipline and I hate my life. I would literally rather die than looking in the mirror and seeing how fat I got. I can't stop thinking how my bf must think I've never had an ed because how tf would someone like me, someone with no discipline, someone this fat have anorexia??? I was literally at my goal weight and I could've done more but I did \"the right thing\" and everyone thinks 'oh she's so well now.' God I wish I was dead. And the worst part is EVERYONE in my family and stuff lies to me saying I'm not fat but I SEE it in the mirror. And it's not like I'm in recovery for months it's been 1.5 fucking YEARS. I HATE IT.",

It takes discipline to continue recovering, even when you feel like shit about it.\nYou're stronger than you give yourself credit for \ud83d\udc9c",

I would do anything to not feel this pain and thinking of the glimpses of my child state, the one that giggles and laughs but has no idea what is going on when she sleeps. It doesnt work for me, the say the qhole what would say to a friend, but thinking of saying it to q child or a young  me. Whom I can't hate, she is  a child, and she would look at me and want me to protect her and tell her why she feels the ways she does.  To look after her and make sure nobody hurts her cause it's what's screamed at me, to feed her and to sit with her well she eats. I still am fighring. Im fighting for my life after hitting the worst hole I've ever been in. Oneday, you'll look at photos on this time and think, wow, I looked i can't believe I thought this at the time. You deserve to recover and that's not something that just come with reseeding. It comes with finding reasons, hard working, and factory resetting neuro pathways except there's no button to press and it's hard and scary and painful. But you eating disorder is too and it's the one yelling you these things. Breathe. Think of 1 thing. Anything, you can do right now even if it's just staring at a different Wall to chance your perspective to help ground you. \nNobody deserves to feel this way, I am so so sorry because it hurts.

On the other hand, I think without satisfying it you are experiencing depression and lack of direction. Now I am far from recovered, so keep that in mind I guess taking advice from me. I think you need a new obsession. A new hobby that engulfs your brain. Start with a list of the things that you love to do. Maybe make a list of what you want for your future. Now make a path that connects what you love now to your future self. Forge a new path for yourself",

      "body": "It\u2019s completely normal to feel like this. In order to gain you had to go against your basic instincts (because anorexia rewires your brain to feel like starving is your normal safe state) and may feel like your belief system has been dismantled. \n\nJust to remind you, my doctor told me that it takes around five years for your brain to recover, so the main thing is to give it time. It is uncomfortable right now and while it does get better over time (2.5y since starting recovery and 2y1mo since hospital), the thoughts don\u2019t go away for a long time. The way I see it, when we have started to recover but can\u2019t yet be considered recovered, we are in some kind of limbo and just have to accept that this is temporary. \n\nThis advice may not apply to you because people are different, but what really helped me was to try and find the same control as I felt when ill in other areas of life. You felt like you were disciplined when you didn\u2019t eat and while yes, that takes discipline, it also means that you are disciplined as a person. \n\nRegarding feeling fat: I feel like most people who don\u2019t have eating disorders don\u2019t understand what we mean when we say we feel/look fat. They think that by fat we mean obese because that is usually what people mean when they say fat. However, we usually mean HAVING fat on our body that wasn\u2019t there before or that we don\u2019t want and for some reason they can\u2019t comprehend it. Probably because their brains aren\u2019t affected by the illness. It may be helpful to talk to your family and help them understand what it is that you really mean when you talk about your body. If they understand, they\u2019ll be able to support you better. \n\nAnyway, I hope that it gets easier for you in time and in the meanwhile, I wish you strength :)",

And my advice is even i know its hard dont check out your body every time you look in the miror rather then that look in the miror in the morning and say something positive about yourself and go on with your day and enjoy life. I hope this helps a bit and stay strong and happy!",

So i js wanna say that i get ur fear. Overcoming an ed in one go isnt easy so maybe u could start by eating at ur maintenance calories? Thats what i did. I was still counting calories but i was eating at my estimate maintenance and thats why i gained only 1-2 kgs. And then after a trip, where i wasnt counting cals at all, was eating reallyy well but also walking a lot, i lost that weight too. So what I'm trying to get at, food is neccessary and not eating is gonna cause sm problems: health problems obviously, mood problems and so much more. Trust me it's not worth it at all. My mood has never been better, i have tons of energy, im rarely fatigued and soo on. Id suggest to start eating well, enough to not lose any more weight and once you've got that down start recovery. I'm also at that stage where i really want to stop obsessing over food in general and i think its working. So yeaa again just to put a disclaimer, im not an expert in this field so take my advice with a grain of salt\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb",
