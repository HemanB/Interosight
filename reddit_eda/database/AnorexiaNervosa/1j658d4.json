  "selftext": "I was looking through my photos and I came across this one. Just reminded me of all the things that my body went through. I was starving myself and my body and brain had to stop doing normal every day functions so it could keep my organs running basically. It\u2019s one thing I always come back to. That when you\u2019re hungry, your mood, and your body temperature are usually the first to go. And it was horrible. So I want this to be inspiring but it also might be triggering so I apologize. But I\u2019m proud of myself and I just really wanted to share because I tend to neglect that part of my life alot. \n\nThe photo is my sister, myself and my dad. It was some sort of UV ray thing that detects heat coming off of peoples bodies. And yellow is heat. Blue and purple is cold, meaning no heat is coming off of those parts. We thought it was funny at the time lol.",
