      "body": "I always like to remind myself that food are made for enjoyment and are not cause pain. Our body needs a balance of everything to function and our body knows when is too much and when isn\u2019t it. Remind yourself that food is not your enemy but the voices in your head. So far with my ED I\u2019ve always tried to go against it when it talks to me about what I can and cannot eat and it\u2019s helped me a lot because I start to realise that even though the voice gets louder I am one step closer to recovery! Don\u2019t satisfy the voice and don\u2019t tell if you will exercise it off because then like me you\u2019ll believe you don\u2019t deserve to eat because you haven\u2019t exercised when YOU WILL ALWAYS DESERVE TO IT!",
