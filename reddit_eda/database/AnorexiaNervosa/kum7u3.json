  "selftext": "Okay... Today, I had a high fever and my whole body, joints and all, felt like it was going to break. I had a bad headache, couldn't look at lights, had ringing in my ears, and the cherry on top was my stomach. It was in so much pain, literally could feel indigested food roll around in it and cause severe stabbing pains. I was so lightheaded and detached I could barely walk. \n\nBut later on in the day, with the help of medications and subtle self-care, my body fought off the fever and... \ud83e\udd7a \n\nUgh I'm gonna cry. \n\nMy joints are so much better, my stomach is kinda still in pain but waaaay better than this morning, I'm no longer lightheaded and I overall feel great now that the fever is gone. \n\nSo it dawned on me... \n\nMy body, single-handedly pulled through. It fought off the sickness and took care of the pain, all on its own. \n\nThough yes, I'm still on my bullshit and weight loss is still my one main goal, but something clicked in my mind even if only for today. \n\nI will listen to my body's cravings. Just for today, I will eat what it's been craving for days now. Just for today, I'll reward it for what it's done for me. Just for today, I'll have it eat as much as it wants till it feels satisfied. \n\nIt got me through the day and healed me quick. It deserves respect. It deserves energy. It deserves love. And food.",
