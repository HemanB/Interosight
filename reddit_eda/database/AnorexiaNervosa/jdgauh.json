So before starting recovery I\u2019m planning on getting even more underweight so that I can be more calm in the process, but in reality I know that weight gain will affect me negatively no matter what. Tomorrow my future therapist is gonna call me and give me an appointment to take my measurements with other specialized ppl, and god I\u2019m scared.",
