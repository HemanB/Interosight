Because in many ancient cultures and even now in more impoverished countries, being fat is a sign of wealth, and so it is often associated with happiness and considered to be a positive thing.\n\nActually there are a lot of interesting ramifications to this comment thread, when one considers that Siddhartha Gautama actually did practice aestheticism, essentially starving himself, until he decided that it wasn\u2019t bringing him the fulfillment he expected. He then abandoned that way of life and instead founded his own religion as a way to find peace for himself instead of just going along with the masses and starving himself like they expected",
