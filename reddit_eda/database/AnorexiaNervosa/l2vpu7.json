However, a few months ago I stopped counting calories completely and explained to him that I had been doing that for a year and that\u2019s what I was doing after/before we ate. He was pretty understanding but still gets suspicious sometimes. I think you should tell him and it will ease his mind and hopefully he will be understanding.",

There's never gonna be a time where it'll feel right to tell him but the best thing to do is get it out early. I'm sure when you explain things, hell understand not to be pushy with food and you won't have to worry about seeming off when you decline food coz hell know what's up. It'll also means hel'l know how to support you better and to be more patient regarding food issues. You don't have to take my advice, but from experience it's the only way out without jeprodising your relationship.",
