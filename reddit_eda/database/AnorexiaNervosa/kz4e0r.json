  "selftext": "My boyfriend made me a portobello mushroom burger with roasted red peppers and lactose free cheese on a pretzel bun, with Greek salad on the side. I was only able to eat half of it but it was so good, this is the first time we've eaten dinner together in ages. I've barely been able to eat at all lately, like I can barely manage a short walk to the pharmacy, so while I feel a bit anxious about it, physically it feels so good to finally have something nourishing my body. I've been so exhausted. \ud83d\ude2d\n\nEdit: thanks everyone for the awards and the support! \ud83d\udc96",
