  "selftext": "I do have body issues. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s really why I have anorexia. \n\nI think I just want to die. Have a heart attack or organ failure. Maybe I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll end up on life support or something and come back from it and suddenly want to live. At my best I\u2019m just sort of putting off suicide a few more years instead of thinking of it as an immediate option. At my worst I end up back in the hospital for suicidal ideation and whatnot. Ideation. I hate myself for being all talk and no bite. Like a failure because I haven\u2019t -actually- tried to kill myself. \n\nI feel like such a piece of shit. Worthless. Pointless. A fraud. I have this amazing job in which I help people with mental health issues, and I\u2019m a fraud. I keep feeling like an imposter and my dietician recently pointed out that I kind of am. I\u2019m helping people and encouraging them to get better, while in secret, I\u2019m making myself worse. Diet pills. Psyllium husk. Lying about having eaten. I live alone so it\u2019s pretty easy to get away with it. Is anorexia a choice? What does that say about me, that I\u2019m choosing sickness? Attention-seeking? I realized this week that I\u2019ve struggled to eat for five years. Most of that was very secretive. Now this year I told people and am diagnosed with anorexia. And I love that. My fucked up twisted brain. \n\nMy dietician said this week that my \u201cED voice\u201d is louder and more intrusive and stubborn than anybody else she works with. And I was PROUD of that. Fuck. Me. I must be a real piece of shit. \n\nAnd yet, I\u2019m nowhere near the weight I want to be. Know I could be at. My BMI is still in the green, at least for a few more pounds. I\u2019ve seen the signs of sickness in me when it wasn\u2019t. People asking, \u201cHey... aren\u2019t you looking kinda skinny?\u201d My hair falling out in handfuls, my tightest pants requiring a belt. Then I started eating more and my hair stopped falling out after some time. And guess what? I\u2019m upset about that. It\u2019s not a sign of progress. \u201cProgress.\u201d \n\nAnyways. I just feel sad and weak and like a piece of shit. The reality is that I just want to be sick. I don\u2019t want to get better. I tell my dietician every week. I tell her I\u2019m wasting her time. Wasting my time. But I think I like the self-pity-party. Watch me burn, ya\u2019ll. I hope this either kills me or makes me finally want to live.",

However, you don\u2019t actually have autonomy if you have a perception of yourself or believe that you have to carry out specific actions. As for feeling better when you\u2019re dietician says the things you talked about, I think it\u2019s simply a matter of feeling good about being the greatest at something\u2014that something that you are doing in the present is working out, and you perceive that it is working out because these signs are extreme. \n\nJust know that everything you are in the moment is the result of nature and nurture and that IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT. If possible, ask you\u2019re dietician if there is a healthy way to maintain you\u2019re current weight. Anorexic behavior is more prevalent when the individual feels that it needs to exist for some reason. It seems that this reason is prevalent in your life right now and if you can indulge in some behaviors part way, without it actually damaging your health, at least for the time being, it might help. \n\nPlease stay safe. Your life is important. Just think about all the people you are helping and how being alive makes a difference in their life.",

I have Borderline Personality Disorder which has some overlap with bipolar. \n\nI don't know you or your situation but I wanted to reassure you that it's very, very unlikely that your doctor is mocking you. The difficulty with brain stuff is that tries to convince you that you're not sick. I'm not saying this to invalidate what you're feeling - which sounds fricking terrifying and stressful - but to encourage you to be open to the doc's suggestions. You can find some great tools to make your life easier.\n\nWishing you all the best.",
