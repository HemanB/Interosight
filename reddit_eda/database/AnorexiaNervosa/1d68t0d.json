But even THEN she didn't do THIS. She wasn't trying to compete with me, she was trying to *connect* with me, like you said. There was such an obvious difference between her and someone like my aunt who just straight up hated me for being a thin child (back when I was naturally thin because I was like SEVEN YEARS OLD, not even struggling with an ED yet) and literally celebrated / would constantly remind me as I got older and puberty made me naturally gain weight. Honestly that aunt probably contributed a lot to me developing AN in the first place which is so fucked up to think about. (And her husband was a creep toward me no matter what I weighed so you know what maybe there was a reason that she \"acted jealous\". Not a good reason by any means but certainly a reason.)

Chances are if somebody \u201cwishes they were anorexic\u201d or claims to be anorexic they probably fall somewhere on the spectrum of ED. I once \u201cwished I was anorexic\u201d and ended up in ED treatment for bulimia because I was purging 8-15 times a day to the point of vomiting blood and needed weekly dental appointments for the better part of a year because I had essentially eroded all my teeth away. And I never felt like I was sick enough. I had periods of anorexia and of binge eating and of cycling through the two but I wasn\u2019t emaciated and therefore not deserving of help.

But even THEN she didn't do THIS. She wasn't trying to compete with me, she was trying to *connect* with me, like you said. There was such an obvious difference between her and someone like my aunt who just straight up hated me for being a thin child (back when I was naturally thin because I was like SEVEN YEARS OLD, not even struggling with an ED yet) and literally celebrated / would constantly remind me as I got older and puberty made me naturally gain weight. Honestly that aunt probably contributed a lot to me developing AN in the first place which is so fucked up to think about. (And her husband was a creep toward me no matter what I weighed so you know what maybe there was a reason that she \"acted jealous\". Not a good reason by any means but certainly a reason.) TLDR adults in the family who act this way with malicious intent are the fucking worst and I hope they all step on glass.",
