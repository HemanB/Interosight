And that still feels so very wrongs to even admit..\n\nI've found this happy good middle ground where I can eat a bit more, not exercise as much & feel a little better. If only this could last.. Tho this is as far as I'm able to go, at least for now. Ofc everyone would want full recovery but not sure about that. What even is \"full recovery\". Who can genuinely say they can live after ED life without any disordered thoughts towards food or exercise? Think about that alot. It's a slow ride, but at least I'm able to eat couple meals & often one snack too, not starving as bad as I used to.\n\n\"bc i want it to be done?\" Relate to this alot. Always afraid I can't stop cause my body just wants more n more food & I'm losing control & eating over my limits & getting fat.",
