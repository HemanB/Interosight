      "body": "Straight up explain to the person why what they said was wrong and why it actually hinders your recovery. People need to be called out when they say triggering shit like that. If they get defensive about it, double down, or try to say you're too sensitive, then they are an active threat to your recovery and it'll be harder to heal with them around. Hopefully, they are understanding as to why what they said was fucked up so that it's easier for you to move forward. I genuinely do not understand why people who don't have EDs think this shit is okay to say.",

      "body": "The way I looked at it is even if you were binging everyday that would be it's own eating disorder. Disordered eating can come in many forms. I think the person that said that is ignorant. I think they're a lot more things to be worried about in this life then weight. If someone else is that worried about your weight then they need to get a life. If course it would be okay if someone close to u was expressing concern in a nice way but that is just a horrible thing to say",

He didn\u2019t really give me permission, but he knew about my ED, and when my dad died I said I didn\u2019t want to eat anymore and idk if he just didn\u2019t realize it but he said \u201cit\u2019s ok you don\u2019t have to eat if you\u2019re upset I understand \u201c and fast forward a few months to him about crying saying \u201cI let you do this, now I\u2019m watching you wither away and die in front of me this is my fault\u201d it\u2019s not his fault, but he won\u2019t stop blaming himself. I guess my advice is don\u2019t take it too far like I did cuz I hate myself for him blaming himself. Also it\u2019s really hard to know when it\u2019s too far, so try to find someone you trust who can help you slow down if things get crazy, cuz I still don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m sick but he feels like I\u2019m dying EDs are blinding like that",
