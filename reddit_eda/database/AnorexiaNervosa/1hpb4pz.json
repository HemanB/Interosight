I bought a giant bag of oranges the other week that I haven\u2019t even touched \n\nPlus a dozen expensive supplements and vitamins, \u2018diet foods\u2019 that I wouldn\u2019t need if I just ate normal food. Expensive protein shakes that I have maybe once a week. Specialty \u2018low calorie\u2019 mayonnaise that I also haven\u2019t touched\n\nI hate this",
