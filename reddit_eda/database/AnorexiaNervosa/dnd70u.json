I\u2019ve been to hospital a few times for my low potassium levels - and I\u2019ve had a literal heart attack from it (though it was quite \u2018mild\u2019).\n\nI also have chronic \u2018overflow\u2019, which is a delightful phenomenon where you are constipated, but have liquid (literal liquid) diarrhoea at the same time (like \u2018around\u2019 the constipation).\n\nBecause I binge and purge, my fluid levels jump around a LOT - think going from bodybuilder after cutting (when I\u2019ve had a long b/p session) to having full blown oedema that is so bad it hurts my skin from stretching.\n\nI\u2019m doing a lot better now - I still drink way too many fluids (over ten litres easily), but because I\u2019m actively in recovery I\u2019m looking after myself so it\u2019s much less of an issue (is taking supplements, not purging so much etc).\n\nHope that\u2019s helpful haha :)",
