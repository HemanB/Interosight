  "selftext": "Is anyone else just really bored? Like I seriously don\u2019t want to do anything. I don\u2019t want to watch tv, do any exercise or see my friends who I haven\u2019t seen in ages. I don\u2019t want to do my puzzle and social media just bores me now. When I\u2019m not working I\u2019m honestly just sitting with my thoughts I feel so unmotivated and like there\u2019s nothing to life anymore. My thoughts mainly consist of food. I had a dream about food last night but I\u2019m constantly fighting with myself and restricting.",

With my eating disorder I lost any mental capacity to care about things I used to enjoy, reading and watching tv were too taxing and I had no energy for it. Now I\u2019m in recovery and it\u2019s started to get a bit better\u2014although I\u2019m still exhausted all the time, I feel like I have a bit more energy to put towards fun activities once again, even if just a tiny bit. You have to remember that recovery is worth it and it will get better, but you do have to push yourself to choose recovery. Wishing you all the best <3",
