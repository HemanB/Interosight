When you're eating enough, there's less worry about it being \"perfect\" because there are more opportunities in the day for food to be enjoyed, e.g., if it's disappointing at one meal or snack it's no big deal because there will be other chances",

For example, I got really excited to see some cherry scones reduced at a supermarket the other day but upon eating one realised it had next to no cherries in it. It was not \"bad\" it just was not perfect/what I wanted it and expected it to be. I also compared it to other cherry scones I last had years ago and recall being much better/more enjoyable. I was honestly so upset and felt like I'd wasted calories which I could have spent on something I would have enjoyed much more. Literally felt to cry haha. ERGH ED LIFE IS HARD LADS.",
