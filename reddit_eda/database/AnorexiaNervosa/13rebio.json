  "selftext": "Apparently the past couple of years there is a new trend in trans circles called \"anamaxxing\"   \n(think \"ana+looksmaxxing\")\n\nI think the idea is that to achieve a more feminine or masculine physique either before or at the start of hormone replacement therapy the \"anamaxxer\" goes all out (in what would otherwise in *any* other context be considered absolutely \"proana\" behavior) in order to drastically reduce body fat across the board.\n\nThen because of the presence of the cross-sex hormones that fat is later regained (with eating) but is more likely to be distributed in the desired masculine or feminine way (different parts of the face, different parts of the body, etc.) versus the typical feminization or masculinization cosmetic surgeries.\n\nWould this be considered the same as \"ED pro ana\" or not pro ana, or not an ED at all?",

      "body": "Honestly not only for the sake of mental and physical health, dramatically dropping weight being bad on its own for the body and all, this not so new trend of \u201canamaxxing\u201d is actually just a really stupid idea. I don\u2019t mean to say the person is stupid, I completely understand it. Though I\u2019ve had anorexia since childhood, anyway. When I went on HRT I quickly took myself off due to weight gain, heavily backfired. Then before my top surgery I was in my \u201cprimetime\u201d anorexia state. This is bad for the following reasons:\n- Being too low of a weight is dangerous for surgery \n- Being too low of a weight before and after surgery confines you to that weight because fluctuations will change your top surgery results in the future.\n- It could kill you.\n\nI say that last bit as someone who went under the knife for a mastectomy with severe anorexia and my heart stopped during the surgery. I was lucky to wake up, and when I did, they told me about the complications during the procedure. Lucky to be alive (well, whatever you consider lucky anyway. I don\u2019t really know if it\u2019s luck because dying under low weight anesthesia heart failure might have been the best for me). Despite how much I loved my results, all the jealousy of my peers (which made me feel guilty to where I isolated anyway), and how I was able to form pretty decent pecs afterwards, when I finally started recovery last year after almost two decades of anorexia, my results changed. I am not happy, and relapse is in progress. \n\nAny trans guys reading my comment, I don\u2019t suggest this \u201canamaxxing\u201d, it\u2019s a dangerous road that can lead to potentially endless misery.",

      "body": "The line between going on a diet and an eating disorder do get blurry at some point, but they are very separate things, thats why not everyone who goes on a diet is diagnosed with an eating disorder. \n\nGoing on a diet is just changing the food you eat, it can look like many different things and be for any number of reasons. Whereas eating disordered behaviour encompasses many things including diet, exercise, body image, the way you see the world. When it comes to restrictive eating disorders, weight loss or maintaining a low weight is always the goal. Anyone can make disordered/pro ED comments, body check, etc...without necessarily having an eating disorder or being on a diet.\n\nA lot of people assume you can engage in extremely disordered behaviour and then resume eating again like nothing happened when you reach your goal, but it\u2019s often not that simple as you\u2019ve changed how your brain thinks about food to be negative, and that\u2019s not easily undone.\n\nWhen it comes to studying starvation or things requiring fasting, the participants are unlikely to develop an eating disorder as the pathology isn\u2019t there; they weren\u2019t trying to loose weight they were the subject of a test and would likely be vetted psychologically before and after.",

Anyway\u2026 as an example there was one account that had a cow avatar and literally tens of thousands of posts telling trans youth that they\u2019re ugly and that they should just give up.\n\nThere was also a fair amount of pro-suicide content and the general attitude that anyone who started transition older than 20 was \u201chopeless.\u201d\n\nAlso there was a lot of toxicity around sexuality that was just plain weird. Back then there was a lot of medical gatekeeping where you had to pretend to be what we would now recognizes as a TERF caricature of a trans woman where you dream of basically being a \u201ctrad wife\u201d since you were a little child. There was this whole long narrative we used to teach each other that was incredibly cringe but you had to know it and be able to regurgitate it to an expert if you wanted access to medical support.\n\n\u2026 and access to medical support was life or death. If you want an insight into this garbage read True Selves by Mildred L Brown which presents this caricature as fact from the perspective of an \u201cexpert.\u201d It\u2019s an important historical artifact.\n\nAnyway, that got reflected and amplified in online spaces by bitter closeted people who used it to cut down people who were actually t trying to come out. Trans lesbians, non-binary people, gender non-conforming people, and anyone with a healthy sex life were treated as some kind of weirdo fetishist.\n\nThere was a lot of pro-SH and pro-ED content, too.\n\nIt was a real mess.",

The online trans communities of the time made proana forums look wholesome in comparison and in person communities of people actually going through medical/social transition were frequently nonexistent.\n\nBut yeah\u2026 never heard that word before and I expect to never hear it again.",

These things are also very commonly experienced in the trans community. Trans people have body dysmorphia and dysphoria, just like eating disordered people do, and experience a similar fear of their biological puberty. The difference between \"us\" and \"them\" is that the thought process for eating disorders is \"I can't be thin enough.\" And for transgenderism it's \"I can't be masculine/feminine enough.\"\nThis is one hundred percent an eating disordered behaviour in the fact that it is intentionally losing an unrealistic amount of weight in a relatively short span of time, for the purpose of altering the appearance and having \"control\" of how others see you. They're both predicated in the desire to have a new body.  \nhttps://ovc.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh226/files/pubs/forge/sexual_numbers.html\n\nhttps://www.verywellmind.com/the-influence-of-abuse-trauma-on-disordered-eating-1138267\n\nhttps://www.psycom.net/eating-disorders-in-children",
