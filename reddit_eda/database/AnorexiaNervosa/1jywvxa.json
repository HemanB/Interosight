But honestly, I miss craving it with someone. I miss the connection. Living a normal life. Flirting. Being insecure if she/he likes you or not. The so-called butterflies in your stomach. For me it was more like the moment you go peak down on a rollercoaster, your stomach flies to your mouth and it gets cold there. \n\nIdk. I guess I miss being a person. Living regularly. I don\u2019t want much tbh I just wanted average. Legit average. Nice warm love, small house, a cat, having jobs and making it one day at a time. Just knowing you\u2019re going home to peace. To love. To health.",
