  "selftext": "I always knew that people with anorexia suffer with different symptoms with still a fair amount of symptoms that make up, well, anorexia. So, I already knew anorexia was more than just looks and that for me, it was mainly about looks and that being diagnosed with anorexia gave me closure knowing what I have and what I can do with this struggle \n\nBut now I know I'm being superficial. I've never understood being in control, I don't think I ever struggled with body dysmorphia, I've always been fat my whole life and I've been obsessed with being skinny. I don't know what it is anymore, I don't know but I hate that I am nothing but a mockery of those who truly do have anorexia and I feel so guilty of this",

As I got older I unpacked it and realised it was also a way to feel in control, to rebel against my carers and to deal with sexual trauma. It can be a coping mechanism for some, and for others it can be from a lifetime of having their self worth tied to their appearance. You may be using it and your obsession with how you look and controlling how you look as a coping mechanism for something you don't even realise you're coping with yet. That's not superficial. \n\nAnd even if it all does come down to how you look, let's not pretend that doesn't affect the way we are treated in society and connects with our inherently human desire to be loved and admired and wanted.
