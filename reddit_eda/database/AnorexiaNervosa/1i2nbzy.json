      "body": "Yes!!! I think when people post obvious unnecessary shots like someone having to take a picture of the plate they're gonna eat ...in their lap for some reason showing a thigh gap. That's a body check.  \n\nWhen people put like energy drink cans in their lap right on their thigh to compare sizes. \n\nSomeone taking a photo of their coffee on a table and having to hold it and show their emaciated wrists. Even though they didn't need to hold it or stretch their arm like that while holding it \n\nMirror selfie standing sideways \n\nSomeone flexing and exaggerating the visibility of certain body parts \n\nEtc\n\nSome things are just blatant\n\nOther times people are just want to take a selfie and they should still be allowed to. Or they want to make content online as that's their hobby and/or job so they need to be on camera.\n\n\nI think it's a body check when the focus is clearly the body (and the sickness of it) or it was unnecessary and random there's for some reason limbs there. \n\nA selfie shows a vibe!, an emotion!, a day, a Person, an outfit, a location, a group of people, etc. Even when you're underweight. It's a grey area when someone is showing off an outfit but I can give the benefit of the doubt. \n\nA body check is ....the body.  Sometimes the face isn't even in and it's expressionless if it is in and it's clear the person taking the photo is focusing on how they look. \n\nIt's tough and whenever I'm underweight I worry about this and the ethics of sending selfies still. I don't even post my photos online and I wonder if some rando online would call it a body check. Idk. It's a grey area for certain things and other things you just know. Someone doing their job as a book reviewer isn't doing that.",
