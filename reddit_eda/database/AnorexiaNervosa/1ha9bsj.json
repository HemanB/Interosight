  "selftext": "I don\u2019t even know what to say\u2026 \n\nNo one knew it was this bad. She was at an inpatient treatment center out of state. She died in the ICU yesterday after she kept pulling out her feeding tube and went comatose. By the time they restrained her and kept the tube in, her kidneys were already shutting down then everything else followed. \n\nI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m feeling, but I haven\u2019t been able to stop thinking about it since then. Just replaying those words over and over. She starved herself to death. \n\nI\u2019ve had to bury family members before, but this\u2026 this isn\u2019t a reason to have to bury someone. She shouldn\u2019t have died. She had so many years ahead of her. She wasn\u2019t even at a low BMI. \n\nI get she was sick. Hell, I\u2019m right here with her in that sense. It\u2019s terrifying. \n\nI don\u2019t know. I guess I came here to try and help myself feel better. Process it in some way. Ultimately though, I hope some of you take this as a sobering sentiment. \n\nIt\u2019s easy to forget that death is still a looming danger even when you aren\u2019t at a lower BMI. You\u2019re just as much at risk. Take care of yourself. You have to. ",

I thought it would be different for me, I thought I could outsmart my body by taking certain supplements and vitamins etc. You cannot cheat your own health or body like that. You are not a unique person who is invincible because you do x, y, or z. You are not a unique case where you actually will be happy once you reach a certain goal. \n\nLuckily I was forced into treatment (which I used to adamantly disagree with until it saved me from dying at 16-20 years old at different points and I recognize in hindsight I needed it). My family and me all thought I would never recover, just live with symptoms and die young. But I did recover, and I look back at how I felt just a year ago and cannot fathom or even try to explain how convinced I was that I NEEDED to keep my ed. \n\nIf you are reading this and struggling, I cannot even put into words how much I urge you to recover. I truly never wanted to recover, my ed genuinely had many benefits in my life. It was grief and a major loss to recover, on top of that, I was so deep in my ed that I couldn\u2019t even conceive WHY I would ever want to recover. But one day I tried anyways, I did something I had never done which was put all my trust into someone else\u2019s hands (my team). Scariest thing I have ever done, but I am on the other side. I can see the \u201cgreat filter\u201d so to speak that I passed through, that I couldn\u2019t see before. I like my life even though I still have problems sometimes in life. I wish I could put just a fraction of what it feels like to realize that you CAN live without an ed into everyone\u2019s minds who struggle. Like truly, genuinely, can live without an ed. Even typing this I have a frustrating battle in my mind because I know the old and sick me just wouldn\u2019t let what I am saying truly sink in the way me now wants it to. \n\nAnyways, all that to say, I am so sorry for your loss OP. Your cousin will not be forgotten, and remember to take care yourself right now. Ed\u2019s are so complicated and they aren\u2019t any one person\u2019s \u201cfault\u201d. I hope your family and you can find comfort and care during this time. Feel free to message me if you need anything.\n\nTo anyone else with an ed reading this, or any other mental health struggle. There is something to hang on for and something to get better for even if you don\u2019t see it now, even if you don\u2019t see it in recovery, trust me because something will come make life worth living. Everyone said that to me and I never believed it until it did. I love you all, I don\u2019t just say that. I truly know how this disorder feels and how much of a battle it is just to see the next day, but I want to see ALL of you the next day with me.",
