They\u2019re getting off on hurting you\n\nWhenever someone tries to compliment me on being skinny I just get anxiety cause I don\u2019t want the eating disorder and those comments make me feel pressure to stay thin. This would trigger the crap out me how incredulous they\u2019re acting about something as personal as your body. If someone compliments me on being \u201cthick\u201d I feel distraught too; I\u2019m a person. I\u2019m not \u201cskinny,\u201d \u201cthick,\u201d or \u201cthin\u201d I don\u2019t like being spoken to like a public display and my body described rather than my inner world flattered.\n\nThis honestly triggers me in reminding me how viciously nasty I\u2019ve been spoken to in terms of mental abuse; this is mental abuse. You shared you have an eating disorder, now they\u2019re making a body comment, you asked them to stop, so they\u2019re acting incredulous to bait a reaction to feel amused over. They\u2019re being sick and awful. I wouldn\u2019t personally talk with them again. \u201cOh I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t mean to hurt you\u201d after using the term \u201cfuck\u201d in terms of referencing your body size and exaggerating harshly; yea, you don\u2019t need that BS.
