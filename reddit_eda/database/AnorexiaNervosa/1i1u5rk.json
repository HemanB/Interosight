The amount of food I\u2019m made to eat makes me so uncomfortable, full and just disgusted. It\u2019s also extra triggering since i started at a hw and even gaining to a \u201caverage weight\u201d triggers the hell out of me. I can\u2019t live like this.",

What I'm \"meant\" to be eating seems to be a  colossal amount of food, and the weight has restored far quicker than I am comfortable with - it's now to the point that jeans that once fell off me are sitting just above my hips and it makes my skin crawl.\n\n\nI don't want friends (that I haven't seen in a few months and who know about the ED and that I'm in treatment) to see me at all. I feel like I'm revolting and they're going to see that I look \"normal\" now, so why the hell would I be in treatment. A \"You've gained weight, you're cured!\" type of mentality. Or worse still,  \"you made it up.\"\n\n\nI now only feel comfortable in super baggy clothes and barely leave my house, aside to help my brother with his kids. This feels so much worse than the ED itself. I feel like agreeing to coerced recovery is the worst decision I have ever made, I regret it so, so much; and I resent my spouse and primary care doctor for making me go down this route as an alternative to putting me in hospital against my will.\n\n\nI don't feel like I can do it anymore. I have some autoimmune issues and the chronic pain one has gotten *worse* in treatment - probably because I'm lugging around more weight and also I'm restoring muscle giving more battleground for the pain. I have cried myself to sleep every night since restoring weight. I'm close to being the most su***dal I've been in my life (something I've struggled with for 20+ years). I've recently started SH again. \n\n\nTL;DR - this whole thing fucking sucks and I'm sorry you're going through it too, I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. I completely relate to your feelings that recovery ruined your life, as I feel the same way.\n\n(Edit cos autocorrect changed it to the wrong \"you're\" and it bugged the hell out of me).",

I've been in recovery for years now and it really does get easier with time. It wasn't something I just woke up one day and noticed either. If you're malnourished at all it definitely affects the way your brain works, and you can still be malnourished at any weight. It probably took years for my brain to return to full capacity and now that it has, I can look back and realize how much easier things truly are for me now. \n\nUnfortunately I think the uncomfortable feeling is just part of the process, and a big part of recovery is learning how to sit with uncomfortable feelings without needing to DO anything about it. It might feel like you can't cope with the weight gain right now but that's just your disordered brain wanting you to go back to the ED. Even though it's really hard, I believe that you CAN do this.
