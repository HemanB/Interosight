  "selftext": "Tik tok is absolutely becoming the new tumblr. I started liking body positivity videos and now my fyp is flooded with gym vids, what I eat in a days, and \u201crecovery\u201d vlogs because those are all sort of related topics ig. The body checking is scarily prevalent on there, too. I\u2019m thinking of just deleting the app and redownloading it bc that resets your fyp preferences. \n\nEven ignoring my personal triggers and the fact that I\u2019m still only 18, I\u2019m seriously worried about the younger generation of kids who are super susceptible to this kind of thing. I think we all understand the rabbit hole social media can be but lowkey tik tok may be even worse because it\u2019s a never-ending stream of content. Idk maybe I\u2019m just being paranoid lol?",
