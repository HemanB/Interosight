Don't you worry that you will be hungry again too soon\" \n\n*\"uhh.. I don't know, I don't really think about it, if I get hungry I'll eat something else I suppose\"*\n\n\"And you're like okay with being hungry?\"\n\n*\"Yea can eat later!\"*\n\n**Fml. Why is it that every time I eat, I NEED to feel full. Like what the fuck is the point of eating if it doesn't make me feel any more full than i was before.** It's literally why I starve all day and eat all my cals in the evening. So I can actually get full once a day. She just runs on \"just satisfied enough\" all day!",

So it does kinda matter how you were raised or who you were raised around makes a difference I think. Some folks never had or don't know about good smelling/ tasting foods is all  and I believe it could make all the difference in the world.  Don't knock it till you try it.
