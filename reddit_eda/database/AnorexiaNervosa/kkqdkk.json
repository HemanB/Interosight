  "selftext": "Yeah, you, who feels fckin invalid all the time but especially during the holidays!\n\nOvereating for a day, or two days, or a whole damn week for that matter does not make you invalid. Starving and fucking with your metabolism for 360+ days of a year is not invalid. Enjoying your holidays is not invalid - neither is dreading them or hating yourself after them or any combination of these. Your poor brain, giving you shit for even a few days when everything is supposed to be *merry and bright* is not god damn invalid. Coming here, seeking reassurance from strangers is not invalid. But I hope you did find that reassurance.",
