All I said is that you can't be bulimic and anorexic at the same time, which goes to show how little they actually bother. \n\nThat being said, there's a lot to unpack here. First of all, AN-BP doesn't exist in the ICD due to the way AN is defined and categorized; it's strictly a DSM diagnosis.\n\nThen, there are other diagnoses that could be given, which seems more likely (given this episode is from the early 2000s and) she doesn't meet the diagnostic criteria for AN from the DSM; it's more likely she's diagnosed with OSFED, bulimia nervosa, or feeding or eating disorder, unspecified.\n\nTo clarify a bit, she could be diagnosed with AN under the ICD-11, or with atypical AN under the ICD-10, but not with AN-BP. \n\nNow, onto what the difference is; basically, AN-BP is a diagnosis that's given if you fit all of the diagnostic criteria for AN (according to the DSM, not the ICD), and have engaged in recurrent episodes of binging and purging within a set time frame, exclusively during an episode of AN. If you have binged and purged recurrently within that time frame, but don't meet the diagnostic criteria for AN (most commonly the BMI requirements, which is bullshit; I'm glad the ICD changed that), you get hit with bulimia nervosa (as long as you meet the diagnostic criteria of BN, of course, but I hope you get what I mean).\n\nThat being said, AN-BP and AN-R are bullshit; the diagnostic criteria is outdated. Separating a disorder like that even though it's a spectrum, even though symptoms do change, is also a bit weird. The way they use BN as a backup diagnosis for AN-BP is also kind of icky. Sadly, it likely won't get changed any time soon. The last revision (although, to be fair, it wasn't a new edition, just a revision) came out 3 years ago.",

Like, it just feels like a \"hey, look at those addicts; look at how we're helping them! doesn't that feel good\" kind of show, while also satisfying people's morbid urges. \n\nI worked in a psych ward for a while, and most of the patients had one substance abuse issues or another (mostly alcohol, but also opioids, cocaine, weed, etc.; the patients who were addicted to \"harder\" drugs were on a different ward). It's a bleak reality. Substance abuse issues suck ass, as do other kinds of addiction. Exploiting people at their lowest point, forcing them into intervention or punishing them while filming, is just horrid. Why can't the family just cut contact, or enforce boundaries? Why do they need a film crew? \n\nIf the producers actually wanted to make a change, create a better world, help addicts and their families (which, be real, they don't), they'd donate money, or create a documentary about a treatment center, or something respectful. Not this. Not like this. \n\nI'm sorry for the rant, but this stuff is honestly infuriating. People deserve dignity, at all times, and it feels like they are stripping that away for money.",

The people behind the show however were most concerned about shock value and marketing promotion and their tactics were somewhat morally dubious. They would say things \"we don't want to encourage you to do \\_\\_\\_\\_, but if you're going to do it anyway we'd like to get it on film\"",
