Was wondering if anyone else has experienced this?\n\nThere will be weeks where I go without eating, or intentionally eating little, but then experience a massive binging episode where I eat everything in my kitchen, and can't physically stop. And the cycle repeats. I hate this relationship with food.",

It's almost like I lose my ability to experience fullness in that session. I feel regret afterwards, and my stomach feels horrible. I feel bloated and in pain until the next day. I do go back to restricting lower to compensate for the excess calories.",

Restrictions and binge eating go hand in hand and while the medical definition of Ana is to be under a certain body weight- how the fuck did these ppl get there you know? At my lowest weight technically I wouldn\u2019t be Anorexic because my bmi was still the lowest end of normal,  but my kidneys had acute failure. Currently my diet consists of a bowl of  cucumber tomato feta sometimes baked buff cauliflower that I\u2019ve been measuring and zoodles with shrimp, a truly and coffee besides water. I just bout fiber one brownies and oikos triple zero yogurt to add to the mix by all means I\u2019ve relapsed but I think eating a whole zucchini of noodles and like 5 shrimp is a binge especially if I eat some cauliflower or pickles after but realistically my intake especially if a work out at all is not in the range of a healthy diet at all. But I mean true binges can also happen which I\u2019ve also experienced where I\u2019ve eaten half of a xl calzone and could still eat or eating cold fries from the fridge while heating up food in the microwave while the ovens preheating then feeling guilty about it and not eat for a couple days then going on a crazy restriction episode. It\u2019s not always as ppl think",
