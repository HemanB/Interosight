  "selftext": "Telling a person that they don\u2019t want anorexia because \u201cit\u2019s good to have some meat on your bones\u201d is the worst reasoning in my opinion. There SO many worse consequences that come with living this way.\n\nThe worst part for me isn\u2019t even that I\u2019m \u201cmissing out\u201d on eating fun foods/eating events, I\u2019m used to that. The worst part is the horrible, selfish person I become when I restrict. I have wasted so much of my life worrying about food that I can\u2019t help but wonder who I could have been if I had done more worthwhile things.",

Met my half sister for the first time and went out for breakfast? Purged in the restaurant bathroom. My little brothers 13th birthday at the go cart track? The whole time I spent it trying not to pass out, feeling SO BAD because all the walking while saving face around my family. I have so many more examples I'm sitting here bumming myself out just thinking about it.",

It can be really hard when someone close to you is struggling, to watch them engage in self destructive behaviors and not knowing how to help. It\u2019s good that you are taking the time to understand it though. I have faith that she will recover with your support <3",
