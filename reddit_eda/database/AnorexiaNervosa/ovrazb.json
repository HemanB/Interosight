Then other days I cry over my weight and ended up punishing myself for gaining weight or not counting calories. Fuck....... I'm so confused. I'm not diagnosed by a professional so this makes me even more nuts. I could be just faking it.. I don't know..... Does anyone ever feel like this? I have no one to talk in real life",

At the time that was a required criteria for diagnosis, and I was actually told to lose more weight. Personally I go through periods of high restriction, then I struggle with trying to control binges. As an adult I\u2019ve learned this is disordered behavior, but it almost feels like being older adds more difficulty to getting diagnosed. \n\nA lot of things make me feel like maybe I\u2019m faking it, but I also can\u2019t stop it on my own. The restriction, the obsession with tracking, the daily weigh-in rituals, the thoughts of fuck it I\u2019m \u201cfailing\u201d and binge episodes taking over, being angry at myself for \u201callowing\u201d myself to gain weight\u2026 it\u2019s exhausting.",

My mind is also switching from : Oh, lets fast for X days - and ah, i should give up this ed and eat the unhealthy stuff... \nOnly one of my closest friend understands, what is going on, but alot of people think \" Im just eating clean and i love running\" It is very annoying. So, as u can see, alot of people are not understanding what ed's actually are. I think u are not faking it. It is only the part of our brain thinking : I am not sick enough...",

In my opinion, even having an average calorie intake but obsessing all day over it could be considered an eating disorder (even wikipedia describes it as \u201ca mental disorder defined by abnormal that negatively affects a person\u2019s physical or MENTAL health\u201d).\nSending much love to you, have a great day <3",
