  "selftext": "I'm a diligent student, graduating with my BS in psychology (ironic) in May, have a 4.0, and yet I'm struggling and failing to complete my work. It makes me feel like shit because the reason I can't isn't clear. I end up doing crosswords and watching YouTube all day and falling into the reddit rabbit hole.\n\nI feel like I just don't have mental energy, but it seems like such bullshit that I'd be able to do those other mindless activities but can't sit down and write an essay or read abstracts. It isn't just anxiety-procrastinating, which I know I also do. At this point I feel like I physically can't. I just stare at the screen. It makes me hate myself and think I'm just making things up.\n\nI've been weak, cold, and dizzy almost every day, though I am making efforts to eat more. But I can't just tell my professor, sorry, I've been starving myself (with a daily mental breakdown, just to mix it up) so I wasn't able to get my work done. Obviously restriction worsens emotional stuff as well, which includes my OCD and anxiety, and that takes up mental energy to cope with too.\n\nDoes anyone else experience this? Am I just being a slacker?",

With recovery, you can definitely gain that back. You also still have time to right the ship and make sure you don't end up wasting your university experience! Also, if you are struggling, it's always worth it to reach out to professors or the dean of students office. My case manager there was incredible and helped me and advocated for me so much.\n\nI feel like the problem with anorexia is that professors will understand anxiety and depression, but a lot of them don't specialize in EDs and I'm scared they will think like \"okay, so then eat and don't use anorexia as an excuse\". I'm scared to try and reach out to a doctor because I don't want to be told to gain weight. I also don't look underweight yet (I think I lost weight, but not a lot) so I feel like they might not take that seriously either.\n\nAHHH anyway I'm glad I'm not alone in this haha.

When all this stuff first started happening, I went back to self-harming (which for me is a compulsive/control behavior) to deal with the anxiety. My relationship OCD spiked, which worsened everything, then I just kind of... slid back into my ED behaviors, which then replaced the self-harm and ROCD.\n\nMy plan is to try and get a weight check tomorrow at CVS. When I saw my doctor in January she said that I could come back for a weight check if I was struggling in a few months, but clearly that's not an option now. I generally try to avoid seeing my weight, but I am thinking of trying to find a nutritionist as well as an ED therapist, and if I do, I want to be able to be forthcoming about wherever I'm at. Right now I have *literally* no idea what my weight could be in relation to in January. If my weight is for some reason at a more concerning point than I expected, then I definitely will pursue a nutritionist because even though I HATE the idea of being told to gain weight, I know there's a certain point at which I need professional support and can't just do this alone.\n\nSo once I hopefully get a better picture of where I stand, I think I'll feel more comfortable talking to my professors openly about what's been going on. I guess I'll just feel like I am more validated if I know for sure that I've lost weight? It like \"proves\" that I'm restricting and it's something tangible I can explain to my professors.

          "body": "You are not alone! This was me 100% before I graduated (thank goodness I\u2019m done & out of there). Complete inability to focus, attention span of a concussed goldfish, pretty much 0 retention of new material unless I was hopped up on enough caffeine/anxiety to power through.\n\nIt sucked realizing that my ED was drawing strength from one of the loves of my life: academia.\n\nLooking back, I can confidently say I only graduated because of the following:\n\n\u2022 I made the dean\u2019s list my very first semester of college, and tbh I kind of used my initially high GPA as a buffer of sorts to dip into during the tougher semesters. \nBy the time I was done and graduated, my GPA was hovering around a 3.4 or something. So not the best by my standards (for me) but not too shabby all things considering!\n\n\u2022 I was honest & upfront with my profs...kinda. I didn\u2019t go into details about the ED, but went to them one on one and let them know I was really struggling with my mental health, and also with the unhealthy coping mechanisms I\u2019d developed as a result. No specifics, just very factual. I let them know I was in therapy (at the time) and working with a psychiatrist to try and help me along. Letting them know about the psychiatrist was important because I was able to basically say, \u201csorry if my attendance/work quality/attention span is incredibly hit or miss. It probably will be for several months, because we are trying to figure out dosages. I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019m going to react, but I am going to try my best and I will try to keep you informed on my progress.\u201d\n\nI was lucky enough to have three very understanding, compassionate, and flexible professors. I was a double major, two of them made up the entire department of one of my majors, and the other was a long-time prof of mine for my other major. They had seen me for all 4 years, so they all got first hand seats to watch my mental decline lol. But it ended up working in my favor, because they had already seen what I was capable of when I was doing well mentally. Because of that, they were willing to be incredibly accommodating and work with me to help me find my potential again.\nI sincerely believe I wouldn\u2019t have graduated without them.\n\n\nI would encourage you to talk to your prof. You don\u2019t need to give details, but don\u2019t sugar coat anything. Just be factual and goal-oriented: \u201cThis thing is happening. It is causing these issues for me. Here\u2019s what I\u2019m doing to try and mitigate the negative effects, I would greatly appreciate your patience as I try my best to complete your work during this difficult time.\u201d \nIt\u2019s scary and hard but very important. Out of all the profs I had to talk to about my mental health, I only had mediocre to less than helpful reactions from two of them. The rest were all willing to work with me.",

I'm an open book with mental health stuff though so they practically know my life story by now.\n\nI think my biggest concern is telling them about my eating disorder stuff. They completely understand anxiety/OCD/mental health in general, but I feel like saying that my anorexia/restriction is making it difficult for me to focus and rise to the occasion sounds so dumb and they'll just be like \"....or you could eat and this wouldn't be a problem,\" you know? I guess I don't need to go into detail, but I'm super honest and I want them to know what's happening instead of just saying it's my anxiety or whatever.",

It\u2019s worse than ever right now because food intake is the only I can control in my current environment/lockdown. \n\nIf it\u2019s true for you, maybe approach it like, \u201cHey, my OCD sometimes manifests itself in my relationship with food. I\u2019m aware of this and working on it, but it\u2019s really impacting my ability to focus and turn in good work right now.\u201d\n\nOr even, \u201cHey, so my OCD behaviors are really taking over right now because I feel like I have such a lack of control during this time/these circumstances. They\u2019re getting in the way, but I\u2019m aware and trying to address them to minimize the effects.\u201d\n\nOr something like that? And I 100% understand not wanting to disclose an ED even if you\u2019ve discussed other mental health stuff. For me, my ED is so much more...vulnerable? Intimate? Than my anxiety/depression/OCD/whatever. The good news is that they\u2019re psych profs \u2014 they should be knowledgeable enough to not tell you to \u201cjust eat\u201d (although let\u2019s be real, ignorance abounds and it is a risk). \n\nJust remember: you can disclose however much you want to or don\u2019t want to! You could even just tell them that you\u2019re struggling with a different aspect of your mental health that you\u2019re not comfortable disclosing, but that it ties in closely with x/y/z you\u2019ve already discussed with them or something?\n\nSorry I feel like I\u2019m rambling lol. Either way, you got this! It\u2019s a weird and stressful time for everyone, and you\u2019re not alone!",

          "body": "Yup, it was absolutely triggered by my GAD/OCD. When all this stuff first started happening, I went back to self-harming (which for me is a compulsive/control behavior) to deal with the anxiety. My relationship OCD spiked, which worsened everything, then I just kind of... slid back into my ED behaviors, which then replaced the self-harm and ROCD.\n\nMy plan is to try and get a weight check tomorrow at CVS. When I saw my doctor in January she said that I could come back for a weight check if I was struggling in a few months, but clearly that's not an option now. I generally try to avoid seeing my weight, but I am thinking of trying to find a nutritionist as well as an ED therapist, and if I do, I want to be able to be forthcoming about wherever I'm at. Right now I have *literally* no idea what my weight could be in relation to in January. If my weight is for some reason at a more concerning point than I expected, then I definitely will pursue a nutritionist because even though I HATE the idea of being told to gain weight, I know there's a certain point at which I need professional support and can't just do this alone.\n\nSo once I hopefully get a better picture of where I stand, I think I'll feel more comfortable talking to my professors openly about what's been going on. I guess I'll just feel like I am more validated if I know for sure that I've lost weight? It like \"proves\" that I'm restricting and it's something tangible I can explain to my professors. Sorry I'm totally rambling too but thank you so much for your support and listening ear. All of this is so stressful for me, ugh. Thank you again <3",
