  "selftext": "I feels so disappointed in myself because I worked so hard over all of last year to gain this weight, and I was so determined then, but now that I actually am a healthy weight I just feel really fat and miss everything about being as thin as I was. Like I worked so hard to actually become healthy, and now that I'm healthy I feel like it wasn't worth it... Sometimes I feel like I made a mistake, but then I feel worse for feeling like that, so disappointed in myself for wishing to go back to that horrible illness, but then keep missing it... \n\nSorry if this broke any rules or isn't allowed here; I haven't really used reddit in a few years.",

And I mean it took my so long to come to terms with that but once you do, you\u2019ll notice just how much you\u2019ve missed out on because of the disorder and you can finally begin to live again.

I lied very well at how I lost weight so easily and quickly. My weight came off so fast that I couldnt see how bad I had gotten. It wasnt until my best friends called me out on it on a moms getaway over the summer. I begged them not too tell my spouse ( I know how awful that sounds) and I told them I would get professional help. I didn't. I tried to fix it on my own. I did pretty well for no help. At first, it felt awful. Then, it felt amazing to give myself permission to eat again.... I binged without purging. My hair has stopped falling out, I don't have the white little hairs growing on me anymore and I am not as cold as I used to be. I know overall, I am doing the right thing for my body, but I absolutely hate it. Physically and mentally hate it. I now hate the way my body looks, and feels...even more so then i did before. At this very moment, I would do anything not too crave food, not too feel hunger, and to have that control again. I can remember feeling so genuinely fat still when people would compliment me. I was so addicted to the praise yet I also didn't want the attention on my body either. I wanted to not be hungry ever but I also wanted to have a good enough body to eat whatever i wanted. I didnt want anyone to ever know I was not eating or purging what I did eat, yet at the same time I was screaming inside for someone to lovingly notice that something was wrong..... I was constantly at odds with myself. It was exhausting. It still is. My body issues have not gone away. I just struggle on different sides at different times( if that's makes sense). Either way..... To fat...to thin....my entire day and mind set...every single thing revolves around how much I hate my body and myself and food. It always has. During the holidays...when I binge eat... I miss anorexia and purging more than ever.\nI am not sure if what I typed made sense to anyone else, but thanks for letting me vent. I never shared anything like that before. Hang in there everyone .",
