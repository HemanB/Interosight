  "selftext": "as the title says, a couple months back I hit my gw, I have no desire to lower it and I\u2019ve just been maintaining ever since. I will say I am more comfortable in my skin, but (and this will probably come as a shock to no one) I\u2019m not happy. like at all. nobody treats me differently, in fact people are typically meaner. I hardly recognize myself when I look in the mirror, and not in a good way. It almost makes me feel guilty seeing how thin I am?? I miss my ass but it\u2019s not enough to make me wanna gain bc that\u2019s the only thing I miss. I\u2019ve lost a lot of hair and if I didn\u2019t have a bunch of it to begin with I\u2019d probably be balding. Im still depressed (duh) and the only thing I really got out of it was that I don\u2019t hate my thighs anymore. Idk why I\u2019m posting this, ig just to give some insight on how truly pointless and underwhelming it all is? wanting to know if anyone can relate??",
