      "body": "I've been going through a similar thing where my bf of a little over a year has made it clear that if I continue to get worse it will end the relationship down the road. It was actually what pushed me to go see a doctor and set an appointment with a therapist. I'm terrified and its overwhelming, but I know I'd rather have my life with him than with this disorder no matter how hard it is. That being said, I'm still tempted to cancel my appointments and just stop. I will say though that the recovery aspect seems a lot easier with the right supports and I'd again rather do this now while he's still willing to support me than try to recover down the road when I'm alone. It will always be hard and I wish you the best!",

I stormed out of the house and ended up calling 1800-273-8255 and they told me i need to be honest with him and tell him whats really going on. He was so supportive and let me set a bunch of rules like no talking about amount/healthiness/timing of when i eat and hiding the scale to help avoid triggers. But that was literally yesterday so i also know i need to get professional help but i'm also not really ready or sure where to start. I'm scared of being put back on antidepressants because last time it made me feel worse. Basically I had bad experience with trial and error of meds and just quit them all together. I need to get TALK therapy but its expensive man idk where to go",

Hopefully, you'll figure it out as well. Getting help is never an easy road but I can assure you that it will be a happy road. Good luck with everything!",

You could mention it at a physical with your GP that you believe you are restricting and you're not sure what to do. That's the first step i took, but it wasn't for another year i got into a program. Although, i was in denial, and only told him i was having issues gaining weight.",
