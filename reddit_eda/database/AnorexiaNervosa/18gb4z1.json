  "selftext": "oats have been my breakfast obsession since this summer when i started \u201crecovery.\u201d i would always have a bowl of oats with blueberries (bc obvi - lowest cal) and no other toppings. i never took pictures of this breakfast because it was so sad that it didn\u2019t even look appealing.\n\n\nthe first picture is from october 15 when i considered myself to be nearly fully recovered. i considered this a \u201chuge\u201d breakfast with absolutely loaded toppings and immediately went to do a workout afterwards to \u201cuse the energy.\u201d i only added pb, granola, and banana rarely because i thought it was so much.\n\n\nevery picture is in chronological order before my forced treatment started around november 23 (3rd pic). i started adding pb and granola every day. i had banana instead of blueberries despite the higher caloric content.\n\n\nin the 4th picture, i finally tried caramelized apple on top, which was cooked with maple syrup. i was so scared and didn\u2019t try any other toppings, but it was so good.\n\n\nthen, i started adding a couple small slices of chocolate with some shreddings.\n\n\ni\u2019ve now had apple oats with pb and granola.\n\n\nthe last couple days, ive tried nutella with banana, an entire reese\u2019s christmas tree candy, and granola. nutella is such a big fear food and ive been having it nearly every day on my oats.\n\n\ni know that this is a pretty long post but i was just scrolling through my camera roll and saw these as i realized how much of a change there has been in the past two months, from sad, unpictured, blueberry to nutella and banana-filled oats : ).",

I\u2019ve always thought camera rolls are the enemy of recovery, but you\u2019ve proven that they can be the exact opposite\u2014indicators of just how far we\u2019ve come. Please keep it up, as these look increasingly delicious!",

I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been so directly confronted with the damage I do to my body and how much I deny it before now.\n\nThe act of caring for yourself and enjoying a meal is so powerful to me. I can identify so much with the fear \u2013 your gradual progress and courage is something I feel like really translates through just the pictures. I love the slow progression. I love how I can visualize your growing happiness and bravery with every new addition.\n\nI JUST THINK IT\u2019S NEAT OKAY.\n\nBut no, seriously OP, good job. This is amazing. Thanks for the encouragement.",
