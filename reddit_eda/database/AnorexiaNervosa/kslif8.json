When I finally went into a recovery program, there were people of ALL sizes and only one person was \u201cskeleton\u201d like but not close to whats advertised in the media. Its a mindset not a weight that makes you anorexic and I think you would be surprised by who you see there if you go to a group program. As for food, the doctors know you will probably go home and restrict. But thats part of the recovery part, its not about being perfect, its about taking small steps to get you to recovery. Recovery is not based on just eating and I think you might be seeing it as just that. It tackles all areas and the mindset of why you restrict. So a doctor is not going to say you are \u201ccured\u201d as soon as you eat two meals because and ED is not really about eating.... SO If you get turned away or not taken seriously then its not the program for you and find someone else ASAP. Some people dont do well with groups and do better with individual treatment but a good program/ doctor will know that a healthy weight is not a sign of recovery. It just means that you arent going to die.",

BUT I can tell you though that my BMI was not underweight when I was hospitalized. It wasnt underweight when I was asked to go to residential program. All bodies are different so its really unfair to compare yours to someone elses. Also if you are restricting you most likely are malnourished and that can be at any weight, especially if you are saying your mental state is at an all time low... mood is 100% controlled by how much you are nourishing yourself. Your brain literally cant function so it stops trying go regulate mood and emotion when its malnourished. \n\nI am sure digital is different for a day program... but regardless it still will have an effect because you are still talking and being around professionals who understand and know eating disorders. Its sooooo much more then just restriction as silly as that sounds. Its definitely a major part but they will start showing you how to cope with those thoughts as well. You can also always start at a day program and then switch or you could do a residential and always go back to a day program. Nothing is set in stone and you can always change your mind!",

BUT I can tell you though that my BMI was not underweight when I was hospitalized. It wasnt underweight when I was asked to go to residential program. All bodies are different so its really unfair to compare yours to someone elses. Also if you are restricting you most likely are malnourished and that can be at any weight, especially if you are saying your mental state is at an all time low... mood is 100% controlled by how much you are nourishing yourself. Your brain literally cant function so it stops trying go regulate mood and emotion when its malnourished. \n\nI am sure digital is different for a day program... but regardless it still will have an effect because you are still talking and being around professionals who understand and know eating disorders. Its sooooo much more then just restriction as silly as that sounds. Its definitely a major part but they will start showing you how to cope with those thoughts as well. You can also always start at a day program and then switch or you could do a residential and always go back to a day program. Nothing is set in stone and you can always change your mind!",

      "body": "Go to a doctor and ask for an EKG but tell them that you are having strong palpitations. I would tell them that you have an ED and restrict food too. This way the can help you fully. I dont want to scare you but that is a bad sign..\n\nDo they happen more frequently when you are in the cold, walking/ working out for long periods, or after heavy restriction? Are you getting light headed in the shower, standing up from the ground, or walking up stairs? Do you feet or hands tingle or fall asleep randomly or easily? Do your ankles swell up a lot by the end of the day? I used to faint when I would stand up from the ground and in the shower or my eyes would like black out or fuzz out (even just while standing.) I couldn't be in the frozen isle of the grocery store with summer clothes on or any cold temps because it would trigger bad palpitations. But I also would just get them randomly while taking with someone or just being me and standing or sitting.... These are all signs I had and yours probably will if your heart isn't strong enough to deliver blood through the body or a valve has prolapsed (I think im saying that correctly)\n\nThey will refer you to a cardiac specialist anyways and you should go asap or find a treatment program that monitors your health. I had an EKG done twice a week and they took pee samples and blood samples while I was in a critical state.\n\nBut it solely relies on you to take care of yourself.  If you are cutting out food groups like fats, carbs, proteins, etc.... but maybe not restricting heavy it will still make you at risk for a heart attack or damage. An electrolyte imbalance can cause this too which happens when you restrict, exclude food groups, or drink an excessive amount of water.\n\nYour body is essentially eating your heart muscle to get energy, same thing with your brain, same thing with any muscle in your body.\n\nThe GOOD NEWS is that this can all be reversed if you start eating FULL meals (I mean all food groups and enough food) almost immediately.  But if you don't start recovering you can do damage that cant be reversed in the long run like me. This is why finding an all inclusive program (has a onsite doctor, nurse, therapist, group sessions, nutritionist, etc....) is so important.",
