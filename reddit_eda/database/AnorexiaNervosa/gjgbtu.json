I'm weight restored and I was really putting in the work on my mental recovery too, and rationally, I *know* that I'm better and happier for it than when I was restricting... but now I have too much time to overthink my food and my weight and my relationship to both, and all I want is to restrict, restrict, restrict, just so I could feel like I'm control of *something*.",

      "body": "It might feel impossible but you can get better. Whether better means recovered, approaching recovery, or learning to live with the ED, can can get there. You have the strength in you, even if it doesn't feel like it. You've made it this far, which is a tough one on its own, and you can undoubtedly make it further. Consider changes you might need to make, or priorities to reconsider, that could maximise your potential to achieve 'better'. If all else fails, listen to a beautiful song and try to feel peace in the moment. I wish you the best of luck.",

Sometimes you gotta hurt a little to know what it means to be strong.",

Anti anxiety medicine is what finally helped me win my battle with eating/myself. It\u2019s not a magic pill but it just keeps your mind from wandering to dark corners and places of defeat",
