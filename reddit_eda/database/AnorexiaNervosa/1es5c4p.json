Going out to eat brings me immense anxiety, it makes dates with my bf unbearable, it makes dinners with my parents unbearable, it just makes LIFE unbearable.\n\nDo you know the things I'd do, to be able to shut up this voice in my head? So I could just enjoy a damn latte and bagel with my mom at a little cafe? Oh my god, I would do anything. I'm sobbing as I write this post. I'm only 21, and my body looks hideous and gross, with stretch marks from weight gain from my last recovery.\n\nI can't do this anymore. I now understand why the mortality rate is so high.",
