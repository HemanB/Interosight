  "selftext": "Anorexia is so weird. I\u2019m so obsessed with that smaller number on the scale that I don\u2019t even care how awful I\u2019m starting to look. I can\u2019t find clothes that fit. I can\u2019t sit anywhere comfortably. I\u2019m losing all my hair. I\u2019m always cold and cranky. I\u2019m eating more but not enough. I\u2019m in treatment, but also in denial about how bad things are.\n\nI\u2019ve started planning meals with others more because it\u2019s the only time I\u2019ll eat. I\u2019ll be on vacation with my boyfriend for a few weeks and he\u2019s worried I won\u2019t eat or have energy to be outside hiking and stuff. It makes me so sad, yet I need that rush of happiness from that lowest number.",
