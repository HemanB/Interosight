      "body": "Just wanted to mention some stuff that you may already be aware of but I wasn\u2019t sure. My opinion on this is that it\u2019s usually bullshit for a few reasons. \n\n1.) People ABSOLUTELY lie about that kind of thing... it\u2019s seen as \u201cquirky\u201d to say things like \u201clol I love cheeseburgers and eat like sooo much but look how petite I am\u201d... Many high fashion models are guilty of this even. (Bella hadid and Kendal Jenner especially annoy the fuck out of me with how much they talk about how \u201cbad\u201d their diets are)... The issue is that these people want to be seen as naturally beautiful, and tie their identity to their appearance. If they admit to putting effort into their appearance, it shatters the illusion of perfection they are aiming to create. It\u2019s the same reason many models refuse to admit to getting plastic surgery, even if it\u2019s obvious. \n\nAnother reason they could be putting this image up is to avoid criticism or concern. I had a friend that was insanely beautiful growing up, and was literally stick thin. She\u2019s still insanely beautiful and actually has a pretty successful Instagram now. She would constantly say things like \u201cI wish I could gain weight\u201d, and \u201cI love eating soooo much. I literally eat nothing but sweets and pizza lolll\u201d... anyway I knew it was all bullshit. The real reason she was insanely skinny was because she has severe anxiety that made her feel too sick to eat. She also engaged in self harm and other self destructive behaviors. While she wasn\u2019t actively searching to lose weight, she stayed skinny as a result of her mental illness. She would say those things as a way to mask the pain she was experiencing, and to avoid being \u201clooked down on\u201d as she put it. \n\nGenetics only go so far. There are rare occasions that people are naturally thin, but even then, their lifestyle influences it whether they know it or not. \n\nAlso, They simply may be under the impression that they are eating more than they really are because of their hunger cues. \nAnother good friend of mine had no hunger cues, and always talked about how much unhealthy food she ate. She would eat \u201cunhealthy\u201d, but would only eat like 1 slice of pizza a day and not much else. This is because she didn\u2019t get hungry.... This is not normal. In her case this was caused by a medical issue. She ended up having a hormonal disorder that messed with hunger signals. That isn\u2019t healthy, and she had pretty severe vitamin deficiencies without even knowing it. If someone\u2019s baseline is to feel shitty, they aren\u2019t naturally thin. They just don\u2019t know how to be healthy. That\u2019s not something to envy. \n\nI know the urge to be thin often overshadows the care for health, but I bring these things up for a reason. People passing off insane thinness as being effortless, are usually lying to promote an image, or they live unhealthy lifestyles themselves. That\u2019s the majority of people. Yes there are still outliers, but it\u2019s pretty rare. It\u2019s ok that u aren\u2019t an outlier. You are ok the way u are. Your genetics aren\u2019t wrong, you just don\u2019t know the entire story of other people\u2019s lives. Don\u2019t take what they say at face value. Don\u2019t let their \u201cgenetics\u201d be a reason to hate on yourself.",
