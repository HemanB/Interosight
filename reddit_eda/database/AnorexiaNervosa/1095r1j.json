I feel better, no dark circles, complexion more even, and my hair is happy and not falling out. My eyelashes are so long and full. I never realized how much anorexia ravished every inch of my body.",

I compare them to pictures from when I was recovered earlier this year. I cannot believe I thought I looked bad then. I looked so cute and pretty. I'm going to hang onto these so that every time I get the urge to relapse, I will remember that I was balding, had sunken eyes and cheeks, irritated and discolored skin, and couldn't be comfortable in any position. Healthy is pretty.",
