  "selftext": "Since I was sent to the hospital last year and put into \u201crecovery\u201d its so much worse. Everyone around me is like \u201cokay, she went to the hospital so she\u2019s ALL BETTER now\u201d it\u2019s like they just expect me to be fine again. But I\u2019m not, and they don\u2019t care. I gained 46 lbs in recovery, and I fucking hate it. Every time I look in the mirror I just breakdown. I have to cry in the shower just so my family won\u2019t hear, because they don\u2019t understand it. I hate going outside, I hate people, I literally hate living. And no one notices how much pain I\u2019m in. Because I\u2019m always the happy outgoing girl that\u2019s there for everyone else. But why is no one here for me when I\u2019m in such a dark place? Am I being too selfish to ask for my mom to hug me and tell me it\u2019s okay? Or for my siblings to stop making fun of my body? For my dance instructor to acknowledge my hard work and passion? Or for my best friend to listen to me? I feel like I\u2019m just annoying and not good enough for anyone :/",

I'm so damn mad at people being so uneducated about eating disorders and stuff and also for the so called \"recovery\" where people don't even care if you feel better and if your relationship with food and your body is better and just want you to stop being underweight..",
