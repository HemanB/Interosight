  "selftext": "I found my diary from when I was ten years old. I wasn\u2019t anorexic at that age but apparently that\u2019s when the thoughts began. I don\u2019t remember this at all (it was 30 ish years ago) but by 14 I was hospitalized for AN. Now in my early 40s it\u2019s back. It\u2019s like a beast that never goes away. Anyone else have it return after literal decades? ",
