I\u2019ve never been so happy to have cramps again and pms, I came running down the stairs and yelled I got my period and even my parents were happy, sorry had to share somewhere\ud83e\udd20 but I\u2019m praying all of you guys in recovery are doing well too, I\u2019m not fully recovered by ANY MEANS but that definitely meant a lot given I haven\u2019t gotten in a longgggg time.",
