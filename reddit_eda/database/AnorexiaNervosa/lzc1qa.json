  "selftext": "My eating disorder started out of a desire to have control over something in my life.  I was in charge of what I ate and how much I ate.  When my body told me it was hungry and wanted to eat, I could say no.  I could see the evidence that it was working when I got on the scale and my number had gone down.  It was instant reinforcement.  But I have come to realize that ED was simply another abuser in my life.  It groomed me.  It let me think I was in control but it was manipulating me.  And I wanted to please it.  I wanted to be good at it.  **But I'm done being ED's victim.**  The real control is in saying no to ED.  I started eating this week.  It hasn't been easy.  Frankly, I feel like shit.  My stomach is a mess, I'm bloated, I have bad headaches, I keep blacking out, the acid reflux is nasty.  I don't care.  I'm eating.  **F\\*\\*k you ED!**",

It takes awhile for your body to trust that you\u2019ll keep eating, and in my experience it took months before the bloating stopped but recovery has been so worth it.",
