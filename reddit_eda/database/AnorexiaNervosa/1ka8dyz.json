  "selftext": "i am not currently in the process of recovering from my own ED. however, i thought this was worth sharing.\n\ni foster cats. many of them come in sick, malnourished, weak beyond belief. i use up all the cans of cat food and bags of dry food i have in an extremely short amount of time because they are just so hungry.\nand you know what? i'm glad they're eating me out of house and home.\nthey've been starving half to death. they have no energy to play, to love their new lives free from danger. they've been absolutely miserable.\ni feed them one can for breakfast. they gobble it up in minutes. they're still hungry--so guess what? \ni give them another can. i give them all the food they want and need until they're satisfied.\nat the end of the day, their bellies are bloated--and they're happy.\nthey need all that food to recover. i watch them flourish day by day as they nourish their bodies and gain back the zest for life they lost.\nso what if they're bloated? so what if they gained weight? these angels have suffered so much, and now they are RECOVERING.\n\nyou need food in recovery. you need to eat, to thrive. you deserve to be your healthiest, happiest self, free from your disorder. \n\nhere is one of my current gremlins guarding her very messy food :)",
