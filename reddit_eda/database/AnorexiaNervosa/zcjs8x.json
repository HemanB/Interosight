Sweet potato toast. Sweet potato jacket potato. Stir fry. Ramen. Homemade lentil dahl or curry, with rice. \n\nDesserts - have a Google but things like avocado chocolate mousse/pudding, nice cream/banana ice cream, chia coconut pudding, nut butter stuffed dates, heated up protein bars, flapjacks, etc.",
