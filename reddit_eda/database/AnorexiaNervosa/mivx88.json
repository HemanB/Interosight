I want to look \u2018sick\u2019 and I realise that is so screwed up, and I don\u2019t understand why; it makes me feel like such a despicable human being, but I do. I can\u2019t keep doing this anymore. I want to lose weight but I can\u2019t because I\u2019m under the constant surveillance of my parents this Easter holiday. I also can\u2019t afford to lose weight and become sick again because I need to have the capacity to function for the sake of my A Levels next year. I just want this all to stop. As a side note, sometimes I do look a tiny bit sick when I look in the mirror, but most of the time I don\u2019t. It\u2019s so difficult to know which image to trust and whether it is just a projection of my own worst fears, as we don\u2019t own any scales.",

I have a tendency to shut down when anyone gets a little \u2018heavy handed\u2019 and is a little too forward for my liking in terms of interventional matters, or I feel is approaching it with a lack of compassion. This seems to be just about every person I have confided in prior, so I am a little stumped as to who to turn to. I recently spoke to a teacher about it who was quite clinical in their approach, and I completely closed myself off out of fear and due to feeling a little unable to disclose anything personal in that kind of an environment. I\u2019d love to try with another teacher but I know that I worried them as they vocalised this and said they would like to speak to me once we return to school, so I think this is looking rather difficult and I don\u2019t know how to articulate the fact that I wish they would show a little more compassion without sounding rude! I understand their handling of it, of course, is born out of care, but it\u2019s really hard to talk to someone who can be a little unfeeling.",
