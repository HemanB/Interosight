Of course this doesn't lessen the severity of what's going on though. A label or diagnosis is only helpful in so far as it helps the person. I'm a guy and to admit I had anorexia is not helpful for me. I believe that it was eating disorder behaviour secondary to depression and the need for control, and body image issues, etc. But the point being that if what you are struggling with is affecting your health, it is an issue. Don't let anyone tell you you aren't struggling if you are. An official diagnosis may be different than what you think or expect but that doesn't change your worth or your need for help. Do try and find out what's at the root though. Wishing you all the love :)",

They found a large number of individuals were being diagnosed with OSFED/AAN despite meeting the criteria for AN, which ended up becoming harmful and invalidating to people who did still lose a significant amount of weight and met every other criterion for AN. Even the eating disorder center I worked at most adults were of normal weight and very very sick (no period, refeeding syndrome, heart issues, electrolyte imbalances, hair loss, decreased bone density, etc) \n\nI understand where you are coming from. After all, we (because I also struggle with anorexia nervosa since I was 12 years old and now as a 25 year old in recovery) are a disease of never being enough. And yes, there are serious physical manifestations to being underweight. The DSM now uses BMI to categorize severity, which isn\u2019t perfect either, but it\u2019s something. But there are also very serious physical and physiological effects to being normal weight/overweight and struggling with anorexia. \n\nI don\u2019t mean to be rude! Just an educating moment haha. I hope you are taking care of yourself\ud83d\udc95 it\u2019s rough out here",

I\u2019ve never been hospitalized or passed out. I eat everyday, especially a decent breakfast before work. Still disordered according to my primary, but the comparison makes me feel like eating anything at all invalidates the disorder. NOT true. \n\nAs for the tactless outlining of diagnoses in these comments, I will leave you with this insight: my disorder was the same with the thoughts but 10 times worse with actions when I was diagnosed with AAN than when I crossed the \u201cthreshold\u201d into AN. That weight distinction is crap.",

          "body": "I mentioned this above but the weight thing is for an official diagnosis of AN. The diagnosis of AN matters medically but for an individual who is struggling, the struggle is what matters a whole lot more. I would classify anyone other than AN as having eating disorder behaviour or BN. It doesn't lessen their need and eating disorder behaviours can end up leading to AN but a normal or above normal BMI is not AN. On a personal note, when I looked in the mirror I really did see fat on my abdomen and my mom told me later on that friends were asking if I had cancer. This is really hard to type but it's the truth. That's the AN. And it's not any better or more special than ED behaviours or BN or anything else. Everyone's struggle is their own struggle period. And deserves recognition and help. But AN is a particular beast in that you actually think and believe that you are fat looking while others think you are about to die from being underweight. While I've increased weight, I still struggle with this every day, every hour, and still haven't gotten back to \"normal\" weight. Cheers",

I was frustrated by feeling like a lot of people were claiming to be anorexic while normal/overweight and I felt like I was being crowded out by people who didn't understand how horrible it is to be very underweight and unable to stop losing weight and the terrible nightmare after you have a wakeup call and are fighting a horrible mental and physical battle trying to recover your weight, something I'm still trying to do. I didn't know how to respectfully share my feelings about that and I probably still don't but I think I'm improving, anyways, cheers :)",

That makes no sense. I knew I was sick, but that didn't mean I didn't feel good about it. I felt good and I felt better regardless of how I looked to others. That makes no sense to say you don't enjoy being sick but that you thought you were healthy??? What??? If you truly thought you were healthy, then you wouldn't have felt sick at all, let alone have anything to enjoy or not. Yeah, IDK, I'm confused. I definitely didn't think I was healthy though lol, I just didn't feel as sick as others were saying. It was mostly my neurological condition that made me feel really sick and not knowing how to implement basic self care methods, not the starving or throwing up part. But yeah starving and throwing up isn't *healthy.* But if you are a healthy weight, then you are *healthier* than if you're underweight, like that's just common sense.",

And still losing weight (for AN). It took me a year to admit it to my counselor and I haven't admitted to anyone else, even when I heard that people thought I had cancer... This is just my own experience of course. But the diagnoses are to help medically treat AN or BN. Other psych issues should be treated appropriately as well. Someone who doesn't technically have AN or BN but has eating disorder behaviours +/- other mental health issues isn't less valid or less worthy of help if they are struggling. I feel like there's this culture of \"a skinny person suffering is more worthy than an overweight person who is suffering\" and this is total BS. And I'm so sad that this is the culture we live in.

Not everyone *wants* to boast about how sick they are and act like they *want* feeding tubes or to be hospitalized. Most of us *enjoy* our disorder. That's part of the shock value, when someone is sick and underweight and their brains *like* it enough to continue to deny food. \n\nWhen I was underweight, I was suffering from undiagnosed and untreated epilepsy, which was honestly the main cause for wanting to recover and feeling like I even needed to be hospitalized at all.
