  "selftext": "hi... i don\u2019t know if anyone will actually read this, but i need to get this off my chest. i am absolutely devastated, and i know it may sound like i\u2019m exaggerating, but i genuinely feel like sadness is eating me up alive. i got into a hospital because of anorexia a few months ago, and before getting admitted in the hospital i wrote a few texts to the only people i talk to (which are all online friends bc i don\u2019t have any friends in real life) to let them know i would be gone for a bit. i got discharged recently and when i texted those people to let them know i was back from the hospital, one of them didn\u2019t even ask how i was doing. the other just said they were sorry because my recovery wasn\u2019t going well, then they changed the topic of the conversation. another person didn\u2019t care at all and now they reply to my texts once every 2 days if i\u2019m lucky.\nthis has me wondering... what if i just die? what\u2019s there to lose anyways? the only people i expected to care, or to at least write me a few words of encouragement, absolutely don\u2019t give a shit about me.  yes, they might be online friends, but i have known them for at least 1 year. after years spent talking, you\u2019d expect someone to be a little interested in your well-being. \nthat didn\u2019t happen.\nnot to mention the fact that my family doesn\u2019t understand me, so i have no one to fight for, not even myself.\ni lived for a long time in the illusion that people would be happy to hear from me again after months, i was looking forward talking to them, and i was hoping for a \u201cif you wanna talk about it, i\u2019m here\u201d text. but i got nothing instead. \nthis is the last straw for me. \nwhat\u2019s the point of all of this? what\u2019s the point of living, of trying to recover, if my existence gets ignored by everyone? i am glad that my weight is dropping more and more each day. when i weighed myself yesterday, i thought \u201ci can\u2019t let this continue any longer.\u201d for a split second. but the happiness that comes from the feeling of knowing that i am on the road to death is far better. even if that means i have to die, i just want someone to care.",

Recovery takes guts and grit and determination but if I can do it, so can you.  Just know that you will be uncomfortable at times, but that's completely normal.  The ED voice is hard to silence but it truly doesn't have your best interest at heart.  Go for it.",
