I read them, thought about them but didnt take any move forward and few days later i was hospitalized (against my will\ud83e\udd72) for months.\nSymptoms were: serious oedema in ankles; it took for an hour to get my clothes on; couldnt make ponytail cause i lost all my muscles; couldnt sit up in my bed without help (at my worst i couldnt get up my head so they held it while take medicines) and so on and its soooo embarasing but i couldnt sit on the toilet, had to stand/squat cause my muscle loss.\n I lived alone, lost all my relationships so no one knows about me and yes, i cant believe i was that sick that i didnt realized how miserable i am.\nAnd the most scary experience was when i felt im dying. Couldnt explain but i felt my last breathe and how my strenght go away.",

I had elevated troponin levels, heart attack level.  I also had terrible brain fog and inability to think critically about anything except workout plans. My heart rate was 20s/30s and I had low blood pressure. Extreme dizziness and blurred vision on standing. Cold always. Despite all this, I thought I was fine until I wasn\u2019t, and found myself in the ICU for a week. I was out of state and my mom had my dad fly out to say goodbye. Now I\u2019m 11 months out from that, and doing much better thanks to a 7 month treatment stay at a fantastic center that saved my life.",

And i really don't understand how others can walk with x bmi for example. (No shame or something of course!! I just cant accept that i wasnt able to do a lot of things and cant see where i screwed it)\nIn the meantime I did a lot of shit, I mean I drank a lot of alcohol and tried other things. (But in the meantime I did the same at school and had good results) Looking back, it was all very sad. \nThen it got to the point where I had to leave an hour early for the university 20 minutes away, and I was afraid of freezing to death on the street because I couldn't walk up the hill to the dormitory and as i write before i was so slow, faint in public places etc \nThen I had to go home to my parents for something and they decided to call an ambulance. And even though I was 21 years old, I got a court order like that saying that I had to have compulsory psychiatric treatment. And that lasted for 3 months.\nIn my country there is no proper care for people with eating disorders so those months were disastrous. Partly because the first half was spent trying to keep me alive and I had terrible pain and really just wanted it to be over. Shame or not, at 21 I was being changed by nurses barely older than me. The hospital stay was awful, no one came to see me. And because the care was so shit they gave me enough formula to get me to the required weight and discharged me. So mental recovery was 0.\nIt's actually been years since then anyway, I've tried to put it completely behind me but I just can't. \nNow writing this I have ambivalent feelings, because on the one hand I'm glad I survived all this shit, but on the other hand I miss the discipline and the way of thinking I had back then.\n\nEdit: and i had to add that i know proA forums can be harmful but when i did my post when started to realise that something is wrong i got incredible support, they were so worried and so nice to me. \nI was soo delusional and i swear im not that dumb but when it was me i didnt see the signs.

And i really don't understand how others can walk with x bmi for example. (No shame or something of course!! I just cant accept that i wasnt able to do a lot of things and cant see where i screwed it)\nIn the meantime I did a lot of shit, I mean I drank a lot of alcohol and tried other things. (But in the meantime I did the same at school and had good results) Looking back, it was all very sad. \nThen it got to the point where I had to leave an hour early for the university 20 minutes away, and I was afraid of freezing to death on the street because I couldn't walk up the hill to the dormitory and as i write before i was so slow, faint in public places etc \nThen I had to go home to my parents for something and they decided to call an ambulance. And even though I was 21 years old, I got a court order like that saying that I had to have compulsory psychiatric treatment. And that lasted for 3 months.\nIn my country there is no proper care for people with eating disorders so those months were disastrous. Partly because the first half was spent trying to keep me alive and I had terrible pain and really just wanted it to be over. Shame or not, at 21 I was being changed by nurses barely older than me. The hospital stay was awful, no one came to see me. And because the care was so shit they gave me enough formula to get me to the required weight and discharged me. So mental recovery was 0.\nIt's actually been years since then anyway, I've tried to put it completely behind me but I just can't. \nNow writing this I have ambivalent feelings, because on the one hand I'm glad I survived all this shit, but on the other hand I miss the discipline and the way of thinking I had back then.\n\nEdit: and i had to add that i know proA forums can be harmful but when i did my post when started to realise that something is wrong i got incredible support, they were so worried and so nice to me. \nI was soo delusional and i swear im not that dumb but when it was me i didnt see the signs. Its kinda akward and slightly funny after that i was that naive\ud83d\ude02",
