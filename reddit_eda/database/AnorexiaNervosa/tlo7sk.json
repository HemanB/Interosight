          "body": "That's what I'm doing right now actually and I haaaate it, I just hate eating at all tbh so any \"regular\" amount feels like so much. Tbf I'm maintaining well underweight (I'd have to put on so much weight to even be considered low-end healthy and that absolutely terrifies me), but ironically it means I'm having to deal with *both* the effects of being underweight and eating enough which is so overwhelming. Not quite as bad as being in hospital though which I was a couple months ago and it was torture so I'm sticking with this plan to avoid that again (hopefully) but just ugh I wish I could stop eating so much without worrying people who want me to recover.\n\nAnyway, thanks for the suggestion and sorry for the vent!!",

          "body": "That\u2019s totally okay! The stress of having to eat regularly is a lot! Especially because weight loss to an extent decreases hunger hormones (weirdly). Hence the lack of physical desire to eat. I had to gain nearly the same amount to hit my low end so i feel ya on the intimidation there. For the hating to eat part, drinking my calories really helped. And again, if it is just one tiny gain every week or so, that\u2019s okay. One thing i dislike is the emphasis on fast weight gain in the system. Fast weight gain doesn\u2019t support the psychological aspect, and it doesn\u2019t teach proper eating habits or regulation. One mistake I experienced was once i had hit the healthy weight i was comfortable with i realized my hunger satiation cues were all out of wack and I kept eating as if i was starving (in a gain-mindset not a maintain-mindset). I think my re-feeding journey could\u2019ve been better managed in that regard. So, slow and steady and re-learning body cues and *validating* how you feel about food but also asserting that food is not an enemy is very important. \n\nHugs I hope this is helpful!",

          "body": "Thankyou so much for this \ud83d\udda4 it's sparked a tiny bit of hope that maybe things can get better. Even the tiny gains terrify me, when I was in hospital they pushed fast weight gain to medically stabilise me but I've lost all that again which my team is... not happy about lol. I'm getting there on the physical comfort side re eating maintenance but still trying to be ok psychologically with having to increase that at some point and gain slowly. I'm also sensitive/allergic to so many foods after almost 20 years of doing this so everything that's not fruit and veges makes me feel icky :( it really does feel like food is the enemy and I'm not sure how to change that",
