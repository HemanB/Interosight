  "selftext": "It feels so discouraging when I'm trying to gauge more realistic portion sizes and they're serving themselves even less than what I would've done. It makes me feel like \"well fuck, am I even disordered if this is how much a normal person would take?\" \n\nOr when they don't eat all day (not even touching on the people who brag about it) and it confuses me because like, oh, so skipping meals is okay then? If normal people can do it, then why shouldn't I be allowed to? Because I \"took it too far\" but how can that be the case if it's a normal, everyday behavior? What makes it a disorder when I do it? Do I even have a problem? Because it's hard to see anything wrong with what I'm doing when it's everywhere all the time, it's downright inescapable. \n\nrecovery feels impossible in a world where it seems like not a single soul is actually healthy",

I was in hardcore-ish recovery treatment and were pretty strictly following their rules. I remember vividly when I was partially impatient and they served us pizza as a challenge food and my group was told not to pat it down. but then at this friend dinner thing, I see my friend pat her pizza down. red, flashing signals go off in my brain. should she be doing that? that's a disordered thing, right? should I tell her that? wait, can I do that? \n\nbut then she says \"I don't like the taste- it's so greasy I genuinely dislike it.\"\n\nthis girl is the most brutally honest Latina girl I've ever met. I would believe every single word that comes out of her mouth. if she told me my parents were government spies I'd believe her barely any questions asked. so I know she is being completely and utterly genuine about disliking the pizza grease. \n\nit kinda dawned on me that I can't pat down my pizza cause my brain does it for the disordered reasons and I can't tell if I ACTUALLY dislike grease or not. her though? she just genuinely dislikes it.\n\nI'm not sure how to explain this but I think skipping a few meals on accident or messing with portion sizes is normal if it doesn't overtake a person. y'know? I dunno, this story of mine just reminded me of how I felt then.",

      "body": "I feel the same!!!\n\nmy mom encourages me to skip meals sometime... she recently got into the idea that people should have one full meal where they are 7-8/10 full and the rest are small snack like meals. and everytime i get upset she goes on about how i need to lose weight and how i have no willpower.\n\n  \nthis morning, i ate half a sandwhich-didnt eat breakfast-(finished around 12). By around 3:30 i was pretty hungry so I told her i was 'pretty hungry' and she started mocking me and saying how i have a big appetite and stuff. And she sounded kinda mad about it and stuff. Its painful because I dont know how I can control my appetite because shes been trying to get me to do that for years and its so annoying. Because for the past few days, dinner has been a protein shake(only one scoop protein powder so like hald a serving) or a watery soup with mushrooms.\n\n  \nShe makes me feel like being hungry early or not being full after a small portion is a crime or something and it makes me feel ugly, fat, and hungry.\n\n  \nI dont want to develop a eating disorder but I feel myself stuffing myself at certain meals when I am alone so if, JUST IN CASE I dont get a proper dinner, I wont have to go hungry.\n\n\n\nbut tbh, everyone seems to eat less than me and idk why. Like im just actually hungry. everyone else seems to eat smaller portions and IDK why i just feel hungrier than them. its been like this since im little and my mom has always shamed me for it...\n\n  \nlet say i dont eat all day and only have dinner, instead of getting mad, my mom praises me.\n\n\n\nps. im 60 kg and 167cm tall so im not overweight but my mom keeps saying I am.",
