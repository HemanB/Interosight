  "selftext": "There are a lot of misconceptions about anorexia. Here are the ones that stand out to me the most\n\n1. That inpatient treatment will help everyone or cure the disorder. Inpatient helps some people, but ends up traumatizing others or simply doesn't help with the anorexia. I still have awful memories of my inpatient experiences.\n2. That all people have to do to get better is eat more. Anorexia is a serious disorder that a person doesn't choose. And they can't simply turn off the thoughts and behaviors. It requires treatment and support to improve\n3. That anorexic people only eat healthy foods. You can be anorexic and eat sweets and carbs. People don't just eat salad all the time\n4. There are a lot of medical complications that can occur. Most people hear about how the illness affects your heart and bones. But these aren't the only health issues that can happen. Anorexia can also cause nerve damage, bladder incontinence and urgency, and damage your digestive system, affecting the person's ability to absorb nutrients from the food you eat.\n5. Treatment resistance is really common. And most people who are sick often don't just get treatment because you ask them to. It's common to be unsure if you want help or anxious when the topic of treatment is discussed\n6. Recovery doesn't instantly occur because you reach a certain weight or because you become medically stable. Even after treatment, a person can still be struggling with anorexic thoughts and behaviors. And people can relapse. For some, recovery can take years\n7. When you have severe and enduring anorexia, the behaviors are more entrenched and the person didn't choose to be sick for a long time. At this point, the person needs specialized treatment. But not all anorexia treatments are set up to handle complex and long lasting anorexia. Treatment needs to be tailored to fit the person's needs. While not every person will be able to let go of the illness completely, you still deserve support and understanding\n8. That anorexia only happens to younger people. Anorexia affects older people too\n9. Anorexia is not about just weight loss. It's about feeling bad about yourself and not knowing how to cope those feelings. There is no weight loss or number that will bring happiness. A person with anorexia often has depression or anxiety, and these feelings won't just disappear because you lose more weight\n10. There is no sick enough. If you are obsessing over your weight and food intake, you are sick. Everyone experiences the disorder differently. Everyone has different health complications and different reactions to treatment. Just because another person has different symptoms or health issues from you doesn't mean they are suffering more. Every person with anorexia is suffering in their own way.",
