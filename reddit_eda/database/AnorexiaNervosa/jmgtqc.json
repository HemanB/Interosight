  "selftext": "I feel like I have to hit rock bottom to recover and I\u2019m not at my lowest weight anymore but I\u2019m starting to lose again and it\u2019s causing issues at work because I can\u2019t lift heavy stuff without being in pain after the shift. Recently my left arm/hand tenses up and shakes and it\u2019s uncomfortable and I can\u2019t stop it. I\u2019m not that underweight so I feel like I don\u2019t need to recover or that I\u2019m not even sick but it\u2019s still getting in the way of life. All I think about is my weight and how I\u2019m going to manage it",
