I\u2019m trying to find that balance between not eating enough and eating too much to be healthy, but it\u2019s hard. I started counting calories in an app that has me at 1600 a day and I just tell myself to stay with that. My issue is that I tend to get extreme with counting and start starving myself again, but I have to keep reminding myself to reach that daily goal. So far it hasn\u2019t been too bad, but it\u2019s only been a week",

History does tend repeat itself.. when we starve our body so much of course as soon as we start eating again we don\u2019t stop, because our body is kinda scared what if we stop eating again? So its like trying to get in all the food it can.. and we tell ourselves last binging day everyday and it never is last...I know being anorexic makes us feel like we are in control, but how about you recover slowly, I\u2019m not saying just eat, start your own diet plan that contains sufficient calories that your body requires be it 1000 calories, so that history doesn\u2019t repeat.. I hope the best for you.",

I'm too \"small\" for people to take my binging seriously and way too big for anyone to take the fasting seriously.  I wish my aunt never force fed me.  If I was still at a low weight I could get into an eating clinic.  But I'm at this disgusting (to me) weight and no doctors take me serious, my case isn't bad enough for inpatient but I can't do transportation for the only outpatient services in my area because it's too far.  I just got out of the hospital for suicidal ideation and they couldn't even really help me there.  This is unrelated to eating, but I just feel like I keep reaching out to try to get help and get nothing from it at all.  I put in all this effort and shit is still exactly the same as it's always been.  I hope you can find peace of mind in it all and I wish you a recovery, hopefully soon.",
