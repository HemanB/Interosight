  "title": "Is anyone else bothered by the fact that they are women, thus curvier than men?",
  "selftext": "By this, I mean that our thighs are wider and \"juicier\"... I don't even know how to describe how I feel.\n\nI have always been naturally skinny and underweight but in the last few years, as I've gotten older, I started to look more like a woman. And I just hate it. Every time I'm watching a movie I compare myself to the women in the movie and I realize that they have the same body type. We are women after all and having a higher percentage of fat should be normal. But not in my mind. I just wonder, how the women in the movies are not self-conscious of their curviness? How do they accept themselves and even feel confident in their body? I envy them:(\n\nAnd I also envy men... usually their thighs are not the first place to gain weight around. And during biology class, we talked about the difference between men and women: how men are the apple type and women are the pear type and I realize that, yet cannot accept and not feel anxious about it.\n\nIt's just so hard to accept these changes in my body. And I feel so alone with this feeling, none of my friends thinks like this. \n\nSo if anyone here relates to this, could you give me advice on how to accept myself as a woman and not a skinny teenager anymore? For me, this proves to be one of the hardest parts of recovery and if I overthink it, I usually end up relapsing getting more and more hopeless every time.",
