  "selftext": "I feel like there's such a big part of me that wants to hear about other people's experiences (their weight, what they eat -- especially if they're thinner than me, eat less than me, and dislike their body more than I dislike mine) because deep inside I'm scared to get better because this could lead to weight gain, so I'd rather get worse. I know this probably sounds fucked up, but is this a common thing?",
