  "title": "Life is too fucking short. ",
  "selftext": "Eat the food. Have the experiences. Spend good time with good people. Life is too short to care about being skinny. No one cares. Well, you care. But you are the only person who cares. Your feelings are real and they matter, but two things can be true at the same time. You are wasting time. Life is too short to miss out because of food. \n\nToday I met up with a friend and we ate cake and had coffee and had a wonderful time. Food is not just fuel; it is culture, it is experiences, it is people. How many things do we miss out on because we are scared of the food that will be there? And how many people do we know that only like us because we are skinny? None. No one. People want you there. They want you around. They wish you'd see food for what it is; fuel, but something with the propensity for so much more. It is what you make of it.\n\nPlease, please, please, please. Don't give yourself things to regret. Life is too short. Like, for example - everyone only gets to be a teenager once, right? How did I spend my one chance? Depressed, lonely, hungry, thinking about food. And you know what? D'you know how much better my life was because I was skinny, how much nicer everyone was because I was skinny, how everyone complimented me on how I was skinny? IT FUCKING WASN'T. NO ONE GAVE A SHIT. NO. ONE. GAVE. A. SHIT. I KILLED MYSELF OVER SOMETHING ONLY I GAVE A SHIT ABOUT, AND IN THE END? IN THE END I GOT NOTHING OUT OF IT EXCEPT TRAUMA AND SCARS AND MISSED OPPORTUNITIES. \n\nPlease. Eat the fucking food. Be fucking happy. YOU DESERVE TO BE HAPPY. I AM SCREAMING THROUGH MY SCREEN RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I CANNOT SAY IT CLEARLY ENOUGH. YOU DESERVE HAPPINESS. \n\nIt is not easy. But literally what is? Nothing that is good is easy. Please. Think about life. YOU DESERVE A FULL AND JOYOUS LIFE.\n\n- from someone who is happy and content with a life that does not care about anything except feeling happy and healthy. And who regrets all the time they lost not feeling that way. And who knows that it feels fucking impossible (it still feels impossible!!!! I will forever be marred by this disorder!!!!!!) but has discovered that maybe it is possible. ",

      "body": "Well I believe people care. So many people noticed my weight loss and complimented me. I also want to be on stage and sing but I feel like I need to be skinny to do it. It's been so recent that I realized I was shy because of my body, because I felt that I'd never be skinny, bc it was an issue everytime I tried to lose weight. But yeah I only live once and I want to be skinny in this short life. I never believed in myself that I could lose weight, I would never succeed, but I finally do believe in myself.\n\nBut it's important to be social as well, maybe I can eat most of my meals with people, I think that's what I'm gonna do, at least for a while. It's challenging but I don't want to lose my friendships over some goal. That goal could also be studying. I could study for so hard bc I'm afraid of failing and never make time for my friends. Then I miss out on them and many great memories. Remembering that life is too short helps me take my obsessions to side. Thank you \u2764.",
