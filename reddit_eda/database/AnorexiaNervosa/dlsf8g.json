  "selftext": "I was just relaxing in the bath, flipping through Reddit and listening to music, when my body decided to fall apart. I lost all feeling in my arms, hands and face. My heart started pounding so hard and fast in my chest I could actually see it. I started to lose consciousness. \n\nI had enough energy to throw myself out of the bath, wrap a towel around myself, and threw myself on the floor of my dad's office because I was scared shitless. I'm a 23 year old woman, lying on my 58 year old father's floor in just a towel, wondering if I'm about to die right in front of him. \n\nI didn't let him call the ambulance, things settled down after about 20 minutes, but fucking hell I'm done with this bullshit. I'm getting engaged soon. I'm about to be a high school English teacher. I can't keep doing this shit. I'm going to die if I don't stop.",

I went to an ED treatment center in NC for about 4.5 months when I was 16/17 and just fell back into drugs and alcohol when I got out and when I got clean/sober in 2018, I relapsed with anorexia worse than ever and it's just been going downhill since. It's been tough on everyone in my life because while I'm doing extremely well in every other aspect of my life, I'm dying right before their eyes and I don't want to keep doing this to them or myself. \n\nMy mother is pretty much done with me and my bs but my bf (soon to be fiance) and my dad have my back 100% and while they have severe man brain, they're a really great support system :)",

I spent so long doing things for other people, I even quit smoking to make my boyfriend happy, but they only stuck when I started doing it for *myself* and not them. Well... I never quit smoking for myself but I did stick with it because I love my boyfriend and I hate smelling bad lol.\n\nGahhh I swear you're putting a huge smile on my face, you're so kind! I'll tell you what, getting clean and sober was hell but I'm *so* much better off than I was a couple of years ago. It's amazing to look back on my old Instagram pics, I looked so...
