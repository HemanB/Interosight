  "selftext": "After weeks of not weighing myself bc I\u2019ve been fucking terrified, I did it today. Last week, I told my therapist \u201cI gained weight, I just know it\u201d and I\u2019ve been saying it for weeks before this. She encouraged me to recognize that it\u2019s probably just my ED talking.  But it wasn\u2019t. I knew it. I fucking knew it. I DID gain. And not a lil bit either. Fuck this shit man.\n\nI tried y\u2019all. I really tried this recovery thing. I\u2019m so over it. So done.",

Your body probably needs it badly. \n\nI am so jealous you were able to not look at your scale for so long, what an accomplishment by itself already! You are doing great, keep it up. How about you try to maintain this new weight for a time and see how it feels? Please don't try to lose it again.",

I have the same friends, same likes/ dislikes, same hobbies. Yes I\u2019ve put em off for ages, but they\u2019re still the same, I am running on reserved energy and different priorities going on in my head. \n\n\nOn that note: well done, I\u2019m soo fucking proud. I bet you never knew how much a piece of glass and plastic would control you. I\u2019m proud that you are seeing your positively. I\u2019m proud that you see that to be a smaller size isn\u2019t your sole purpose. I\u2019m glad that you have found your souls purpose. Idk you but I love and admire you. Shows real strength not many people have. Well done for not falling into the jaws of death and escaped anas luring trap before it\u2019s too late. Love you, peace out. Xx",
