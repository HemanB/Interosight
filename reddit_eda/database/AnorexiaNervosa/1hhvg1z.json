I asked her many times to stop staring, but she wouldn\u2019t stop and got upset every time I told her to stop, or asked her why she kept staring. Fuck her.",

I don\u2019t know why it makes me so uncomfortable. He also doesn\u2019t really know i have an ED i think he just assumes i naturally don\u2019t eat much, like he thinks it\u2019s not intentional.",
