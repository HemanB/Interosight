  "selftext": "I don\u2019t know if anyone else experiences this - but I feel like my anorexia hits me in waves. It\u2019s like always there - but sometimes I just feel it\u2019s more controlling than others. Like right now I feel I am recovering and making a genuine effort to do so- but I am nervous for when the \u201cwave\u201d comes back and hits me in the face again. Can anyone relate?",
