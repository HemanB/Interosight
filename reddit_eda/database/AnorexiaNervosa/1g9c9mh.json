  "selftext": "I know that being anorexic is not about being super skinny. It's about the mindset it's a MENTAL illness. But even though I know all that I still feel the need to \"look\" Anorexic. I'm still at an early stage, It's been at its worse for a few months and I used to be overweight (not talking about how I see myself I literally was more than the average weight that I needed to be) so now with this whole thing getting worse and loosing weight I've been at normal for my age and height weight but I still don't look \"skinny\". And it's really hard having to say \" And yes I know I don't look like it \" Whenever I'm talking to someone about my disorder. Also a lot of people are not very educated on the subject and they think anorexia is only being very very thin so they think I'm faking it. I'm just tired of all these, I want to be able to talk freely about my problem without feeling judged. And I always have this mindset, that of course it's very usual for the disorder , that I need to get worse and then maybe they will care. And now it's my chance to choose because my therapist said that considering it's at an early stage I can get better soon if I try. But do I want to get better? Of course I'll have to say yes because if I say no I feel like there is not going to be a way back then. ",
