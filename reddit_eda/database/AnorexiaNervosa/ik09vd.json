  "selftext": "I came to a revelation yesterday that has helped me wrap my head around how to recover.\n\nPart of the reason I struggle with an ED is because of past abuse by someone I used to trust. This person as in a position of power and decided to take advantage of my vulnerability in the worst way possible. To this day my abuser is trying to ruin my life. I starve myself to gain a sense of control.\n\nStarving myself IS ruining my life. If I give into my ED, I'm giving my abuser another way to make me miserable.   \n\n\nIn retaliation, I ate two hashbrowns this morning. Maybe I'll even make something for lunch.  \n\n\nViva la revolution.",
