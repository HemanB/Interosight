  "selftext": "So basically that, I have other disorders and mental illnesses so I how how they feel, and I've dealt with substance abuse so I know both feelings and my eating disorder Is more an addiction than an illness.\n\nI'm constantly thinking about it, it's the only thing in my head, I'm completely obsessed, my life and everything I do revolves around food and my ED, feeling the hunger pain in my stomach gives me a high and so much serotonin that I crave when I eat and I stop that hunger,, every time I eat I just get anxious and want that pain like it's a fix.\n\nSo with all that, the anorexia doesn't feel like other mental illnesses I have (BPD, CPTSD, bipolar etc) I live it like it's a straight up addiction, I crave, I have what I feel when I had withdrawals, I constantly lie and cheat and manipulate, it sounds so stupid but I'm an addict when it comes to anorexia.",

Though it\u2019s not a complete overlap in my case, we treat the anorexia behaviours like addiction. It gives me actionable steps to do harm reduction and give me some control back and steer me over to less harmful coping skills.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having a rough time.
