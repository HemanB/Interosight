  "selftext": "I honestly don\u2019t know where I stand in the weight standards, because when I don\u2019t suck in my stomach it\u2019s obviously not the thinnest and my legs are decently chubby, but my ribs are incredibly visible for some reason. I made a post while sucking in my stomach asking if I looked overweight, underweight or normal weight and basically everyone said I looked severely underweight and needed help, and some people even skinnyshamed me. Is it weird that this makes me feel good about myself? Am I a bad person?",

      "body": "That's a hallmark of the disorder. I love it when people tell me I'm too skinny and need to put on weight. I was excited one time when a coworker said I was looking like a \"walking corpse.\" The opposite is also true. When I tell someone I struggle with anorexia and they respond by telling me I don't look anorexic. That's extremely triggering and makes me feel like a fake. \n\nI feel like a yo-yo that's very influenced by people's perceptions of how thin I look. It's pretty fucked up. Because there is no such thing as \"thin enough\" or \"sick enough\" for many of us, our perceptions are very warped. Most people don't want to look emaciated or sick. To them, that's not a good thing. To an anorexic, this is a compliment that could put us on cloud 9 for the rest of the day.\n\nOur brains are rewired and don't operate like most people... Remember, our brains are impacted by this. It's a mental illness after all. Also, the majority of the population is grossly uneducated about the serious condition of AN. It's a topic that doesn't receive the exposure and attention it deserves. Wishing you the best OP \\*hugs\\*",
