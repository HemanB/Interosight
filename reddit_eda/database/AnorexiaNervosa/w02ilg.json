  "selftext": "In fact, food service is the only industry I\u2019ve ever worked since I got my first job hostessing at a local restaurant.\nYet, I have never eaten any of the food from any of the restaurants I have worked at, despite having a free meal per shift. I am just too scared of restraunt food and eating in public.\n\nBut I enjoy preparing food for others and serving them so I choose to work food service. It\u2019s good, honest work but I know my coworkers have picked up on the fact that I never eat the food that is offered to me.\n\nI hope this post doesn\u2019t trigger anyone. I still eat, but only food I make at home. This disease is not fun and makes no sense at all. It is a sick obsession with control.",

After my first serving job I fell in love with the positivity and love I could share with strangers. I go into work with the mindset that I could be the thing that helps make a horrible day a bit better. It may \u201cjust be\u201d a serving job but it fills me with satisfaction that I can\u2019t give myself. I can\u2019t accept the love given to me but giving it makes me feel like a person instead of the empty shell I feel I walk around as. There are a million things keeping me in the restaurant industry and anorexia is one of them.",
