  "title": "It\u2019s been a year since I got over the worst of my eating disorder. Recently it hit me that I still bear resentment towards my friends/ family for never noticing (+ my life story I guess)",
  "selftext": "Or perhaps even against humanity in general. Or maybe, I\u2019m just frustrated that emotional pain is reserved to the individual. No one ever knows how you truly feel or how deeply you are hurt. \n\nI\u2019ve been depressed for the majority of my life. Once I got out of it I went straight back in with an eating disorder on top of it, no one ever reached out to me, or comforted me when I needed it the most. I was below essential fat%, looking back on pictures I was visibly very sick.\nAfter I recovered a friend told me they and everyone else noticed but just didn\u2019t say anything. It lasted over a year, and no one ever reached out. \n\nIt felt like it was all in my head, the part of me that still wanted to live thought that surely someone would say something or stop me before I would drop dead. I got worse, and worse. My heartbeat started hitting the lower 30\u2019s, I\u2019d go to sleep every night terrified I wouldn\u2019t wake up. Just laying down on my side would bruise my knees, I had red marks on my inner thighs from repeatedly burning them with a rubber flask filled with hot water to keep myself warm. (Went to the doctor with it, he said I might need laser treatment but luckily it faded) To this day, after making a near full recovery I still throw up randomly sometimes and have chronic hiccups that can get very painful. The worst part of it being the near constant reminder  that I did something my body can\u2019t forgive\n\nI have a history of mental illness, my parents both knew that. My friends all knew that. I simply can\u2019t comprehend why no one reached out, no one attempted to talk some sense into me or show compassion. It was just me. Even looking back now with my life together, it is absurd that there never once was anyone despite me occasionally reaching out myself. \n\nOn a winter day during the bike home from school I simply broke down. Somewhere something in me realized I wasn\u2019t going to be saved by anyone, it was like a survival instinct almost. The next month felt like one big reflex, I started exercising like crazy and eating much more. If only I could tell you I magically regained my senses and got better but sadly not. I went from anorexia to bulimia, both through excessive exercise and puking and lost even more weight. \n\nMy stepdad would mock me for eating so much, \nI would make half a salad bowl full of oatmeal after school and hide in the bathroom to eat it, that went on for weeks. Honestly it felt like the world just wanted me dead. It felt like apart of me wanted me dead. Writing about this feels absurd, I haven\u2019t thought about this for so long. I\u2019m quite disassociated from this entire chapter of my life, it almost doesn\u2019t even feel like my story anymore \n\nAfter half a year of bulimia I became ecstatic about slowly regaining my strength. I did a lot of weight training and track sports, I slowly eased into allowing myself to eat more but would still throw up if I ate anything unhealthy. Over the course of a few months I slowly got better, and eventually got where I am today. \n\nI\u2019ve been running from acknowledging this part of me for awhile now. To this day I haven\u2019t spoken about it with my parents, despite my bond with them having improved significantly. Only 2 of my friends know the gist of it, and I don\u2019t see them often. \n\nIt feels scary now that i could be so horrible to myself, and even endanger my own wellbeing to that extent. I wish someone would have cared, I wish I would\u2019ve had a shoulder to cry on, or someone to slap some sense into me. \nThis could have meant the end for me, it feels horrible that in the end I could only rely on myself, even when I felt I had lost myself, and for that I honestly still hold a grudge. \n\nNot much that can be done there I suppose. I do know that I want to remember this pain in order to be compassionate towards others where others have failed me. No one should have to face a darkness like that by themselves. One act of kindness would have changed my world, I can\u2019t conceal that this experience turnt me bitter, however hopefully it will also lead me to an act of kindness that might change someone else\u2019s world for the better",

That thing you describe in a comment about how the world just kept going so casually is something I've experienced many times, after someone I love has died too. It seems to strange how my world can be in such crushing agony or has been turned upside down but everything and everyone else just goes on. But now it comforts me, that it's consistent like that lol. Life doesn't continue despite us, life continues with us, it's us who feel disconnected from it. \n\nTruly though, all it would've taken when i was younger was one person to take an interest in me and care. It's an awful feeling thinking you're supposed to have people who will help you and realizing you have to be the one to save your own life when you're the one who's sick in the first place. Even in me the survival instincts kept kicking in lol but i definitely pushed it very close to that line of death. I'm still disordered and still no one ever says a word except my therapist. I was never expecting to be saved but neglect is something else entirely. \n\nI became very bitter. Now, my main goal is to dissolve this anger and bitterness. Being as bitter as I am, it feels like holding my breath and I've been holding it so long and now I'm just ready to breathe. Forgiveness really is for us, not anyone else, though i know if i forgive my parents we'll have a better relationship, and i love them so i think it's about time. Its a process anyway.\n\nIt just really shows how much impact even the smallest kindnesses can do for each other. Even you writing this helped me. Thank you. I would like to get to the point where i can spend my life finding ways to help other people or nature in small ways. \n\nI always dissociated from the tough times of my life and now trying to integrate them is strange. Like how do i go on normally knowing these things happened? I think the answer for me is to not try to go on \"normally.\" To acknowledge what they've changed in me good or bad and take the parts i need with me and let the rest go. I have tattoos and they help me, because they're the only thing physically in the world that say, \"yea this happened, u survived, you're still here bro\" lol\n\nSorry i ramble a lot, I'm not even fully sure what i was trying to say. You're really good at writing by the way",

      "body": "Sorry it took me awhile to reply \n\nIt is the absolute neutrality of the world. Even we ourselves normalize over time and begin to look at the most twisted things as mundane. It made me understand how easy it is to lose yourself, and perhaps the only way to stay yourself is to change constantly. \n\nIt\u2019s the same for me. I\u2019ve never had the feeling that anyone felt genuinely and intimately concerned with what I was going through.\nI can\u2019t help but envy relationships between people that get emotional when the other is hurting. I\u2019ve done that for others countless times and yet it is never reciprocated, almost like it\u2019s a curse. \n\n\u2018I was never expecting to be saved but neglected is something else entirely\u2019\n\nI feel exactly the same way. I even went to our school nurse once during the time I was scared I would die in my sleep, I think I even told her about my very low heart rate. She acted dismissive, like she didn\u2019t get what my problem was. She suggested to weigh me and I declined and quickly left. \nI also visited my own doctor when I had my thighs badly burnt, now it seems so strange to me that no one goes like \u2018huh, why would you purposely burn your thighs every day\u2019 \nIt is especially that indifference that made me feel like it was all in my head. \n\n\u2018It feels like I\u2019m holding my breath\u2019 is another brilliant one, that made me pause for a second. It is a very good analogy. I think I consciously forgave my parents, mostly because I didn\u2019t want to rob myself of the good memories I could still make together with them. Though subconsciously I think has changed me in a way I can\u2019t reverse, I can\u2019t go back to the way I used to be. The best I can do is become someone I can respect regardless of the past\nI hope you can patch things up with your parents as well, it is a very difficult thing.\n\nIntegrating them is definitely strange. I\u2019ve been confronting myself quite a lot, I can feel myself resisting. Its overwhelming and exhausting, It makes me feel a stranger to my own body, almost as if I\u2019m a random soul that just stumbled into here like \u2018what the f is going on in here\u2019. Like I\u2019m trying to pick up the pieces of something whilst I don\u2019t even know where it shattered.\n\nDon\u2019t apologize for rambling, you\u2019re venting, I\u2019m venting too. I think it\u2019s good for us, It\u2019s a rare occasion for me to feel so many emotions during an interaction. It\u2019s strange how it\u2019s our pain that binds people to each other.  It reminds me of the Hedgehog dilemma if you\u2019ve heard of that.\n\n Thank you for complimenting my writing. I like to write in my free time, I wasn\u2019t expecting to get a comment like that, it means a lot",

Sadly it's not as uncommon (dissociative issues, trauma and EDs) as people like to pretend or believe.\n\nI guess in some ways life has gotten better for me.\nI almost ended my life at the start of this year, and the sheer degree of hopelessness I felt gave me the courage to finally admit I was trans and do something about it (Started therapy with a trauma specialist and was approved to start hormones 2 weeks ago \ud83d\ude01 and the waitlist processes for surgery has been started.) I've held myself back from admitting I'm a boy hiding in a girl's body for my entire life. It's like my fear and \"what If I'm just confused / I share my body with women! I can't change it or they'll take on my dysphoria\" excuses and fears lost some of their power and I was able to admit my truth to both myself and people who can help. My system was surprisingly supportive, it's like they were waiting until I could admit this to myself. My worst case scenarios haven't come to pass, it has been strangely better than I could have hoped. I feel love and support from both Inside and Out. I guess I had to finally hit a place where I had nothing left to lose so I could take the risk and made those first appointment(s). \n\nWhile my ED is still there and pretty actively trying to end me, I now have a drive to fight back against it, and stay alive. I get a chance of occupying the right gendered body I should have been born into, now. It's a big help in fighting against the destructive urges when they come up. \ud83d\ude04 I never thought I'd see the day I was approved to start testosterone, and I'm so so greatful I managed to live long enough to have that moment. My road isn't going to be easy, but I've seen more beauty in this world and felt more hope for myself than I think I have in my past 20 years here.",

Sadly it's not as uncommon (dissociative issues, trauma and EDs) as people like to pretend or believe.\n\nI guess in some ways life has gotten better for me.\nI almost ended my life at the start of this year, and the sheer degree of hopelessness I felt gave me the courage to finally admit I was trans and do something about it (Started therapy with a trauma specialist and was approved to start hormones 2 weeks ago \ud83d\ude01 and the waitlist processes for surgery has been started.) I've held myself back from admitting I'm a boy hiding in a girl's body for my entire life. It's like my fear and \"what If I'm just confused / I share my body with women! I can't change it or they'll take on my dysphoria\" excuses and fears lost some of their power and I was able to admit my truth to both myself and people who can help. My system was surprisingly supportive, it's like they were waiting until I could admit this to myself. My worst case scenarios haven't come to pass, it has been strangely better than I could have hoped. I feel love and support from both Inside and Out. I guess I had to finally hit a place where I had nothing left to lose so I could take the risk and made those first appointment(s). \n\nWhile my ED is still there and pretty actively trying to end me, I now have a drive to fight back against it, and stay alive. I get a chance of occupying the right gendered body I should have been born into, now. It's a big help in fighting against the destructive urges when they come up. \ud83d\ude04 I never thought I'd see the day I was approved to start testosterone, and I'm so so greatful I managed to live long enough to have that moment. My road isn't going to be easy, but I've seen more beauty in this world and felt more hope for myself than I think I have in my past 20 years here.",
