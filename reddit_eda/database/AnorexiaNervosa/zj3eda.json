Has she explored any of that with a psychologist/psychotherapist?\n\nKeep in mind that public hospital wards may only treat the symptoms (in this case malnourishment) and not the cause(s).

The peice of advice might sound  really strange, but normal things are not getting to her so time to jolt her awake. When it is your Donner time lay out plates, bowls, glasses cutlery and sit at the table for the appropriate time you have Dinner do not serve anything. When she is home offer her a snack and just hang her an empty plate. Do not eat in front of her, I fucking hate this trick, but tell her you will not eat until she eats. (Obviously eat when she's not around) this one is fucking morbid and emotionally painful but drive her to cemeteries and funeral homes ask her to choose her casket so you won't get the wrong one. Get her to volunteer for cancer patients and see how they long to eat but can't. Take her to therapy lunches with her friends. Get ahold of her friends set up a picnic, no one eats until she does and when she does everyone eats the way she does. Always have fruit and veggies kept in odd places like in her bedroom on her bed or whatever, or on the bathroom sink (covered) on the coffee table, by the computer, you get the idea. But it's time to lay it on her. Anorexia is fucking evil and growing up feeling like a corpse is no way to spend days or years. Also, get rid of all your scales and if you must only have mirrors that can see your face. Anorexics love \"progress\" so remove all the ways she gets to see her \"progress\". Start putting parental controls on your wifi and her phone. Ban all social media, tik toc, Tumblr,  Reddit plus many others. Do not allow her to go out for exercise without supervision there are 2 good reasons for this one she won't be able to over-exercise and you know she is safe and hasn't passed out anywhere. Take her to her therapy Apts. DRs. Apts etc etc. \n\nIf she's mad good showing emotions or feelings, in general, it can break down that wall and you're getting somewhere. Or she could just retreat more into herself. But at this point I think she needs a reality check and sometimes that reality check is harsh. But whatever keeps her alive.",

This could stem from being suicidal, OCD, trauma, self hatred, or people that are keeping her sick. I would explore other additional diagnoses to maybe find the root of the problem.

Im not saying to break her privacy but you might find out more about what\u2019s really going on in her head. Just remember it\u2019s not her fault and it\u2019s not yours. She is Ill.

My parents would do the same as you in response.\nHere's what was going through my head at that stage:\nI was depressed about school. And in early teens, you feel like parents and adults just cant understand that. It wasnt so much a losing weight thing but a depression thing, I felt like I'd given up because I was in a place that I hated every single day and nothing seemed to make it better, I couldnt see a way out and it getting better. Hell I'm in college now and I'm still counting down the days until the end, I still feel that way sometimes. I wouldn't tell people how I was feeling because to adults it looked like such a petty problem, but to a 13 year old, it's a lot to contend with.\nThat giving up thing I relate to. For me it's because I was in a situatiom that I felt I couldn't explain to people, they couldn't understand. I was embarassed, I didnt want to discuss it with adults. I felt like I was trying so hard and it wasnt enough so I gave up. Have you tried to talk to someone her age, her friends? See if she's spoken to them about anything. Teen girls talk to eachother about problems, and they're at school with her so it makrs sense that they'd be able to tell her things she wouldnt tell you and you might get more of an insight into the underlying problem",

Could there be some trauma that she isn't telling you, or anyone else, about (for whatever reason that may be \u2013 and there could be many, including guilt, shame and fear)? Has she explored any of that with a psychologist/psychotherapist?\n\nKeep in mind that public hospital wards may only treat the symptoms (in this case malnourishment) and not the cause(s). To treat the causes she probably needs one-on-one psychological intervention and/or an inpatient stay at a *good* ED clinic (there are too many below average of those, my girlfriend tells me)",

My parents would do the same as you in response.\nHere's what was going through my head at that stage:\nI was depressed about school. And in early teens, you feel like parents and adults just cant understand that. It wasnt so much a losing weight thing but a depression thing, I felt like I'd given up because I was in a place that I hated every single day and nothing seemed to make it better, I couldnt see a way out and it getting better. Hell I'm in college now and I'm still counting down the days until the end, I still feel that way sometimes. I wouldn't tell people how I was feeling because to adults it looked like such a petty problem, but to a 13 year old, it's a lot to contend with.\nThat giving up thing I relate to. For me it's because I was in a situatiom that I felt I couldn't explain to people, they couldn't understand. I was embarassed, I didnt want to discuss it with adults. I felt like I was trying so hard and it wasnt enough so I gave up. Have you tried to talk to someone her age, her friends? See if she's spoken to them about anything. Teen girls talk to eachother about problems, and they're at school with her so it makrs sense that they'd be able to tell her things she wouldnt tell you and you might get more of an insight into the underlying problem",
