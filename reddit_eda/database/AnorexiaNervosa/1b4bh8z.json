      "body": "That logically makes no sense. Are you suggesting that we're unable to derive meaning or happiness from other sources of fulfillment, like graduating, getting a job, falling in love? Eating disorders make life tolerable as one goes through the motions. They don't stop life from happening and they don't rob you of your prior happiness nor do they steal your future happiness. They numb you out just enough to keep going. This couldn't be more false. Unfortunately some lose their lives and that's the only time that they're robbed of future happiness. You can't be happy if you're dead. You can absolutely be happy now or 5 seconds from now as you were yesterday for a few moments. An eating disorder doesn't take that away from anyone. The idea of pure bliss all the time is false and sets people up to fail.\n\nEdit: People have every right to use crutches as they see fit. We all do it. Every single person in this world has one. Anger is useless when you have nothing to pour it into. The best revenge is success. Subtle anger can help you achieve long term success, only when subtle. An eating disorder is like self protection by hibernating. We come out when we're ready, when we're more confident, when we're recharged, when we love being thin etc. The depletion is the hibernation and the emotional rest we require. Numbness is a prolonged state of rest and healing. I'm already in my revenge era after suffering from bulimia, epilepsy...after gaining all that weight back and craving thinness everyday of my life. I'm getting my life back and I'm getting the body that I love back. That's where I'm channeling a piece of my anger and to me, to us, this is worthwhile. Especially when you know it will work...This is how we choose to live and it works.",

Life only \u201cworks\u201d with AN or bulimia until it doesn\u2019t anymore. Some people may never recover, but those people ALSO face long term consequences and miss out on major life experiences precisely because of their disorder.\n\nI never said you couldn\u2019t experience happiness or brief moments of fulfillment while living with an ED, but the ED is there as a coping mechanism for a reason.

So the more energy I have to focus on body strength, the more I\u2019ll reshape my body. I can still run but no long distance yet. Plus I walk a lot anyway. So my goal is yoga and strength training until I learn enough sustainability to get back into endurance training.\n\nI\u2019ve got a whole plan lol. It\u2019ll take years and it can potentially look like near death at one point, but that's part of the plan. It'll end with me running a marathon in the body I\u2019ve always wanted. The long distance training won\u2019t be in effect until I\u2019ve maintained a low body weight for at least 3 years because then that weight maintenance is basically muscle memory at that point. That\u2019s the goal.

I predict there will be a lot more balance or stability with my energy levels and that\u2019s just because I don\u2019t use any substances. \n\nI definitely think about food more but it feels productive and it\u2019s a type of planning that I genuinely enjoy. It doesn\u2019t feel like a deprivation or a longing type of thing. I don\u2019t have much else going for me at the time to judge where my brain capacity lies the most. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be able to answer that question when I start school and work.",

Death by AN is rare and takes a ridiculous amount of suffering over the span of decades to achieve. This can be anything but careless if you allow that.",

But because I don\u2019t have boyfriend/girlfriends/, a job, a full time course (practical) or friends at the moment I haven\u2019t got to worry about or give a shit if the exercise takes up my entire day and excessive/extreme. I don\u2019t have friends to worry about that care about, my mate died of cancer a few years ago and my other mate lives too far away from home that I can\u2019t be bothered to go and see anymore. I am depressed, so how on earth realistically am I gonna move my ass 30 miles on 2 trains 3 buses to go and see him for 12 hours I don\u2019t think so. He\u2019s not worth my time and energy when I have FaceTime. I don\u2019t have lift finger lol.\u00a0 I could justify the exercising and lots of walking of travelling but it would be along day.\u00a0 I don\u2019t like humans for that much effort. Depression has gotta be effortless. Plus I would spend the day at the gym!",
