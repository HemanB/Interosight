I wish I was smart enough to see it earlier.\n\nIn my mind I wish I never left, in my mind I wish I never left you. I wish I stayed in that apartment with the cats.

      "body": "Thank you so much for not blocking me. I did fail you in every way. I was such a bad boyfriend. With the cheating with how I spoke to you, how I neglected your needs. How I minimised how I was treating you. I don't know why I thought you'd never leave I don't know why I was so delusional I don't know what's wrong with me. I seriously don't know what's wrong with me why was I that delusional why did I think you'd never leave no matter how badly I treat you. Its not how people work and its not real life why did I think like that. Somethings actually wrong with me. \n\nLook none of this is your fault. And I'm sorry if I made you feel like if any of this was your fault. Cutting someone off for not being good for you is normal and the healtiest thing you can do you weren't wrong to do that. I didn't understand I wasn't good for you and I was still in that trance where I thought idk you know what I'm talking about where your still in love with someone and it makes you blind to common sense and normal behaviour. I'm sorry I didn't understand you were doing it because I'm bad for you I'm a bad influence and I can't treat you how you deserve to be treated. How we showed our love for eachother was so messed up like isolating eachother and the other stuff we did. Ik it's toxic and not good but I miss it sometimes because I've never been so intensly close with someone and I'll never be that close again with someone like that because it's toxic.\n\nAnd I'm sorry for the stuff I did after you broke up you being immature and lashing out at me is no excuse for any of it i was so hurt i thought it was okay but it isnt . I'm sorry I went so far. Ik your scared of me and you don't trust me at all. It hurts me so much that that's how you see me now. I'm sorry I made you scared I  could never hurt you or do anything bad to you like that I just lashed out without thinking. I realise my actions have consequences and things will never be the same between us because of what I've said and done. I wish I had the foresight and maturity not to have done that stuff. Please please no mater what please remember I never wanted to hurt you I was just hurt and I didn't know how to show how bad I was hurt. I was hurt and grieving so badly. And in the moment it genuinely felt like I was dying. I'm sorry for ever threatening you. I have no idea why I thought it was okay or why I did it? I wanted nothing more than for us to go back to talking and watching movies, how was threatening you helping? How was threatening you going to achieve that?.\n\nI wanna atone for all the wrong I've done so badly. I want you to trust me again and feel safe around me again. Most importantly I want you to love me again and treat me how you used to. Please gabby how do I do that? I've messed up so much and I keep messing up nothing I do helps it just makes things worse. I keep fucking up. I really need your help please tell me what to do. Please I keep fucking things up.  How do I get your trust back? How do I fix things between us? How?. Ik I still love you and ik despite what I've done and how I treated you ik what I feel for yoy isn't fake it's the deepest I've ever felt for anyone. I just wanna be in your arms. I want you to nuzzle me. I wanna wrap my legs around yours. I wanna hold your arm and wear your cloths. I wanna play with your hair. I want you to feel safe and loved and happy. I wanna make you happy. I'm really lost like in life and just everything but ik when I go through life I won't be able to do it without you. Your really important to me I can't do it without you. I messed up were in this situation because of me. I deserve this ik I do. I just wanna be happy and loved. That's it I'll be obedient ill do anything change anything sacrifice anything give anything up do whatever it takes go he'll and back please please just love me. I just wanna be loved by you it can't be anyone else it isn't the same. Your my person your the only person for me. Ik ill never be happy in life without you. I'll never be anything in life without you. I will never be loved, love from anyone else except you dosen't feel like love at all. I'll love you forever. Thats never gonna change. Its not a phase or just a moment or something.  We haven't been on good terms for a year and I still love you as much as I did 2 years ago ik I can't stop loving you. Please tell me how to fix all this. I don't wanna be alone, I don't wanna die alone gabby.",

I just miss you and I miss my dad I miss you both. The guilts been killing me and everything in-between. I haven't done anything for uni either, I haven't done my dissertation at all everyone's submitted it the deadline was a week ago I have 4 other assignments I haven't done just missed a deadline this Monday. I'm failing more than you can fail. I'm not passing my final year, 3 years down the drain. I just don't wanna be alive tbh. Messed up everything.  I just wanna be happy, I just wanna be happy I just wanna be happy for once. Why is it so hard impossible to be happy. \n\nI thought happiness meant you, I thought the only thing that could makes me happy is you. I thought without you I wouldn't ever find happiness and when you said you didnt want me it feels like as if hapiness itself told me she dosnet want me, how can I ever find happiness when even happiness dosnet even want me. I don't even know if I was wrong for feeling like that I haven't found happiness like that since. I can't find happiness can't find it drinking, I can't find it in friends, video games, not even in god. I lost my happiness with you and my strength with my father. I wanna be happy again I wanna go back to when I was happy when I had a future planned out when I had happiness when I had my dad and you I had everything. I wanna go back to that.\n\n I wanna be loved again, I wanna go back to when I was understood and loved.

Im not afraid to admit that i did that to you, i did that to you while telling you i loved you like no one else. I'm sorry it took you doing something drastic that affects me to finally experience what you went through and felt for so long, its the worst imaginable thing and I did that to you. How can a person treat somone they love like that? Yet i treated you like that. Im ashamed the oceon couldnt hold the shame i feel.  The only reason you've ever done anything to me is because I did it first i taught you how to do it. What you inflict onto me i did first. I see I was wrong. It's not your fault for hurting me I taught you how to hurt like that.\n\nYou weren't wrong for being scared to talk to me you weren't wrong for running away. I hate the person I was. I hate that I was such a repulsive and disgusting person that you had to run that you couldn't talk to me about something so important. Whenever you act like you don't love me it's because I act like that first your pointing the mirror back at me showing me, making me feel the lack of lobe you felt. I still love you to this day ill never act like I don't love you.thats a msutake ill never make. If I do not love you you cannot love me.\n\nGabby I genuinely hate the person I was. I genuinely hate how I treated you like filth like you dont matter like your disposable. I treated you like a stupid powerless helpless woman. I hate myself for cheating and being sneaky. I hate that I didnt put you first. I hate that I betrayed you. I hate how I made you feel unsafe. I hate that I didn't love you. I hate myself for not being able to say more than 2 words. I hate what I put you through. I hate what I did to you. I despise myself for how much pain and agony I gave you. I hate the empty I love you I gave you. I want to chnage gabby.\n\nGabby I want to change. I want to repent. I want to be absolved of my sins. I want to be a better man. I want to be what you deserve. I want to love you I want to cherish you. I want to support you. I want to make you feel beautiful I want to prop you up. I want to make you feel good about yourself. I want to was away your depression. I want to give you a home. I never want to be the person I was. I never want to cheat again I never wanna be that bipolar or un-understanding. In the day of my judgment when God asks me why I treated you like shit why I put so much hardship on you why I failed to love you, when god asks me i gave this gift to you to protect to nuture to give all the love you have , i gave you this wonderful woman to love more than anyone has ever loved, to treat as your equal to be your companion, i gave you this gift, why did you tramatise her why did you destroy her why did you abuse her why did you put her through hardship why did you hurt my child why did you put my child through that why did you make my child cry and vommit why did you give my child suffering. I will tell God I was an evil man I was a disgusting man i was a corrupt man and all mighty God I want to chnage I don't want to be like that anymore. Almight god I wanna love this woman. Almighty god this is the only woman I will ever love. Almighty god I want to be a good person. Almighty god I want to be cured. Almighty god I want to treat your child the way she deserves. Almighty god I am sin, I want to be good.\n\nI am melancholy I miss my home. please let me back home gabby.\nPlease let me back home.",
