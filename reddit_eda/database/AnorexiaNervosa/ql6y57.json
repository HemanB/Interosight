  "selftext": "So I know it\u2019s their job to inform you about health issues, including those around weight. I get it. But they should at least have some compassion right?\n\nSo a few months ago, I found out that if I take too much my thyroid medication, it can cause weight loss. So obviously I started taking more and more each day (I had a reserve because before this I went days without remember to take it.) When I started nearing the end of my stash, I started thinking of lies and ways to get more than my normal dose from my doctor. I realized how terrible I was being and promised myself I would stop and discuss this with my doctor to see what harm I may have done to myself. (It can cause heart issues.) \n\nDuring my next doctors appointment, I admitted to abusing the medication and admitted to starving for days and basically broke down and admitted my eating disorder in full. She nodded a lot, gasped a few times and whatnot. A day later, I received an email from her saying I should continue taking medication but in proper dose. And then she told me\u2026 that my cholesterol was high and that I should consider GOING ON A DIET.\n\nAnyways. That fucked me up a bit. Tell me your stories.",

A DOCTOR said that. To someone with a diagnosed ed) and should just eat x # of cal a day (the infamous amount that people say a toddler needs. If you catch my drift. Which was WAY less than the meal plan I\u2019d been on at the treatment center and way less even than the meal plan my outpatient dietitian at the time wanted me on). I left the appointment and cried. My treatment team was furious at the lack of due diligence on my doctor\u2019s part for giving such harmful advice outside of her area of expertise. Doctors really shouldn\u2019t give nutrition advice. Needless to stay I didn\u2019t stick with her, I switched to a PCP who actually used to work at the treatment center I\u2019d gone to and worked at my primary care practice with a specialization in eds. It was so nice to have my doctor be a certified ed specialist after the traumatizing experience of what my old doctor said to me. Doctors that give nutrition advice despite not being dietitians will forever bother me",
