  "selftext": "In a good majority of people who solely restrict, their labs come back totally normal.\n\nPeople's bodies have different genetic susceptibilities, so, while some people may lose their period, grow lanugo, have heart issues etc, other people don't, and it's not because your eating disorder isn't as \"severe,\" it's because everyone's bodies respond so differently to our eating disorders. Not showing any physical signs of malnutrition, despite being malnourished, doesn't make you any less valid.\n\nPlease don't let anyone tell you that you're not sick enough. If you have an eating disorder, you're sick enough.",
