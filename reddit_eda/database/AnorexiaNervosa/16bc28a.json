  "selftext": "I see alot of people on here saying they've had anorexia for years but no one knows, and im just wondering how? When my ed started to get worse my parents noticed within a couple months that i went from the low end of nw to very uw and i was immediatly hospitalised. I get that not everyone is a minor or lives with their parents but how does family / friends / people at work not notice?\nI know it probably sounds so rude but how do you have anorexia and not lose enough in like half a year or less for people to notice? I feel like i sound like such an asshole and like im trying to be \"best anorexic\" but i genuinely don't get it",

Some of my behaviors like food hoarding were ignored for \u201cjust being gross\u201d and turning down sweets, etc were praised for \u201cbeing healthy\u201d. I was an athlete and that usually edged out my ED. \nIt was only when I became an adult that food restriction became super central to my ED. I mostly just overexercised before, but when I had my recent relapse it was deep restriction & excessive exercise. Honestly my s/o and parents did not know I was struggling with anorexia until nearly 9 months into my relapse when I broke down completely. I was experiencing really bad health consequences and was underweight. I lied often and told everyone my stomach hurt a lot to avoid eating so they thought I had some other kind of condition going on.",
