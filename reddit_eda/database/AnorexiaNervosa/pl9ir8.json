  "selftext": "I feel like this is too fucked up to tell anyone irl but i love the feeling of being ill. I like feeling hungry and dizzy and fatigued, i like seeing my hair falling out, I love seeing the bruises all over my legs, I love the excessive furry hair on my arms because it feels like Im doing it right. \n\nSometimes I feel like I want to push myself hard enough that I black out at work or in public so I can go to hospital because it would just validate me even further. It\u2019s so messed up to think that but I always feel like I\u2019ll have to reach a certain point in my illness where I\u2019m SICK ENOUGH",
