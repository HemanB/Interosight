There seems to be an \u201canorexic to bodybuilder/exercise addict\u201d pipeline. Exercise is great but it\u2019s easy to get addicted to it, to hide behind it with \u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m weight-restored and healthy, I just love to work out, exercise is not even a bad addiction anyway.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m an amateur endurance athlete (long-distance runner) and my running helped enormously in finding recovery again after my most-recent AN relapse. But I know I have to be mindful: am I getting overly concerned about building muscle and the shape of my muscles? Do I cross train/run when I\u2019m sick or injured? Do I not allow myself rest days? Do I cancel other plans to run/cross train? Saying \u201cyes\u201d to any of these is a red flag and a sign I need to step back and prioritize my recovery. I\u2019m telling you the same things I tell myself. \n\nYou\u2019ve come far and you should be proud of yourself.",

But I know I have to be mindful: am I getting overly concerned about building muscle and the shape of my muscles? Do I cross train/run when I\u2019m sick or injured? Do I not allow myself rest days? Do I cancel other plans to run/cross train? Saying \u201cyes\u201d to any of these is a red flag and a sign I need to step back and prioritize my recovery.

Learning new recipes and trying new foods. You will get bored of chicken and rice and slowly begin not eating again. Recovery is a slippery slope and you have to be cognizant of everything you\u2019re doing. When he\u2019s READY getting into the gym could help. Letting off some steam and making goals.

We take down timeline posts ONLY if they do not follow the protocol - unrecovered to recovered, NOT healthy wait to unhealthy, and they MUST be spoiled. This post does not break any of our rules so it's not been removed. We've allowed countless timeline photos from both women and men, and yes we've removed some, but only if they don't conform to the rules exactly due to the danger not doing so may pose to some members of our community. \n\nThere is a slight sexism here though, but not due to the mods. The last time a woman posted a timeline photo, she got hardly any positive comments and people yelled at her and us mods for \"allowing\" her to post her recovered and happy body. We did not take that post down because it did not break the rules. If you wish to do your research, you can probably find the comments where I was defending the OP and saying that her post would not be removed in my comments history. It was fairly recently, maybe the beginning of this month or late last month? \n\nI don't agree with people yelling at others for posting rule-conforming timeline photos. I think that these posts hold a great potential for positive interactions, but some people are dickheads and ruin that by being dickheads. \n\nAnd if you don't like timeline photos, that's fine. They're required to be spoiled and if they included numbers or were healthy->unhealthy and not unhealthy->healthy, they would be removed regardless of OP's gender. As they're spoiled, people are free to just scroll past and not open up the photos or the post at all if they don't wish to see that sort of content. It's not up to us to cater to everyone's triggers. You must cater to yourself. If you know that seeing people's bodies is a trigger for you, scroll by and ignore the post.",

I come to Reddit for community support because I know full well the number of ig 'recovery' accounts that do just this - posting images of their disordered bodies seeking unethical clout\n\nEating disorders are inherently competitive, no matter the order of your photos. Yes, the images are spoiler tagged but anyone who is subbed to an anorexia community is surely going to be affected by these images. I understand that it's the internet and one cannot expect their triggers to be catered to but this is a sub for people effected by anorexia and it seems a low bar to set asking that people not post their emaciated bodies.\n \nThere are subs dedicated to these types of posts (progresspics, gainit etc) where these posts would surely be far better suited. \n\n\n\nYes, I will be unsubscribing - I am just hoping for some constructive dialogue.",

If we amended the rule to only allow recovered bodies, not only would there still be people yelling at us (again, not you), but there would also be very little way for us to tell if the person is ACTUALLY recovered or just showing their UW body and calling it recovered. That would definitely end up being a problem. \n\nI've been modding this place for many years now and it's only relatively recently that these posts have been deemed as a \"problem.\" I've seen countless people say on timeline posts that the OP inspired them to start recovery. And as most of the comments in this post say, people express their happiness for OP - not only maybe encouraging themselves and others to recover, but to inspire the OP to continue on their recovery journey and not give up and go back to how they were before (which is emphasized as disordered, horrible, and unhappy, vs. recovered, happy, inspiring). \n\nThe rules are a balance. What can we ban, what can we allow, without seriously endangering our community? Timeline photos are on the threshold but in my opinion as the mod that brought this place from a pro-ana cesspool to where it is now, they shouldn't be outright banned. We've amended their guidelines many times, the most recently to require spoiling. I don't believe that banning the pre-recovery photos would do that much good in the long-run due to the aforementioned reasons, just as I don't think banning all timeline photos would do more good. \n\nYes, there are subreddits dedicated to timeline posts, and we're not one of them. But we're also a space that tries to allow as many kinds of posts as we can that fall within the rules because there is a wide variety when it comes to our community's members. Timeline posts are rare here, anyways. We've gone months without them, then sometimes there are two in 1-2wks. There are people that benefit positively from timeline photos. There are people that benefit negatively from them. It's a balance. \n\nSorry to see that you're unsubscribing, but hope that you're able to find what you're looking for elsewhere. Our rules aren't for everyone and we understand that, but right now they're not going to change. We're going to keep enforcing them and removing timeline posts that do not follow guidelines, but allowing the ones that do.",
