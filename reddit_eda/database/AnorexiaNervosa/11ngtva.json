  "selftext": "I work with people. People see me everyday. I tend to be a very chilled out kind person at work. I completely get that some people don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on so I don\u2019t blame them one bit if they say something off kilter. But some comments have no place. I was working at my standing desk and a patient came up to me and says \u201cyou\u2019re gaining weight, don\u2019t go and get fat on us now\u201d I was so shocked I didn\u2019t know what to say other than \u201cI\u2019ll try\u201d I just went into the bathroom cried for a bit and just continued my day. Later a fucking co worker comes up to me and says \u201cI\u2019ve noticed you\u2019ve been gaining weight, it looks good\u201d I want to fucking cut myself jfc. Do people not understand there is no place to talk on other peoples weight. I feel fucking disgusting. Yes I gained weight I went from severely underweight to a low but healthy weight for someone my size and men specifically feel the need to comment. Like stop looking at my fucking body and pondering it\u2019s size go fucking look at porn if you want to look at womens body\u2019s like holy fucking shit why are people so fucking dense. Fuck humanity.",

Or like someone said above, saying something like, I\u2019m dealing with a health issue that is unresolved or something like that then just stare at them to embarrass them. Fight back instead of hide. My first instinct is always hide and feel isolated/sad/overwhelmed, so I understand you completely. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",
