Anyone else hear any really not-so-great comments from people around you?\n\n\n\n",

Although, right now, as I\u2019m in self recovery with her, she does comment on my weight gain in a way that a normal person would be happy about, and there is really nothing wrong with what she says, but me and my still messed up mind end up wanting to go back to old ways, or just end up feeling bad\u2026) not to speak in a certain way, but my dad doesn\u2019t and my sister still does talk in a way that badly affects me, but not everything is about me so I can\u2019t change them for me alone. Plus, I want to learn to be able to stand convos and words like that again. It\u2019s not really working so far, but oh well. Plus, I recovered by eating alone, so now I can eat most fear foods alone without any big bad thought, but I can\u2019t eat anything in front of my family, but I can infront of my friends\u2026 weird.",
