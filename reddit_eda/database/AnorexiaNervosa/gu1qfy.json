Slowly I started working out, first yoga, then cardio and I started to get hungry and started eating. I had a lot of people holding me from falling again, I guess that was a key. I just told myself 'it doesn't matter which size I am, I will try to love myself the way I am'. Still working on that, but first time in life not feeling shame because of my body. It's an everyday fight, but it's so so worth it. There will always be bad days, I don't think you can get rid of this illness for good, it will always be in the back of the head, but you choose will you listen to that voice or no. \nJust fight and don't give up <3",
