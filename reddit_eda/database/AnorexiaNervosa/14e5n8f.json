  "selftext": "My best friend has always made fun of the fact I was anorexic, and when I got down to my Lw and was forced into recovery she would purposefully say things like I was getting so big and I should lose some weight. Which made recovery extra hard. \n\nBut now since she\u2019s read some more of the heart stopper books she\u2019s claiming to have anorexic and it\u2019s just so stupid . I\u2019m all for people figuring out what\u2019s going on with themselves but it\u2019s so obviously fake?? She\u2019s not underweight (ik you don\u2019t need to be uw to have Ana) nor has she ever tried to lose weight, she actively dislikes people with Ed\u2019s and does her best to trigger them. So why say she has one? \n\nI\u2019m just really upset and annoyed with her about it but I can\u2019t say anything to her cause I don\u2019t have any other friends",

She sounds like a very toxic person who likes to downgrade people to feel better about herself. if she is definitely not at danger and just making the ED up, she is probably doing it for attention. \n\nMy former best friend always said bad things behind my back, including that I look like a ghost and will never find a boyfriend the way I look while i was on a very low level of ED and depressive. She was on the chubbier side of life and needed to talk bad about other people to feel valued by others. \n\nI cut her out of my life. \nBest decision ever! Can just recommend it. And I know you have noone else atm but it is better to be on your own and get healthy than dealing with a toxic person who is only triggering you during your recovery. she will never help you with your recovery nor will she take your health serious. \nNoone needs a friend like this.",

And learned that some \u201cfriends\u201d really weren\u2019t worthy of the title. \n\nYou deserve real friends - even if it is just one - who supports you and encourages you to be the best version of you. You are worthy of so much more than someone like her putting you down and treating you like crap. You do not have to settle for people like her in your life. Discover your value and what you have to offer in a friendship and find people who can match that. Friendships are a 2 way street. Not a highway and a bicycle path.",

Then I grew up, and now I don\u2019t have any friends, really.  Some online friends I speak to, but none I really hangout with irl. And although I\u2019m lonely, and although I sometimes miss having a group of friends, I am happier alone than I was having friends that made me feel less than.  Having no other friends is not a good enough reason to keep someone around that makes you feel the way this friend seems to make you feel.  Just something to think about. \u2764\ufe0f",
