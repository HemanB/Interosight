But I tried it. I thought \u201cthis isn\u2019t ED, this is me being healthy!\u201d \n\nFor some reason, this changed my eating behaviors to something of pride instead of guilt and shame, and I\u2019m more focused on how the food is healthy for me rather than deprivation and punishment. And I\u2019ve been  feeling better. I know for sure this wouldn\u2019t be a recommended strategy for most, but I\u2019m surprised that it\u2019s helping me slightly?!",
