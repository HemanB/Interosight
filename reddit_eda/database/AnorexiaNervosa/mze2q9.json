  "selftext": "I'm kind of sick of seeing this one certain stereotypical picture of anorexia, because it makes me feel so invalidated. sometimes, I will look at my body in the mirror and think \"yeah ok I've lost x amount of pounds this month and I see the change, that's awesome\". I still hate my body, and I never want to stop losing weight, but I see a visible difference and that's what keeps me motivated. it feels like the stereotype of anorexia tells us that people who struggle with it never see a difference or never recognize their weight loss. maybe this post is stupid because I'm sure it's not just me, but idk. it invalidates me. it makes me second guess my disorder.",

Because yeah, I don\u2019t think I see myself that wrongly, I know I\u2019m skinny and I can see where others are like \u201cya too skinny\u201d but like my brain also is like \u201cdamn get it\u201d - but yeah, I have a lot of different \u201cquirks\u201d than the stereotypical anorexic so it makes connecting with others a little harder because they do things I don\u2019t. Like counting calories, I don\u2019t do that, never have and that\u2019s like one of the biggest anorexia things, apparently.",

My tummy is still fat and my thighs are still fat. I know they\u2019re not, like I can logically understand that and I know that I\u2019ve had body dysmorphia my whole life and can acknowledge that what I\u2019m seeing isn\u2019t accurate. It just doesn\u2019t stop me from seeing it the way I do. I can absolutely see the difference though when I lose, like when I\u2019m even typing this now I can look at my thumbs and wrists and see that it\u2019s different, and I still do have body dysmorphia. Not all people with anorexia even do have body dysmorphia, the things are not mutually exclusive.\n\nI do think we should talk about this more, because I felt really invalid too.
