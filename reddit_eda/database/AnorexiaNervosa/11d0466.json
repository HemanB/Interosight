  "selftext": "At first I started counting calories everyday and when I wasn\u2019t seeing a lot of results I made the decision to skip breakfast altogether eating only two meals a day and each meal halved. I finally started loving my body until everyone around me started noticing and telling me how thin I am. Everyday I stare at my body and see my rib cage, which scares me but also somehow feels like an achievement. I thought that I could always stop when I wanted to but I can\u2019t. I\u2019m not sure I can.",

In reality, it's just something in my brain that couldn't just diet or \"eat healthy\" like people without anorexia. Plenty of people make the conscious decision to count calories. Most people never feel the urge to eat as little as possible. That's just what makes us different, I guess.",
