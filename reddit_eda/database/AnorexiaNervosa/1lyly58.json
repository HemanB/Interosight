Gives me peace knowing i won't have to live for much longer. I think it's because I'm too scared to end it any other way so not eating it is.

Things got better fast, as I went all-in, my mood and everything. But now that I'm 3 months in, I've gotten so much better, but now that I am, Im dealing with my worst trigger again. For me that's having fun with people, and now that I'm able to do that, without thinking about food the whole time, afterwards it makes me want to engage in behaviors again, because I feel like if the others make me feel so good, I should at least look good for them, so they don't feel ashamed for hanging out with me. And since recovery my weight-insecurity somewhat got better, I have started nit-picking at my face to the point where I can hardly look into a mirror without feeling discomfort",

I hope he knows how much I love and appreciate him and all the time he's spent with me and every word he's ever said to me.\u00a0\n\n\nI truly believe you can recover like I did. Finding a person that you know you can rely on for support and kindness but also honesty when you're doing worse so you're aware that you need to lock in is extremely important. This person should help you explore your interests and yourself as a whole, because they might not be there forever. But the things you learned from them will remain.",
