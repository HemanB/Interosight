  "selftext": "I forgot how horrible it felt to restrict until I relapsed a little bit the other day. I just skipped dinner and I got all the horrible hunger pains again along with being moody and tired. That sent me into a calorie deficit the next morning and even though I ate, I was still so low energy the whole day. I don\u2019t know how I managed to function as I did when I was severely restricting. Needless to say, I\u2019m so glad I\u2019m recovering. It feels so much better to eat.",
