  "selftext": "Today I stayed after school with three of my friends. My ed vry quickly became the topic and one was trying to get me to eat a granola bar and the other two were asking me if they made me certain things if I would eat them. This escalated into a big argument about it and one friend left while the rest of us sat in silence. I told them if they told anyone about my ana I'd no longer be friends with them and I'd unalive myself. That's why we were sitting in silence. I ended up leaving and sitting outside until I got picked up, my closest friend of the three joined me. We sat in more silence except for me apologizing. When I got picked up and got home it just clicked. Something in my brain really changed and I don't know how or why. I cried and cried and texted my closest friend about how sorry I am. I'm done ruining all of the good things I have because of my ana. I'm sick of it. These people love me so incredibly much and I sat there laughing it off because I don't want to give up this disease? Fuck it. I'm done. I don't want to be anorexic anymore. A five year struggle ended in the most abrupt manner ever. I didn't think it'd end this way, I didn't think it would at all. Bye bitch. I don't need you anymore. I have them.",
