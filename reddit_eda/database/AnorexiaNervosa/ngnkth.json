And so far I realized this myself. No good-hearted person could convince me until I actually got sick with anorexia, relapsed many times, recovered and actually started to see how things really were all my life.\nI am the one responsible for my life and if I make mistake I can always fix it. So you are! \nYou can always get back to your best self. You can always be whoever you wanna be. But don\u2019t give in to anybody- be yourself!",
