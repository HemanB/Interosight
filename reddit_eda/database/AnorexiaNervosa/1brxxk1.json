  "selftext": "I find it facinating how there are so many people who try to loose some weight and it never becomes more than that. It doesn\u2019t turn into a downward spiral till they develop anorexia.\n\nMy eating disorder started as me harmlessly wanting to loose some weight when I was 14 but became a downward spiral that was made worse after forced hospitalisations. But there are so many people who can do the same thing and are fine.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting what make some people different or more susceptible. \nThe same with recovery. Some people I know were able to recover relatively fast while myself and others have become still trapped 5+ years on.\n\n",

Anorexia has a strong genetic component, and it is also associated with personality traits like perfectionism, as well as other mental health conditions such as anxiety and OCD. For some people, those stars align at just the right time and an eating disorder develops, whereas someone else in the same circumstances but without the genetic predisposition/personality traits/mental health condition would not develop an ED.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of like asking, how can some people have a couple beers every night or hit up the bars without becoming an alcoholic, but when other people do that it becomes an addiction?",

But now my body dysmorphia dominates my view of myself and I struggle to find happiness so my weight loss became a lot more important and a lot less healthy",

But the stereotype that AN is about weight loss and being skinny is at best a gross oversimplification, and it\u2019s worth talking about the part of the iceberg that the world doesn\u2019t see.",
