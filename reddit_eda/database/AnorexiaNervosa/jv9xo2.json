  "selftext": "I\u2019m laying in bed right now, and I think it\u2019s time to get help when I go back home for thanksgiving. I never wanted to tell my mom or my family because I felt like it would be another burden they would have to deal with right now. But if this keeps going, I am going to be miserable for thanksgiving and Christmas. I want to be happy again. \n\nOf course there is the voice in my head saying \u201cno keep going\u201d, \u201cdon\u2019t tell her she will be sad\u201d, and even \u201cyou don\u2019t need help.\u201d But the matter of the fact is I won\u2019t be happy until I get help. Getting help will hurt. Trying to change and go against everything I\u2019ve worked toward these past 3 months will be agony. But I think it\u2019s time. Even if it\u2019s as simple as telling my mom when I get back home. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m ready to recover, but I need it. I want to be happy. I want to be god damn happy and have that damn pumpkin pie without feeling guilty. So it\u2019s time I suppose. I\u2019m not ready, but it\u2019s time. \nWish me luck! \ud83d\udc96",
