Skinny people weren't always idolized if you look back at the history. Even now, there are still a lot of countries who prefer chubbier people. The western culture isn't as dominant as you may think.

Two wrongs dont make a right, how about you stay in your lane, if you don't have anorexia you will not understand and be able to contribute in any positive manner. That is an excuse for abusive behavior in a sub with vulnerable people regarding these topics. \n\nI dont usually respond to trolls. Because I know this is all intentional on your part, and im feeding into your search of a reaction. I just wanted to let you know, as someone who has recovered, my brain works, I can see clearly, not get overly emotional, etc- that you are being an abusive piece of shit. I would recommend staying in your own lane, focus on your own issues, stop purposely triggering people. Its not a good look. Your reasons for doing so aren't good enough. You're just being a shitty person.",

I just wanted to let you know, as someone who has recovered, my brain works, I can see clearly, not get overly emotional, etc- that you are being an abusive piece of shit. I would recommend staying in your own lane, focus on your own issues, stop purposely triggering people. Its not a good look. Your reasons for doing so aren't good enough. You're just being a shitty person.",
