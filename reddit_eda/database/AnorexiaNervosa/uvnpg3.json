  "selftext": "EDs feel sexy at first- they are forbidden and mysterious, with the promise of some prize if you keep going further into it. Even when you first start recovery, or first relapse, there are a lot of people there helping you fight. But if it becomes chronic, and as you get older, you become frozen in time. People move on, get married, and have kids and families. You are stuck with a debilitating, dangerous disease that is no longer sexy or seductive at all- it's the worst kind of boring, but just as life-threatening. I think this is the least discussed long term consequence- that you just stay stuck in your ED until it is embedded into your personality. I know the people who would benefit most from this post probably will breeze over it in the same way I would have, but god I wish I could take my younger self and shake her sometimes.",

      "body": "\n\n\nThis is very true. I\u2019m 35. I have what some people have referred to as \u201cfunctional anorexia\u201d. I have an amazing life. Wonderful family, perfect boyfriend, great career, beautiful home, I\u2019m very happy- but I\u2019m also very sick. I\u2019ve been very sick for over 20 years. During that time I\u2019ve learned to be so precise and calculated that no one can really tell that there\u2019s anything wrong, especially because I\u2019m only slightly underweight. I don\u2019t stress about food or my weight or exercise anymore because I\u2019ve learned to fit reason into my disorder. I eat absolutely whatever I want, whenever I want, but I just don\u2019t want to eat a lot. It\u2019s just how I am now. My hair will be thin and falling out for the rest of my life, I\u2019ve accepted that. Im always going to be freezing and shaking in less than 80\u00b0 temperatures, so I never leave the house without a sweater because I can\u2019t even go into an air conditioned store in the summer without shivering and loosing feeling in my fingers. My family knows not to try and make me eat things I\u2019m not comfortable with, because if they do I won\u2019t visit as much. They turn up the heat and set my place at the table with the smallest cutlery they have in the house, and they think it\u2019s just a cute quirk. When picking food, I will always choose the lower calorie one, because it\u2019s what I genuinely prefer to eat, regardless of taste. I can\u2019t eat breakfast, and when I see people eat breakfast Im envious because I wish I could just casually eat in the morning. But I can\u2019t. It\u2019s just not who I am anymore. I\u2019ve been in and out of treatment, I\u2019ve suffered a lot, but over the years I\u2019ve learned to ease that suffering. Ive learned to be flexible with my disorder, because if I didn\u2019t I\u2019d likely be dead or in the hospital. All my ED behaviors are so ingrained in me that it\u2019s a part of me now. I\u2019m different than I was before. I hide my ED behind veganism and running and stress and dental problems. It\u2019s so easy to live this way now, and in general I feel great physically and mentally, so there\u2019s not really any motivation for me to change anything. Even though my life is easy and good now, I would never wish this upon anyone else because the suffering I went through to get here almost killed me multiple times, in multiple ways",

The long term psychosocial effects of EDs can really drag down quality of life and cause us to just want life to be over, if this is what life is. The honeymoon phase is so nice; everyone is worried, keeps and eye on you, you hate it but it\u2019s hard to deny the hope that others hold for you. They say there\u2019s treatment that can help you. There\u2019s a method to help you get better and you\u2019ll put this all behind you. After a few tries to get better and not sustaining recovery, I have a friend who seems to sort of feel sorry for me bc of my ED. We don\u2019t talk about it much anymore, but when it comes up she seems so genuinely sad and I never know what to say because I\u2019m not a gung-ho recovery fighter. If anything I\u2019m just scraping by as a functional anorexic. I don\u2019t talk about my ED in real life anymore, except to my partner when things get so bad that I can\u2019t hide it. I don\u2019t talk about it because I\u2019ve tried everything that anyone could suggest. People want to fix it and they can\u2019t. It\u2019s easier to let people think you\u2019re fine. But believe you me, I am not afraid of a sudden death. It doesn\u2019t make me reckless but if I die early from some freak accident or a sudden severe medical condition, I would be kind of relieved. To have someone take the choice away from me sounds wonderful. \n\nThey say you can\u2019t choose to have an ED but you can choose recovery. The older I get, the more life experience I have from myself and observing others\u2026 I realize some people cannot or will not achieve a lasting state of recovery. Some win the fight, some lose the fight; some choose not to fight and accept the outcomes.",
