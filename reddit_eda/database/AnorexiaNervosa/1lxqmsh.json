The world literally goes quiet and everything feels like a dream. I feel like it really helps me to dissociate. And i feel kinda like my head is floating and no longer connected with my body. I love it. I am addicted to it. It holds mw back from recovery, because i don't want to have more energy, i am almost afraid of it. How am i going to relax? Starving is honestly like a drug.

      "body": "Not the low energy, but I did get really used to my veins being small because I was cold all of the time. It made me uncomfortable when I started sweating and being able to feel the big vein on my arm. Also that the veins in my neck and by my temples got noticeable once my blood flow increased from eating enough to help my blood pressure and increase heart rate. \n\nSomething I noticed was that I actually got used to having energy again. I reintroduced foods slowly to prevent refeeding and over the 3-6 weeks my energy levels began to go up. Not enough to tell day by day, but if I missed a meal or snack my body would go into panic mode and throw me into fatigue. This time I could tell I was tired because I hadn\u2019t been in that state constantly, and the inability to think, smile, move as quickly etc. was no longer desirable. I didn\u2019t desire to take naps every day because I didn\u2019t need to. When I was restricting my eyes constantly felt like they wanted to close even if I was highly caffeinated or had slept well.   \n  \nMy therapist explained to me that your brain gets used to being in panic mode, hence why people with ed\u2019s tend to have higher rates of anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, etc. It knows it can\u2019t survive like that, so it\u2018s response to having no energy is to keep up a lifestyle that maintains that because energy (food) isn\u2019t being provided. The reason you can dissociate is because you don\u2019t have enough energy to feed your brain to do more than its basic functions. I was addicted to my ed because I didn\u2019t have time to think about anything but food/body/numbers. It was a coping mechanism since everything in my life felt out of control and like a threat.   \nI would recommend getting a therapist just so that they can help you filter through your thoughts as you start to fuel yourself enough to think. \n\nOn the bright side, as I was able to think more, my hobbies came back! I had energy to sing in my car. I could smile without forcing it. I could engage in conversation and connect with people again. If anything, relaxation is about letting go, not silencing everything. I realized that I had also been working a ton (3 jobs) to stay busy enough that I couldn\u2019t think about my problems. It had made me put walls up that felt \u201csafe\u201d but they really isolated me and stressed me out more.",
