  "selftext": "I really hate having both of these conditions. \n\nIt sucks when you have movement compulsions and you just HAVE to do X amount of exercise or X amount of this or that and then you're depressed and you just don't want to do anything at all. But then your ED brain just kicks you for being such an unmotivated, lazy, slob. \n\nIt's just like the meme with the two wolves. I hate both of them.",

And I have zero energy to get out of be even to smoke cigs. I'm proud when I get up and workout or go to the store because it's so hard. But I also feel guilty for not exercising 24/7 even though that isnt really a realistic goal",
