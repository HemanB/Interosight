The only way for the feelings to subside is to keep challenging yourself and giving into your cravings and over time the feeling of guilt and \u201cfatness\u201d get better. Do you have someone to debrief with post treat? I often talk with my partner if these feelings are coming up and try and rationalize and explain where they are coming from and I find it really helpful. All the best x",

I have been in recovery for 2 years so it\u2019s definitely gotten easier with time. \n\nI\u2019d say let yourself indulge at least once every week/ two weeks, 1) because your bad ass and made it through that week  2) because you truly do deserve happiness, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with eating something you actually want to eat! \n\nI programmed my brain by thinking everything was \u201c bad \u201cand I\u2019d get extreme anxiety even thinking about having to eat. BUT as much as we can trick our selves with bad thoughts we can trick ourselves with good ones. \n\nEven if you just tell yourself and \u201cAnnie\u201d F*CK YOU I like this I want this, it sounds so cliche but it will work in time.",
