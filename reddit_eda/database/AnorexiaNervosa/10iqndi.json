  "selftext": "Hi, I am looking for some advice here, I have a friend coming to stay for the weekend whom I love dearly. She struggles with anorexia, and just getting her to stay was a huge triumph in itself. I want to make the weekend as comfortable and enjoyable for her as possible. I know she wouldn\u2019t want to go out to eat, so I will plan activities which don\u2019t involve food, like a gallery, maybe going to a garden to see some flowers. But my main question is how do i adress the food issue? I need to offer to feed her of course as she is my guest, but I don\u2019t want to make her uncomfortable or like she has to make excuses not to eat/ avoid certain foods. \n\nSo, do I offer to get some of her \u201csafe foods\u201d (I heard that is a thing)? Or is that going down the wrong path\u2026\n\nWhen I notice her doing rituals (won\u2019t mention specificities as not to trigger anyone), should I say anything? \n\nBasically what can I do to make the weekend as comfortable and safe for her as possible? \n\nThanks in advance!",

I\u2019ll share some things that have helped me personally, but obviously I\u2019m aware not everyone is the same. \n\nNot too much physical activity (including walking) if no food is involved. If you\u2019re walking a lot have opportunities for rest (sitting on a bench). \n\nEat as you normally do, don\u2019t change your eating habits it\u2019s good for ED sufferers to see intuitive eating. Bring granola bars out with you if you sense your friend is getting fatigued/dizzy but hopefully it doesn\u2019t get to that point. \n\nWhen you eat meals, you don\u2019t need to ask \u201cdo you want to eat?\u201d just say \u201cI\u2019m hungry, let\u2019s get some lunch.\u201d You can also say \u201cIm going to have a granola bar, I have plenty so if you want one let me know.\u201d If they choose not to eat if you go out or cook, that\u2019s their prerogative but don\u2019t put it in question form as if it\u2019s an option. \n\nAt the same time, you don\u2019t really need to censor yourself. Don\u2019t feel like you have to walk around on egg shells. You don\u2019t need to bring up food outside of the context of meals/snacks but it\u2019s okay if it comes up. Obviously no talk about weight/calories. If there\u2019s any panic about \u201chealthy/unhealthy\u201d foods, no reassurance is necessary. It doesn\u2019t really help the situation and I would dismiss that kind of talk and try to change the subject. Talking about anything other than food while eating is important. No need to comment on rituals. If you sense any anxiety try to keep a fun topic of conversation going. If it\u2019s prolonged, check in. A simple  \u201cyou okay?\u201d works but no need to push. \n\nWhen I visit friends, they\u2019re pretty straight up with me and sometimes that\u2019s necessary. For example I\u2019ve been told \u201cI don\u2019t feel comfortable drinking with you tonight if you\u2019re drinking on an empty stomach.\u201d \u201cI wanted to take you to this museum but it\u2019s a lot of walking, I\u2019d feel more comfortable if you had something to eat before we go.\u201d Technically, still my choice to decide but in these situations I opted to eat. It may not be comfortable, but my friends feelings are valid. They want to enjoy activities without worrying about me, and I want them to enjoy activities without worrying about me. \n\nNot sure if this helps, I know it\u2019s a lot but I hope it did a little!",

Eat as you normally would. Offer her drinks and food regularly unless she explicitly asks you to stop doing so; a lot of anorexics would be hesitant to ask if you stopped offering, even if they had said no to previous offers and were perhaps considering taking offer number ten. \n\nDon\u2019t comment on what she eats or doesn\u2019t eat - don\u2019t praise her. Don\u2019t comment on her appearance in any way. Best of luck - you seem like a kind friend. I am mostly recovered now.

Obviously she is an adult and you can\u2019t force her, but everyone around someone with an ED should be aware of the risks and potential for quick deterioration.)",

If you\u2019re walking a lot have opportunities for rest (sitting on a bench). \n\nEat as you normally do, don\u2019t change your eating habits it\u2019s good for ED sufferers to see intuitive eating. Bring granola bars out with you if you sense your friend is getting fatigued/dizzy but hopefully it doesn\u2019t get to that point. \n\nWhen you eat meals, you don\u2019t need to ask \u201cdo you want to eat?\u201d just say \u201cI\u2019m hungry, let\u2019s get some lunch.\u201d You can also say \u201cIm going to have a granola bar, I have plenty so if you want one let me know.\u201d If they choose not to eat if you go out or cook, that\u2019s their prerogative but don\u2019t put it in question form as if it\u2019s an option. \n\nAt the same time, you don\u2019t really need to censor yourself. Don\u2019t feel like you have to walk around on egg shells. You don\u2019t need to bring up food outside of the context of meals/snacks but it\u2019s okay if it comes up. Obviously no talk about weight/calories. If there\u2019s any panic about \u201chealthy/unhealthy\u201d foods, no reassurance is necessary. It doesn\u2019t really help the situation and I would dismiss that kind of talk and try to change the subject. Talking about anything other than food while eating is important. No need to comment on rituals. If you sense any anxiety try to keep a fun topic of conversation going. If it\u2019s prolonged, check in. A simple  \u201cyou okay?\u201d works but no need to push. \n\nWhen I visit friends, they\u2019re pretty straight up with me and sometimes that\u2019s necessary. For example I\u2019ve been told \u201cI don\u2019t feel comfortable drinking with you tonight if you\u2019re drinking on an empty stomach.\u201d \u201cI wanted to take you to this museum but it\u2019s a lot of walking, I\u2019d feel more comfortable if you had something to eat before we go.\u201d Technically, still my choice to decide but in these situations I opted to eat. It may not be comfortable, but my friends feelings are valid. They want to enjoy activities without worrying about me, and I want them to enjoy activities without worrying about me. \n\nNot sure if this helps, I know it\u2019s a lot but I hope it did a little!",
