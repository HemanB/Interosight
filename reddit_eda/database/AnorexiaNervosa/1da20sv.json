  "selftext": "Although I\u2019m fully recovered now, I\u2019ve had numerous strange addictions. My most memorable one is that I would stock up on an insane amount of 0 calorie sweetener packets (Stevia, Splenda, etc.) and would just rip them open and eat them as a snack. It reached an extreme as to where I\u2019d buy several boxes a day and consume nearly 300 packets in one sitting (major digestive issues entailed).\n\nWhat about you?",

Protein bar hoarding and other safe foods - it started off as a small selection, probably around 10-20 in my bedside draw. Just before I went into hospital I had about 60-80 protein bars and other snacks/bars - kept some for so long they were out of date\u2026 had a huge box that I kept in my wardrobe and I would \u2018re-organise\u2019 it very very often\u2026 \n\n2. \u2018Perfect\u2019 routines and rituals - I felt like I couldn\u2019t eat dinner unless it was dark, I had gone to the toilet twice, my hot water bottle was filled but before I started making food so it was at the right temperature when I ate, had to remake my made, light candles, turn my fairy lights on and find something to watch before I felt okay to eat\u2026 if I didn\u2019t do any of those things I felt \u2018wrong\u2019 \n\n3. Only eating with one type of spoon or fork - and if I couldn\u2019t find those specific things I would panic and refuse to eat anything (I liked the size and the shape, they were small and thin and to this day I still only use them and refuse to use other spoons, I think normal spoons are too big) \n\nAnd there are many many others\u2026 (like one that we called \u2018food tourism\u2019 - just walking around supermarkets looking at food but never buying it",

Also my hair needs to be tied in a loose low ponytail.\n\n2. I drink several cans of zero sugar sodas a day because I hate water and it\u2019s a way to keep my stomach full without food. Also zero sugar squash is fine but never plain water.\n\n3. If I dont have my big morning cup of super strong green tea on an empty stomach I feel like my day is ruined.\n\n4. If I do allow myself to eat something during the day (even if it\u2019s a safe food) I will think about it all day and regret it, and therefore punish myself by eating less in the evening or not at all.\n\n5. Obviously tracking everything via food apps.\n\n6. Always stocking up on celery, cucumbers, tomatoes, radishes, zucchini and mushrooms.\n\n7. Last but not least: eating extremely spicy food. I use hot red chili flakes on everything. Also sriracha, tabasco, sambal oelek, jalape\u00f1os and habanero like crazy. I consume so much of it that I feel like non spicy food is kind of lame and boring so I always spice up my low cal veggies.",

      "body": "When i was 15 (five months ago), I was emaciated to ghe weight of 16 kg at a height of 155 cm, I began to engage in the ritual of chewing and spitting out food, meticulously rinsing my mouth after each bite to ensure that no remnants remained and that no accidental caloric intake occurred through cephalic ingestion through my saliva. This was followed by a tedious routine of brushing my teeth and tongue to pristine cleanliness (albiet w/o toothpaste due to fear that it contained calories. Chew/spit process became an intense source of psychological satisfaction: chewing, spitting, rinsing, and brushing satiated me an illusion of absolute control, that even with food present in my mouth, I maintained the autonomy to expel every trace of potential calorie, a behavior driven by a deeply entrenched psychogenic impulse rooted in maintaining control during the chaos of my unstable domestic environment. I always had an innate predisposition for OCD, which manifested into Anorexia due to the sporadic blights of my household environment as I begun fixating over my numerical weight\n\nThis insane regimen led to an expenditure of calories so significant that I managed to lose 0.4 kg daily, resulting in an exponential drastic decrease from 42 kg to 16 kg within less than four months. my objective was to starve myself to death; I perceived death through anorexia as much more tranquil and enjoyable than platitudinal suicide. I also had a morbid vision of myself dying at 15, looking like an Egyptian mummy in my casket, romanticizibg the idealization of extreme atrophy.\n\nDuring this epoch, (thinking back its kind of embarrassingly humorous) I curated a 140-page document on Google Docs, morbidly scrutinizing every type of food, analyzing its textures, brand, and whether it felt overly unctuous or \u201cfatty.\u201d I would not even proceed to chew/spit the food if I couldn\u2019t identify the type or brand as everything that touched my mouth must be recorded in this document in overt and austere detail or it would trigger profound neurotic distress. reinforcing my OCD.\n\nDespite drinking around 4L of water daily, I was severely dehydrated due to the utter lack of sodium and electrolytes. My lips would frequently crack and bleed, yet even blood was promptly spat out and my mouth cleansed, driven by an irrational fear that it might contain calories.\n\nMy inborn predisposition for OCD manifested into anorexia when the exogenous domestic instability and abuse exacerbated my need for control and autonomy. On June 11th, 2024, I concluded that my initial plan to succumb to death through anorexia was unattainable, as my guardians persisted in sending me to eating disorder treatment facilities. In response, I attempted suicide via refeeding syndrome by consuming an excessive amount of food daily. This led to terrifying peripheral edema, gastrointestinal paresis, and alternating tachycardia and bradycardia arrhythmias. To my dismay, these symptoms subsided after one month. Realizing my plan to die before turning 16 was thwarted, I ultimately gave up attempting to die through ED or Refeeding syndrome. I knew that no physician or psychiatrist could alleviate my profound psychosomatic torment; the enforced confinement in treatment units only intensified my sense of lost control, I understood that my environment was stipulated to change before my healing can commence. I identified the primary source of instability within my family and I was determined to ameliorate my internal psychological warfare, thus I distanced myself from the family members who inflicted torment upon me. Now I\u2019m significantly better.",

Even most bottled water has small amounts of sodium in it (like under 10 mgs per liter) so do you just not drink any water? \n\nSodium also isn't really bad for you unless you have hypertension, high blood pressure, or consume it in significant amounts regularly. It is a necessary electrolyte like potassium, magnesium, calcium, etc and it especially impacts your heart rhythm and blood pressure. While excessive sodium can cause high bp, restricting sodium too heavily can cause dangerously low BP, and many people who restrict already have low bp. If you feel horrible and weak all the time, your heart seems like it's beating weird, or frequently find yourself passing out or feeling like you will if you stand up, then you're probably restricting sodium way too much. Drinking water actually dilutes sodium levels despite the minor amount of sodium in water cause it flushes it out, so if you drink a lot of water and live in a hot environment where it's summer rn and you're sweating (you also sweat out sodium), please don't restrict sodium heavily. It's dangerous and will actually make you retain water (drastic changes in sodium levels either too high OR too low both cause water retention).",

          "body": "When i was 15 (five months ago), I was emaciated to ghe weight of 16 kg at a height of 155 cm, I began to engage in the ritual of chewing and spitting out food, meticulously rinsing my mouth after each bite to ensure that no remnants remained and that no accidental caloric intake occurred through cephalic ingestion through my saliva. This was followed by a tedious routine of brushing my teeth and tongue to pristine cleanliness (albiet w/o toothpaste due to fear that it contained calories. Chew/spit process became an intense source of psychological satisfaction: chewing, spitting, rinsing, and brushing satiated me an illusion of absolute control, that even with food present in my mouth, I maintained the autonomy to expel every trace of potential calorie, a behavior driven by a deeply entrenched psychogenic impulse rooted in maintaining control during the chaos of my unstable domestic environment. I always had an innate predisposition for OCD, which manifested into Anorexia due to the sporadic blights of my household environment as I begun fixating over my numerical weight\n\nThis insane regimen led to an expenditure of calories so significant that I managed to lose 0.4 kg daily, resulting in an exponential drastic decrease from 42 kg to 16 kg within less than four months. my objective was to starve myself to death; I perceived death through anorexia as much more tranquil and enjoyable than platitudinal suicide. I also had a morbid vision of myself dying at 15, looking like an Egyptian mummy in my casket, romanticizibg the idealization of extreme atrophy.\n\nDuring this epoch, (thinking back its kind of embarrassingly humorous) I curated a 140-page document on Google Docs, morbidly scrutinizing every type of food, analyzing its textures, brand, and whether it felt overly unctuous or \u201cfatty.\u201d I would not even proceed to chew/spit the food if I couldn\u2019t identify the type or brand as everything that touched my mouth must be recorded in this document in overt and austere detail or it would trigger profound neurotic distress. reinforcing my OCD.\n\nDespite drinking around 4L of water daily, I was severely dehydrated due to the utter lack of sodium and electrolytes. My lips would frequently crack and bleed, yet even blood was promptly spat out and my mouth cleansed, driven by an irrational fear that it might contain calories.\n\nMy inborn predisposition for OCD manifested into anorexia when the exogenous domestic instability and abuse exacerbated my need for control and autonomy. On June 11th, 2024, I concluded that my initial plan to succumb to death through anorexia was unattainable, as my guardians persisted in sending me to eating disorder treatment facilities. In response, I attempted suicide via refeeding syndrome by consuming an excessive amount of food daily. This led to terrifying peripheral edema, gastrointestinal paresis, and alternating tachycardia and bradycardia arrhythmias. To my dismay, these symptoms subsided after one month. Realizing my plan to die before turning 16 was thwarted, I ultimately gave up attempting to die through ED or Refeeding syndrome. I knew that no physician or psychiatrist could alleviate my profound psychosomatic torment; the enforced confinement in treatment units only intensified my sense of lost control, I understood that my environment was stipulated to change before my healing can commence. I identified the primary source of instability within my family and I was determined to ameliorate my internal psychological warfare, thus I distanced myself from the family members who inflicted torment upon me. Now I\u2019m significantly better.",

I have rituals outside of food and some intrusive thoughts. Honestly, I just recently found out that I could have OCD and didn't bother to seek the diagnosis because I'm just so tired of doctors, psychiatrists, and institutions. I was diagnosed with BPD and AN at 19, then substance abuse disorder at 21, was in and out different treatments and hospitals, and I'm just so, so tired. Since I'm at least  clean from substances and have my AN semi under control (I harm reduce as much as I can), it's not a priority for me to seek another diagnosis at the moment. I just think even more interactions with doctors would be worse for my mental health at the moment. \n\nBut I am genuinely thankful for your input. It's kinda comforting knowing that someone else does similar things and that there's an explanation for that. I'll research what are the perks of getting the dx in my country, like if there's anything that could help me manage the behaviors and thoughts.\n\nAlso, sorry for the long response, I felt like I needed to explain all the context, haha.",

          "body": "When i was 15 (five months ago), I was emaciated to ghe weight of 16 kg at a height of 155 cm, I began to engage in the ritual of chewing and spitting out food, meticulously rinsing my mouth after each bite to ensure that no remnants remained and that no accidental caloric intake occurred through cephalic ingestion through my saliva. This was followed by a tedious routine of brushing my teeth and tongue to pristine cleanliness (albiet w/o toothpaste due to fear that it contained calories. Chew/spit process became an intense source of psychological satisfaction: chewing, spitting, rinsing, and brushing satiated me an illusion of absolute control, that even with food present in my mouth, I maintained the autonomy to expel every trace of potential calorie, a behavior driven by a deeply entrenched psychogenic impulse rooted in maintaining control during the chaos of my unstable domestic environment. I always had an innate predisposition for OCD, which manifested into Anorexia due to the sporadic blights of my household environment as I begun fixating over my numerical weight\n\nThis insane regimen led to an expenditure of calories so significant that I managed to lose 0.4 kg daily, resulting in an exponential drastic decrease from 42 kg to 16 kg within less than four months. my objective was to starve myself to death; I perceived death through anorexia as much more tranquil and enjoyable than platitudinal suicide. I also had a morbid vision of myself dying at 15, looking like an Egyptian mummy in my casket, romanticizibg the idealization of extreme atrophy.\n\nDuring this epoch, (thinking back its kind of embarrassingly humorous) I curated a 140-page document on Google Docs, morbidly scrutinizing every type of food, analyzing its textures, brand, and whether it felt overly unctuous or \u201cfatty.\u201d I would not even proceed to chew/spit the food if I couldn\u2019t identify the type or brand as everything that touched my mouth must be recorded in this document in overt and austere detail or it would trigger profound neurotic distress. reinforcing my OCD.\n\nDespite drinking around 4L of water daily, I was severely dehydrated due to the utter lack of sodium and electrolytes. My lips would frequently crack and bleed, yet even blood was promptly spat out and my mouth cleansed, driven by an irrational fear that it might contain calories.\n\nMy inborn predisposition for OCD manifested into anorexia when the exogenous domestic instability and abuse exacerbated my need for control and autonomy. On June 11th, 2024, I concluded that my initial plan to succumb to death through anorexia was unattainable, as my guardians persisted in sending me to eating disorder treatment facilities. In response, I attempted suicide via refeeding syndrome by consuming an excessive amount of food daily. This led to terrifying peripheral edema, gastrointestinal paresis, and alternating tachycardia and bradycardia arrhythmias. To my dismay, these symptoms subsided after one month. Realizing my plan to die before turning 16 was thwarted, I ultimately gave up attempting to die through ED or Refeeding syndrome. I knew that no physician or psychiatrist could alleviate my profound psychosomatic torment; the enforced confinement in treatment units only intensified my sense of lost control, I understood that my environment was stipulated to change before my healing can commence. I identified the primary source of instability within my family and I was determined to ameliorate my internal psychological warfare, thus I distanced myself from the family members who inflicted torment upon me.

I am highly fond of psychoanalysis and have done some research into the etiology of my illness, here is a composite of my meanderings: https://www.reddit.com/r/psychoanalysis/s/uhuKq0Agef\n\nIn my anecdotal experience, the impetus for my Anorexia revolved around my need for control, my attempt at hormonal castration (I didn\u2019t want my menstrual cycles and wanted less libido because it was giving me bouts of psychosis), and overall enervation because I didn\u2019t want to be drenched in the overwhelming amount of stimuli anymore (I am hypersensitive).\n\nMy innate predisposition for OCD has been conspicuous and overt since birth. I have always been considered high maintenance and a scrupulous perfectionist. This applied to anything I valued: 4.8 GPA, immaculate cleanliness of my room, my academic and intellectual vigor, etc. \n\nAs a child, a concept of perfection, intellect, and academic luminosity permeated my entire existence, which exacerbated my endogenous aptitude for flawlessness. Starting with my parents, my father never hesitated to remind me that if I didn\u2019t accomplish something worthwhile (by which he means, having a net work of Bill Gates), I would be worthless and a travesty to this family. My mother hated me for having a strong volition, as our personalities were polar opposites and greatly clashed, she purged all her hatred for my narcissistic father onto me and would beat me every fucking day, kicking, punching, dragging me by my hair up and down the stairs; the abuse rarely ceased, and if it did, I was met with stone cold contempt. I can still recall in vivid detail the revolt and hatred in her eyes when I would attempt to interact with her. On the other hand, my father was a very limbic and unwell person, his emotions oscillated between genuine ecstasy (complete tolerance for any behaviour: i could throw a tantrum and he would laugh) and barbarian rage (breaking things, beating me, screaming at my mom), with little to no transition period; therefore I never understood how to interact with him and establish appropriate boundaries with him. \n\nI was in grade 5 when I first reached out to my teacher regarding the abuse (at the time, I was so desensitized, I wasn\u2019t even sure if it was considered abuse). Childrens Aid Society contacted my father and he ensured I suffered hell for it. For a week, I had to spend hours memorizing sentences on how to contrive a charade of the perfect family to CAS and my teacher, and I would be  beaten as atonement for my \u201cmishap\u201d. On the bright side, I was alleviated from the \u201chomework-checking\u201d for the extracurricular works my parents assigned that week. I managed to derail the CAS investigation, and resumed to living in that emotional and psychological squalor again, but not for long.\n\n\n**part 1**\nLol srry rhis is gonna be long, im on a rant",

      "body": "I could still recall as clear as day, the night of my first breakdown, the night I officially snapped. I was 11 and It was a typical evening of homework duties, and my father was enraged by my incompletion and incompetence that day as I have failed to complete the 4 pages of math work he assigned. We argued for a few minutes before it escalated into assault; he chased me to my room, and I had locked the doors again. He went to grab his screwdriver to uninstall the lock, and I would plead with him begging for forgiveness if I opened the door, praying to god for mercy from his wrath (this is how a typical fight would unfold). But to no avail, he persisted in trying to unlock the door and put me in my place. As he was screaming and getting closer to removing the lock, I snapped. I grabbed the chair beside me and I launched it into my closet, creating a loud thud, I proceeded to scream back that I couldn\u2019t care less if he killed me, that I was done with this bullshit. And to my surprise, he retreated. My father yelled back a few more swears, but he eventually left. \nI was left untouched that night. I was relieved. \n\nAfter that incident, I succumbed to MDD and began living in the garage, sleeping on a yoga mat and spent my days learning about topics that actually intrigued me. I would research and watch science videos about physics and philosophy, eventually I found psychoanalysis. I had transformed in those few months drastically, as my repressed desires and psychosis surfaced and the symptoms only intensified as I continued to brawl with my parents. Despite the horrifying fights and constant police involvements, one thing was for sure, that I was liberated, that I finally established my autonomy and I was unfettered from the inundations of my parents.\n\nFor the next 4 years, a lot has happened. Foster homes, treatment residences, hospital admissions, but I\u2019ve managed. I have managed to find an equilibrium of fighting for the maintenance of my autonomy while ensuring the highest academic standards possible. I thought I\u2019ve endured the climax of my life, but far from it. In the summer of 2023, my mother left me and my father, she went to a women\u2019s shelter because she couldn\u2019t handle the narcissistic scapegoating of my father anymore (my father blamed all my mental illness on my mother, and my mother couldn\u2019t practice her \u201ccatharsis\u201d of hitting me anymore as a way to mitigate her mental apprehension). I have abandonment issues with my mother from trauma in my early infancy, and her abrupt absence further tormented me. Not to mention my father proceeding to blame his marital problems onto me and gaslighting me to believe that if I wasn\u2019t born, they would be a happy couple. He fought me on my birthday over this crap and was sent to the psyche ward, I spent the following week alone with nothing to eat but corn flakes and I begun developing gastroparesis. Many more incidents ensued and although difficult, I\u2019ve managed to stave away from suic*de and sublimated my focus onto academics again, this is where it goes downhill. \n\nAs I\u2019ve mentioned, my propensity towards asceticism and compulsion for perfection was held in tact with my ability to manage and control, at least my autonomy. But once my father decided to move districts right before I finished my Grade 10 semester, and I couldn\u2019t adjust properly to the new social and emotional conditions of the novel environment because all the my previous coursework were rendered obsolete and I was imposed a new curriculum not of my choosing, I silently snapped. For 4 months, my father berated me and constantly taunted me, saying things along the lines of \u201cyoure brain is made of sh*t, and you are a waste of resources, you should k*ll urself\u201d, \u201cyou\u2019re GPA is gonna be messed up and you\u2019re gonna be homeless\u201d. I realized not long after, I started obsessively scrutinizing the weight and looks of my body, and incrementally decreased my caloric consumption to a maximum of 30 cal per day. I had officially unraveled; since I lost control of my autonomy, my environment, my relationships, and even my academic procession (the only thing that I truly valued), I knew I had to redirect my focus onto another facet of life, and nothing tasted better than skinny feels. \n\n\n**part 2**",

      "body": "I\u2019ve been through manifold eating disorder units and ICU treatments, but it was futile. How do you remedy the illness that remains the only thing keeping you from suic*de? As I watched my weight drop every day, I felt a sense of satiation and gratification; a jouissance and ecstasy I\u2019ve felt before, comparable to the feeling of pride when I accomplished something academically intensive. I was proud of how I was incrementally kllling myself, and I knew damn well I was going to die. But hey, I thought \u201cid look astonishingly attractive in my casket\u201d. I had romanticized my demise and the tragedy of my psyche. \n\nEventually, I realized that the Canadian healthcare system was too vigorous and I wasn\u2019t able to terminate my life in Canada, so I convinced my father to take me back to China, and off we went. I would be admitted into hospitals in my homeland, but managed in persuading my father to allow me residence with my grandparents after tedious badgering on my part. And there, my weight dropped to a staggering 16 kg.\n\nWhen my dad found out, he took a train back to my grandparents and literally tied me up onto a wheelchair to travel to Shanghai for ED treatment. On our way, we stopped at Beijing and an untold nuance of things happened (I\u2019m too exhausted to go into), but he changed course and listened to my will. Instead of going to Shanghai for treatment (he and I both knew how strong willed and potent my volition was, and that treatment would be futile and fail to benefit me), so we decided to go to Hainan. When we stopped as Guangzhou, I had a thought, \u201cI\u2019m going to induce refeeding syndrome to end myself\u201d, so I told him to allow me to eat a surfeit insofar as to throw up. I ate until I puked and my father didn\u2019t object. I believe there was an aspect of my father changing route in his determination of sending me to the Shanghai ED unit that contributed to my mental healing, as I felt I\u2019ve regained my autonomy again. But the predominant role in this psychosomatic transformation was when I began recalling the progression of my disease. I realized something then and there when I stood in front of a public washroom after vomiting all the food out, \u201cI didn\u2019t gain any control by starving myself, I had been controlled by my illness. It was an illusion of autonomy and pleasure I gained through fulfilling my inner child, but reality was that I was wholly bound by my Anorexia\u201d. That\u2019s when I told myself that I don\u2019t have to be \u201cperfect\u201d, I don\u2019t have to live up to the expectations, hell, I don\u2019t even have to be average!\n\n\u201cMomentum mori, I\u2019m going to die regardless, so why live a life restricted by the expectations and ailments of my psychology?\u201d\n\nI felt an emotion I had never experienced before, it was similar to the Buddhist Moksha (liberation), I felt genuine serenity and grace, alleviation and rebirth, tranquility and universality (sry, I dont know how to palpably describe it). But I knew I was in control this time, I wasn\u2019t going to be coerced by my parents, by their expectations, nor by my Anorexia, I was going to be free and uninhibited. That was the commencement to my journey in recovery. \n\nThere has been tremendous difficulty on my journey in recovery, psychical and psychological. But I had identified something, I know what I needed and strived for what I wanted. Unbinding stubbornness is a double edged sword, it could drive you mad when paired with Anorexia, or it could save you from the darkest pits in life. It sounds cliche, but after I learned to wield that sword, the world is my oyster.\n\n\n\n**part 3, last part**",

I always had an innate predisposition for OCD, which manifested into Anorexia due to the sporadic blights of my household environment as I begun fixating over my numerical weight\n\nThis insane regimen led to an expenditure of calories so significant that I managed to lose 0.4 kg daily, resulting in an exponential drastic decrease from 42 kg to 16 kg within less than four months. my objective was to starve myself to death; I perceived death through anorexia as much more tranquil and enjoyable than platitudinal suicide. I also had a morbid vision of myself dying at 15, looking like an Egyptian mummy in my casket, romanticizibg the idealization of extreme atrophy.\n\nDuring this epoch, (thinking back its kind of embarrassingly humorous) I curated a 140-page document on Google Docs, morbidly scrutinizing every type of food, analyzing its textures, brand, and whether it felt overly unctuous or \u201cfatty.\u201d I would not even proceed to chew/spit the food if I couldn\u2019t identify the type or brand as everything that touched my mouth must be recorded in this document in overt and austere detail or it would trigger profound neurotic distress. reinforcing my OCD.\n\nDespite drinking around 4L of water daily, I was severely dehydrated due to the utter lack of sodium and electrolytes. My lips would frequently crack and bleed, yet even blood was promptly spat out and my mouth cleansed, driven by an irrational fear that it might contain calories.\n\nMy inborn predisposition for OCD manifested into anorexia when the exogenous domestic instability and abuse exacerbated my need for control and autonomy. On June 11th, 2024, I concluded that my initial plan to succumb to death through anorexia was unattainable, as my guardians persisted in sending me to eating disorder treatment facilities. In response, I attempted suicide via refeeding syndrome by consuming an excessive amount of food daily. This led to terrifying peripheral edema, gastrointestinal paresis, and alternating tachycardia and bradycardia arrhythmias. To my dismay, these symptoms subsided after one month. Realizing my plan to die before turning 16 was thwarted, I ultimately gave up attempting to die through ED or Refeeding syndrome. I knew that no physician or psychiatrist could alleviate my profound psychosomatic torment; the enforced confinement in treatment units only intensified my sense of lost control, I understood that my environment was stipulated to change before my healing can commence. I identified the primary source of instability within my family and I was determined to ameliorate my internal psychological warfare, thus I distanced myself from the family members who inflicted torment upon me. Now I\u2019m significantly better.",

To read all of what you\u2019ve gone through at the hands of people who are supposed to be the ones to love and support you is devastating. It\u2019s  unbearable and it\u2019s amazing that you\u2019ve been even able to withstand what sounds like purgatory even from such a young age. There\u2019s a special place in hell for parents who have children and expect machines out of them. \nI haven\u2019t gotten a chance to read the psychoanalysis yet but I\u2019m looking forward to it.\nThere are some similarities though, I believe. \nAs a child, I myself witnessed the toxicity of my mother\u2019s relationship with a man. Wanting to save my mother but feeling so helpless. You mentioned perfectionism and I believe I\u2019d developed that from playing childhood sports all through highschool (I just graduated in May) and being held at such high standards that just felt unattainable. I moved schools in 2022, my junior year of highschool and that meant abandoning friendships and familiarity. sometime in Febuary of 2023, I decided to fast. I don\u2019t know why. Or at least I didn\u2019t. I\u2019d been so overwhelmed with feelings of being not enough and it came up on an algorithm. Water fasting for ten days. Lost the weight and it felt euphoric. Anorexia has been hell on me ever since then. I\u2019m a freshman in college and literally can\u2019t even think straight when I\u2019m on campus because I get so stressed out and just overwhelmed with life that all my brain does is resort to food as a way to get a dopamine response but then Anorexia makes it all bad again and so the cycle repeats and so on and so on. I digress though, I\u2019m sure you know more than psychologists about anorexia\u2019s effects the psyche \nLately it\u2019s gotten worse. I don\u2019t think I want to participate in life anymore and anorexia has sort of become a passive path to death which gives me satisfaction thinking about it.\n\nYou said you realized anorexia had been controlling you instead of the other way around and so that motivated you to try and get better and it\u2019s like, I understand that I\u2019m no longer in control as well but it\u2019s like\u2026 I can\u2019t stop! \nDid you develop another coping mechanism? Have you developed other obsessions? We don\u2019t get to decide when we are done with traumas and I\u2019m learning now that the body keeps score. \n\nBut like seriously, I hope all is well now or atleast someday in the future. You\u2019re sixteen (I think) and you didn\u2019t deserve that. Plus you\u2019re seriously smart as shit.",

I go on rants sometimes and lose track of how much I output lol.\n\nHelplessness, as you\u2019ve delineated, is a central constituent in the manifestation of AN. In psychoanalysis: we *sublimate* (transfer our desires and emotions from the symbolic order to an object in reality) our desires for control onto our bodies. The predicaments you\u2019ve gone through with trying to extricate your mother from her relationship and the unpredictable and novel environment after you\u2019ve changed schools abruptly, inevitably took a toll on your psychological wellbeing. To salvage some form of psychological equilibrium, you developed a mechanism of starvation to signify a realm of jurisdiction because other mechanisms were out of reach. \n\nThe Anorexic gene is a substantiated conjecture on how our ancestors began deriving gratification and euphoria from our hunger. It stimulates a rush of dopamine that invigorates our ancestors to find food in a timely manner. This gene has negative connotations nowadays; striving for the desire of asymptotic emaciation rewards our brain with dopamine and achievement. This happens primarily because we aren\u2019t receiving sufficient pride in our current accomplishments.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing that you\u2019ve already identified what has been impeding your sense of self and accomplishment. The mundane tasks of schoolwork and parental expectations have consumed your freedom and obscured the direction of your life. I understand how difficult it is to alleviate the burden and inundations, because one can\u2019t just elude the ideologies and doctrines that have been ingrained in our mind, and I don\u2019t believe I currently have the erudition insofar as to guide you (my life still requires much reparations lol). I strongly disdain contemporary treatment methodologies of forced refeeding and do not support reductionistic tenets of therapy, because it fails to address the underlying impetus, which is control and also untold nuanced psychoanalytical frameworks (which are highly controversial: it involves anorexic fetishism, electra complex, etc. which sounds fanciful when not examined holistically). That being said, perhaps if you rekindled an interest or avocation (ie. begin taking courses in what intrigues you, not what you believe is stipulated by societal mores), then you may feel a restoration of individual autonomy. And eventually, you would feel comfortable enough to stray away from the clasps of vocational expectations and immerse yourself in what you truly value. Afterall, we live only once, and like hell I\u2019m going to compromise my livelihood all because of the plights fate has dealt me with. I shall inhibit no regrets when I\u2019m lying on my deathbed.\n\nP.S: I somehow developed a knack for the culinary arts and gastronomy, so I proceeded to write my own recipe book. I also began to work in restaurants as a mechanism to rebuild my relationship with food (started doing this unconsciously after I quit the 140-page book of listing foods I\u2019ve eaten, interesting how the mind can concoct new methods to fortify itself and expedite recovery). It\u2019s also imperative to note that coping mechanisms are always idiosyncratic and should tailor to the individuals personal needs. I think the reason you haven\u2019t settled on a technique yet is due to the nature of your environment, there has been slim opportunities for you to truly reconnect with yourself, and trust me, opportunities will present themselves when you rectify your exogenous environment (for me, it was emancipation from my father). A turtle can\u2019t crawl out of its shell if it perceives imminent danger, so I suggest placing yourself in a position of psychological comfort before attempting to ameliorate your AN.",

          "body": "When i was 15 (five months ago), I was emaciated to ghe weight of 16 kg at a height of 155 cm, I began to engage in the ritual of chewing and spitting out food, meticulously rinsing my mouth after each bite to ensure that no remnants remained and that no accidental caloric intake occurred through cephalic ingestion through my saliva. This was followed by a tedious routine of brushing my teeth and tongue to pristine cleanliness (albiet w/o toothpaste due to fear that it contained calories. Chew/spit process became an intense source of psychological satisfaction: chewing, spitting, rinsing, and brushing satiated me an illusion of absolute control, that even with food present in my mouth, I maintained the autonomy to expel every trace of potential calorie, a behavior driven by a deeply entrenched psychogenic impulse rooted in maintaining control during the chaos of my unstable domestic environment. I always had an innate predisposition for OCD, which manifested into Anorexia due to the sporadic blights of my household environment as I begun fixating over my numerical weight\n\nThis insane regimen led to an expenditure of calories so significant that I managed to lose 0.4 kg daily, resulting in an exponential drastic decrease from 42 kg to 16 kg within less than four months. my objective was to starve myself to death; I perceived death through anorexia as much more tranquil and enjoyable than platitudinal suicide. I also had a morbid vision of myself dying at 15, looking like an Egyptian mummy in my casket, romanticizibg the idealization of extreme atrophy.\n\nDuring this epoch, (thinking back its kind of embarrassingly humorous) I curated a 140-page document on Google Docs, morbidly scrutinizing every type of food, analyzing its textures, brand, and whether it felt overly unctuous or \u201cfatty.\u201d I would not even proceed to chew/spit the food if I couldn\u2019t identify the type or brand as everything that touched my mouth must be recorded in this document in overt and austere detail or it would trigger profound neurotic distress. reinforcing my OCD.\n\nDespite drinking around 4L of water daily, I was severely dehydrated due to the utter lack of sodium and electrolytes. My lips would frequently crack and bleed, yet even blood was promptly spat out and my mouth cleansed, driven by an irrational fear that it might contain calories.\n\nMy inborn predisposition for OCD manifested into anorexia when the exogenous domestic instability and abuse exacerbated my need for control and autonomy. On June 11th, 2024, I concluded that my initial plan to succumb to death through anorexia was unattainable, as my guardians persisted in sending me to eating disorder treatment facilities. In response, I attempted suicide via refeeding syndrome by consuming an excessive amount of food daily. This led to terrifying peripheral edema, gastrointestinal paresis, and alternating tachycardia and bradycardia arrhythmias. To my dismay, these symptoms subsided after one month. Realizing my plan to die before turning 16 was thwarted, I ultimately gave up attempting to die through ED or Refeeding syndrome. I knew that no physician or psychiatrist could alleviate my profound psychosomatic torment; the enforced confinement in treatment units only intensified my sense of lost control, I understood that my environment was stipulated to change before my healing can commence. I identified the primary source of instability within my family and I was determined to ameliorate my internal psychological warfare, thus I distanced myself from the family members who inflicted torment upon me.

As I watched my weight drop every day, I felt a sense of satiation and gratification; a jouissance and ecstasy I\u2019ve felt before, comparable to the feeling of pride when I accomplished something academically intensive. I was proud of how I was incrementally kllling myself, and I knew damn well I was going to die. But hey, I thought \u201cid look astonishingly attractive in my casket\u201d. I had romanticized my demise and the tragedy of my psyche. \n\nEventually, I realized that the Canadian healthcare system was too vigorous and I wasn\u2019t able to terminate my life in Canada, so I convinced my father to take me back to China, and off we went. I would be admitted into hospitals in my homeland, but managed in persuading my father to allow me residence with my grandparents after tedious badgering on my part. And there, my weight dropped to a staggering 16 kg.\n\nWhen my dad found out, he took a train back to my grandparents and literally tied me up onto a wheelchair to travel to Shanghai for ED treatment. On our way, we stopped at Beijing and an untold nuance of things happened (I\u2019m too exhausted to go into), but he changed course and listened to my will. Instead of going to Shanghai for treatment (he and I both knew how strong willed and potent my volition was, and that treatment would be futile and fail to benefit me), so we decided to go to Hainan. When we stopped as Guangzhou, I had a thought, \u201cI\u2019m going to induce refeeding syndrome to end myself\u201d, so I told him to allow me to eat a surfeit insofar as to throw up. I ate until I puked and my father didn\u2019t object. I believe there was an aspect of my father changing route in his determination of sending me to the Shanghai ED unit that contributed to my mental healing, as I felt I\u2019ve regained my autonomy again. But the predominant role in this psychosomatic transformation was when I began recalling the progression of my disease. I realized something then and there when I stood in front of a public washroom after vomiting all the food out, \u201cI didn\u2019t gain any control by starving myself, I had been controlled by my illness. It was an illusion of autonomy and pleasure I gained through fulfilling my inner child, but reality was that I was wholly bound by my Anorexia\u201d. That\u2019s when I told myself that I don\u2019t have to be \u201cperfect\u201d, I don\u2019t have to live up to the expectations, hell, I don\u2019t even have to be average!\n\n\u201cMomentum mori, I\u2019m going to die regardless, so why live a life restricted by the expectations and ailments of my psychology?\u201d\n\nI felt an emotion I had never experienced before, it was similar to the Buddhist Moksha (liberation), I felt genuine serenity and grace, alleviation and rebirth, tranquility and universality (sry, I dont know how to palpably describe it). But I knew I was in control this time, I wasn\u2019t going to be coerced by my parents, by their expectations, nor by my Anorexia, I was going to be free and uninhibited. That was the commencement to my journey in recovery. \n\nThere has been tremendous difficulty on my journey in recovery, psychical and psychological. But I had identified something, I know what I needed and strived for what I wanted. Unbinding stubbornness is a double edged sword, it could drive you mad when paired with Anorexia, or it could save you from the darkest pits in life. It sounds cliche, but after I learned to wield that sword, the world is my oyster.\n\n\n\n**part 3, last part**",

          "body": " I don't eat anything until late evening, so I'm hungry in the day anyway if I don't have gum, I think people who have one piece and then that's it probably get hungry, but I'm eating copious amounts of it from when I wake up at 6am until I eat in the evening.\n\nIt doesn't' sound believable but I have 230 pieces of it a day, it's non stop, hence why I'm poor because it's an expensive habit, I hate myself for wasting money on it, I literally work 45 hours a week just to pay for it, what's the point. But I can't quit it now either, it's been this way for 6 years I'm truly addicted to the taste & how it makes me feel. Even though it rises my bank and makes me super gassy. When I add what I've spent over 6 years  it's in the thousands of pounds, I could have a nice chunk of savings behind me, or afford a house by now, instead I've wasted it away on something you chew for 10 mins and replace.\n\nI'm nearly 40 and after 17 years together my partner should have someone who's financially stable, not someone who needs to borrow money off him at the end of the month just to get by. I'm miserable but don't know a way out, if I don't eat gum I know it will just lead to me eating In the day and I can't do that.",

If i am to offer am objective view, many people have at least one dysfunctional thing they spend a lot of money on. If it's not one thing, it's another. So don't be so hard on yourself on it, it just does worse for your wellbeing. I also spend sooo much money and time on food (bulimia) that went in the toilet. I was able to recover partially, the money and time remain wasted, but i don't think about it, it does me no good. There's always time to get better, save money, enjoy some nice nourishing food. \n\nPlease please stop beating yourself up for it, you're only human. \ud83e\udd0d\ud83e\udd0d",

So I wanted to say thank you, because you made me feel so much better about it. It's hard when my family and partner constantly remind me about how much I'm spending on it and how little money I have because of it. You're so right though the money and time wasted whenever I choose to get better will remain wasted, but I can't change that. All I can do is look to the future and hopefully somewhere down the line there's a brighter and better one waiting for me. I just need it to hurry up because I'm not getting any younger. \n\nI'm so glad you replied to me, I appreciate everything you said and I hope you are living a happy and healthier life xx",
