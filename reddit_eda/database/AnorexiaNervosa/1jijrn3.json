  "selftext": "People with high functioning anorexia are high achievers\u2014 active members of their community, with careers, families, and relationships\u2014 even though they actively engage in their eating disorder.\n\nI definitely resonate with this, and wanted to discuss this with y\u2019all. A lot of people I\u2019ve met in treatment talk about the opposite experience, falling apart and being completely non functional. But, I still feel like I\u2019m doing so well. \n\nI know part of it is that I\u2019ve learned to live with the negatives (ie health complications), but I still live a full life with Anorexia. \n\nSo\u2026 what do you think of this label? Do you fit into this category? Do you think it is a harmful idea? ",

A \"full life\"\n\n but statistically speaking that is likely to fall apart, it's easy for things to spiral out of control, it's likely to make your full life shorter, and how can it really be full if you have to dedicate significant time if your processing to abide by anorexias rules and behaviors?\n\nPart of the disease is the coping, and the excuse making. \n\nBecause there is no reality that you are better doing this to your body than you could be if you're able to ever reach fully recovered",
