With an added bonus of their limited funding being pulled more and more so there's even less of the terrible resources that are still all those people have. \n\nI've only been to one ED treatment center, and my insurance cut me two weeks in because I was \"doing too well.\" AKA, actually TRYING. The only reason I was able to stay for TWO weeks was because the psychiatrist there started me on a new depression med as an excuse (needing to monitor the adjustment to it or whatever). Soooo... I don't have much knowledge about those specifically. Not from personal experience, anyway.",
