  "selftext": "When I was heavier (most of my life) I used to have a visceral reaction (feeling nauseous/distressed) whenever I caught sight of myself, to the point that I would avoid mirrors and ask to never be in photos. Granted, I doubt I'll ever be at the stage where I love how I look/believe that I'm attractive, but since dropping weight to a borderline unhealthy degree I am definitely a lot more comfortable seeing myself in the mirror and will be happy to appear in photos or even post them on social media. \n\nI'm a little resentful of family telling me I'm too skinny / judging me for my eating habits now because mentally I've never felt more at ease with how I look. Part of me wonders if I ever had body dysmorphia, or if I was simply aware of how chubby I was when I looked in the mirror. I look at past photos of myself and wonder how my family never commented on how overweight I looked. I'm hoping they're just used to how I looked back then compared to this sudden change they've seen in how I look now. I'm hoping if I keep this up for long enough they'll eventually get used to it and the comments will stop. ",
