I also read nutrition labels as a kid bc my mom told me to. that\u2019s all the specifics I can remember \n\nbut Ive always had secretive eating habits, shame and guilt around wanting/needing/asking for food to the point where if i didn\u2019t have money for lunch i would just skip (my school had a program where you could still get a PB & J and they\u2019d charge at the end of the month) and i would never ask my friends parents/my parents/my aunt for food no matter how hungry I was. but yeah maybe halfway through the school year when i was 8 i actually started developing anorexia and now here i am \ud83d\ude43",
