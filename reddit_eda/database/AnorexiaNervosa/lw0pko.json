  "selftext": "My friends all know about my ED but I struggle to tell them when I'm doing well so I keep it quite quiet, so I thought I'd tell you guys instead, if you wouldn't mind. \n\nYesterday, my boyfriend said something that would've normally triggered me into oblivion. But I was okay. I told him that it was too far, something I've never had the strength to do before, and was okay. It didn't make me feel as anxious as before and didn't trigger me nearly as much.\n\nAlso, this morning, my mum stood next to me and compared our sizes, saying she'll be as skinny as me soon. She's doing some dumb crash diet that I don't agree with cuz it's really disordered. But anyways, I was making my breakfast whilst she said this. And I carried on, and ate my breakfast anyway. On top of that, my breakfast was quite a big fear food of mine. So I'd say I did pretty well.\n\nAnd my mum has lost a pretty big amount of weight the last week, and shes very proud of that and keeps reminding us how much she has. This would usually have a massive effect but it hasn't been stopping me from recovering.\n\nI've eaten pretty normally for the last two weeks, have exercised to make me stronger not skinnier, and haven't weighed myself.\n\nIf anyone has got this far, thank you for reading. It means a lot, and I wanted to show someone that I'm going well. Secondly, if you're struggling, please just do one thing to try and recover today: eat a fear food, skip a workout, etc. Do it for me! Do it for yourself! I promise you can do this! Recovery is possible <3",
