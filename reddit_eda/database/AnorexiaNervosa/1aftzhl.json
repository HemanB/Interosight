  "selftext": "tw\u26a0\ufe0f\nNo one ever talks about who you constantly feel like your rotting with anorexia, I don\u2019t have the sensation of feeling fat I feel the opposite, I feel like my organs are being sucked out of me, like I\u2019m nothing but bones, like I\u2019m dying every single day. It\u2019s gotten to the point where I need a cane bc I can\u2019t stand or walk for \u201clong\u201d periods at a time. I can\u2019t run like I used to, I used to love running. I used to like sports if my teammates were kind, I liked doing that type of stuff even though I wasn\u2019t good at it. I can\u2019t even do gardening. I guess this post is to ask if anyone else feels like this ?",

      "body": "Yes. It was awful. I\u2019ve been depressed and passively or actively suicidal for the past 10 years. Dying was never an issue. It never scared me. Except when it was caused by anorexia. It\u2019s terrifying because you feel like you\u2019re gonna die but you don\u2019t know exactly how so you become hyper focused on every failing signal your body sends you. At my lowest I could no longer tell if it was a heart attack or just anxiety for knowing a heart attack might be imminent (and one day it was actually a heart attack). I couldn\u2019t sleep, even a small fold on any piece of clothing I was wearing or in the sheets was painful against my body. I sat on two huge fluffy pillows on top of a couch and even then it would be painful. I couldn\u2019t poop, I was having severe heart issues, I would get tired over just standing up, I even wanted to eat but couldn\u2019t get myself to do it, because I completely lost all hunger signals and was getting painfully full after just 2 bites. I didn\u2019t feel fat either. At all. It got to a point it was too exhausting to talk. I would lose my breath. I would never leave my bed. Had no life, had no friends, couldn\u2019t work, couldn\u2019t study, couldn\u2019t even focus on watching Netflix or any movie or show. I regretted everything I had done to my body. I felt stupid. Every moment was scary because it was out of my control. I dug myself into that huge dark hole and I couldn\u2019t get out anymore, even if I wanted. \n\nThat\u2019s no way to go though. I refused to go that painfully. Even though I don\u2019t appreciate life, if I ever decide to end it I don\u2019t want it to be this way. So I trusted that I needed full time professional help. And it didn\u2019t fix me, but it fixed my weight enough for a while. And I am and will continue to do my best to keep it that way, because this disease is excruciating and the most horrible hell. I am not the epitome of health as I still have significant issues, but things are better. It doesn\u2019t hurt to sit, or to sleep. Talking is not exhausting. I have 3 friends and I\u2019m back in college. \n\nThis meaning, I deeply sympathize with how you\u2019re feeling, and I am truly truly sorry. But please, try to hold on. You can have good things again. You really can, and you deserve them. I can now acknowledge that at my lowest my mental capacity was so so reduced. A lot of things that were dark inside my head were literally just a mental consequence of starvation, even though I felt perfectly able of being rational. I thought everything I thought or felt was real, and it wasn\u2019t. If you can, try to give yourself the opportunity to make a choice for yourself at full capacity. Believe me, even if it\u2019s still somewhat dark, it is way more colorful than that hole will ever be.\n\nYour body is still fighting for you. Fight with him, and give him time to heal. Our bodies are incredibly resilient. I promise it doesn\u2019t have to feel that way, there is still a way out while you\u2019re here.\n\nSending you a lot of strength and love \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb",

Except when it was caused by anorexia. It\u2019s terrifying because you feel like you\u2019re gonna die but you don\u2019t know exactly how so you become hyper focused on every failing signal your body sends you. At my lowest I could no longer tell if it was a heart attack or just anxiety for knowing a heart attack might be imminent (and one day it was actually a heart attack). I couldn\u2019t sleep, even a small fold on any piece of clothing I was wearing or in the sheets was painful against my body. I sat on two huge fluffy pillows on top of a couch and even then it would be painful. I couldn\u2019t poop, I was having severe heart issues, I would get tired over just standing up, I even wanted to eat but couldn\u2019t get myself to do it, because I completely lost all hunger signals and was getting painfully full after just 2 bites. I didn\u2019t feel fat either. At all. It got to a point it was too exhausting to talk. I would lose my breath. I would never leave my bed. Had no life, had no friends, couldn\u2019t work, couldn\u2019t study, couldn\u2019t even focus on watching Netflix or any movie or show. I regretted everything I had done to my body. I felt stupid. Every moment was scary because it was out of my control. I dug myself into that huge dark hole and I couldn\u2019t get out anymore, even if I wanted. \n\nThat\u2019s no way to go though. I refused to go that painfully. Even though I don\u2019t appreciate life, if I ever decide to end it I don\u2019t want it to be this way. So I trusted that I needed full time professional help. And it didn\u2019t fix me, but it fixed my weight enough for a while. And I am and will continue to do my best to keep it that way, because this disease is excruciating and the most horrible hell. I am not the epitome of health as I still have significant issues, but things are better. It doesn\u2019t hurt to sit, or to sleep. Talking is not exhausting. I have 3 friends and I\u2019m back in college. \n\nThis meaning, I deeply sympathize with how you\u2019re feeling, and I am truly truly sorry. But please, try to hold on. You can have good things again. You really can, and you deserve them. I can now acknowledge that at my lowest my mental capacity was so so reduced. A lot of things that were dark inside my head were literally just a mental consequence of starvation, even though I felt perfectly able of being rational. I thought everything I thought or felt was real, and it wasn\u2019t. If you can, try to give yourself the opportunity to make a choice for yourself at full capacity. Believe me, even if it\u2019s still somewhat dark, it is way more colorful than that hole will ever be.\n\nYour body is still fighting for you. Fight with him, and give him time to heal. Our bodies are incredibly resilient. I promise it doesn\u2019t have to feel that way, there is still a way out while you\u2019re here.\n\nSending you a lot of strength and love \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb",
