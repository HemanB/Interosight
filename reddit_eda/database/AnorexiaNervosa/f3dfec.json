I \"binged\" last night, probably still lower than maintenance tbh after bot having solids for two week, put on a \"pound\" (food weight obv), but I feel like my fingers are bigger, my cheeks are puffy, obviously my stomach is huge, I feel like my jawbone has so much more fat on it, like my thigh have gotten bigger, the bone along my arm is impossible to feel...  its terrifying and up until I read the comments I genuinely thought I looked different. In a way it's nice to know it's all in my head and people aren't staring at me knowing I look like I gained 20 pounds overnight. Still brutal though so guess who's skipping class to go to the gym, it's this dumb bitch",
