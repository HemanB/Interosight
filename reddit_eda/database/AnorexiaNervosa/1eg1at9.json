  "selftext": "I have severe and enduring anorexia. I've suffered from it for 18 years. I never fully recovered. I tried inpatient treatment twice, but it didn't help me. I have autism as well, and the inpatient programs I went to did not take this into consideration at the time. I am experiencing severe medical complications from prolonged malnutrition, like an inability to digest nutrients properly from the food I eat. This is resulting in unintentional weight loss and stomach pain. I also have bladder issues and painful, frequent urination. Due to the embarrassment of the symptoms, I don't want to go to the hospital. These symptoms have been going on for three years and have not resolved. I am on palliative care for my eating disorder. My doctor has told me I could die if I don't turn things around and explained my body can't process the nutrients from food properly because of how long I have starved myself. She said it will take time for me to feel better and that I will have to push myself to eat more, despite the pain I am in. And that's very difficult. Because on days when I am in pain, it's hard to motivate myself to eat more. My parents had a hard time accepting the severity of my illness, and wouldn't take it seriously, until the nurse from palliative care explained it to them. They are very supportive, but I think it makes them sad to talk with me about this. They will take me to my doctors appointments, but don't want to listen to me when I explain to them how bad my pain is. My doctor is trying to get me set up with an online eating disorder program that works with people who have autism and anorexia. I just want the painful medical complications to go away. I try to eat more, but it doesn't make me feel better. My weight won't go up. I can't go through a day without feel pain and exhaustion. I don't want to get worse, but I feel I've been sick for so long, that I may not be able to completely reverse these medical complications. I know this is serious, but I have a fear of change. This fear of change makes me afraid of trying new things, new treatments. Talking to new doctors gives me anxiety. But I know if I do nothing, I will continue to decline. Can anyone relate? Anorexia is such a serious illness. Anyone who is struggling, I advise you to seek help as soon as you become ill. I was very stubborn and refused to listen to the doctors years ago, who told me I needed to treat this right away. I stayed sick for years, and now my behaviors are deeply entrenched and hard to break. Due to being autistic, I also have sensory sensitivities, rigid thinking, and issues with my hunger cues, which are things not typically addressed in anorexia treatment. I think being autistic makes my behaviors more engrained. I don't think recovering is impossible for me, but it is more difficult for me at this point. And that is why I need a treatment program tailored to fit my specific needs. Anorexia is a heartbreaking disorder. No one deserves to suffer with it. I do have a therapist and nutritionist and I hope the online program can offer me some advice about what to do. ",

I could hardly focus on getting better because I was so anxious. And the programs didn't take into consideration that I have autism and that I will respond differently to anorexia treatment. I think I have trauma from my last inpatient experiences. But I know all programs are different and I know they do work for some people. I would feel more comfortable staying at home and doing outpatient care.",

I\u2019m not certain of your location but in the UK there is a relatively new care pathway called the *PEACEpathway* they\u2019ve been specially set up to deal with people and complex cases who have both autism and EDs, they have a range of resources that may help you, your family or your care team- even if you are out of country. \n\nI echo the sentiments of the other responder in that please don\u2019t feel embarrassed - I know that\u2019s easier said than done and I too have medical complications that cause me much shame -about seeking support, bodies fail in all sorts of ways for all sorts of reasons, medicine exists not to judge but to care and help. \n\nI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever recieved enteral feeding - I\u2019ve had a PEG for 12years, NGs before that, my advice would always be that if you can find ways to keep hold of an oral intake then do so as tubes come with many downsides, but equally if you have no other choice and it hasn\u2019t been suggested then I\u2019d propose asking your team why it couldn\u2019t be at least a stabilising option for you.\n\nLastly if you still have hope please don\u2019t allow any professional to erase that from you. Nobody should be forced into palliative care, or given up on because you have a lengthy or complex presentation. Palliative should be a collaborative decision never to be taken lightly and never used as an excuse to not continue to support or provide you with care. \n\nYour words highlight to me that you still have that inner fight to reclaim a life worth living, hold onto that, and whilst I know it can feel impossible to advocate for yourself you are allowed to need different care, tailored care, person centric care. You aren\u2019t your disorder or labels, you deserve the right to heal and find a life that\u2019s more than just enduring.",

He was fine with it, and I proceeded to apply it for some time. \n\nSome of the content came from articles I found in studies accessible online and similar information sources. I cannot locate those with ease given they were saved on a device I no longer own. \n\nSome of the titles do not focus on SEEDs, but I likely found something that led to saving the book long-term. At the time I approached it this way I had restrictive anorexia nervosa, but I know most have info about binge purge subtype. I'd say they're generally lacking in terms of atypical anorexia nervosa. \n\nI also obtained information from content related to harm reduction in drug use and applied similar guidelines. Likewise, I looked at medical, none eating disorder focused texts that included information related to complications I personally experienced (ranging from dietary deficiencies and osteoporosis to impact of malnutrition on other conditions I was diagnosed with). I won't know which specific books these were offhand. \n\nI apologize given the list is likely incomplete, but will list what I can:\n\n\u2022The Oxford Handook of Eating Disorders\n\n\u2022 Severe and Enduring Eating Disorder: Management of Complex Anorexia and Bulimia Nervosa\n\n\u2022 Medical Management of Eating Disorders\n\n\u2022 Critical Care for Anorexia Nervosa: Marsipan Guidelines \n\n\u2022 Behavioral Neurobiology of Eating Disorders \n\n\u2022 Neurobiology in the Treatment of Eating Disorders \n\n\u2022 Anorexia Nervosa: Symptoms, Treatment, and Neurobiology \n\n\u2022 Tipping the Scales: Ethical and Legal Dilemmas in managing Severe Eating Disorders\n\nThose are the only ones I still have downloaded. I hope you are able to find something of help in one of them. I used methods from different types of therapy I was aware of either through reading or treatment, too. \n\nIf you are able to find and obtain a provider who works with SEEDs, i recommend that route first.",
