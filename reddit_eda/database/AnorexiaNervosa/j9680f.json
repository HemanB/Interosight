  "selftext": "i tagged this as a tw just because i didn\u2019t want to accidentally trigger somebody, but it\u2019s really more of a question.\n\nfor me, it\u2019s always been having a flat stomach. i live in england and i\u2019m 15 so i\u2019m in my last year of high school, but anyways we have to wear a uniform. on friday the school wore non uniform for charity and lots of people showed up in low rise jeans, figure hugging dresses and skirts etc. i found myself subconsciously looking at their flat stomachs and telling myself that if i carry on restricting then i can look like that too. but when i realised that i was doing it i always felt really really bad. idk. it\u2019s not really that much of a question but i don\u2019t have anyone i can talk to this kind of stuff about lol",

Til one day, she made a long fb post, revealing that she suffered from ED for many years... I could NOT believe it... I reached out to her immediately to tell her and she was SHOCKED someone was even considering her thinspo! I felt so bad, but we connected and she\u2019s the only girl I know that I can talk to about ED struggles",

We idealize a certain shape and features of people. It\u2019s not your fault. Just remember they probably struggle with body image too. There\u2019s not too many people that do not struggle with it in some form. There\u2019s so much pressure on us to be someone other than ourselves. So much pressure to be \u201cperfect\u201d when perfect does not exist.",
