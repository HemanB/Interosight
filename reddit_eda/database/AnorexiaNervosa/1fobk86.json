  "title": "What is something about anorexia you wish others would try to understand?",
  "selftext": "There are a lot of misconceptions about anorexia. One thing I wish other people would try to understand is that a person who suffers from anorexia is in pain, whether that is physical, mental or emotional. They did not wake up one day and choose to starve themselves. And they are not doing it to look a certain way or because of vanity. It is not about vanity. It's about being in pain and feeling bad about yourself and you don't know how to cope with it, other than to restrict your food intake and lose weight. Even if you reach a very low weight, you still feel unhappy with yourself. So I wish people who have never suffered from this illness would try to be more compassionate to those who have it. It is not an easy disorder to cure and the person going through the illness needs support and understanding, not harsh judgements and criticism. ",

The only reason I ever started recovery was because I moved here (with my grandma).\nI was so out of control in the end. I remember seeing blood in my vomit, telling myself I was never going to do something like that again. Found myself back in the bathroom the next day.\nI woke up in the middle of the night because I felt like I couldn't breathe. Constantly checking my heart rate and blood pressure. Heart rate in the 30s and I couldn't bring myself to start recovery.\nIn the end I wanted to stop more than anything but I genuinely couldn't stick to it. \nI hate the idea that everything is within your control, maybe some aspects are. But i really don't think I was to blame for it getting as bad as it did. I didn't feel sick. I never saw how bad it had gotten until two months ago when I looked back at old photos, remembered small snippets of that time,\nRealised the last seven years of my life have been a  blur, the last year even more so. I hate the idea that eating disorders are voluntary. That they're something you can choose to have and then choose to snap out of. \n\n\nAnother one, I think, is a pretty obvious one.\n That it's not about weight. That lower weights dont make you more valid. Ive had an eating disorder for 7 years, only in the last year was I ever underweight. \n\nONE year, out of seven, did I fit the stupid criteria for a diagnosis and, even then, from what I've seen about the NHS ED services, sometimes even that underweight BMI means nothing to them unless you're about to die.\n\nI was sick before I was underweight and the years of trying to fit the stupid criteria destroyed my health so much so that when I reached what was borderline underweight my body was having none of it and started genuinely failing on me where some people can get to BMI 11 and have fairly little issue. \nThe lower my weight got past that, the worse I felt physically.\nIt's so stupid to look at weight when, clearly, my body felt uncomfortable even being near the underweight category. \nThey're so incredibly personal and where people can stay alive for months,even years, in a sickeningly low bmi, I personally don't think I would've survived past 14. When you put so much emphasis on something so stupid, you make people sicker.\n You draw out their illness for longer, you essentially give them a death sentence when you don't act immediately. I'm so lucky to be in recovery and I'm so lucky that I didn't leave it until it was too late and that my mind wasn't starved beyond convincing.\n\n I think the eating disorder statistic is bullshit. I think Recovery potential is much higher than what is shown. I think people are just not given the resources and environment to recover. I think people aren't given the chance.",

So snarky comments about how little I'm eating or how bad I look are counterproductive, they make me feel worse and eat less as a result. \n\nThat I don't feel a sense of superiority over people with other eating disorders, or overweight people, or people who eat a normal (or larger than normal) amount. \"If you think you're fat then you must think I'm huuuuge\" is not how it works. Also that most underweight people with long term AN are aware that they're thin, at least on some level, but that doesn't take away the obsessions or the attachment to the ED as a coping mechanism. Telling me \"you know you're not fat at all right\" does nothing. \n\nThat I'm suffering too and that relapses aren't some kind of shameless self-indulgence at the expense of the people around me. \n\nThat \"warning\" me about the risk of \"going too far in the other direction\" during a recovery attempt is one of the most harmful things you could possibly do to someone who has an obsessive fear of that exact thing.",

The only reason I ever started recovery was because I moved here (with my grandma).\nI was so out of control in the end. I remember seeing blood in my vomit, telling myself I was never going to do something like that again. Found myself back in the bathroom the next day.\nI woke up in the middle of the night because I felt like I couldn't breathe. Constantly checking my heart rate and blood pressure. Heart rate in the 30s and I couldn't bring myself to start recovery.\nIn the end I wanted to stop more than anything but I genuinely couldn't stick to it. \nI hate the idea that everything is within your control, maybe some aspects are. But i really don't think I was to blame for it getting as bad as it did. I didn't feel sick. I never saw how bad it had gotten until two months ago when I looked back at old photos, remembered small snippets of that time,\nRealised the last seven years of my life have been a  blur, the last year even more so. I hate the idea that eating disorders are voluntary. That they're something you can choose to have and then choose to snap out of. \n\n\nAnother one, I think, is a pretty obvious one.\n That it's not about weight. That lower weights dont make you more valid. Ive had an eating disorder for 7 years, only in the last year was I ever underweight. \n\nONE year, out of seven, did I fit the stupid criteria for a diagnosis and, even then, from what I've seen about the NHS ED services, sometimes even that underweight BMI means nothing to them unless you're about to die.\n\nI was sick before I was underweight and the years of trying to fit the stupid criteria destroyed my health so much so that when I reached what was borderline underweight my body was having none of it and started genuinely failing on me where some people can get to BMI 11 and have fairly little issue. \nThe lower my weight got past that, the worse I felt physically.\nIt's so stupid to look at weight when, clearly, my body felt uncomfortable even being near the underweight category. \nThey're so incredibly personal and where people can stay alive for months,even years, in a sickeningly low bmi, I personally don't think I would've survived past 14. When you put so much emphasis on something so stupid, you make people sicker.\n You draw out their illness for longer, you essentially give them a death sentence when you don't act immediately. I'm so lucky to be in recovery and I'm so lucky that I didn't leave it until it was too late and that my mind wasn't starved beyond convincing.\n\n I think the eating disorder statistic is bullshit. I think Recovery potential is much higher than what is shown. I think people are just not given the resources and environment to recover. I think people aren't given the chance.",
