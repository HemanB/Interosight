It acts like your support and controls everything and let\u2019s you think you\u2019re extremely fit and skinny. To me it shows the side of recovery when 80% of you is still overtaken by your eating disorder, yet the other 20% just wants to be free (figure on the right)",

      "body": "I see this as anorexia being a demon that grasps onto you during your darkest time. You can see that anorexia is unhealthy, based on the similarities in the appearances of the two people here. Sometimes it feels like you\u2019re unable to break free, even though anorexia might not always have such a tight grasp on you, as shown by the way anorexia is holding the person. The person looks exhausted, but also relaxed in a way. Almost like they are unwillingly accepting that anorexia has latched onto them, and now there\u2019s no way for them to break free at this point because they\u2019re so exhausted and tired, based on the presentation of their body, and the dark circles around their eyes. The colour gradient of red and blue represent two different sides. Almost like a dark and a light force. Anorexia is closer the red side of the painting, whereas the person is closer to the blue side. You see the red bleeding into the blue, indicating that anorexia is not just a physical presence, but the environment around the individual is also tainted by anorexia. Not only is it an internal experience, it\u2019s an external experience that impacts the way they see the world. I would almost argue that the blue, in my eyes, is representative of feelings of depression. For me, anorexia resulted in depression and anger, and I often act irrationally at times. That irrationality is fuelled by the anorexia, but anorexia was a result of the depression. So it\u2019s like the depression is transitioning into the eating disorder. Not sure if that makes sense.",
