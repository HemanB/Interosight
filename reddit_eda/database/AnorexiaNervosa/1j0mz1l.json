Anyway, the lack of movement plus the perceived notion that I was eating more made me feel like I\u2019d gained weight. What I did was try on a pair of pants to sort of see if it was real or not. Spoiler alert \u2014 they actually fit better and slightly looser. It was slightly upsetting to see the extent of my distortion, but I remind myself that it\u2019s just that: disordered perception. \n\nI will discuss it with my therapists this week. That often helps!",
