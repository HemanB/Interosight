  "selftext": "anytime I'm eating with people outside my immediate family, I feel like my brain is screaming at me. \"don't hold your fork like that, sit straight, that's too big of a bite!! don't look sloppy!!\". I avoid certain foods in public because I know I'll look dumb or gross eating them.\n\nand this isn't like a constant thing when I'm around people, it's specifically when eating. I have terrible posture and don't really care unless I'm eating, I don't care how I'm holding stuff unless I'm eating.",
