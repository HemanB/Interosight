  "selftext": "It took me 8 years to get to this weight. 8 long years and today when I finally saw the number on the scale I had my soul crushed. I thought all my problems will go away. I thought I will be loved more, somehow in my silly brain I thought I would be calmer to be a better mom, more confident at job. I thought that number will ground me down, make me better in life. What a scam, I feel so dead inside, all these problems are still there and I know, going down in weight will only make things harder but then without anorexia how do I even attempt to exist? \n\nPlease, anyone who still feels they still can stop, I am telling you, it is the best thing you can do for yourself. Stop and get help now, before it is too late \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n\n",

I can't say much or give advice, as I am actively in relapse, but I encourage you to take care of yourself. Counseling is another good first step, and though it's not a cure, over time you can learn to accept and like yourself better just as you are. It's not a cure by any means, and it's a lifelong struggle, speaking from one who's been in and out of therapy since 2010 and still struggles with low self worth, but it can help. I wish you the best. Take care.",
