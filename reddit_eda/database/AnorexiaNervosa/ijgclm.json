  "selftext": "When I was younger about 10 or so. Whenever my cousins would come over, our moms would have me and my cousin stand side by side and show them our stomachs. Then they would comment to who they thought was skinnier. I still remember my mom saying how I was smaller and look you can see her ribs. So I won the skinny contest and felt proud. Now that I'm older and dealing with my ED, just makes me so sad.",

I went through that too. My oldest sister (13 years older than me) would often fat shame me, tell me I need to stop eating. This started when I was around 10, so she was 23. And then shame my other sisters also who were 11 and 13. So we all suffered eating disorders that landed us in the hospital from our older sisters constant ridicule. Saying she was skinnier than us, and going much much further than that, it was painful to go through what she put us through. Now she's using meth and cocain and lost a lot of weight and still shames us for being fat. I'm 19 now. And it still hurts. Even words she said when I was little stick with me and fuel my ED. (we are all 3 in recovery). \n\n\nAbusers don't stop, you have to try and beat those memories and the abuse still occurring by overcoming and getting help. Its hard, and you all need to remember that it is not your fault. Nothing is. But youre stronger than that even if you don't feel that way, and remember that there's always people out there who care about you, even if we don't know you. Because when you talk openly like this, you're creating your own little support system. And you need to know that it's always there for you. I learned that later than I would've liked. \n\n\nBut don't ever stop sharing your feelings. There's someone out there who loves you. And i don't know you, or your cousins, but i sincerely care about your recovery from ED and abuse and would love to see a fellow struggler thrive. \n\n\nRemember that there's always a home for you out there \u2764",
