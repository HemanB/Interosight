Try and make each moment into the best you possibly can. Ask yourself what is the best and most fun thing you can do right now that may bring you joy? Even if it's something simple like coloring in or doing a puzzle, having a little chat with someone there, whatever. All the best and all my love to you, you're going to be a-ok I promise.

I was one of the largest people inpatient and I completely know how stressful and triggering it can feel. Like I felt like I wasn\u2019t supposed to be there, like I wasn\u2019t valid in my sickness. But listen: they admitted you. The doctors deemed that you needed that level of care. So regardless of how it feels internally, you both NEED and DESERVE to be there getting help. You\u2019re ED is no less valid than the other patients, regardless of if they seem comparitvly \u201csmaller\u201d or \u201csicker\u201d. You are NOT a fraud. Again, I completely understand those feelings, I had the same ones, but in reality we have distorted views of our bodies to begin with, and fact is if you didn\u2019t need to be inpatient, you wouldn\u2019t have been admitted. It\u2019s hard to be out of your comfort zone, I hope there is some kind of self care you can do that can help you feel more at ease..maybe writing or drawing or music? Stay strong \ud83d\udc9c",
