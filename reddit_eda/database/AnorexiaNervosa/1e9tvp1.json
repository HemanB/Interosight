For me, the weight loss came very gradually, because I have hypoglycemia and have to eat every few hours to prevent myself from passing out.\n\nAt age 26, I broke up with my long-term boyfriend and moved into a place of my own. For the first time in my life, I didn't have anyone monitoring my food intake or influencing my eating habits. As a result, my weight dropped rapidly, and a year later I became so sick that I had to be hospitalized.\n\nI spent the next 110 days at a rehabilitation center and was fortunate enough to work with a very talented team of doctors, nutritionists, and psychologists. They taught me how to cope with my depression in healthy ways, helped me rebuild my self-esteem, and opened my eyes to the insidious nature of \"diet culture\", which made me rethink my relationship with food and also with myself. I'm not exaggerating when I say they saved my life.\n\nI'm now 37-years old and consider myself mostly recovered. There are still days where I struggle with intrusive thoughts, but they're nowhere near as intense as they were a decade ago. Obviously, not everyone is going to have the same results that I've had, but I recommend that everyone try in-patient treatment at least once, if given the option.",
