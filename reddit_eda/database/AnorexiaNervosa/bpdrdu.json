  "title": "Finally hit 100 lbs!!!",
  "selftext": "I've been struggling with anorexia since I was 16. I was hospitalized when my weight was in the 80s, but honestly, nobody knew what to do with me. Twenty years later I found myself less than 90 lbs again. I looked awful and I felt awful. In February of this year, I made a promise to myself to gain weight and look good!! I drank naked high protein drinks, full fat yogurts, peanut butter, eggs, etc. I am now 100 lbs and love how I look and feel. Being 5'3, my healthy BMI states my weight should be 107 so I still have some weight to gain. But boy, do I feel soooo much better! I've been struggling with this disease more than half of my life. Thankfully I always knew how skinny I looked, I just didn't know how to \"fix\" it. There was no therapy, no meds to reach my goals. I just promised myself to eat a certain amount of calories each day (like 2500-3000.) Sometimes it's hard to do the opposite of what 90 percent of the population is doing (trying to lose weight,) but us skinny people need to be supported as well! Just thought I would let people know that the fight isn't easy, but being healthy is certainly worth it\ud83d\ude0a",
