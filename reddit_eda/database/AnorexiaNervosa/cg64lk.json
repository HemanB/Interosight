This meal looks amazing and would be a wonderful lunch to sustain someone through the day. Especially a person who works a desk job and doesn\u2019t burn many calories throughout their day.  \nMy job is active and I struggle to consume the calories needed to sustain my energy exertion.  Still, I don\u2019t think my physic at my age is any more unhealthy than the women who have put on 30-50 pounds during their 20\u2019s.\n\n*Edit for grammar",
