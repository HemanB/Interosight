It\u2019s water soluble so you can\u2019t accidentally poison yourself by taking too much, which mattered because I also take a multivitamin. I talked to a pharmacist to help sure it wouldn\u2019t react with my medications\u2026 please always verify with your doctor or pharmacist because medication interactions can be really bad!! I also started using [this hair serum](https://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-care/shop-by-solution/hair-thinning-and-hair-loss/extremely-thin-hair-serum-treatment/SBS-623818.html) that a friend who went to cosmetology school recommended. The other thing isn\u2019t really much for advice, but it\u2019d be disingenuous not to add that I started doing a bit better financially so I was able to eat better foods. Restriction when you can afford produce is definitely a different game entirely",

I actually only have a buzz cut because it was falling out so fast and it was just making me panic every time a hair fell so I buzzed it so it\u2019d be easier to live with. It\u2019s funny because I\u2019d have never ever dreamed of shaving my head and like I wear a wig when I go out, but I actually don\u2019t hate it buzzed. I actually seriously recommend it! Super easy!!",
