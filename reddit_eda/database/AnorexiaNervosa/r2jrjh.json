I want to starve myself not to be physically small, but emotionally so. \n\nI want to starve myself to show people that I'm not doing well with my illnesses, that I'm overwhelmed and need help. That I'm miserable and depressed. Being smaller has always gotten me more attention. I want to starve myself back into hospital. I want to be seen as sick, rather than \"strong\" because I am not strong. I cannot cope. I need help. Therefore I will stop eating.",

Therapy can really help the roots of feeling like you need to externalize your pain to be believed and sympathized with. Instead of trying to get yourself into the hospital with your ED, can you ask for professional help to address your chronic suicidality and your need to use self-harm as a coping mechanism? I haven't learned the skill of self-validation yet myself, but it's possible to learn how to do that and how to safely express your pain to get your needs met.",
