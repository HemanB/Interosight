  "selftext": "Your goal weight will never be enough and you will want to set it lower. You will never be satisfied. No number you reach will bring you happiness\n\nYou never stop thinking about what you are going to eat that day or your weight. You can't switch off the disorder once you get tired of it. \n\nSooner or later, people in your life will notice a change in your health and behavior and say something to you or express concern, even encouraging you to get treatment.\n\nIt's not glamorous. The side effects are awful. One of the worst side effects of anorexia I have now is the fact that it's messed up my bladder so badly that I experience painful and frequent urination. The pain is constant and so far, I have not been able to find treatment for this symptom. This symptom keeps me staying at home. It's also worsened my depression and anxiety. But I had no idea anorexia could cause bladder issues. I would encourage people to read more about anorexia and bladder issues, because when I was younger, I didn't know about this side effect. Malnutrition will affect your body in ways you don't always think about, until it happens to you\n\nAnorexia has the highest mortality rate of any mental illness. Whether you have had the disorder for a few years or 18 years, it's deadly and requires treatment\n\nYou don't have to be hospitalized to be suffering greatly. There are people who have severe anorexia who aren't in a hospital. It's just not something that everyone finds helpful. At the time of my last hospitalizations, which were years ago, I had a few medical issues but they weren't painful. And as soon as I began the refeeding process, they went away. But my obsession with losing weight did not and only grew worse. Not every person with anorexia wants to be hospitalized. Even though my medical complications are worse now than before, the idea of going back to inpatient causes me a great deal of anxiety. \n\nYou don't have to have a feeding tube to be considered sick enough. I've never had one and the idea of having one scares me. If you are starving yourself and worrying constantly over what you can and cannot eat, you are sick. You don't have to prove anything to anyone. If you are suffering, you are suffering. You don't have to get to a certain weight or wind up with a feeding tube to be considered ill. Everyone with this illness experiences it differently and hurts in their own ways. \n\nEven if you go through inpatient treatment and years of therapy, you may still find yourself struggling with disordered thoughts and behaviors. While some people will make a full recovery from this, other people will become chronic and find it hard to let go of the illness completely\n\nRecovery can take years, and relapse after getting treatment is common. This is not an easy disorder to cure. \n\nEating more food doesn't just make the illness go away. \n\nPeople who suffer from this disorder aren't being vain and it's not just about being skinny or wanting to look a certain way. It's a devastating mental illness that affects everything in the person's life and everyone who cares about that person. It's not a weight loss method or a diet. It is a dangerous disorder which requires support from a team of people who know how to treat it\n\nIt is common for a person suffering from anorexia to be in denial at the beginning of their disorder. But eventually, the person recognizes they have a problem. But asking a person with anorexia to \"just eat\" is not helpful and won't cure them. \n\n",

Eating/normalising weight might have made me somewhat physically better at some point, but the mental stuff idk how to resolve that. I\u2019ve tried many therapists etc but ???\n\nI also don\u2019t want to go back to hospital bc it was traumatic, but now my team is mentioning it and I\u2019m scared as hell bc it doesn\u2019t feel like it will resolve anything, just patch me up medically and throw me out. \n\nI don\u2019t feel very well, but I have this urge to just lose a bit more weight. Situation feels utterly fucked\n\nI often feel like there\u2019s no way out and the only way to be at peace is to\u2026not be here",

I have been struggling so much and fighting with myself about whether I am \u201csick enough\u201d or not. \n\nI made the call and signed myself up for treatment and see a doctor/psych/dietician on a weekly basis out patient but now when they show concern I just feel like everyone is being dramatic. \u201cI\u2019m not losing weight, my labs are fine, I\u2019m alive, so like what the big deal?\u201d Is kind of my thought process. Yet I signed myself up for this? I keep going back?  I make these plans and goals with my care team and simply just don\u2019t follow through with them. They are really pushing for partial but I realistically cannot do that right now. So if outpatient isn\u2019t working, should I just stop and try again in the future? I truly could really use some advice or words of encouragement.",

You deserve to feel better. I can understand how an illness like anorexia wants to convince you that you aren't sick enough, but you deserve support. And you aren't alone in feeling the way you feel. I also have times where I feel like I can't stick to treatment. But I am still going to all my appointments. It's a tough illness to fight. I wish I could provide more helpful advice, but I just want to say your feelings are valid",
