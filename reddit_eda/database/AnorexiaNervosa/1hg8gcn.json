It's like I'm thinking 'I've done all this hard work and put myself through to much' I need someone to know. All I think about is being small and losing weight so when I can see it I feel such peace. Maybe it's like an outward expression of what I'm thinking on the inside. It sounds so bad and so vain but I'd be lying if I said the weight doesn't give me deep satisfaction when I can see it. \n\nHide consciously - If I'm with family I don't want to advertise what I know they worry about. I don't want to make them concerned or feel like I'm showing off to them what has brought our family so much misery. And of course if I'm having a bad body image day I'll dress this way. \n\nHide subconsciously - My style is very long skirts, tights, lots of layers and long cardigans which makes sense as it's so cold and I hate feeling cold even slightly but I wonder if I do it subconsciously to hide away. No one can make any opinions about what size I am if I'm covered up. \n\nI never know what I really think half the time so I might disagree with these by tomorrow.",

I suppose it's because despite wearing tight and small clothes, the most \"concerning\" looking parts of my body weren't visible unless I was naked or wearing a bathing suit. Now, my face looks a lot sicker than it did then (due to this having been going for a year and a half now, rather than just a few months -- even though my weight is up, my fat hasn't redistributed so my face looks much thinner, I'm paler/look exhausted 24/7, and have more hair loss).",
