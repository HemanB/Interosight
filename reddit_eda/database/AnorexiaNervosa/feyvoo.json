  "selftext": "Look, I see myself as beautiful. I never developed anorexia because of my physical appearance. I developed anorexia because it terrified me to watch a loved ones' health decline due to weight gain.\n\nANOREXIA IS NOT JUST SELF ESTEEM BASED.\n\nI'm much more focused on my health than most people (My psychologist said that anyhow), and I'm so afraid of my health deteriorating due to being fat. Nobody understands that I don't have issues with my body image, I've learned to love and embrace my insecurities. Nobody understands that I have anorexia out of fear. I'm not anorexic because I want others to see me as beautiful, I'm anorexic because I'm so overly concious of my health that it fucked up my thought process.\n\nI mean, I get it, a lot of 14yo's have self esteem issues, but you can't just assume that these issues are because of that. It hurts more and more to be told I'm beautiful how I am, it just makes me feel like looks are more important than anything else. I just want to be told he'll be okay in the end, that's all",

It\u2019s in the diagnostic criteria of AN to have an extreme fear of being fat and/or being in denial about your body shape despite being severely underweight (I\u2019m paraphrasing bc my DSM-5 is across the room lol), but it definitely isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s experience. For me it wasn\u2019t until I was underweight that I started to have disordered thoughts related to body shape and even then I don\u2019t feel like that was my primary cause for restricting. It\u2019s always always always been related to my anxiety. \n\nIt makes me wonder if I really have anorexia or if I just happen to meet the diagnostic criteria but in reality have some other type of disordered eating that there isn\u2019t a diagnosis for yet. (I\u2019m not self-diagnosed btw & I\u2019ve had these discussions with my psychiatrist) But I have to acknowledge its name (whether it be a placeholder or not) so that I can overcome it.",
