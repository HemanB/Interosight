I\u2019m like always covered in hair because i keep losing it. \n\nSorry for the rant but I see so many people claiming that anorexia is \u201cback\u201d and making it a trend. This is the truth of this terrible disorder that has been ruining my life in every single aspect. My hair used to be my pride, the best part of my body. And now i am basically balding at 21. \nBut those pro ana weirdos won\u2019t show you this. ",
