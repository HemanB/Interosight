I love them, I really do, but for heavens sake they have no fucking idea what it\u2019s like to be anorexic and be surrounded by foods you don\u2019t even want to think about being around. \n\nThe cherry on top of the cake is being forced/pushed to eat fear foods, people need to understand that if you know someone who is suffering from ANY eating disorder, do not think it\u2019s okay to socially pressure them into eating if they don\u2019t want to, and DO NOT comment on them as a person with things like \u201cShe/He/They never eats\u201d \n\nJust back the hell off.\n\nEdit: I would like to change this from the original title to \u201cNever EVER force people to eat if they don\u2019t want to.\u201d",

I\u2019ve had issues with people watching me eat because of this super traumatic thing when I was 7, so even if I didn\u2019t have a restrictive ED it would have fucked me up. I couldn\u2019t even manage to eat at school until the end of high school over that, like forcing me to eat (especially while being watched) was bullshit. \n\nMy sister used to buy me high-calorie snack foods and give me a due date. Like here\u2019s one of those like 2 foot tall tubs of cheese balls, have it gone Friday. I had mixed feelings about that because on one hand she asked if I wanted her help and I said yes, but on the other using guilt from people spending money on me to make me eat sucked. Especially because she gave me such unrealistic deadlines! Like my sister actually has BED, so it was really extra difficult because neither of us had any idea how much humans are supposed to eat",

I think my brain has locked that memory away for good, but your post reminds me that what she did really was insensitive and there could have been a better way to coax me into eating more than just forcing me to eat. I\u2019m lucky enough to not be traumatised and can eat anything I want now. The people around us mean the best for us, but we need our time to recover too.",
