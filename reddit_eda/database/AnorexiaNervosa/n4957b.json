Like I used to be a grade A student but after my ED, I am failing all my subjects even though I\u2019m working twice as hard???\n\nI was only dangerously underweight for about 4 months but I feel like it\u2019s taken such a huge toll on my intelligence already??\nI\u2019ve also noticed my interests are more childish than they used to be (mlp, stuffed animals etc...) it\u2019s as if my brain is regressing from the starvation???\n\nWill I ever be smart or even average again or am I doomed to be a dumbass forever because of what I did to myself last year??",

Partly because I never recover, I just freak out totally because I could not talk, I could not learn or understand anything new, I told everything like 5 times to my friend when she was over visiting me. All my energy went to make food, the tiny amount I was having and that was fucking scary. I desided I needed to start eating more or i would end up hospitalized as an adult which is a thing I don't want. Now I weight more, hate it, I am probably going to do same mistakes again \ud83e\udd21",

When I was still on a low weight, I was really.. well, stupid:))\nI really just cared about my performance in sports and calories, so not only had my intelligence gone downhill, but emotional intelligence too. No empathy, I was just really unhappy - which is totally against my nature, I laugh all the time now.. but being on healthy weight and not excercising all the time (recovered for year and a half, with some ups and downs) has helped me - I feel bit more bright again, so don\u2019t give up on yourself. It should get better, and of course your brain is a muscle too, so not sure if you\u2019re a student now, but learning languages and such could help you get back at it again... and helps building up your confidence through smth else than your body:)\nBest of luck!
