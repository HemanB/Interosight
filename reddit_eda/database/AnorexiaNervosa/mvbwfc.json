      "body": "This struck a chord with me. I\u2019m at the higher end of my weight again and I feel like shit. I want to start restricting again to get back down because I\u2019ve gained so much during recovery, but I don\u2019t want to relapse. I don\u2019t want to feel faint and lethargic all the time again, but I hate having this extra weight. On top of that, I\u2019m seeing my family again in a few weeks for the first time in two years and I don\u2019t want to be the same weight as when they last saw me. I hate feeling like this; I just want to be able to maintain my goal weight healthily, but I can\u2019t afford to buy a bunch of healthy food on my budget. I also don\u2019t like cooking, so even if I had healthy food I would opt for quick options. I wish it were easier and affordable to be healthy and I could stop feeling like shit about myself.",
