I remember before my ED when I was a little kid I would eat as much as everyone around me, especially at frequent family gatherings where me and my cousins would drink cup after cup of soda or eat a bunch of dessert or ice cream and eat all the burgers we\u2019d want with no guilt. I miss that because even now that I\u2019m trying to recover from my ED, I still feel slightly repulsed by the idea of eating large amounts of food and I\u2019m just really not interested sometimes. I have to force myself to eat enough to gain weight. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to be able to get to a place of truly loving food again. It makes me kinda sad. I miss who I used to be and I\u2019m jealous of my cousins who thankfully never thought too much about food or developed EDs. I would do anything to go back to who I used to be and not worry. \ud83d\ude14",
