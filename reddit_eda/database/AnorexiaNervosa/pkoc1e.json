It's depressing to see and both know that the only reason I'm being accepted is because of my E.D \nIt makes me fearful of ever gaining weight.",

      "body": "Aww.. it can be hard I know to look at it this way, but instead of seeing it as you being \u201cused,\u201d instead that you have a greater spotlight on you. \n\nThis can give you an opportunity to shine the greatest qualities in your heart even for a second to others. It will make you feel so much better. Like in your head your kindness to them will constantly be reminding you \u201cI\u2019m not just pretty.. I\u2019m not just skinny.. I love others, and that\u2019s what makes me special.\u201d \n\nYou may be beautiful on the outside yes\u2026<3 but by making a mark on someone\u2019s life with your qualities or kindness, will not make you feel like you are being used. But that you are living a purpose. They will start to admire you for more than your exterior<3 \n\nThe Rose Song by Olivia Rodrigo talks about this. It heals me every time I go through this. Reminds me to be humble. And thankful to turn it around as a positive. If people are looking at me, you, more, you are being given a role to uplift others in a beautiful way<3",

      "body": "100% my life right now. People in general are so much nicer to me. Also..As sweet as he is don't truly think my bf would like me or have gone for me if I was at the weight I was before this (24kg heavier) which is the weight I've been most of my adult life. I'm considered cute, funnier. Not just in the background. I think I was always somewhat pretty and my weight sat \"well\" (and being thicker is in, or has been?) but yeah.. wow the difference. I totally relate to feeling so wierd about it, in a way I know I should be happy? But I feel the same intense fear that if I ever gain the weight back (or any weight back) that this all goes away.\nAlso it's just kind of sick that this positivity has come from something that's been such a dark place and struggle for me. Plus, when people comment on how much better I look it's fucking painful because all I hear is wow I must have looked a bit shit before then I guess? Ouch",

But in reality they probably don\u2019t.  \u2026 hopefully.  I\u2019m not saying people don\u2019t treat people differently based on appearance. They totally do. But I also think 70% of it is actually your confidence and comfort in your own body finally. \nAnd it really saddens me that so many of us see starvation as the only way.    \n\nI don\u2019t have a positive takeaway here.
