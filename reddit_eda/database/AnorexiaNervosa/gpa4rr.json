  "selftext": "A part of me thinks I\u2019m getting thinner like I want and a part of me doesn\u2019t. I know I\u2019ve lost weight but I don\u2019t want to weigh myself because I feel like I\u2019ll be upset no matter how much weight I\u2019ve lost/haven\u2019t lost. I just want to be \u201cnormal\u201d again and lose weight the healthy way but I feel like I\u2019ll never be able to get back to that mindset. I\u2019m at a healthy weight right now but for some reason I can\u2019t stop with all the negative self-talk and seeing myself as fat. \n\nThis is going to sound so bad, and it might possibly be triggering, so fair warning: \n\nI know I\u2019m an attractive person. Not because that\u2019s what I think, but because I see how others react to me. I get hit on a lot and will notice when others check me out in public. I\u2019ve had many boyfriends and girlfriends (I\u2019m bisexual) and I have a natural hourglass figure; small waist, big butt, big boobs. My current boyfriend worships me and always gives me compliments on my appearance (as well as other things) and that reassures me. I\u2019m just so confused; If other people think I\u2019m \u201chot\u201d the way I am now, why do I only see myself as this fat and undesirable person?\n\nI just want to be at a lower weight, but a part of me feels like I\u2019ll never be satisfied and I\u2019ll always come up with a new \u201clow\u201d once I reach the old one, if that makes sense. \n\nI think one of the reasons I can\u2019t stop starving myself is because I am absolutely terrified of gaining weight. A couple years ago I was at my highest, and most unhealthy, weight and I was able to lose it all and then some, and I\u2019ve realized that my biggest fear is gaining it all back. The thought of getting bigger terrifies me and I\u2019m not happy with how I look now so the only solution in my mind is to get smaller. \n\nIf you took the time to read this, and maybe you feel some of the same things I do, know that you\u2019re not alone. Our situations we\u2019re in truly suck and we don\u2019t deserve it, but I\u2019m hoping we will get through it together. :,)",
