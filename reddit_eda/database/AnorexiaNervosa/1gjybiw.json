  "title": "The anorexia euphoric high ",
  "selftext": "Some days, very rarely, I will be hit with a string of days or a day where I feel literally high from my anorexia. But I know deep down it\u2019s because I am deep in the addiction of the ED. When I feel my clothes fitting looser, when I see my body getting smaller it\u2019s the only thing that truly gives me this drug like high. I\u2019m not proud of this, but I know it\u2019s stemming from addiction. As folks with Ed\u2019s we are in an active addiction, just not to a substance, we\u2019re addicted to feelings and sensations and habits and behaviors. Sometimes I even think I am a food addict, like I\u2019m \u201caddicted\u201d to my healthy low calorie sugar free orthorexic safe foods, but is it really food addiction or is it actually because my body and mind are starved and malnourished. So when I do finally work myself up to eating, it makes me feel high too. Like the safe foods make me feel high. It feels like I enjoy food too much even if it\u2019s low grade stupid safe foods that any normal person would not enjoy whatsoever.  Eating has become something I dread and simultaneously look forward to as if it\u2019s the highlight of my day while it\u2019s also the darkness of my night because eating comes with chaos and panic and discomfort and purging and overwhelm. It\u2019s like nothing I do has any outcome of winning. I try to eat more and that backfires into potential weight gain and purging. I starve myself more and that gives me a false high and euphoria because of the addiction. Some days I am completely obsessed and fixated on food and what foods I want to eat or could eat and some days I have no hunger and food isn\u2019t on my mind at all. The highs and lows are similar to bipolar or Borderline personality disorder ",

I didn\u2019t think anyone else liked me either. I didn\u2019t think I was worthy of food. I had to learn to love myself no matter what state I was in- skinny, fat, awkward, lonely. And, I needed to learn to love others in their imperfections. I needed to just let go! I was a control freak. I began to see the beauty in the flaws and that made all the difference. I had to cut friendship ties- those that encouraged me not to eat or would only like me based on my outward appearance, but it was worth it. A number of years later, I\u2019ve reconnected with them and they\u2019re out of that phase. This is a hard thing to realize, but anorexia is no friend! Anorexia is a lying demonic bitch from the pit of hell- break free and stop listening!",

Now I am close to my LW, and I\u2019m wondering, when will people show concern. No one around me seems to care but I\u2019m also not around family, so I guess people just don\u2019t care. I am addicted to being a certain size, and feeling a certain way in my body. It\u2019s truly like drugs.",

There\u2019s so many full blown anorexic girls in the \u201chealth\u201d and wellness space and girls who are all about intermittent fasting and carnivore but deep down they are fucking just full blown Anorexic and trying to do anything they can to be as skinny as possible. Like just admit you have an Ed. It\u2019s almost easier to like someone if they just admit to having anorexia rather than covering it up with \u201cibs\u201d or crohsn or whatever the fuck. I\u2019d have more respect for someone who just says they have an Ed rather than painting it as a thing like crohns. Drives me fucking insane",
