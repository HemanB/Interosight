But if I hear someone I stop eating and try to put it somewhere no one will see. Once I even put a bowl on nachos under my pillow and ruined my pillow cases with the cheese. I was so scared of my sister seeing me eat... and do you find the word \"food\" to be unpleasant? Because I do. It feels shameful and like a bad word. I hate struggling so much. I understand your pain, and I am so sorry you have to have this burden. Hopefully we can both heal soon.",
