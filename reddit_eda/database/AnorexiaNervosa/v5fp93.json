When I was in residential treatment the vast majority of patients were actually older than I was. I think we see more teens/young 20s on social media talking about their EDs for a few reasons: they have more free time to do so (usually past the age of 23 you have a full time job), it\u2019s trendier for younger generations, and younger generations have less of a stigma surrounding taking about their illness publicly than older generations (especially Gen X/boomers). It\u2019s not that there are less \u201colder\u201d folks (we aren\u2019t old btw we\u2019re in our mid 20s lol) that are struggling w/ EDs, it\u2019s just that the loudest people tend to be younger than us rn, at least in online forums. \n\nBut you aren\u2019t alone, and you certainly aren\u2019t pathetic.",

I want a place to talk about struggles and share advice to other people *who have already surrendered completely to the disease.* Kids never, ever fall into that category.

Until something happened that triggered them. I started therapy and the more I talked about my past, the more my emotions and anxiety shut down my body and I couldn\u2019t eat. At first the weight loss made me feel strong. But once this disorder gets it\u2019s hooks in you, it\u2019s takes over. And now I am in a battle between what I know I need to do and what this disorder tells me I want to do. It\u2019s really hard to overcome. I can\u2019t imagine struggling with this as a teenager. Before you really even know who you are. I so admire the sheer courage and strength that it takes for anyone to beat it. For those in recovery, I am in awe of you.",
