  "selftext": "If I remove a post, it's because you broke a rule. Saying that we're \"your last outlet\" and guilt tripping me into unbanning, unmuting, etc., you will do absolutely nothing but irritate me. Insulting me will result in nothing good, either. \n\nThe last 10 people I had to have a conversation with? 90% guilt tripped me. We're not five year old children, here. We're all suffering from AN in some form or another, I get that, but the guilt tripping *has* to stop. \n\nFrom now on, guilt tripping after being told not to do so is just going to extend whatever sentence you've been given for breaking rules that are clearly stated. I'm tired of it, and I'm sure others are too. \n\nThank you for those that spend time writing thoughtful, helpful messages and tell others when they're breaking rules, and especially to those that report for rule 10 - the rule that people apparently hate. (It's not being removed >.>) I may not participate in general chat much but I do appreciate those that help others on here & make my job easier.  \u2764\ud83c\udf38 \n\nAnd for those that have absolutely nothing to do with this angry post about guilt trippers, I'm sorry that it's probably coming off agitated. Ignore it and continue on, you're doing great if you're not being a dick and not breaking rules(which, really, everyone should act like you guys).",
