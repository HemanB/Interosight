  "selftext": "After years of abusing my body, it\u2019s finally caught up to me. I\u2019ve struggled with an extremely weak bladder for such a long time and I just couldn\u2019t hold it in at all. As soon as I felt the need to go to the bathroom it was already too late by then. I tried my best to position myself and remove the blanket from me, but I know he knows. The first thing he said to me was \u201choly shit were you sweating a lot last night?\u201d. I had to lie and tell him that was why, but I\u2019m sure he could tell. Especially when he asked me to remove all the bedding to wash it. Thanks for ruining a potential third date anorexia.",
