  "selftext": "Obviously all of us know how competitive this disorder is and how it can severely mess with our perspective on bodies/eating. But I just need to admit something cause I feel so fucked up feeling this way.\n\n\nI struggle with anorexia, binge eating and bulimia. I have never recovered- only continued switching between each disorder throughout each phase of my life. \n\nThis year I have been binging and purging for the past few months due to uni stress and just eating my stress away- later purging because of the disgusting full feeling. \n\nI have relapsed back into ana- for a myriad of reasons, but one of them is because I\u2019ll be headed to Europe in a month. \n\nI am at a healthy weight right now, but I want to look slimmer. And one of the fucked up things is- I\u2019ll be meeting up with my cousin at one of my destinations and I know she\u2019s on the heavier side. And theres a sick part of me that wants to look good because I want her to envy me. \n\nI feel so fucking disgusting, because she\u2019s my cousin and I love her to death. Does anyone else go through this?? I just feel like I want to shower over and over again because I\u2019m so disgusted with myself. ",

I'm sort of in the opposite situation, I have three younger cousins (they're all siblings) with anorexia. they've all been incredibly severely underweight and in hospital. And it makes me so competitive it's horrible. I want to be worse than they ever were. Every time I see them I feel so pressured to restrict even more so that I can be skinner than them. and it's even more horrible that one of them is recovered and another is weight restored. What if me being smaller triggers them and they relapse? Yet I still feel this drive to be skinnier than them. They're all younger than me too and it makes me feel like such a failure because it's like they beat me to it? \n\nIt's really sad because including me, that makes 4 out of the 5 girls in this generation of my mum's family with AN. The only female cousin who doesn't have an ED is the youngest whose only 10. It terrifies me that she could pick up an ED too. It would hurt so much to see her go through that pain. It's not too long until she's a teenager as well and that seems to have been the age where the ED gene kicked in for me and the others. \n\nSorry for hijacking your post with a vent, but I just want you to know you're not alone. I wish I had better advice, but I hope you can take comfort in the fact that it doesn't mean you're a bad person at all. It's this horrible disease, it affects how we see everyone around us. It says nothing about you. Best wishes <3",
