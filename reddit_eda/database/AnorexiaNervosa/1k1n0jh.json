Also, obesity does not unequivocally equal negative health outcomes.

Did you just not know about that or did you try to mislead me on purpose? I wonder what kind of research you have been doing. Without experience or only with experience online doing research alone very often isn't reliable. To be fair my knowledge comes from online too if me studying psychology doesn't count",
