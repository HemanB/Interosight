If something is carb heavy one does avoid most of those carbs. \n\nThe problem with it is that it does kick off an insulin and salivary response. It's also poor for the teeth with sugary foods. \n\nIf you're going through a set amount of food that's one thing, or using it to get through a temporary bout of hunger until your jaws are tired or your mental state shifts that's also a thing, but if you keep going and going c/s-ing high sugar food until you feel satisfied you can get some portion of calories it just takes longer. \n\nWhen those AN do it, it can often be a calorie coping mechanism if the amount isn't huge. But for someone with a full on BN feast going on they can go through ginormous amounts of food this way.\n\nBack when I used to do this it was more of a last-resort mitigation effort that often was used to avoid a full load of calories but as it encourage me to be more willing to buy snack/junk food and I didn't like the over-consumption/food waste aspect of it I eventually stopped. And when I did buy more snack/junk food the chances are 60% I would just end up binging on it versus c/s-ing it.\n\nI used it as a \"restriction\" personally, and I think it's more fairly considered a restriction mechanism versus a type of purging/compensatory behavior but one could make the case either way.\n\nOverall it's not the focus of a lot of research and just sometimes noted as incidental to one's eating disorder:\n\n[https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40337-016-0115-1](https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40337-016-0115-1)\n\nI always considered it personally more of a \"side quest NPC\" sort of thing, and maybe others consider it the same as a reason it doesn't get specifically talked about much outside of very pro circles.",

If something is carb heavy one does avoid most of those carbs. \n\nThe problem with it is that it does kick off an insulin and salivary response. It's also poor for the teeth with sugary foods. \n\nIf you're going through a set amount of food that's one thing, or using it to get through a temporary bout of hunger until your jaws are tired or your mental state shifts that's also a thing, but if you keep going and going c/s-ing high sugar food until you feel satisfied you can get some portion of calories it just takes longer. \n\nWhen those AN do it, it can often be a calorie coping mechanism if the amount isn't huge. But for someone with a full on BN feast going on they can go through ginormous amounts of food this way.\n\nBack when I used to do this it was more of a last-resort mitigation effort that often was used to avoid a full load of calories but as it encourage me to be more willing to buy snack/junk food and I didn't like the over-consumption/food waste aspect of it I eventually stopped. And when I did buy more snack/junk food the chances are 60% I would just end up binging on it versus c/s-ing it.\n\nI used it as a \"restriction\" personally, and I think it's more fairly considered a restriction mechanism versus a type of purging/compensatory behavior but one could make the case either way.\n\nOverall it's not the focus of a lot of research and just sometimes noted as incidental to one's eating disorder:\n\n[https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40337-016-0115-1](https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40337-016-0115-1)\n\nI always considered it personally more of a \"side quest NPC\" sort of thing, and maybe others consider it the same as a reason it doesn't get specifically talked about much outside of very pro circles.",

Non-desert foods I would say a quarter or a third is pretty accurate.\n\nHowever what you're **not** getting though is also a factor: you're not getting any of the carbs for more sustainable energy, you're not getting any benefits from things like fiber, and you're not getting most of the nutritional value. Overall, sugar spikes and confusing your pancreas and stomach and insulin spikes are not a good thing for an average person anyway. Again, not terribly too much medical research has been done specifically on this.",
