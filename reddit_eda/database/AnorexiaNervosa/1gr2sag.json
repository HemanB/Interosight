  "selftext": "I\u2019ve been weight restored since 2021, I\u2019ve had minor relapses and dips in weight (but no where near my lowest weight) \n\nWhen I got out of hospital I started lifting again, I\u2019ve trained ALL my life, I used to swim, I started competing at the age of 7 and carried on until 17/18 and after that, weights & cardio (running, swimming but not as much cardio as my swimming days) \n\nI\u2019ve recently been diagnosed with advanced osteopenia. I\u2019m also starting HRT. I haven\u2019t had my period since I was 16 (now 23) and I feel like I have ruined my body :( \n\nWhen I first lost my period, I was happy, it made my ED brain happy, it felt like a good thing (and honestly not having to worry about random bleeds or running out of tampons was great) but now I\u2019m sitting here, wishing I had jumped into action sooner, wishing I had recovered faster, wishing I didn\u2019t hang on to my anorexia for so long. \n\nWhen I was in the depths of my anorexia, osteoporosis, infertility & other issues were brought up a lot, to me it always felt like a \u2018fear mongering\u2019 tactic to scare me into recovery, and obviously back then, I did not care and also believed nothing like that would ever happen to me.\n\nTbh I believed I would never be sectioned but I was\u2026 \n\nI\u2019m already on medication for things like acid reflux and stomach issues, which I can deal with, yes it\u2019s annoying but that\u2019s it, it\u2019s just annoying.\n\nI\u2019m heartbroken at the fact I have done this to myself. But god am I thankful that I got myself back into lifting after I got discharged, I have a feeling that it would have been a lot worse if I hadn\u2019t got myself back into lifting. \n\nBut still, heartbroken. \n\nIf you\u2019re sitting there, reading this, contemplating recovery or you\u2019re struggling to keep up recovery, please, take it from me and many other people, you need to get your body into a healthier place as soon as you can. Because there are very real long term consequences. I wish I listened, I wish I crawled out of that hole sooner than I did. \n\nI know it\u2019s hard, it feels impossible at times to recover, but you can, you can do it. Do it for future you, future memories, do it for your family, future adventures, do it for the you that wants to be healthy and happy. Because if the time comes where you have red flag after red flag with your health (even when you\u2019re a healthy weight) you\u2019ll wish you started sooner. \n",

Lost my period 4 1/2 years ago, and after almost two years of being weight restored (or close to it), I\u2019ve finally had two periods this year but have to accept that the baby maker is probably retired. I\u2019m lucky I have two healthy children from before I got so ill. I\u2019m not completely recovered but I\u2019m so much better than I was even 8 months ago. I could barely walk up my driveway but now I\u2019m making efforts to take vitamins and stay hydrated on top of eating as well as I can, and I can outrun my 8 year old (in short bursts lol). \n\nBut yes, I have severe gastric issues now that cause severe illness/knocks me out of commission for 3 days every 6-8 weeks. I am extremely worried about my bones because of all my neck, back, and knee pain, and I have neuropathy in my hands and feet which is getting worse by the days. Minor heart complications\u2026but my major wake-up was when I almost died two januarys back (\u201823), I\u2019d passed out from low potassium for 17 hours and they found me unresponsive, 90 degrees F, gave me chest compressions and intubated me. They said I was lucky to be alive.\n\nEvery day can bring struggles but when I think I feel heavy or want to restrict, I have a long think about how I\u2019ll feel in a few weeks if I continue a bad behavior. It satisfies the ED brain immediately but I think about barely walking up my driveway, stopping halfway gasping for breath. Then I think about running in the yard. It\u2019s so difficult but it helps me (usually) make the worthwhile choice. \n\nMuch love to all of you \ud83d\udc9c",
