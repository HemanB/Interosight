I find if I look at it repeatedly over time, it starts to morph into something I\u2019m more used to, and the initial reaction is gone. I guess that\u2019s just the body dysmorphia doing its work. I have no objective way to know how I\u2019m doing, which is why I\u2019m stuck weighing myself all the time I think.",

It got harder again after that sadly...\n\nAnd another time i realized how old and gaunt and grey my face looked when i met a friend shortly after i got out of the hospital.

It doesn\u2019t take away from the progress they\u2019ve made already, that person is only seeing them at a moment in time, not comparing them to how they used to look",
