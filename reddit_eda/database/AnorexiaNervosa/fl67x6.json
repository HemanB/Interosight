Always watching you and making sure you're not stepping out of line but at the same time comforting you by telling you that if you only loose a bit more you'll be worth something.   \n\n\nIt's an abusive relationship that feels safe and reasuring, but hurfull and isolating at the same time. The drawing captured that in a very grotesque way. Thanks for sharing!",
