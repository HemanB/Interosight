  "selftext": "For the first time in a long time I don\u2019t feel guilty about going out to eat. \n\nI was planning on just grabbing dinner with a friend tonight and calling that my one meal of the day, but by lunch time I was hungry, so I ate. \n\nThen, after my last class of the day my sister stopped by and picked me up to go get ice cream, her treat. I wanted to say no, but thought \u201chey I like icecream, let\u2019s do this thing\u201d so I got a big 2 scoops (same as her) and polished of the bowl. \n\nFinally, at around 7 I met my friend for dinner and she said she wanted comfort food so we went and got burritos! I ended up only being able to finish half of mine. But I stopped once I felt full and I was able to shut down the \u201cwell I\u2019ve already eaten so much, might as well binge\u201d mentality. \n\nI ate almost like a normal person today and normally I would feel guilty/embarrassed. But I actually feel really proud of myself. Because for once I just enjoyed myself around food and didn\u2019t let this disorder ruin my time with my friends. \n\nI just can\u2019t believe that I don\u2019t feel guilty. \n\nI just feel PROUD, because of FOOD!!!!!\n\nI think I\u2019m finally going in the right direction. I don\u2019t know how I got here because last week I was at one of my lowest points mentally. \n\nBut I\u2019m done being depressed and letting food stop me from living my life. I want to be happy and tonight was proof that I can be.",
