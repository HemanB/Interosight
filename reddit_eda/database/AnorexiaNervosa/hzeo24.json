I have no desire to eat anything, but don\u2019t want to die and I need my brain to work cause I\u2019ve got projects.\n\nYesterday, my mom says \u2018have you eaten in the past few days? Normally you\u2019re in the kitchen nonstop eating everything!\u2019 \n\nI\u2019ll take \u2018best ways to push your child further into anorexia\u2019 for 500, Alex. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t know I have an ED. But for someone who senses something is wrong, wow. What a fucking winner of a question to make things worse.",

My parents used to say a lot of triggering things before I told them about my eating disorder. I just want you to know that you don't have to suffer alone. You can tell her and even if she doesn't understand, she can learn. In my case my parents talked to my therapist and she educated them a lot.\n\nI know that the thought of telling her might feel very scary. Not to be a mindreader or anything but it kinda sounds like you resent her a bit (which is totally valid). I know I resented my parents for a while because I thought \"how can they not see that something's wrong?\" But since telling them things have improved a lot.\n\nI hope you can open up and get the help you deserve. Take care \u2764\ufe0f",
