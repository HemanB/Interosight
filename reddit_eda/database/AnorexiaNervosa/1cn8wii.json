While I don\u2019t actively restrict to the point that I\u2019m losing weight anymore, I can\u2019t help but compulsively track every calorie that goes into my mouth and keep my intake under 1400. It\u2019s stressful but I\u2019m maintaining a healthy weight now. Hopefully, I can also have a healthy relationship with food soon since eating is one of the few things that I enjoy. This vicious cycle of restriction and guilt has not been great for my mental health.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m happy for you and wish you all the best! :). Stay happy and stay healthy! Having a healthy relationship with food can do wonders to one\u2019s mental health. I\u2019ve almost forgotten what it feels like to eat without constantly counting calories, it\u2019s exhausting.",
