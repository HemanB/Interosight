  "selftext": "Okay so I thought this is super interesting and SUPER depressing and awful, so of course I\u2019ll share \ud83d\ude0d\u263a\ufe0f. During the peak of my anorexia I finally began to feel actually suicidal. Like I genuinely did not want to live anymore and wouldn\u2019t care about being careful on the roads and what not. I genuinely just hated my life so much and felt so worthless and felt so isolated. I just think like WOW a human becomes so numb and so incredibly malnourished to the point ur brain begins telling you to kill yourself. Does this happen to many anorexic people? Like ur brain actually telling you to kill yourself. It\u2019s just insane. Looking back 6 months later I feel so bad for myself like that\u2019s insane! \n\nThis is a super ridiculous story that I never tell anyone but when I was little I would watch rly scary horror movies and it just wired my brain to be scared of the dark even to this grown ass adult age. Whenever I would walk in the middle of the night through my house or just down the hallway to my bathroom, I no longer turned all the lights on, I no longer gave a fuck if there were demons or ghosts standing in the dark. I did. Not. Care. About. Being. Alive. My life was worthless. That whole scary dark thing situation made me realise wow this is lowkey the beginning of the end. Anyways, super random but \n\nP.s, if anyone is going through these thoughts right now, please know you\u2019re going to fucking get through this bitch of a disorder, you\u2019re life isn\u2019t as worthless as the disorder makes u think it is. I love u, stay fierce xx",
