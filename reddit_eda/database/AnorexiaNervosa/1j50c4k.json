I can\u2019t share how triggered I feel when my ex partner fucking tells me, unasked, how much his new gf weighs (like wtf??). \nNo non-disordered person would understand and I dont want to trigger anyone (with details about my my ed) that I know who has or had an ed theirself.\nCan anyone here relate? I feel so lonely rn. Lonely and triggered. Why did my ex have to tell me about his gf. I kind of want to block him but he is one of my very few friends\u2026",
