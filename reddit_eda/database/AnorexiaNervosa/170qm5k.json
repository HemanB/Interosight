You're completely valid for wanting to reach out and just because you aren't \"sickly thin\" doesn't mean you aren't mentally sick. Ed's are horrible and they eat away at you for years. Try to reach out to a support network (family, friends, or therapist) that will actually support you, and if that isn't available then be that supportive person for yourself as hard as that sounds. Only you know truly how you feel and how you react, and realizing that you're the only person who can help yourself really saved me in the height of anorexia. You're a strong person and you wanting to open up and be vulnerable about it shows that you want more for yourself. Be safe and know thay you aren't alone <3",

The fact this person had the audacity to say \u201cyou\u2019re just balling\u201d when you relayed a vulnerable thing to them shows that they aren\u2019t an empathetic or self aware human - feel bad for them that they can\u2019t meet people where they are . For yourself, your eating disorder and how you feel about it are VALID!!! The only weight you need to lose is this person from your life ! You don\u2019t need to prove your illness to anyone because this illness isn\u2019t about them, it\u2019s about you. Stop seeking external validation and things may get better - I\u2019m saying this because I noticed my ED coincides with wanting people to like me or think I\u2019m skinny as well or approve of me. People don\u2019t matter , YOU DO- anorexia doesn\u2019t define you, it\u2019s not part of you even if it feels like it is. It\u2019s not your friend even when it feels like it\u2019s the only thing that understands . You know what you need to do - be honest with yourself about what you can do to get back on track \ud83e\udef6",
