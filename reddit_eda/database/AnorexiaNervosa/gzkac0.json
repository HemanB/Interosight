  "title": "Should I feel bad?",
  "selftext": "Yesterday I saw a extremly skinny girl. She was supported by a man while walking and seemed very weak. The man also carried a few back, so I assume they were on their way to an psychical hospital or something like that. On one side I felt sorry for her and hope she will get better, but on the other hand I thought: God, what would I do to look like her. The thought spun around in my head the whole day. Now I'm unsure if I should feel bad about it, because the girl looked so ill and sad, and all I can think about is how badly want to be like her. Am I a bad person because of this?",
