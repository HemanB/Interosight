      "body": "Honestly numbers are completely unnecessary unless you're talking to therapist/psychiatrist/doctor. There is no need to talk about it in an online or irl support group. It's easy to talk around it by giving a general sense of \"I was a below/above average weight\" or \"I was restricting/binging very heavily\". When I see people talking numbers about how much they lost when restricting it kinda just sounds like they're trying to flex how \"good\" they are at their ED, and that's not what this space should be about. This isn't tumblr ffs.",
