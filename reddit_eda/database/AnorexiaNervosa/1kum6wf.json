  "selftext": "I never wanna eat ever again. Chewing makes me feel disgusted knowing all that mush is in my mouth, food is never as good as i thought itd be, and i cant eat stuff (even foods with listed calories) without overthinking how many calories are in it. I wanna survive off air and tea and nothing else. Food is disgusting filth and calories terrify me. Oil, sauce, seasoning, even the sound of food frying disgusts me. I hate oil spray and butter. I hate sauces and glazes. I hate the noises of mixing and frying. All i can think about is every little calorie being added to that meal. I cant even enjoy mukbangs anymore. My appetite has been gone the past few days and eating even fruit and veggies makes me sick. ",

Food has just brought so much stress and discomfort to my life, I could only imagine how much easier it\u2019d be to not have to worry about it at all. Alas, we must eat to survive!!",
