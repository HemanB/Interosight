  "title": "Anyone else get triggered by extremely thin Instagram models constantly posting pictures of high calorie foods?",
  "selftext": "I try to avoid Instagram models to the best of my ability but because using social media is part of my job, it can be easy to get sucked into their feeds. One trend I see with Instagram models is them posting high-calorie foods like pizza, hamburgers, and alcoholic drinks all the time. They act like they are enjoying these foods and even though rationally I assume they probably don\u2019t eat them, I still get slightly triggered. \nInstagram models in general completely destroy my self-esteem every time I see them and they trigger me back into a restriction routine. But watching them post all of these fatty foods makes me extra sad and extra desperate to lose weight and be as skinny as them. \n\nI hate that social media has become such a huge part of jobs and lifestyles. Instagram models have infiltrated everything- online stores, advertisements, other media platforms, etc. \nI wish I could delete all of that and never look back. Anyone else?",
