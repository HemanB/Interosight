  "selftext": "Sometimes I see people eat stuff and I\u2019m literally awestruck cuz like I didn\u2019t know you could just do that? For example I make my sister breakfast every morning and it\u2019s usually like eggs and toast and sausage and cheese and onions but then sometimes while I\u2019m cooking it she will just like grab a muffin and eat it as a pre breakfast snack and I\u2019m literally just in awe cuz like In my mind I don\u2019t know if I could ever just do that, like that\u2019s a thing? You can just have a muffin BEFORE breakfast?? Like I genuinely forgot that was an option. Also when people will say they want a coffee and then order like a really elaborate latte with like syrup and whip cream and all the jazz, like you\u2019re telling me you can just do that and not think twice about it? It feels like my brain is just so programmed to see calories and not flavours that I  genuinely have a hard time believing that other people aren\u2019t the same because it just feels so like\u2026 normal? I guess for me. I\u2019m in awe of these people I want to be like them but idk if it\u2019s in the cards for me, maybe I\u2019ll never un-learn the calories in my head and I\u2019m forever cursed. ",
