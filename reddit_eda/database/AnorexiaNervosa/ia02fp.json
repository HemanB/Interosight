  "selftext": "Recently I made a post with details and numbers about my weight loss & i was asked to take it down because it was triggering. I just wanted to say to anyone that saw my post with specific numbers in it, I am so sorry. I am sorry if i caused a negative thought for even one second, i didn't mean to, and i didn't realize that what i said could have been harmful to someone. My post was only up for a couple hours but to anyone saw it or was triggered or wasn't triggered, I really do apologize. I'm learning the acceptable things to say on this thread, and i now know what not to say. \n\nI took a moment to weigh myself at work and saw that i was an even ___.0 lbs so i typed a little paragraph real fast and posted it. I should have thought harder about what i had said & I should be able to filter it myself, not have other people tell me what i said was wrong. I apologize to the deepest of depths",
