Just always thinking in the back of my head \u201cI\u2019ll lose it when I go home\u201d. I was literally eating so much and enjoying it. The day after I got home I started restricting just like that, even purging\u2026 \n\nLike I don\u2019t even know what this means how can I go from fully normal eating to this in a day and is this even a disorder anymore or am I just doing this because I can? \n\n(I was recovered for 7 years and relapsed last year but am always going back to recovery and relapses keep happening)",

Currently on vacation w the fam and have definitely gained a bit, at least that\u2019s what I think. I\u2019ve thought about it but it hasn\u2019t made me spiral, I am so sure once I get back home tho I will lose my mind",
