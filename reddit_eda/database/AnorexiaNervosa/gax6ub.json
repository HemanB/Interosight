  "selftext": "Like, not even a sort of \u201cboo boo I\u2019m so sad because I haven\u2019t eaten and that reminds me how I\u2019m failing\u201d or all that. It\u2019s just I was having an okay morning, did my exercise, went downstairs thinking I should eat a light breakfast because yay recovery, and then my mom comes and asks me if I had breakfast already and I got so nervous and felt so terrible, I only wanted to get out of there. \n\nLong story short I had a panic attack in the bathroom and weighed myself (even though I promised I wouldn\u2019t) and i weight more than expected and I\u2019m not having breakfast or any other meal today :\u2019)\n\nHas anyone else felt the same? Like it\u2019s not even logical, I just felt a switch go off from my happy mode to straight up suicidal",
