  "selftext": "So I\u2019ve been heavily restricting for almost four months now. Like this is the worst my anorexia has ever been. And I\u2019m noticing that when I talk to people at work I end up stuttering and not being able to say a word or phrase properly. I find myself having to repeat the last part of what I said a lot. And for the slurring of words, it\u2019s not so bad as to where people are gonna think I\u2019m inebriated, more so like talking more slowly and dragging out words occasionally. It\u2019s so strange and I hate it.",

I commented on a similar post a bit ago regarding speech and anorexia.\n\nI'm a registered Speech Language Pathologist (SLP) and I also have anorexia. Preface that I'm not giving medical advice or anything, just an SLP who happened to see this post and thought I'd comment as an ally who happens to work in the SLP field.\n\nI've also dealt with slurring speech, and it's likely because expressive language (like verbal speech) is mainly controlled in what's called Broca's area of the brain. This is in the frontal cortex, which is responsible for higher-level thinking and decision-making- including language. When our brains are starved, they will pull function from the \"less\" crucial areas like speech and language, to keep survival functions going, to keep you alive. So you may find you have a harder time making decisions, rationalizing, and expressing yourself. \n\nThere are also speech and language conditions that are a result of planning issues and miscommunication between the brain and the muscles used to make sounds. Producing speech is actually an incredibly complex process but in most of us, it's automatic and so we don't think about the steps it takes from thinking of a word to say, to moving your muscles to produce the sounds. When your brain is starved, there can be a mix-up in this process, and so it may be harder for your brain to produce words. It's commonly referred to as apraxia of speech, and in these cases, actual motor movement of the speech muscles is not usually impaired, rather its a problem within that pathway of your brain thinking of the target sounds and actually controlling the muscles to say them (motor planning). Not saying you have that, just wanted to illustrate that there are speech issues that are more about motor planning vs problems with the muscles themselves. \n\nOf course, with anorexia and muscle wasting in some cases, there can be wasting of the mouth, esophagus and pharyngeal muscles and this can also cause issues with physically moving your mouth to produce sounds too.\n\nIt's likely that with nutritional and physical rehabilitation, you'll find it easier to speak and that the slurring will lessen, but consult an SLP if it persists even with weight restoration (if required) and nutritional rehabilitation.\n\n  \nI know that I have problems making decisions, expressing myself and even rate of speech is lower when I'm not doing well ED wise.\n\n  \nWishing you all the best and I hope this helped some!",
