  "title": "Medical complications I didn't think could happen because of anorexia",
  "selftext": "This disorder can cause so many medical complications. It can cause osteoporosis and bone loss. It can cause heart problems. And it can cause digestive issues and organ damage. I just did not realize that starving myself for years would cause such complex health issues. Because of chronic and untreated anorexia nervosa, my medical complications are hard to treat and really painful. Very early on in my disorder, it caused health issues. But because I was younger and went to treatment early, they were able to be reversed. But I never fully recovered after my inpatient treatments, meaning I did not do what they wanted me to do. I did not fully restore weight, I did not attend residential or outpatient treatment, and I did not continue to get treatment after leaving inpatient. Years later, I have severe and enduring anorexia. And it's affected my health in a lot of ways. One thing I didn't realize this illness could cause was that it can affect the way your body processes and absorbs nutrients from the food you eat. My doctor told me because I have starved myself for years, this has made it harder for me to eat and gain weight. When my body was healthier, I was able to eat and put on weight if I wanted. Now when I eat, it hurts my stomach, I get digestive issues, experience hunger after eating and notice that it's hard to get my weight up. The weight loss I experience now isn't intentional. Anorexia can cause GI issues but I wasn't aware it could be this bad. I get different answers from people. I've been told this is what happens when the illness is progressing towards end stage and the body can't handle food the way it used to. This illness is also affecting my bladder, something I never thought about when I was younger. I experience very painful and frequent urination, which is affecting my quality of life and basically keeps me staying at home a lot. It's the worst pain I've ever felt. Because of the pain I experience because of these symptoms, it's made me more depressed. I'm on palliative care for my anorexia. I am also being treated with outpatient treatment, but because my medical issues are so severe, I have not been able to find any relief from them. But if I could go back in time, I would have listened when people were telling me that this is a serious disorder and when left untreated, it can cause severe complications. I don't want to get worse. And I hope I can find a way to start feeling better. I may have to live with side effects from long term anorexia. I also have discomfort with the idea of being treated in a hospital type setting. I feel embarrassed about my symptoms and also struggle with the need for a routine, due to being autistic. And so whenever someone suggests that inpatient may be helpful, I remember how traumatizing my last treatments were and simply don't want to go through that again. I see a doctor, therapist and nutritionist, but I've been told my symptoms are too severe and they simply won't improve with just outpatient. But the idea of inpatient makes me so anxious. I wish there were more treatment options for complex health issues. And more options, in general, for those who are both autistic and anorexic. While no treatment is perfect, I face extra challenges because my brain responds differently to therapy and treatment, because of autism. Things like group therapy, new environments and new routines give me a lot of anxiety, and that's likely why I was never able to adjust to inpatient treatment. I've never been to residential but I think I would have a difficult time with it.",

      "body": "This post is really important. \n\nI really do feel you and find a lot of similarities in our stories. My weight loss is not intentional anymore either. Or keeping my weight this low. The amount of food it takes for me to keep my weight up is nowhere near what was before. I used to be terrified of gaining weight, now I want it badly to restore some health, and I can\u2019t. It\u2019s very hard, like my body got used to be severely underweight and won\u2019t keep the nutrients I feed it. I just can\u2019t stomach the amount of food needed for me to gain and maintain a healthier weight. \n\nMy heart health is shit too. Palpitations, tachycardia, chest pain and discomfort and pressure. Terrible insomnia, terrible memory, hair loss, dry skin, poor circulation, low blood pressure, my right eye is losing sight progressively, frequent diarrhea, abdominal cramps and bloating, having a hard time regulating body temperature (always too hot or too cold), constant exhaustion, aggravated depression and anxiety.\n\nAll of this (and other traumatic life events) led me to abuse drugs to cope. And now I\u2019m stuck in a never ending cycle.\n\nThis disease is a killer. It\u2019s very important to talk about this and to stop glamorizing and romanticizing this shit. Because it\u2019s a slow and painful death. It takes everything from you. It\u2019s all fun and games until you can\u2019t get out of bed anymore, until talking for more than 5 minutes takes your breath away. \n\nI\u2019m 26 now, and god, if I could go back 10 years and tell her where she would be if she kept going as she was\u2026. I might have saved her.",

God wait till people start dealing with PET disorder . \nBut you begin thinking how useless this all was  \n\nAs we age we find out that most people are involved in their own heads about themselves.  \nAnd we live our life thinking we are center stage.  Wondering who noticed a gain . Who noticed a loss. \nFrankly NO ONE  And whoever does ,doesn't even care. \nIt's on our minds. The ed literally drives every thought, feeling,decision, action. \nBesides PET and loss of teeth , vision peeing, pooping etc \n\nThe WORST thing is that it took my whole life. \n\nI did nothing that matters. \nNo kids was scared to be fat.\nNo loving another person when your busy dealing with health issues so much you can't meat men and when u date it's exhausting.  \nAnd the thoughts that take over your brain. \n\nYou notice that other people around you really LIVE LIVES. \n\nThey are having moments that passed us because we are wrapped into this  \nWhen other laugh it's real laughs.

But then there comes that relapse that was \"impossible\"\n\nI regret evey bit of time i wasted. I wanted to actually live a life of doing what would make an impact.  Get married and settle down. \n\nNo significant other wants to deal with the issues.

WHAT MAKES BEING TOO THIN MY IDENTITY? WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN AND WHERE DID I GO? \n\n So what did we do it for if it got us nothing in life. Not money not love not happiness not changing anything for the good. We didn't participate. \n\nI lost not just a physical body ,but I never had an actual life to live because it ruined everything and it wasn't ME.

      "body": "My body has faced the consequences of atypical anorexia. I\u2019m going to be blunt and real when I write this because I wish I had someone tell me this. \n\nI was never hospitalized, never under weight by medical criteria (actually was still considered obese at the height of my disorder on the BMI scale), never inpatient, always outpatient treatments. I do now have long lasting chronic health conditions from this cruel disease. After 10 years of off and on relapses and now five years of solid recovery, I now struggle with gastroparesis, acid reflex disease, gallbladder taken out due to a sluggish gallbladder (my gallbladder basically was dying because I was not eating and using it), kidney stones and now kidney injury, high liver enzymes and now fibrosis of the liver, chronic bladder pain and constant need to urinate (interstitial cystitis now I have to monitor what I eat so it does not flare up \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Now that I want to eat I can\u2019t eat certain foods that are too acidic), pelvic floor dysfunction (hurts to have sex and I have to wear daily pads incase I urinate on myself while laughing or coughing-yes, purging can cause this. It ruins your abdominal core), chronic pain from nerve damage, chronic low iron (nothing will bring my iron/ferritin levels up), brain damage that I now have to go to rehabilitation for memory problems I never had before (I have a PhD and my memory is now failing me from my brain atrophying during the years I starved myself. My brain is smaller than average. No educational degree will reverse this.), small fractures throughout the years out of no where (legit fractured my foot when stepping off a curb. The embarrassment I felt going to the ER because I stepped off a curb too hard and fractured my foot \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f), abdominal hernia repair surgery from purging (yes, this happens and extremely painful recovery), reactive hypoglycemia, and now heart issues I just found out about last month that may not be fixable. \n\nSo no, you don\u2019t have to be UW or have had numerous or even one inpatient stay or IOP or PHP treatment to experience any of these consequences. I\u2019ve been in recovery for five years and my body is still trying to catch up and falling apart at the same time. I truly wish someone would have advised my mother and me of the consequences of chronic dieting growing up since 10 years old (this is when my mother enrolled me in weight watchers but always had my food monitored since I was a \u201cchubby\u201d kid) and then developing a 10 off and on year long battle with an eating disorder starting at 18. Instead, unfortunately, I was always told I needed to lose weight by medical professionals. My body NEEDED that weight. Oh, I\u2019m also the shortest one in my family so there\u2019s that too (growth restriction). \n\nYou are not immune from these consequences. I thought I was the exception. I kept telling myself this was okay. This is what doctors told me to do. Thought if I have a wonderful career, a PhD, (humbling stating the following to give an example) a decent income for a single middle aged woman, all my needs and wants met-I would be okay. I would tell myself I NEEDED my ED to cope to get where I am today and then I\u2019ll be okay and it will magically go away with no consequences. Nope\u2026I hit 30 and all my health issues started and I had been IN RECOVERY for two years before this and I am still paying the consequences to this day. \n\nI\u2019m up right now at 2 am typing this with severe acid reflux and unable to sleep because I had vegetables with my dinner. Yes, vegetables. I can\u2019t sleep because my stomach is on fire. Already took all the medication I can to no avail. \n\nPLUS what hurts the most is the years I wasted on this terrible disease and how much I suffered. The money spent on healthcare is in the six figures WITH insurance here in the US and this isn\u2019t all my outpatient treatment copays and out of pocket expenses with my specialized psychologist and dietician for the last 8 years. \n\nGet help NOW, please. Even if it\u2019s just having one \u201cextra\u201d food item a day to start. If not for you, but for the people before you telling you this WILL be your life in the years to come. The consequences do not discriminate.",

I've got to the point with Ed where I'm like f societies weight bs I just want to be healthy and happy; still a stuggle though but I pray a lot. You should look into somantic therapy and emdr; they tend to be more helpful for neurodivergants. With routine try to add food into your established routine. Since Ive been feeling sick eating food I make sure to drink an ensure in the morning. I know I have to have a meal with my vitamins so I force myself to have at least one big meal a day when feeling sick. I'll also put collagen in my drinks.\u00a0\n\n\nI'm glad you're seeing a doctor, therapist and nutritionist. Have you explained your concerns being asd and doing inpatient. They are your team so they need to listen and be working with you to get better (if one isnt listening or helping get a new one). Remember you need to be your biggest advocate or bring one with you. See if you can draft up an inpatient type environment to do at home with them.\u00a0There's so many resources to help yourself at home especially with the internet. Online therapy, virtual support groups, audiobooks, YouTube, somantic exercises, journaling, meditation and prayer, etc. Work with them to add things onto your established routine that'll help.\u00a0\n\n\nIt does suck there aren't more places for us. Hopefully one day we'll get there. What matters most now though is your life and health. If you won't be able to help yourself at home then you'll need to go to inpatient. I completely understand the anxiety about unfamiliar places and out of routine. Call around to places (or have someone who understands and loves you) and ask how they accommodate someone with autism and ed. Ask all your questions and find the best fit for you. You'll need to get real honest with yourself if you'll be able to work on your healing at home or if you can't and need inpatient. Listen to your intuition and try to ignore the fear. Your goal is getting better.\n\n\nYou were determined to get to your goal weight. You are strong and resilient going through life with asd and how the world treats us. Now focus that determination, strength and resilience on getting better, helping yourself and getting the right help. I will be praying for you \ud83d\ude4f I wish you all the best on the path forward. You can do this!\u00a0",

This disease is deadly, plus you have to include other health issues or symptoms, environment, social conditioning, and inadequate treatment.\n\nOne health condition I have is called painful bladder syndrome, and it took nearly a decade to fail all the treatments and get an implant in my back that disrupts the pain to my bladder. Surprisingly, Amatriptaline (an old school antidepressant) is used off-label for bladder pain, and pelvic floor therapy helped me a lot.\n\nIf you have not seen a urogynocologist yet, I encourage you to see one for testing just to rule out issues with your bladder. \n\nI tried voluntary inpatient and was illegally detained and prolapsed my anus because the Eating Disorder hospital would not allow me proper stool softners after a pelvic floor reconstruction surgery I'm never going inpatient again and they were dicks about my Xanax prescription which lead to siezures.  It was so inhumane, and they falsified their billing, so I contacted the VAs fraud, waste, and abuse line for my concerns. They charged $7 k a night but would not help with eating, played games at meal time, no individual therapy, just one group therapy exercise where we wrote how similar we are to pigs.\n\nI also can't absorb or convert what I eat or take and that's how my mom was when she died of heart issues from anorexia so I get frustrated.",

Plus i've been impatient five times so i've used all my insurance and money already.\u00a0\n\n\nSo do you have this severe heat intolerance and feeling hot all the time? Has your doctors told you if weight gain would make this symptom go away and regulate your hypothesis? My drs don't know. Does yours?",

      "body": "Came back to say: for those experiencing bladder problems from anorexia look up interstitial cystitis. In a nutshell it\u2019s when the uterine wall becomes weak because of chronic dehydration and changes it genetic make up to \u201cover compensate\u201d for all the acid that builds up when you\u2019re dehydrated. So now when you actually eat highly acid foods (soda, oranges, limes,etc.) it flares up the uterine wall. Think of your bladder having PTSD and anytime you eat a certain threshold of something acidic it has a flashback and wants to get rid of it quick to avoid further damage. It does this through the urgency to urinate and pain. This is SUPER simplified it\u2019s more complex but looking at what were my bladders \u201ctrigger\u201d foods has helped heal the bladder lining. Unfortunately it\u2019s a lot of trial and error. Eat something acidic (like lemonade- this sends me to the er in pain) and see how you react. \n\nI\u2019m NOT a medical provider so take this with a grain of salt and do what\u2019s best for you and consult a urologist. This is what has helped ME: take prelief before you eat anything acidic. This can be found over the counter. However, you cannot take this daily because it will cause kidney stones. It is just meant as an occasional supplement to help. Drink enough water to flush your bladder daily even if you choose not to eat. The acidity in your blood has to leave your body somehow. A heating pad helps with the pain. Work with your dietician to see what foods you\u2019re eating that could be too acidic. This does NOT mean do not eat them. You may just need to take prelief beforehand. Amazon also sells urine acidity strips. This helps to know whether you need to drink more water. Lastly, make sure you do not have an untreated UTI.",

          "body": "My body has faced the consequences of atypical anorexia. I\u2019m going to be blunt and real when I write this because I wish I had someone tell me this. \n\nI was never hospitalized, never under weight by medical criteria (actually was still considered obese at the height of my disorder on the BMI scale), never inpatient, always outpatient treatments. I do now have long lasting chronic health conditions from this cruel disease. After 10 years of off and on relapses and now five years of solid recovery, I now struggle with gastroparesis, acid reflex disease, gallbladder taken out due to a sluggish gallbladder (my gallbladder basically was dying because I was not eating and using it), kidney stones and now kidney injury, high liver enzymes and now fibrosis of the liver, chronic bladder pain and constant need to urinate (interstitial cystitis now I have to monitor what I eat so it does not flare up \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Now that I want to eat I can\u2019t eat certain foods that are too acidic), pelvic floor dysfunction (hurts to have sex and I have to wear daily pads incase I urinate on myself while laughing or coughing-yes, purging can cause this. It ruins your abdominal core), chronic pain from nerve damage, chronic low iron (nothing will bring my iron/ferritin levels up), brain damage that I now have to go to rehabilitation for memory problems I never had before (I have a PhD and my memory is now failing me from my brain atrophying during the years I starved myself. My brain is smaller than average. No educational degree will reverse this.), small fractures throughout the years out of no where (legit fractured my foot when stepping off a curb. The embarrassment I felt going to the ER because I stepped off a curb too hard and fractured my foot \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f), abdominal hernia repair surgery from purging (yes, this happens and extremely painful recovery), reactive hypoglycemia, and now heart issues I just found out about last month that may not be fixable. \n\nSo no, you don\u2019t have to be UW or have had numerous or even one inpatient stay or IOP or PHP treatment to experience any of these consequences. I\u2019ve been in recovery for five years and my body is still trying to catch up and falling apart at the same time. I truly wish someone would have advised my mother and me of the consequences of chronic dieting growing up since 10 years old (this is when my mother enrolled me in weight watchers but always had my food monitored since I was a \u201cchubby\u201d kid) and then developing a 10 off and on year long battle with an eating disorder starting at 18. Instead, unfortunately, I was always told I needed to lose weight by medical professionals. My body NEEDED that weight. Oh, I\u2019m also the shortest one in my family so there\u2019s that too (growth restriction). \n\nYou are not immune from these consequences. I thought I was the exception. I kept telling myself this was okay. This is what doctors told me to do. Thought if I have a wonderful career, a PhD, (humbling stating the following to give an example) a decent income for a single middle aged woman, all my needs and wants met-I would be okay. I would tell myself I NEEDED my ED to cope to get where I am today and then I\u2019ll be okay and it will magically go away with no consequences. Nope\u2026I hit 30 and all my health issues started and I had been IN RECOVERY for two years before this and I am still paying the consequences to this day. \n\nI\u2019m up right now at 2 am typing this with severe acid reflux and unable to sleep because I had vegetables with my dinner. Yes, vegetables. I can\u2019t sleep because my stomach is on fire. Already took all the medication I can to no avail. \n\nPLUS what hurts the most is the years I wasted on this terrible disease and how much I suffered. The money spent on healthcare is in the six figures WITH insurance here in the US and this isn\u2019t all my outpatient treatment copays and out of pocket expenses with my specialized psychologist and dietician for the last 8 years. \n\nGet help NOW, please. Even if it\u2019s just having one \u201cextra\u201d food item a day to start. If not for you, but for the people before you telling you this WILL be your life in the years to come. The consequences do not discriminate.",

I've got to the point with Ed where I'm like f societies weight bs I just want to be healthy and happy; still a stuggle though but I pray a lot. You should look into somantic therapy and emdr; they tend to be more helpful for neurodivergants. With routine try to add food into your established routine. Since Ive been feeling sick eating food I make sure to drink an ensure in the morning. I know I have to have a meal with my vitamins so I force myself to have at least one big meal a day when feeling sick. I'll also put collagen in my drinks.\u00a0\n\n\nI'm glad you're seeing a doctor, therapist and nutritionist. Have you explained your concerns being asd and doing inpatient. They are your team so they need to listen and be working with you to get better (if one isnt listening or helping get a new one). Remember you need to be your biggest advocate or bring one with you. See if you can draft up an inpatient type environment to do at home with them.\u00a0There's so many resources to help yourself at home especially with the internet. Online therapy, virtual support groups, audiobooks, YouTube, somantic exercises, journaling, meditation and prayer, etc. Work with them to add things onto your established routine that'll help.\u00a0\n\n\nIt does suck there aren't more places for us. Hopefully one day we'll get there. What matters most now though is your life and health. If you won't be able to help yourself at home then you'll need to go to inpatient. I completely understand the anxiety about unfamiliar places and out of routine. Call around to places (or have someone who understands and loves you) and ask how they accommodate someone with autism and ed. Ask all your questions and find the best fit for you. You'll need to get real honest with yourself if you'll be able to work on your healing at home or if you can't and need inpatient. Listen to your intuition and try to ignore the fear. Your goal is getting better.\n\n\nYou were determined to get to your goal weight. You are strong and resilient going through life with asd and how the world treats us. Now focus that determination, strength and resilience on getting better, helping yourself and getting the right help. I will be praying for you \ud83d\ude4f I wish you all the best on the path forward. You can do this!\u00a0",

It was so inhumane, and they falsified their billing, so I contacted the VAs fraud, waste, and abuse line for my concerns.

And I djnt cou t the years I was immersed in it as eveb being alive because I was just a body with no thoughts, ideas,plans, feelings that were only mine, they were me and my ED\nSo\nI wasn't alive from age 9 to 45. Minus 14.5 yeara jf recovery. \nTake note I said 45.\nIts a myrh that it cant come back   \nThere used to be very few people over 40 with and today its a growingnahe group,  old mellenials like me and gen x arenfull of ed \nOddly, we were the 90s boom ED of the comeback of twiggy. Now we hit 40 and we are at it ahain, sick and in pain and having body failing early all ober  . here we again at it. \nThere are horrible things its done physically. God wait till people start dealing with PET disorder . \nBut you begin thinking how useless this all was  \n\nAs we age we find out that most people are involved in their own heads about themselves.  \nAnd we live our life thinking we are center stage.  Wondering who noticed a gain . Who noticed a loss. \nFrankly NO ONE  And whoever does ,doesn't even care. \nIt's on our minds. The ed literally drives every thought, feeling,decision, action. \nBesides PET and loss of teeth , vision peeing, pooping etc \n\nThe WORST thing is that it took my whole life. \n\nI did nothing that matters. \nNo kids was scared to be fat.\nNo loving another person when your busy dealing with health issues so much you can't meat men and when u date it's exhausting.  \nAnd the thoughts that take over your brain. \n\nYou notice that other people around you really LIVE LIVES. \n\nThey are having moments that passed us because we are wrapped into this  \nWhen other laugh it's real laughs. When I laugh I hope I didn't look fat  in my stomach  . \nThey have actual fulfillment.  We don't we aren't in our brains and we can't be in our bodies  it's the ed that is. \nSo we are walking zombies \n\nI realized my whole life - is wasn't existing.\n\nI absolutely put nothing into this world. And what's even worse is there are so many people and even kids that are a part of this word and love life and it gets taken away from them ,but we are dead inside and falling apart but still stuck alive. \nTalk about feeling guilty. \nPeople get sick of you being sick and push away to go live life  \nWe go back into our heads with our ed  \nYou spend your life making your body the way you want it,  and during that time- WE LOST TIME.  \n \nJust When u get that perfect wieght and you love seeing all the bones, you start to fall apart.  \n.\nI wish I could go back in time during  14 years of real recovery.  But then there comes that relapse that was \"impossible\"\n\nI regret evey bit of time i wasted. I wanted to actually live a life of doing what would make an impact.  Get married and settle down. \n\nNo significant other wants to deal with the issues.  And when the health problems start those vows suddenly mean crap cuy you are dragging them down.  \nIt just made my vidy fall apart early  \n\nAnd again- the actual QUESTION IS.... WHAT MAKES BEING TOO THIN MY IDENTITY? WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN AND WHERE DID I GO? \n\n So what did we do it for if it got us nothing in life. Not money not love not happiness not changing anything for the good. We didn't participate. \n\nI lost not just a physical body ,but I never had an actual life to live because it ruined everything and it wasn't ME.

          "body": "My body has faced the consequences of atypical anorexia. I\u2019m going to be blunt and real when I write this because I wish I had someone tell me this. \n\nI was never hospitalized, never under weight by medical criteria (actually was still considered obese at the height of my disorder on the BMI scale), never inpatient, always outpatient treatments. I do now have long lasting chronic health conditions from this cruel disease. After 10 years of off and on relapses and now five years of solid recovery, I now struggle with gastroparesis, acid reflex disease, gallbladder taken out due to a sluggish gallbladder (my gallbladder basically was dying because I was not eating and using it), kidney stones and now kidney injury, high liver enzymes and now fibrosis of the liver, chronic bladder pain and constant need to urinate (interstitial cystitis now I have to monitor what I eat so it does not flare up \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Now that I want to eat I can\u2019t eat certain foods that are too acidic), pelvic floor dysfunction (hurts to have sex and I have to wear daily pads incase I urinate on myself while laughing or coughing-yes, purging can cause this. It ruins your abdominal core), chronic pain from nerve damage, chronic low iron (nothing will bring my iron/ferritin levels up), brain damage that I now have to go to rehabilitation for memory problems I never had before (I have a PhD and my memory is now failing me from my brain atrophying during the years I starved myself. My brain is smaller than average. No educational degree will reverse this.), small fractures throughout the years out of no where (legit fractured my foot when stepping off a curb. The embarrassment I felt going to the ER because I stepped off a curb too hard and fractured my foot \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f), abdominal hernia repair surgery from purging (yes, this happens and extremely painful recovery), reactive hypoglycemia, and now heart issues I just found out about last month that may not be fixable. \n\nSo no, you don\u2019t have to be UW or have had numerous or even one inpatient stay or IOP or PHP treatment to experience any of these consequences. I\u2019ve been in recovery for five years and my body is still trying to catch up and falling apart at the same time. I truly wish someone would have advised my mother and me of the consequences of chronic dieting growing up since 10 years old (this is when my mother enrolled me in weight watchers but always had my food monitored since I was a \u201cchubby\u201d kid) and then developing a 10 off and on year long battle with an eating disorder starting at 18. Instead, unfortunately, I was always told I needed to lose weight by medical professionals. My body NEEDED that weight. Oh, I\u2019m also the shortest one in my family so there\u2019s that too (growth restriction). \n\nYou are not immune from these consequences. I thought I was the exception. I kept telling myself this was okay. This is what doctors told me to do. Thought if I have a wonderful career, a PhD, (humbling stating the following to give an example) a decent income for a single middle aged woman, all my needs and wants met-I would be okay. I would tell myself I NEEDED my ED to cope to get where I am today and then I\u2019ll be okay and it will magically go away with no consequences. Nope\u2026I hit 30 and all my health issues started and I had been IN RECOVERY for two years before this and I am still paying the consequences to this day. \n\nI\u2019m up right now at 2 am typing this with severe acid reflux and unable to sleep because I had vegetables with my dinner. Yes, vegetables. I can\u2019t sleep because my stomach is on fire. Already took all the medication I can to no avail. \n\nPLUS what hurts the most is the years I wasted on this terrible disease and how much I suffered. The money spent on healthcare is in the six figures WITH insurance here in the US and this isn\u2019t all my outpatient treatment copays and out of pocket expenses with my specialized psychologist and dietician for the last 8 years. \n\nGet help NOW, please. Even if it\u2019s just having one \u201cextra\u201d food item a day to start. If not for you, but for the people before you telling you this WILL be your life in the years to come. The consequences do not discriminate.",

          "body": "Came back to say: for those experiencing bladder problems from anorexia look up interstitial cystitis. In a nutshell it\u2019s when the uterine wall becomes weak because of chronic dehydration and changes it genetic make up to \u201cover compensate\u201d for all the acid that builds up when you\u2019re dehydrated. So now when you actually eat highly acid foods (soda, oranges, limes,etc.) it flares up the uterine wall. Think of your bladder having PTSD and anytime you eat a certain threshold of something acidic it has a flashback and wants to get rid of it quick to avoid further damage. It does this through the urgency to urinate and pain. This is SUPER simplified it\u2019s more complex but looking at what were my bladders \u201ctrigger\u201d foods has helped heal the bladder lining. Unfortunately it\u2019s a lot of trial and error. Eat something acidic (like lemonade- this sends me to the er in pain) and see how you react. \n\nI\u2019m NOT a medical provider so take this with a grain of salt and do what\u2019s best for you and consult a urologist. This is what has helped ME: take prelief before you eat anything acidic. This can be found over the counter. However, you cannot take this daily because it will cause kidney stones. It is just meant as an occasional supplement to help. Drink enough water to flush your bladder daily even if you choose not to eat. The acidity in your blood has to leave your body somehow. A heating pad helps with the pain. Work with your dietician to see what foods you\u2019re eating that could be too acidic. This does NOT mean do not eat them. You may just need to take prelief beforehand. Amazon also sells urine acidity strips. This helps to know whether you need to drink more water. Lastly, make sure you do not have an untreated UTI.",

The problem is all they do.Is medically stabilize you and I mean barely but then you still have all your medical complications and your left to go home still under weight and with no dietician no help of any kind. And i'm disabled so I can't afford to pay a dietician since they're not covered by insurance and I'm poor as can be. So, therefore, any progress that was made during recovery?I can't continue outside of treatment.And I end up going back to my regular.Eating patterns which is restricting losing what weight that I gained and not ever being weighing enough to be able to get anything to work properly again if it were going to.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nLike they either need to keep you long enough to keep you to a healthy weight and then teach you how to maintain it outside of impatient or if they're gonna let you go when you're still under weight.They need to set app services that are paid for to help you.Get to a healthy weight and then teach you how to maintain it on your own at home.",

Now we hit 40 and we are at it ahain, sick and in pain and having body failing early all ober  . here we again at it. \nThere are horrible things its done physically. God wait till people start dealing with PET disorder . \nBut you begin thinking how useless this all was  \n\nAs we age we find out that most people are involved in their own heads about themselves.  \nAnd we live our life thinking we are center stage.  Wondering who noticed a gain . Who noticed a loss. \nFrankly NO ONE  And whoever does ,doesn't even care. \nIt's on our minds. The ed literally drives every thought, feeling,decision, action. \nBesides PET and loss of teeth , vision peeing, pooping etc \n\nThe WORST thing is that it took my whole life. \n\nI did nothing that matters. \nNo kids was scared to be fat.\nNo loving another person when your busy dealing with health issues so much you can't meat men and when u date it's exhausting.  \nAnd the thoughts that take over your brain. \n\nYou notice that other people around you really LIVE LIVES. \n\nThey are having moments that passed us because we are wrapped into this  \nWhen other laugh it's real laughs. When I laugh I hope I didn't look fat  in my stomach  . \nThey have actual fulfillment.  We don't we aren't in our brains and we can't be in our bodies  it's the ed that is. \nSo we are walking zombies \n\nI realized my whole life - is wasn't existing.\n\nI absolutely put nothing into this world. And what's even worse is there are so many people and even kids that are a part of this word and love life and it gets taken away from them ,but we are dead inside and falling apart but still stuck alive. \nTalk about feeling guilty. \nPeople get sick of you being sick and push away to go live life  \nWe go back into our heads with our ed  \nYou spend your life making your body the way you want it,  and during that time- WE LOST TIME.  \n \nJust When u get that perfect wieght and you love seeing all the bones, you start to fall apart.  \n.\nI wish I could go back in time during  14 years of real recovery.  But then there comes that relapse that was \"impossible\"\n\nI regret evey bit of time i wasted. I wanted to actually live a life of doing what would make an impact.  Get married and settle down. \n\nNo significant other wants to deal with the issues.  And when the health problems start those vows suddenly mean crap cuy you are dragging them down.  \nIt just made my vidy fall apart early  \n\nAnd again- the actual QUESTION IS.... WHAT MAKES BEING TOO THIN MY IDENTITY? WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN AND WHERE DID I GO? \n\n So what did we do it for if it got us nothing in life. Not money not love not happiness not changing anything for the good. We didn't participate. \n\nI lost not just a physical body ,but I never had an actual life to live because it ruined everything and it wasn't ME.

Even when I was in treatment centers , I remember always asking them to put my Air conditioning on when no one else was hot but me.\u00a0\n\n\nBut back then at least I was still getting cold. Now i'm only hot and nothing seems to relieve it. So doctors aren't sure if I were to gain weight if That would help it or if it would still be permanently malfunctioned.But they do think that the anorexia is a huge cause in my hypothalmus not working right. I would gain weight in an instant if I knew that that would get this hotness to go away.But since they don't know , i'm very fearful to do that.\n\n\nPlus they said it wouldn't happen right away that it would probably take a couple years and I have so much weight to gain that I would have to go to a treatment center And I can't do that because i'm out of insurance and don't have the money for that since i've been 5x already",

I have severe osteoporosis , elevated liver enzymes and Permanent damage in both my brain and body. The worst part for me is I have what's called hypothemic dysfunction from the years of no periods and anorexia making my hypothesis not be able to regulate my temperature.\u00a0\nThey want me to go to treatment again and gain weight to see if that hotness will go away with wt gain treatment. But I was told by endocrinologist and gynecologist who aren't Ed specialists if course thatvmy hypothalmus dysfunctuon may never be fixable and that the severe heat intolerance and feeling severely hot 24/7 may nit go away even with wt gain.\u00a0\n\n\nSo that is what is keeping me from getting treatment again?Is I feel like what's the point if they're saying that that won't get better? Also i've been to impatient treatment five times in my life and it's never helped anything before. But back then I didn't have this symptom.\u00a0",

I think recovering from anorexia takes more than inpatient treatment. I think it takes an entire treatment team that you have when you are back home. But inpatient can work for medical stability",

And i'm disabled so I can't afford to pay a dietician since they're not covered by insurance and I'm poor as can be. So, therefore, any progress that was made during recovery?I can't continue outside of treatment.And I end up going back to my regular.Eating patterns which is restricting losing what weight that I gained and not ever being weighing enough to be able to get anything to work properly again if it were going to.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nLike they either need to keep you long enough to keep you to a healthy weight and then teach you how to maintain it outside of impatient or if they're gonna let you go when you're still under weight.They need to set app services that are paid for to help you.Get to a healthy weight and then teach you how to maintain it on your own at home.",

Because it\u2019s a slow and painful death. It takes everything from you. It\u2019s all fun and games until you can\u2019t get out of bed anymore, until talking for more than 5 minutes takes your breath away. \n\nI\u2019m 26 now, and god, if I could go back 10 years and tell her where she would be if she kept going as she was\u2026. I might have saved her.",

Because I am never cold anymore ever...it's that i'm always severely hot with hotness 24/7 and severe heat intolerance.\u00a0\n\n\nMy endocrinologist and gynecologist are not eating disorder specialists but they believe that this is due to my anorexia turning off my hypothesis from regulating properly causing the hotness. The problem is they're not sure that with me having this for thirty years , if weight gain would even turn my hypothalmus back on and get it to work properly and take my severe hotness and heat intolerance away. So obviously i'm afraid to detreatment again unless I knew that that would actually fix itself. Plus i've been impatient five times so i've used all my insurance and money already.\u00a0\n\n\nSo do you have this severe heat intolerance and feeling hot all the time? Has your doctors told you if weight gain would make this symptom go away and regulate your hypothesis? My drs don't know. Does yours?",

They tried Harmon replacement therapy with an estrogen patch and progesterone last year.And it didn't even help, but maybe 10%.So even though my hormones are low , they don't feel that's the only cause. They feel that a typoc dysfunction caused by years of anorexia.And being underweight. But the thing they're not knowing is they don't know if that will regulate if I get to a normal weight again after thirty years of having such bad anorexia and like 5 periods my entire life.\u00a0",

I mean.\nI don't know who to ask unless I try calling like an Ed treatment center.
