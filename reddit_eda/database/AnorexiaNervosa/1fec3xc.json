  "title": "Saddest/scariest moments during my anorexia",
  "selftext": "Thinking about these awful moments during my eating disorder helps to motivate me to do better, to not get worse. An eating disorder does not just affect the person who has the illness. It will affect everyone around you that cares about you. Even if you think they aren't paying attention, usually, if someone loves you and cares about you, no matter how hard you try to hide it, they are going to eventually notice you not eating/losing weight and say something to you. \n\n1, One of the saddest moments I can remember is when it was around my birthday and I was severely ill and had lost a lot of weight. And my mom asked me to weigh myself in front of her and then she broke down in tears when she saw how low the number was. So for the rest of the day, all I could think about was her reaction and how much my illness was hurting her. I had a difficult time enjoying my birthday because her reaction upset me and I just felt terrible for making her worry. \n\n2. When I was staying with my grandparents, I would go out jogging, every day, on this big hill. I was really sick then. My grandfather told me that every day, he wished it would rain, so that I wouldn't be able to jog and lose more weight. He started crying and told me he didn't want anything to happen to me. This reminded me that even when you think your family isn't paying attention or doesn't notice your behaviors around food and weight, they are noticing. I've never forgotten the look on my grandfather's face when he told me that. \n\n3. On a vacation to the beach with my cousin's family, I dressed in layers, oversized hoodies and jeans, during the entire trip, even when it was hot out. I had such a distorted view of my body that I didn't realize how sick I looked then. And I didn't want others to ask questions about my weight loss, so I tried to hide it. But everyone noticed my weight loss and behaviors. I took my bathroom scale on the trip. And would spend lots of time in the bathroom checking my weight on the trip. My uncle noticed I had a difficult time eating and he started asking me what he could do to help. He was very understanding and made me feel not alone. But the trip was hard to enjoy because I cared more about what the scale said at the time, instead of focusing on having fun at the beach\n\n4. Being told in inpatient treatment that I was at risk of dying at the time and that I needed to take this seriously and work on the eating disorder now. I was younger and just wasn't thinking about the future back then. It's not my fault I have an eating disorder, but it's something I think about often. I was seriously ill at the time and just kept saying to everyone that it wasn't that bad and I could handle it. I refused to listen to the people in inpatient at the time, and quickly relapsed and refused residential treatment as soon as I got out of inpatient. Then, I stayed sick for years. And never worked on getting better. I'm now realizing what a mistake that was, because now I have severe medical complications and my illness is chronic. I'm trying to get better, but it's not easy. My doctor told me to not be too hard on myself, as I didn't choose to be sick. \n\n5. Meeting a good friend in inpatient treatment, who was also anorexic. Becoming close friends with her for years, writing her letters and calling her on the phone. And then finding out later that she died from complications of her eating disorder. She was one of my closest friends and very kind. And I've never forgotten her. \n\n6. When I wasn't answering my phone one day, my dad drove to my apartment and knocked on the door, worried. I didn't realize he was worried. He said he had been trying to contact me for hours and I wasn't answering my phone. Something was wrong with my phone that day and his calls weren't showing up in  my phone. My dad, who rarely cries, broke down in tears, saying he thought I had died from my eating disorder and that's why I wasn't answering the phone. I felt so bad and tried to reassure my dad I was fine. But seeing my family cry is something that stays with me. Even if I argue with my parents sometimes about my disorder, they are always here for me. They don't always understand my eating disorder behaviors, but I know they love me a lot and would be sad if anything happened to me\n\n  \n7. When I fainted in front of my dad and he caught me in his arms and my mom ran over to me, panicking. That was really scary and I am glad my parents were there to make sure I was okay\n\n8. Being so obsessed with my scale that I had to have it with me at all times and cared more about what it said, than anything else. I've since gotten rid of my scale and my doctor said that's a great thing. But I do remember, for years, the scale was one of the most important things in my life\n\nEating disorders are not fun, or cute or enjoyable. They are painful, isolating and scary. Painful not only to the person, but everyone around them. ",

I usually try to push these memories away but remembering helps, and I deeply relate to what you posted. It feels a bit like I\u2019m sharing some of your pain as well. We deserved better than to live through horrible experiences such as these. I send a lot (a lot!) of love your way, and the biggest hug I am capable of.",
