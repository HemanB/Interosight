  "selftext": "So many people scoff at people with EDs like we're trying to promote a toxic mindset or something. I've had close friends complain about coworkers and people they know \"doing eating disorder things\" and they'll complain with the utmost disgust in their voice. It sucks not being able to open up to anyone about this because they'll think I'm just trying to get an influencer's body or that I'm just trying to make THEM feel ashamed about themselves for being heavier.

But somehow people almost have more compassion for people with substance abuse\u2026. I don\u2019t know.  I am just rambling on here\u2026 I get your point.   This is another area where you just have to focus on you and not worry about what others say or think or do.  Just walk on minding your own business your issues and your actions\n\nWhat others think of me is none of my business.",

And then we enter this day and age where we have to try even harder to feel valid because it seems like everyone is starving to be skinny. I hate society lol.",
