This applies to people in recovery and those who have recovered but may be triggered by a day of religious fasting.\n\nIf you want to participate but cannot fast, do a little extra for your relationship with God on these days like saying prayers or going to a morning mass.\n\nDo not feel guilty, God would want you healthy and happy.",

Or doing a self care activity everyday, as God says that our body is a temple. Maybe lent means giving up videogames or smoking or alcohol or using reddit or tumblr and using that extra time and energy to praise God and love on yourself and others",

Your opinion on religion does not dictate who can practice their religion nor where they can discuss it.\n\nI hope you find something that helps you through this hard time in your life, and I wish you the best.
