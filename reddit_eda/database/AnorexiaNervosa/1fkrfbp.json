It\u2019s a parasitic mental lllness, that you\u2019re not choosing to have, even if it feels that way. Pls give yourself some compassion and forgiveness, and don\u2019t double down on behaviors if this is causing you feelings of guilt and shame. I pushed people away, was self centered and yes more irritable. Not sure if you\u2019re ready for recovery, but maybe it can be motivation? I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re feeling this way, you\u2019re not alone\u2764\ufe0f\n\nEdit: another analogy- I have bipolar disorder and my episodes can cause me to feel pessimistic and suicidal, when my baseline is usually positive. Mental illness can seriously distort everything. The illness causes me to feel things and act in ways that aren\u2019t part of my normal value system.",

ED's happen for many different reasons, some genetic, some environmental, sometimes trauma. And like any other sick person, you have two options: Staying where you're at or try to get better. There's no right or wrong answer, both sides have good and bad consequences. But I will say, your loved one's miss you. They want YOU back, not the shell your ED uses as a host. And if you ever decide you want to get rid of the parasite that is anorexia, we'll all be here for you<3",
