Its so Simple, everyone will see the second person sicker than the other one and im so jealous that it doesnt matter how much weight the ppl who were overweight lost, the skinny ones will be always look skinnier.\nIt doesnt even matter if i lost more or not, bc they would be always skinny and im so fucking tired of it.\n\n",
