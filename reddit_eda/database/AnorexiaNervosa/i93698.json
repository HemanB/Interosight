  "selftext": "The Whole time I\u2019ve been at my ED SERVICES I have never seen another person there at the same time as me (maybe on purpose?). Well today was the first time it happened, I walked out with my therapist and there was another female there. I dont know why but I looked like a deer in the headlights. Both of us were just staring at each other , looking up and down. Especially due to COVID I haven\u2019t seen many people really and automatically the thoughts were there about comparing myself. then my therapist rushed me along to leave and I was just struck. It\u2019s honestly been the strangest thing to happen to me for a while",
