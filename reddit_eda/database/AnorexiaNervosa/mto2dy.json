  "title": "Recovery feels like \"giving up\"",
  "selftext": "\\*\\*\\*Disclaimer: This is NOT a pro-ED post, nor am I trying to discourage anyone from seeking recovery. This is literally just me venting, don't take it too seriously plz lol\n\nSo I know logically that recovery is a good thing and something I should want and feel proud of myself for doing. However, it just feels so opposite to everything my mind has been trained to think for so long. Like I hear people saying that recovery takes so much \"strength\" and \"willpower\" and \"dedication\" and \"discipline\" but... these were always characteristics I associated with my eating disorder. Like... I felt like restricting and losing weight meant i was strong; abstaining from \"junk food\" took willpower; going for a run in the rain was dedication; staying under my calorie limit was disciplined. Because it's hard af to actually do those things!! Now you're telling me that what I always thought was \"weak\" and \"lazy\" and \"self-indulgent\" and \"the easy way out,\" such as eating more calories, gaining weight, not exercising everyday, etc is actually what requires hard work and dedication and strength?? But how?! That feels like giving up and being weak, not being strong.\n\nSometimes this feeling gives me a bit of imposter syndrome about my ED. I tell myself that if I had a \"real\" ED, then I wouldn't feel this way. I feel like a \"fake\" or \"bad\" anorexic. If I was *actually* anorexic, then maybe eating *would* feel more difficult. Idk, I hope this makes any sense :P",

      "body": "I think that what people mean about the \u2018strength\u2019 or \u2018willpower\u2019 to do things in recovery is not about the behaviours. Yes, restricting and over exercising are \u2018harder\u2019 than eating a normal sized meal and then not going for a run...but the difficulty in recovery is challenging the thought processes that make you think you are bad, weak or a failure for allowing yourself food or taking it easy. What people are praising is the incredible amount of psychological energy it takes to challenge and resist the self critical thoughts that place judgments on the behaviours. Sure- the physical ACTS of recovery are easy- but managing the negative emotions and distress they cause is not. Recovery is totally about giving up...it\u2019s giving up a set of behaviours that allow you to feel safe and then actually starting the hard work of figuring out why you needed the behaviours in the first place.",
