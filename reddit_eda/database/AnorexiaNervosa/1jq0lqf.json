  "selftext": "When I first became sick, I denied there was a problem. I pushed away help. I became very secretive. When people tried to get me to eat more or asked me about my weight, I said I was fine and nothing was wrong. This line of thinking quickly changes as soon as you start to feel the affects of this disorder. It starts off with wanting to lose weight. Everyone has a reason that the illness starts. Then you start obsessing over it. So it no longer becomes something that you can just stop. Soon the number is all you think about. You start feeling cold, feeling weak, and become afraid of gaining weight. And in the back of your mind, you know it's unhealthy. But you have a hard time time stopping the behavior. When I ended up in the hospital for anorexia, I pushed away the help. I didn't think I needed to be there. So I just would not listen to people when they were telling me this is serious and to treat it early. I was stubborn and deep in my disorder. This was when I had only been anorexic for two years. So it wasn't chronic at that point. I was younger and just not considering the future and the consequences of not treating this. While in the hospital, I was very anxious and afraid. It was probably one of the most difficult times in my life.  What made it easier was the other people there who were also dealing with eating disorders. It made me feel not alone. I went through two hospitalizations for anorexia. They told me I had osteoporosis. They wanted me to go to residential treatment. I just did not listen. And after I got out of the hospital, I went right back to losing weight. This is where my behaviors started to become more entrenched. I tried outpatient therapy a few times. However, I never stuck to outpatient treatment. And my disorder became more severe. Years later, I have severe and enduring anorexia. I have never reached a point in my illness where I managed to fully recover. And I feel a sense of sadness and regret that I did not listen to my treatment team years ago. However, it is not my fault I developed this disorder. Now I suffer from very severe medical complications as a result of prolonged malnutrition. I was unaware these complications could happen as a result of starvation. My body can no longer absorb the nutrients properly from the food I eat. This means I lose weight without trying and have a difficult time gaining weight. When I attempt to eat more, I get stomach pain and digestive issues, and feel hunger after eating. And it makes gaining weight difficult. I also have painful and frequent urination, which I have been unable to successfully treat.  The pain has made me more stressed and anxious. And when I get stressed and anxious, I have a hard time motivating myself to stick to treatment. So I am essentially staying at home a lot, in severe pain from these symptoms. It makes me feel like I can't go out and do things, and that will affect a person's mental health. And the pain never stops. Along with these complications, I feel tired and have become more depressed. My treatment team includes a therapist, a doctor and a nutritionist. However, I am very rigid in my thinking and have autism, along with the anorexia nervosa. I have sensory issues around eating and difficulty adjusting to new routines. This is likely why inpatient treatment was so difficult for me. When someone on my treatment team recommends I try something to make myself feel better, I do not always follow through with what they are asking me to do. I do not like change and have fear around it. But a part of me knows that in order to get better from something like anorexia, you have to accept certain changes. I know there are treatment programs out there for those with severe and enduring anorexia and autism. This is an awful disorder. It not only causes pain to the person who is going through it, but to everyone who cares about them. My parents are very supportive and help me with things, but even after I have struggled with this for a long time, they do not always understand my eating disorder and why it is so hard for me to recover from it. Everyone who has this disorder deserves support and understanding. It is not your fault that you have this illness. If I could go back in time, I would have treated this sooner, before it became worse. But I know I can't change the past. I don't want to be in constant pain and I want to feel better. While anorexia is a difficult illness to have, there are people who care and want to help you get through it",
