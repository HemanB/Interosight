I havent weighed myself in a long time, for obvious reasons but ive always been in whats considered appropriate range for my height. But when i look in the mirror i look huge. I don't understand why. \ni haven't eaten in a couple days and i'm starting to notice a difference. im worried that since i see the results i want when i stop eating that ill keep seeing how long i can go. i pretty much just eat enough to stay alive.",

People who are genetically susceptible may trigger these mechanisms when they lose too much weight.",
