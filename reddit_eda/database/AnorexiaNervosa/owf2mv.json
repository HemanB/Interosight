  "selftext": "It\u2019s like a cult leader that convinces you to stay faithful by turning down dinner with friends, staying in your room alone when your parents make you food, missing out on networking opportunities bc the work event has appetizers, and even when you do decide to socialize you have this voice screaming in your head the whole time about \u201cdon\u2019t eat that\u201d, \u201cyou\u2019re a pig, you\u2019re weak if you eat that\u201d and it keeps you from making a genuine connection with anyone.  It fogs up every conversation.  It wants you to be friends with it, and it alone.  It will yell at you until you push everyone away, and are starving , alone.  That\u2019s what it freaking wants\n\nI have been dealing with this all week and I\u2019m just so tired of it that I don\u2019t want to be conscious anymore",

      "body": "I feel you. Its a continuous cycle of not going out with others and feeling bad and going out with others and feeling bad. It feels like you can't win no matter what. BUT, you can win. Recovery is possible and you can recover from an ED. I wish you all the best of luck with this - choosing recovery was the best (but also one of the hardest) decisions I ever had to make, but now I am thriving - I have a life. I can go out with friends and family for food, I can go to that work event, I can sleep in instead of waking up in the middle of the night to exercise, I can actually engage in conversation with others cos my mind isn't so preoccupied with food and simply staying alive.\n\nSaying goodbye to your ED is absolutely terrifying, but is so freeing. You don't have to live with the isolation it demands.\n\nSending lots of love to each and everyone of you, you got dis \ud83d\udc85\ud83c\udffc",
