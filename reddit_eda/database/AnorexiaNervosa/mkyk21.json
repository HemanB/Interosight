  "selftext": "the title pretty much says it.   \n\n\n  \nleft and right i see people with uteruses who struggle with anorexia say that they lost their period, are worried about not being able to conceive, or going into recovery just to get it back.   \n\n\n  \non instagram i see a bunch of wellness and holistic nutritionists talking about ''getting your period back''.  \n\n\n  \ni never lost my period. thanks to the last 7 years with anorexia, i went from mildly overweight to underweight, suffered hairloss and rotting teeth and a burnt esophagus and crippling IBD and colitis.   \n\n\n  \nHowever, i never missed one period and because of that i feel like i cant really have an eating disorder and be a true anorexic and i feel like i could have recovered by now if it wasnt that im still lowkey hoping to lose my period that way i'll know that I'm truly sick. and i know its stupid and i should be happy i never experienced that but ijsfknsakjdsnkjfd its hard.   \n\n\n  \n\n\nthank you for reading if you did",

You don't have to be at your worse to accept that you have an illness or that you need help.\n\nIt's hard to accept that.
