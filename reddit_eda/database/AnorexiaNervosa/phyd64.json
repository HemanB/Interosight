  "selftext": "I met a girl at school who was pretty and skinny, was in honors classes, had long hair, and instead of admiring her or using her as a role model I hated her instantly. When I listened to her talk from afar (eavesdropping) I got annoyed at how confident and beaming she was, she bragged about her straight teeth and then when someone commented on how thin she was at some point she accepted the compliment. I wasn't apart of this conversation, I was basically spying and I feel like a jerk for doing that. I started having dreams where that one girl would call me fat and I would cry.",
