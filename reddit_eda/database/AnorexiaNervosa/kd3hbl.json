  "selftext": "So I was diagnosed early this year with anorexia, while my mom has anorexic tendencies only (meaning not a full blown eating disorder). The thing is, she doesn't know about my eating disorder (just my dad) but we've kinda been on the same boat.\n\nRecently, we bought a crazy amount of seasonal fruits and we made a fruit salad. I, at the very beginning of my ED, was very afraid of fruits but I forced a habit onto myself, which was to eat fruits as much as I want, cause I refused to put them under my \"fear food\" list. I just love them too much to do that.\n\nMy mom, however, only sticks to oranges and apples because she's absolutely afraid of bananas and pretty much all fruits BUT when she saw me grab two plates of fruit salad, she kinda got encouraged into grabbing one herself and SHE CUT A BANANA INTO IT. I'm gonna cry tears of joy. Knowing I involuntarily gave her a push I\u2014\ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95",
