All the while I've been struggling with bulimia, but my weight has been stable and it hasn't been noticeable. During covid my old symptoms of anorexia flared up, and I decided to open up to my therapist about it as I had lost a lot of weight and it worried her. She had no idea of my past history with eating disorders, and asked my permission to forward me to a specialist. I said yes, with the promise of not being forced into recovery.  The specialist kinda just asked me a loooot of questions and diagnosed me with anorexia and bulimia after seeing my fitness apps, haha. I did most of the talking, and it feels nice to be taken seriously.  \nIf you're struggling, I highly recommend you talk to your doctor about it. Where I live, they can send you to therapy and specialists, and I think it's a very good place to start, if you see a good one. <3",
