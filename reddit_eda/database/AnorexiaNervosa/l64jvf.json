  "selftext": "Does any ony else have this feeling where when you eat something it feels like it does not only make your stomach full but everything else too? It also works the other way around: if i don't eat e.g. my arms just somehow feel skinnier after a couple of hours. But then one bite of a \"bad\" food can make my skin feel like i just gained weight even though i know i haven't even digested it??!? \n\nIt's really not that i don't know that it isn't real, but it's just such a strange feeling...",
