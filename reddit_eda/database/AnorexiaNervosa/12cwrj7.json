  "selftext": "Hello friends\u2014\n\nI\u2019ve been MIA for some time now, both having been in Inpatient and just needing to step away from these communities for a moment. \n\nI wanted to share with you all that I am currently in kidney failure, and awaiting lab results to determine which stage I am at. I am only 32 years old. There is little hope that I can recover at this point without major medicinal intervention, of which I am not willing to do. I have suffered long enough, and wish to die with my dignity. \n\nI have suffered for over 25 years with this terrible illness, and I wanted to compassionately warn you all that death by EDs is a VERY REAL THING. I hope this shakes you to your core. I am 32 and dying. It could be within days, or months, but I will die from this. \n\nI wish you all nothing but healing, and peace. I am terrified. My family is in ruins. I truly cannot believe I am writing this post.\n\nThank you to every single one of you who has sent me well wishes; I take every word to heart and I have made some beautiful connections here. You are spectacular people, and you deserve full recovery.\n\nBe well, friends \ud83e\udd0d\n\nETA: Wow, thank you all for your incredibly kind words of love and support. This is the exact energy we all need, here.\n\nIn incredibly surprising news, my lab results are in, and by some chance of all that is good in the world, almost every single value has SHOT up; not just little jumps here and there, like major life-changing amounts. My doctor, family and I are shocked, as I haven\u2019t changed any behaviors! \n\nI don\u2019t know what to make of this; is it a second chance? I have so much thinking to do. \n\nLove you every one of you! I think the prayers I have received here are what has made this happen?",
