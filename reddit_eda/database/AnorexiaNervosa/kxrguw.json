      "body": "No. I know you\u2019re trying to help, but this advice only perpetuates the binge/restrict cycle. \n\nMost of us do some form of what you describe, getting rid of the binge food in one way or another, whether it\u2019s throwing it out, eating it all in one go, giving it away, etc... when we\u2019re getting ready to \u201cget back on track.\u201d \nAll this does is reinforce the idea that some foods are bad and that we\u2019re \u201cnot allowed\u201d to have them, which increases the likelihood that we\u2019ll crave it later, and buy more when we\u2019re at our lowest, thus continuing the harmful cycle.\n\nThe water trick can be helpful if it\u2019s actually thirst we\u2019re experiencing, but it\u2019s also a commonly suggested appetite suppressant/distraction that goes around ED forums. Binge urges are more mental than physical, so the normal \u201ctricks\u201d to suppress appetite or try to treat potential thirst instead don\u2019t work as well. Unfortunately, the only way to deal with binge eating is to break the binge and restrict cycle. You have to forgive yourself after a binge, NOT RESTRICT, and allow yourself to eat at the next meal time you have.\n\nI know this is so so hard, and it\u2019s uncomfortable, but throwing away your trigger foods doesn\u2019t solve anything, it just prolongs the cycle. We have to learn to exist in the same space as our trigger foods, and every instance of saying \u201cI don\u2019t want that right now\u201d or \u201cmaybe I\u2019ll have some later\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t need to eat the whole thing, it\u2019ll still be here tomorrow\u201d is a SUCCESS that you should be proud of!",
