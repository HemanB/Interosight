In the hallway (within earshot of the full waiting room) after my GP called my name, he asked if I had lost weight, got me to step on the scales and said my weight out loud. Then he congratulated me for my weight loss, asked me how I did it and then laughed and brushed it off when I said it is from starving myself. He KNOWS about my ED and he still did this. Then, when I asked for nausea medication to help me keep my food down when I do actually eat (which makes me feel super nauseas), he said \u201cBut why? You make yourself vomit anyway\u201d since I purge sometimes. This appointment was also for something entirely unrelated to my weight and ED. I am speechless.",

(this was the beginning of my ed) I went to the GP because of it and expressed everyone\u2019s concerns and mine and told them I need help before I fall down the rabbit hole. My GP told me to step on the weight scales and I refused and explained its because it will trigger me. \n\nMy GP laughed in my face, and told me I didn\u2019t have an eating disorder I just have anxiety and prescribed me anxiety meds, 3 months later i had a check up with a different doctor due to my depo injection (contraception injections) went on the weight scales and saw i lost alarming amount of weight. Which is when she the doctor who claimed i have anxiety rang me up because of it and said \u201chey we would like you go back to the doctors because I believe you have an eating disorder and we\u2019d like to give you support\u201d I repeated everything she told me that day and put the phone down on her.\n\nI don\u2019t understand how people expect us to get help when the GP\u2019s treats us like this, im sorry for your experience. No one should be treated like that.",
