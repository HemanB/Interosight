  "selftext": "I\u2019m desperately in need of some way to fix my thinking and relationship with food. My relationship with myself and my boyfriend is struggling because I\u2019m not eating or purging all the time, and I\u2019m getting dizzy and almost blacking out from lack of food or low blood sugar or something I\u2019m not sure 100%, but that\u2019s beside the point. I know I need to get better but at the same time I want to lose more weight and be thinner so more people notice before I recover. I know how messed up that sounds but that\u2019s really how I think n honestly idk what to do anymore. I wish my boyfriend would somehow find this post so he would just know how I felt but I also know that won\u2019t happen.",

When going without food for a while (and if you\u2019re purging), you absolutely need at least potassium, magnesium, and sodium, every day. \n\nAdding electrolyte powder (there are no sugar and no calorie options) and salt to some water can help with this. Magnesium in particular can also be taken as a capsule.",
