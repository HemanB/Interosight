  "selftext": "\"I don't think you look that sick\". I've been told this many times before. Today, my therapist said this. But the way she looked at me, I knew she didn't mean \"You're not sick enough\". She meant \"We can still help you before it's too late\". I'm not taking these words like knives to my chest again. I'm twisting them, I'm finding meaningful messages behind them. I'm not letting my ED hurt me again",
