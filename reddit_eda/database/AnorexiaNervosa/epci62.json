Shes super supportive of the pictures I post, but often remarks how thin i am and how she wishes she could be and all of this. And I have to sit there and tell her over and over on ever picture it's a disorder and she doesnt want this. \n\nSome people just dont understand the magnitude. \n\nThey see the small number on the pants line and on the scale. But they dont see the bruises on the spine from just sitting in a chair with a hard back too long, or constantly shifting how you're sitting because you're butt or hips are starting to ache since theres no real support. They dont know how much easier it is to get kidnapped because you weigh so little and you're so tired from not eating (and probably overdoing cardio and core work outs) you cant protect yourself fully. The constant feeling of being cold and having poor circulation since you have literally no insulation.  They dont see the projectile vomiting and horrible stomach viruses because your stomach acid is burning the lining and any virus you catch can get so much worse than what it usually is and needing IVs because it just wont stop. Most movements feel like your body is just filled with sand from exhaustion and the body eating away the muscle. \n\nYou do not want this body. This body is malfunctioning. My brain is killing my body.\n\nLove yours and treat it well.",
