I am at the point where I am worried this will eventually kill me. but I tried to recover and I couldn't and now I feel too weak to try. it's a sad reality of eating disorders. recovery may feel like torture for some people, but living with anorexia for years and slowly dying from it is also pure torture.",

It gets easier and easier everyday. And looking back, I feel silly that I wasted so much time staying in my disorder because I thought it would be near impossible. \n\nDon't get me wrong, it's not easy. But most of the tortures of recovery are only torturous because your disorder doesn't want the unhealthy coping mechanisms to go away. Your disorder makes you think that staying disordered is less torturous than recovery. Just like a drug addict, the first few days of withdrawal are miserable enough to make you want to give up on getting sober but after the withdrawals are over, it gets easier and easier with every breath you take to not use drugs. Especially if you develop healthy coping mechanisms that you can lean on in times of stress or upset instead of turning back to your addiction. \n\nThe disorder is torturous and the only escape from it is death or recovery. The torture of recovery is temporary and leads you out of long term suffering.",

While I was at Monte Nido they had me go out to AA meetings - I remember coming back from one feeling so frustrated at treatment and meetings, and asking in group - if AA teaches me that I will always be an addict and can never fully recover, how is that so different with my eating disorder? How is it possible for me to be 100% recovered from my obsession and compulsion re: ED but not my obsession and compulsion re: drugs?\n\n\n\nNo one had an answer for me.\n\n\n\n(they also loved my abusive, pedo, much older boyfriend - a biiiig driver of my ED at the time - but that's a whoooole other fucking story lmao)\n\n\n\nin any case: I believe fully in the efficacy of harm reduction. it is a concept that is important to me, and feels near and dear to my heart because of my treatment experiences that left me with an all or nothing attitude about recovery. I can put myself at less risk, even if I engage in \"risky\" behaviors, and I think that is important (certainly let me use heroin IV for over a decade without getting HIV or even HepC, despite using with partners who had it)",
