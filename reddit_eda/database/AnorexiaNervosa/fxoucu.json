  "selftext": "When I was underweight, I wasn't happy because I looked like a sickly stick. I was simultaneously \"too fat\" in my own mind, while being too skinny because I still wanted to have boobs and a butt.\n\nWhen the vitamin deficiencies and anemia took their toll, even when I was at a \"normal\" weight, I wasn't happy.\n\nI don't know if I have AN, since i'm not afraid to eat carbs or anything like that. \n\nI just feel like me not being skinny enough is the root of my unhapiness. Obviously that isn't true, since I wasn't happy at any weight. But I just can't help myself feeling this way.\n\nNow, being at a healthy weight and pretty active, I feel like that is the last stepping stone to being totally over this. Starting seeing a therapist, and will be reporting back on how everything goes.",
