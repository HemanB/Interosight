I used to have a youtube channel with a moderate amount of subscribers and the videos where I looked more sick or was very underweight got drastically more views then when I was healthy. So it's counterintuitive to have a YouTube channel for recovery for most people in my opinion because you get reinforcement by more views and subscribers when sick or underweight.",
