I know it feels like failure but it's just biology, and it happens to everyone. Although it doesn't feel like it, it's actually your body keeping you alive. The only way to stop the cycle is to work on recovery as a whole, that is targeting restriction. I didn't believe this for a long time, I thought I'd just end up bingeing forever. But it ended up being true. Once you start nourishing and re feeding your body properly you won't end up binge eating. Sending love to you I know this process is really hard.",

          "body": "Most people with eating disorders transition between them, and it's also completely normal to binge eat once you start eating again because your body is in starvation mode and it's desperate to get fed. I know it feels like failure but it's just biology, and it happens to everyone. Although it doesn't feel like it, it's actually your body keeping you alive. The only way to stop the cycle is to work on recovery as a whole, that is targeting restriction. I didn't believe this for a long time, I thought I'd just end up bingeing forever. But it ended up being true. Once you start nourishing and re feeding your body properly you won't end up binge eating. Sending love to you I know this process is really hard.",

Even though they seem like opposites they're part of the same thing. I know this is a really scary and confronting time though, and it makes is extra hard having to deal with it (mostly) alone",

You have to not purge while on Contrave though, due to the risk of seizures, which has been very motivating to me to stay on track for recovery. Haven\u2019t had any seizures so far.\n\nThe phone call with my doctor was five minutes long. All I said was \u201chi I\u2019m obese and need help please.\u201d Doctor asked me how obese and I told her the weight then she started Contrave and referred me to endocrinology immediately. Rest of the call was just her explaining what the side effects were and making me promise that I was going to be purge-free. Endocrinology was the team who started Ozempic. \n\nYou won\u2019t get Ozempic if your BMI is not high enough. You can also request a different antidepressant than Contrave if you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be able to be purge-free, it might not work as well but that\u2019s better than having a seizure which can cause permanent injury. Therapy is also usually an important part of the strategy for most people, though I personally had more success with just medication.",
