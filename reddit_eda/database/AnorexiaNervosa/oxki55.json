  "selftext": "So, I just read something to my boyfriend, the man who is supposed to love me. It was a blog post I wrote about how scary it is to see physical changes in my body from anorexia and having to accept this could kill me. I poured my fucking heart out. I asked him numerous times if he was sure he wanted me to read it before I hesitantly did.\nWhat I got in return was my boyfriend literally screaming at me, telling me that \"all I need to do is eat!\" Not a gentle prodding, but a screaming at the top of his lungs, \"you're just making excuses\" and \"you're not trying because you think you need professional help to get better when all you need to do is eat!\" When I said I needed support and I had nobody to help me, he proceeded to scream at me more, telling me he's \"tried it my way for months and I've only gotten worse\" and that what I need is to be \"forced to eat, forced to get better.\" Then he threatened to commit me. So, that was awesome. Am I wrong here? I told him he can't fix this. He refuses to believe that. But then when his approach doesn't work, it's my fault. I get that he's scared because he loves me and doesn't want me to die, but this only pushes me away more and makes me want to eat even less. Not to mention, when I eat something that was really hard for me, he doesn't get that. He just says I need to eat more than that. How do I deal with this? Any tips? I've tried telling him to research eating disorders, but that's gone nowhere.",

We were together for about four years (broke up a couple times). I loved him so much, but he had difficulty understanding my eating disorder. He reacted the way your boyfriend did quite a few times. We had multiple blow up fights, because he would get so frustrated with me. I wouldn't eat out at restaurants with him, and I had to have my safe foods all the time at specific scheduled times or I'd have a panic attack (I still do these things). He eventually did some research and tried to educate himself, but he still never fully grasped why I was that way. He was such a logical thinker, and I'm extremely emotional. I would explain to him how I was feeling, and he would say, \"it doesn't matter how you feel; these are the facts.\" I don't blame him for leaving me, because I didn't change/get better. Still, I wished he could have stayed. He said I didn't love him anymore, because I didn't TRY to change. I was trying though, and I have been...but it was never enough in his eyes. I don't know. This disease sucks.\n\nI got back to a \"healthy\" weight after being at my lowest, but all of my mental shit is still here and my body image is WAY worse. I was almost admitted to an inpatient facility, and he was gonna break up with me if I did. I was able to move back in with my parents instead, so we stayed together. It was hard though. \n\nI apologize for rambling about my experience, haha. I guess what I'm trying to say is that he has to be willing to put in the time and effort to research eating disorders and at least TRY to support you and understand. And you have to be willing to put in the work on yourself to try to recover. That is the only way your relationship will survive. If he truly loves you, he will try, but he needs to understand that eating disorders are EXTREMELY difficult to treat, and he will need to be patient with you. So so patient.",

It's just as heartbreaking to realize that no matter how much I may love my boyfriend, I can't get better for him. And no matter how much he may love me, he can't fix my problem. I speak with a therapist once a week, but she isn't experienced in eating disorders. I'm fortunate to have her, though, because I don't have health insurance and I can't afford to pay out of pocket, nor do I qualify for state health insurance based on income. I'm one of the in betweeners; I make too much money for state health insurance, but not enough to get my own. So, I see this therapist through a mental health block grant. She is trying to reach out to ED programs, but hasn't found any. I do what I can on my own, but not having support from anyone other than my therapist makes things harder. It feels impossible doing this alone.",

I was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa 14 years ago. This is the worst I've been since then. I should mention that I'm also an addict. I never really recovered from my ED, I just switched to drugs. Drug addiction dominated my life for the next 13 years. Now that I'm not using drugs, I've gone back to full blown anorexia nervosa. \n\nYour ex-boyfriend sounds exactly like my current boyfriend. He's all logic, and I'm all emotion. He has said the \"your feelings don't matter, these are the facts\" line so many times. That's not how I function. That's not how my mind works. My ED doesn't care about the facts. I know the reasons I restrict, the consequences of doing so, and it doesn't help me stop. My boyfriend thinks I'm not trying hard enough, too. I'm sorry yours thought the same about you. I don't believe I don't try, and I'm sure you tried so hard to be different, but couldn't. It just doesn't work that way. This disorder uses me against myself.\n\nI'm sorry you weren't able to get the help you deserved. Nobody should prevent that from happening. My boyfriend thinks I want to be hospitalized and I'm not eating because I think that only IP will work. God, I wish I had that opportunity, but that doesn't mean I'm not trying. I don't have that option, because I don't have Healthcare and I work full time. But that doesn't mean I'm purposely getting worse because of it.\n\nNow look who's rambling lol. I'm proud of you for getting to a healthy weight. I know how hard that is. I feel like you're right about how much patience it will take for this relationship to last through this. I get that my boyfriend is just scared, and he wants to believe he can fix anything because it feels safer. Accepting you are powerless over others and they can and do die, is too terrifying. I get where he's at, but I just wish he could get where I'm at, you know?",

One of my very close friends stopped talking to me for a while because of how bad my health got and they were mad I wasn\u2019t \u201ctrying harder\u201d by \u201cjust eating.\u201d It hurt a lot, and felt like he was giving up on me. But I realized it\u2019s not fair for people like them to worry about me and my ed when it *looks* like it\u2019s that easy, to \u201cjust eat\u201d and be cured. They don\u2019t have the experience so they can\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like in our shoes. I also want to ask, *are* you in recovery or trying to make recovery-oriented choices? Because if not, then your boyfriend does have a right to be worried and upset; after all, you\u2019re hurting in front of his eyes and he can\u2019t do anything to save you. It\u2019s scary and sad. I think you should refer him to some informational websites/info graphics/resources on eds.",

To other people, it makes no sense to starve when eating is something we need to do to survive, and when food is available. It makes no sense for a person to not be able to eat. I can understand that watching a person you love killing themselves is terrifying and infuriating at the same time. It's just as heartbreaking to realize that no matter how much I may love my boyfriend, I can't get better for him. And no matter how much he may love me, he can't fix my problem. I speak with a therapist once a week, but she isn't experienced in eating disorders. I'm fortunate to have her, though, because I don't have health insurance and I can't afford to pay out of pocket, nor do I qualify for state health insurance based on income. I'm one of the in betweeners; I make too much money for state health insurance, but not enough to get my own. So, I see this therapist through a mental health block grant. She is trying to reach out to ED programs, but hasn't found any. I do what I can on my own, but not having support from anyone other than my therapist makes things harder. It feels impossible doing this alone.",

They\u2019re over zoom/virtual and completely free, and they are massively helpful to a lot of people. It can be a really meaningful step to recovery to connect with other people who understand your struggle, and it\u2019s so relieving to see you\u2019re *truly not alone*. I also recommend your boyfriend attend one of their support groups for friends and family (again, virtual and completely free). I know it\u2019s not much, but EDF is a really good and completely free resource that is so helpful to a lot of people (especially given the atrocious lack of proper and affordable healthcare in this country).\n\nHere\u2019s the support group schedule link: https://eatingdisorderfoundation.org/get-help/support-groups/support-group-schedule/",
