  "selftext": "I got a recovery medallion with the day I decided to commit to recovery stamped on it. It has the NEDA symbol stamped on it with \"Still I Rise.\" This will remind me that I'm strong and still wake up every day despite what I've gone through. That I'm unstoppable!  It's made of solid silver and I carry it in a pouch with me wherever I go. \n\nI have had a couple bad days since I committed to recovery,  but that doesn't erase any progress. Relapse never erases recovery and I'm going to continue to fight! \n\nI really wanted to share this medallion with this community :) People that know me irl aren't as supportive since they don't understand. I posted my medallion on social media and had people asking what I'm recovering from. That hurt... (I talk about anorexia with people.) But they don't see it as serious. \n\nAnyways,  I really wanted to share this recovery win with you guys \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",
