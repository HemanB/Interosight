  "title": "Why do people call everything ana related \"promoting anorexia\"",
  "selftext": "I was just watching a tiktok with 2 girls showing their outfits with a sound of a crumbling stomach behind saying \"when your outfit ate but you didn't\" which in my opinion is just a harmless joke. But everyone was saying stuff like \"thats insane\" And \"ohh that's not..\". Like yeah it's not funny the fact that you're starving yourself but if you want to deal with it with jokes you don't harm anyone. people joke about other mental disorders all the time like for example depression but I don't see anyone saying they are \"promoting depression\".The thing is that we've come to a point that we can't even mention ana without being accused of glamorizing it. And I'm not saying all that just for the tiktok it was just an example because I've seen this happening multiple times. There's a difference between sharing your experience (whether that's in humorous way or not) and just straight up saying \"yeah you should starve yourself it totally works for me\" And blah blah blah like that.
