Like IME often it's not just \"your thinking around your body + weight is impaired due to your condition\" but \"lol your weight/AN means you can't think for yourself! At all! I know we've done this countless times to no positive effect but shut up you toddler, we're doing it again!\"\n\nPersonally I think the difference in how, say, imminent intervention is treated w AN vs BED lies in how uncomfortable it makes your average Joe to look at the physical result, and also in what kind of social judgment is usually cast. I.e. obesity is an everyday sight in Western culture + it's typical for people to mock it as a failing on a personal decision level vs. an illness. Someone extremely UW is not as common a sight, can make people uncomfortable bc of that, and we're more often pathologized as \"oh poor feeble little sick person who can't eat, we have to help them.\" Which leads to both more opportunities for medical help + more damaging insistence on \"help\" when it's been proven ineffective.",

      "body": "I disagree with this take for two reasons. \n\n1) as other people have already pointed out, being severely underweight will kill you much QUICKER than being severely overweight. Force feeding only happens, in my experience, if it's the only option to stop someone dying within the next few weeks. That's just not a position 99.99% of obese people are ever in. Obesity kills you slowly.\n\n2. I think it can be argued that people who overeat have a NORMAL desire (the desire to eat) turned up too high. The desire to restrict food intake, to any level, is not \"normal\". There's no evolutionary reason for that desire to be there. I think that's why restrictive EDs can seem from the outside to be \"more mentally ill\"- because it's not a desire most people have ever had. Whereas most people can understand overeating even if they've never experienced it themselves. I'm not saying that to minimise what people with BED go through btw- I know it can absolutely be horrible just the same as AN. What I mean is that it would appear that the AN brain has to be a lot more dysfunctional to have developed that coping mechanism.",

They can have a normal blood pressure, their vitals are good, heart etc (I\u2019m overweight now and I\u2019m more healthy now than in my ED) \nIf someone is in a larger body and having issues starving is not the answer and never is, everyone needs consistent and adequate nutrition and with a eating enough food and doing exercise you enjoy your body may not be as thin as you want but it will feel better. \nA lot of people in bigger bodies struggle with dieting, if you constantly are going on diets it\u2019s more likely to lead to overeating and can lead to weight gain, it also can raise your bodies set point. Starving them is setting them up to fail. They have to learn to trust their bodies too. A person can be overweight and have an eating disorder. You treat eating disorders particularly by making sure you\u2019re getting the right nutrients and enough food. If you are getting enough food your body can\u2019t trust you. Dieting can lead to binging. If a person lays in bed all the time they\u2019re probably depressed. You don\u2019t treat that by taking away food, you see a therapist and a psychiatrist. A person who is eating to cope with feelings has an eating disorder, again therapy and Seeing an eating disorder dietician. A lot of people can do more harm than help if they are not trained in eating disorders if someone has one! The problem is people see people\u2019s body as the issue but the issue isn\u2019t that, it\u2019s what\u2019s underneath. Besides the fact some medical issues and problems, disabilities, some medications and also genetics all play a role in what your body weight is. All together a person might look different and be judged, sometimes when they\u2019re fighting a hidden battle we don\u2019t know about. There\u2019s so much more at play than just \u201ceating too much and not exercising \u201c my years of anorexia and bulimia has put me in a bigger body. My dietician says I\u2019m eating a good amount, I\u2019m on my feet a lot for my job and go for walks. I believe if I wouldn\u2019t of struggled with my body for so long and my eating disorder than maybe my body would look different and maybe as my body learns to trust me my set point will go down.

The desire to restrict food intake, to any level, is not \"normal\". There's no evolutionary reason for that desire to be there. I think that's why restrictive EDs can seem from the outside to be \"more mentally ill\"- because it's not a desire most people have ever had. Whereas most people can understand overeating even if they've never experienced it themselves. I'm not saying that to minimise what people with BED go through btw- I know it can absolutely be horrible just the same as AN. What I mean is that it would appear that the AN brain has to be a lot more dysfunctional to have developed that coping mechanism.",

      "body": "So, okay. This is actually a pretty complicated conversation and it's something that applies to a *lot* of mental health conditions.\n\n  \nHere's the thing; when patients have serious physical health complications, they legally have a right to refuse care- *unless* they are deemed mentally incompetent. If someone's mental state is altered such that they are not capable of making clear and informed decisions, the choice is taken from them. The logic is this: the person in question can't meaningfully consent to treatment or consent to refuse treatment. If they survive, they will either be upset that they were given care or relieved that they are alive. We cannot know what they would *actually* want in an unaltered state, so we err on the side of caution. You can't change your mind once you're dead.  \n  \nThe same can apply to mental health. Anorexics are not capable of making sound and informed choices, especially when they are severely underweight to the point of hospitalization. They probably won't be after hospitalization either, but they won't be *actively dying*, which means it's no longer immediately dangerous and it's out of the hands of the doctors who treated them.\n\nI get that it's frustrating to have \"help\" forced when you don't want it, but the fact that you don't want it is precisely the reason it's being forced in the first place. When you have an eating disorder your judgment is clouded in multiple ways; the disorder itself, the various deficiencies, sometimes dehydration, electrolyte imbalances... and if your risk of dying without care is too high, they have to at least get you to a point of lowered risk.\n\nYou could certainly also argue, and you'd generally be correct, that obese folks with eating disorders have judgment that is just as clouded as any underweight anorexic. The difference is the immediate risk. Obesity simply does not pose the same immediate risk of death as being severely underweight.  \n  \n\n\nNow, I'm someone who believes that everyone should have absolute control over their life *and* death. But I also think that if we're gonna do this whole pro-social, cooperative society thing, we should be making sure that people are both informed about every health decision they make and in a mental state where they are able to decide. I don't think someone in the throes of a manic episode should be able to choose medically assisted suicide, for example. \n\nAnd that's not all to say the mental healthcare system is anywhere *close* to good. It's not. It's *definitely* not for eating disordered patients, who usually need highly specialized care that they can't access with the services that are usually provided to them. Many facilities treat patients poorly, it's difficult to get effective treatment, and just finding a therapist for the most minor of issues can be a long, annoying process of trial and error, let alone the deadliest mental illness out there. It's *rough-* but the core reason for that is not \"they stabilize anorexic patients without consent!\" it's a lack of funding, a lack of public awareness, a lack of care by people in positions of power.\n\n  \nI'm also going to address some of your other comments here and note that the most common cause of death in anorexics, other than suicide, is in fact heart failure. More people struggle with obesity than severe anorexia, so more obese people die to heart complications by pure numbers. But percentage-wise? Anorexia is *so much more dangerous*.",

      "body": "100/100 of anorexic people who do not want treatment will say that it's better to be left to die than it is to be forcibly tube fed, much like every suicidally depressed person will say that it's cruel to force people to stay alive after they've already decided they don't want to be here anymore. After recovery more nuance comes in. Most people will maintain that being tubed was traumatic but the idea that it would've been better to let them die is nowhere near as common. It's also true that the majority of people who attempt to kill themselves come to regret that decision/be relieved that they're still alive (I am one of those people), which doesn't match the gut feeling that suicide prevention is \"cruel\" and \"robbing people of autonomy\". \n\nThe argument that force feeding should be abandoned holds a lot more weight in people who have chronic, treatment resistant AN, because statistically their chance of recovery actually is quite minimal and at that point you are just forcing someone to stay alive for the sake of it. But that's already a thing. People in that position will often be moved to palliative care with life-saving measures being stopped. \n\nI fully believe that the mental healthcare system needs a ton of work and that ED treatment in particular needs a drastic overhaul in order to stop people from ending up in the position where they're malnourished enough to need tube feeding to begin with. But \"it's cruel and a waste of money so just give people the option to die\" is a gross oversimplification which, coming from someone with an active eating disorder, holds about the same weight as an alcoholic arguing against the existence of rehab facilities.\n\nEdit: changed phrasing to be more accurate",

The desire to restrict food intake, to any level, is not \"normal\". There's no evolutionary reason for that desire to be there. I think that's why restrictive EDs can seem from the outside to be \"more mentally ill\"- because it's not a desire most people have ever had. Whereas most people can understand overeating even if they've never experienced it themselves. I'm not saying that to minimise what people with BED go through btw- I know it can absolutely be horrible just the same as AN. What I mean is that it would appear that the AN brain has to be a lot more dysfunctional to have developed that coping mechanism.",

After recovery more nuance comes in. Most people will maintain that being tubed was traumatic but the idea that it would've been better to let them die is nowhere near as common. It's also true that the majority of people who attempt to kill themselves come to regret that decision/be relieved that they're still alive (I am one of those people), which doesn't match the gut feeling that suicide prevention is \"cruel\" and \"robbing people of autonomy\". \n\nThe argument that force feeding should be abandoned holds a lot more weight in people who have chronic, treatment resistant AN, because statistically their chance of recovery actually is quite minimal and at that point you are just forcing someone to stay alive for the sake of it. But that's already a thing. People in that position will often be moved to palliative care with life-saving measures being stopped. \n\nI fully believe that the mental healthcare system needs a ton of work and that ED treatment in particular needs a drastic overhaul in order to stop people from ending up in the position where they're malnourished enough to need tube feeding to begin with. But \"it's cruel and a waste of money so just give people the option to die\" is a gross oversimplification which, coming from someone with an active eating disorder, holds about the same weight as an alcoholic arguing against the existence of rehab facilities.\n\nEdit: changed phrasing to be more accurate",

Because they (children) learn from what they 'see', whether you like it or not, they will copy. \n\nBut as it stands, in the U.S. the 'Number One' cause of death, is 'heart-disease'... Probably, I assume it is related to 'over-eating', not 'under-eating' (Anorexia).\n\nI think It's ridiculous the 'mental health care' in the U.S. is so 'worried' about 'Anorexic' people.\n\n\"regularly get denied medical treatment\" and well that's also my point, the system is inherently 'screwed'.",

But being suicidal is pretty much always a result of mental illness. Depression, anxiety, ptsd, anorexia, they create real, measurable chemical differences in the brain and change your perception of the world. When we save people who are starving themselves/ suicidal in any way, we aren't trying to force a normal healthy human to do something against their will. We are trying to give someone who is SICK, mentally (physically measurably) SICK, a chance to get healthy so that they can experience life and make their own choices. Letting mentally ill people die would be letting illness win. Their true, healthy self wouldn't get to experience life and make their own choices.\n\nI had multiple attempts in the past, and spent a veryyyy long time being tube fed after trying to starve myself. I was so, so angry. I didn't want any of it and I felt that my autonomy was being ripped away. I felt my human rights were being violated and I fought tooth and nail. This is what makes MENTAL illness so difficult- for those suffering, the illness becomes their reality. The people around us are the ones who know that we are sick, that wanting death isn't US, it's imbalances. \n\nIf they hadn't forced me, I wouldn't be here. And GOD am I thankful that I finally found the right meds and grew up and get to experience the world through a healthier brain. It is so, so different. It's not perfect, but it's worth living. \n\nI'm sorry that you are stuck in that dark place right now, it's so hard. My younger self would hate me for saying this, but I hope people fight you and force you to stay alive just as they did for me. I hope you get to experience a different, brighter reality that feels worth it \ud83d\udc9b",

After recovery more nuance comes in. Most people will maintain that being tubed was traumatic but the idea that it would've been better to let them die is nowhere near as common. It's also true that the majority of people who attempt to kill themselves come to regret that decision/be relieved that they're still alive (I am one of those people), which doesn't match the gut feeling that suicide prevention is \"cruel\" and \"robbing people of autonomy\". \n\nThe argument that force feeding should be abandoned holds a lot more weight in people who have chronic, treatment resistant AN, because statistically their chance of recovery actually is quite minimal and at that point you are just forcing someone to stay alive for the sake of it. But that's already a thing. People in that position will often be moved to palliative care with life-saving measures being stopped. \n\nI fully believe that the mental healthcare system needs a ton of work and that ED treatment in particular needs a drastic overhaul in order to stop people from ending up in the position where they're malnourished enough to need tube feeding to begin with. But \"it's cruel and a waste of money so just give people the option to die\" is a gross oversimplification which, coming from someone with an active eating disorder, holds about the same weight as an alcoholic arguing against the existence of rehab facilities.\n\nEdit: changed phrasing to be more accurate",

(Which usually is expensive). \n\nBut, who knows they (Anorexic people), change their mind 'last minute', something the 'mental health' sustem is 'too afraid' to 'find out' or 'risk happening', because maybe this world really is 'that bad' (lol)...\n\nMental health care providers, are businesses after all... When patients 'get help', afterwards they (Anorexic people, or their family/friends) to pay for it.\n\nBecause the mental health care system isn't financially associated with the 'Government-Tax-System'.\n\nWhich means taxes, which most patients, might've worked for and paid their entire lives (to the govt).\n\nJust to end up 'worn-out' by that same Job-Economy-Tax-system (that they worked 'in/for') and then they (Anorexic) still get screwed from behind...\n\nBecause, the Mental Health Care providers that offer 'the help' they 'need' (?), after getting into that 'unfortunate', 'worn-out' state of mental/physical well-being, will still be charging them $\u20ac\u00a3...",

          "body": "100/100 of anorexic people who do not want treatment will say that it's better to be left to die than it is to be forcibly tube fed, much like every suicidally depressed person will say that it's cruel to force people to stay alive after they've already decided they don't want to be here anymore. After recovery more nuance comes in. Most people will maintain that being tubed was traumatic but the idea that it would've been better to let them die is nowhere near as common. It's also true that the majority of people who attempt to kill themselves come to regret that decision/be relieved that they're still alive (I am one of those people), which doesn't match the gut feeling that suicide prevention is \"cruel\" and \"robbing people of autonomy\". \n\nThe argument that force feeding should be abandoned holds a lot more weight in people who have chronic, treatment resistant AN, because statistically their chance of recovery actually is quite minimal and at that point you are just forcing someone to stay alive for the sake of it. But that's already a thing. People in that position will often be moved to palliative care with life-saving measures being stopped. \n\nI fully believe that the mental healthcare system needs a ton of work and that ED treatment in particular needs a drastic overhaul in order to stop people from ending up in the position where they're malnourished enough to need tube feeding to begin with. But \"it's cruel and a waste of money so just give people the option to die\" is a gross oversimplification which, coming from someone with an active eating disorder, holds about the same weight as an alcoholic arguing against the existence of rehab facilities.\n\nEdit: changed phrasing to be more accurate",

Don't they (know exactly how many Dopamine in milligrams they have pumping through their brain-body)?\n\nThey just need to know 'how you think' and 'how you look', which allows their Biases-Personal-Opinions, to heavily influence their (psychiatrists) 'decision making' in the 'Diagnose-process', of diagnosing patients... \n\nPsychiatry, contains 'too much' pseudoscientific-thinking.

Don't they (know exactly how many Dopamine in milligrams they have pumping through their brain-body)?\n\nThey just need to know 'how you think' and 'how you look', which allows their Biases-Personal-Opinions, to heavily influence their (psychiatrists) 'decision making' in the 'Diagnose-process', of diagnosing patients... \n\nPsychiatry, contains 'too much' pseudoscientific-thinking. Lastly, let people get close to death through 'only-to-self-inflicted- behaviour', committing suicide isn't as easy as 'you think' and most Anorexic people would give up, if they felt 'really weird suddenly', because of their diet.\n\nUnless you of course believe it is somehow 'Very Easy To Kill Yourself' by 'keep' reducing your food intake, because this world is that bad (rofl).\n\nIt's not as if we were all born with the 'Primal Instinct' to survive>  'eating=incredibly important' (the instinct that programs our brain).

Because they (children) learn from what they 'see', whether you like it or not, they will copy. \n\nBut as it stands, in the U.S. the 'Number One' cause of death, is 'heart-disease'... Probably, I assume it is related to 'over-eating', not 'under-eating' (Anorexia).\n\nI think It's ridiculous the 'mental health care' in the U.S. is so 'worried' about 'Anorexic' people.\n\n\"regularly get denied medical treatment\" and well that's also my point, the system is inherently 'screwed'.",

          "body": "No, you are generalizing 'all Anorexic' people now, because each person who 'has' Anorexia Nervosa has a different 'rate' of weight-reduction/health-decline. \n\nFor example, some Anorexic people eat 'way more', while simultaneously 'reducing way less' of their food intake each day, over a certain period of time, until it becomes deadly (\"fatal\"), than 'Other' Anorexic people. \n\nIsn't it funny how we 'are told' to count all calories we 'eat-ingest' into our bodies, yet we haven't been 'told/taught' a way to count/measure the 'Total Amount of Calories' in our bodies... \n\nThey just look at people's body-shape (which is really a subjective-identification point, which allows Bias to dominate and influence the Diagnosis of 'mental health care patients).\n\nFor example, just like body-builders are afraid of ultra-marathon runners, who look WAY TOO SKINNY.\n\nWhich, also now reminds me of the 'Excess in Dopamine' psychiatrists claim their psychotic 'patients' have, they count/measure those too, before they prescribe each patients with 'random' dosages... Don't they (know exactly how many Dopamine in milligrams they have pumping through their brain-body)?\n\nThey just need to know 'how you think' and 'how you look', which allows their Biases-Personal-Opinions, to heavily influence their (psychiatrists) 'decision making' in the 'Diagnose-process', of diagnosing patients... \n\nPsychiatry, contains 'too much' pseudoscientific-thinking. Lastly, let people get close to death through 'only-to-self-inflicted- behaviour', committing suicide isn't as easy as 'you think' and most Anorexic people would give up, if they felt 'really weird suddenly', because of their diet.\n\nUnless you of course believe it is somehow 'Very Easy To Kill Yourself' by 'keep' reducing your food intake, because this world is that bad (rofl).\n\nIt's not as if we were all born with the 'Primal Instinct' to survive>  'eating=incredibly important' (the instinct that programs our brain). Going against that would, mean this world is just really really; Sick/Bad/Self-Destructive (global warming, pollution caused by electronic technology, Bitcoin...).",
