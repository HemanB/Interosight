My doctor thinks I\u2019m developing type one diabetes and all I can think of is when it develops further I\u2019ll be the smallest by far in the house bwahhahaha. Side note on that note maybe my mom will believe me when I say I need my A1C tested again because she thinks I\u2019m exaggerating what my doctor said to me. But then again she may be jealous about the initial weight loss. \n\nI guess from my rambling I do get jealous inside my household more but someone has to be very sick outside my home to get jealous over",
