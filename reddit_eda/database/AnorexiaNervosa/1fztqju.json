  "selftext": "When your bloodwork comes back normal, it doesn't mean everything is fine and that you aren't sick\n\nYou can't always tell who has an eating disorder, by looking at them. People with atypical anorexia aren't underweight. They are still sick and can experience medical complications. Yes, there are severely underweight anorexic people, who look visibly sick on the outside. There are also people who don't look ill on the outside, but this doesn't mean they aren't suffering. The mental pain you go through with this disorder can't be seen. Both anorexic and atypical anorexic people are suffering. \n\nRecovering can take years. Some people won't make a full recovery. Relapses after treatment are very common\n\nThere are a wide range of medical issues that anorexia can cause. Heart and bone problems are common. Other complications that don't get talked about enough are things like bladder issues, digestive issues, stomach problems, nerve damage. There are a lot more. What happens to each person varies. You won't experience the exact same health issues that another person is experiencing, even if both people are dealing with anorexia\n\nEating more food doesn't automatically mean you are cured. Anorexic people still eat.\n\nSaying \"just eat\" is counterproductive and doesn't make the person get over the illness. Saying \"I'm sorry you are struggling with eating\" is more helpful, than demanding the person eat more. This is a serious mental illness and you can't shame or scold a person out of it. \n\nThere is no \"sick enough.\" If you are experiencing mental and emotional pain, have low self esteem, and start restricting and losing weight to an unhealthy degree, that's the moment you are sick. You have nothing to prove to anyone. If you feel bad about yourself in any way, that's the moment your feelings are valid. You don't have to get worse, so more people will care. Someone cares. \n\nAnorexia isn't about trying to look a certain way or about vanity. It is an all consuming, deadly mental disorder. One with the highest mortality rate of any mental illness. People who have this illness are suffering. They aren't choosing to starve themselves. They have an illness. An illness that takes therapy, support from family and treatment to overcome. Even when you go through treatment for this illness, you can find it very difficult and you can relapse. \n\nNot all treatments for anorexia are helpful. Not all anorexic people want to be treated with inpatient treatment. Some people have chronic anorexia and complex situations. Some people have other disorders or disabilities, alongside anorexia, and typical anorexia treatments won't be helpful for them. This is why you should have treatment tailored to fit your needs. And a treatment team that listens, but doesn't pressure you or try to put you in a box. You won't have the exact needs as another anorexic person. If you have other disorders or disabilities that complicate your efforts at recovering, then your treatment team should make adjustments for you. No one should be given up on or made to go through this alone. Even if you have suffered for years and have a hard time thinking about what your life would be like without this disorder, you deserve support and understanding\n\nIf you are younger and just found out you have anorexia, I hope you have support around you\n\nIf you are older and have dealt with this disorder for years and are considered chronic, I hope you have support around you\n\nYou are not a burden. You are not a failure. You are not too difficult\n\nWe all deserve to be at peace with ourselves. \n\n\n\n",
