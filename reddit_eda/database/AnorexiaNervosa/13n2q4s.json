It's so sickening.\n\nYou really couldn't even make up that bead/feather story - the sad excuses for \"therapy\" they presented were awful. I remember one \"therapy\" exercise i had to do was to illustrate in a specific way how big I thought my waist was, and then they showed me the reality! And I got to keep the comparison! (Of course all I ever did with this was use this to body check and see if my waist was as small as when I was in the hospital).\n\nSimilar for me - when I was 17 I went to Renfrew and was in the adult building, and it was SO MUCH better. It was still shit, but it wasn't as degrading and condescending and traumatizing as the hospital program.\n\nAnd I HATED the \"that's the anorexia talking\" thing! They said the same shit at the hospital I was at.  It made me feel even more like I wasn't heard, didn't matter, and didn't have a voice, and of course you know how I coped with those feelings? Anorexia, of course.\n\nSo much of treatment for mental illness (esp for children) is straight up abuse and I hope that at some point its recognized as exactly that.",
