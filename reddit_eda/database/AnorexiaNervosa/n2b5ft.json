  "selftext": "So, I went to rehab last year for a substance abuse disorder. I\u2019ve suffered from co-occurring disorders for years (ED, drug abuse, major anxiety & depression, etc.), so I\u2019ve encountered my fair share of therapists and psychiatrists. I\u2019ve never felt dismissed or shamed by any of my providers... until I went to rehab. Because cocaine is a stimulant and appetite suppressant, it can be extremely harmful when abused by a person struggling with an eating disorder (i.e me). To me, it\u2019s a very obvious correlation and when my psychiatrist diagnosed me with anorexia it was not a surprise. Anyway, fast forward to the first day in my drug rehabilitation counselor\u2019s office. We\u2019re discussing triggers, why I couldn\u2019t stop using, so my ana diagnosis comes up. \u201cOh\u201d she said, \u201cthat\u2019s not right, you\u2019re not anorexic... people suffering from anorexia are much thinner than you.\u201d My jaw hit the FLOOR as I sat there in disbelief. All I could do was choke back the tears and anger that this woman, a LICENSED PROFESSIONAL, was not only inaccurate about what the definition of anorexia is, but also brought my biggest fears to life. It\u2019s so sad when people don\u2019t recognize that their assumptions and words can seriously affect others. This happened last August and I still think about it all the time.",
