  "selftext": "I got pretty much jilted into reality this year. I lost my younger brother to suicide and after I promised myself I would recover. I\u2019ve learned a lot about this disease, and I think I\u2019m finally at a place where I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s grip as firmly over me. Never thought I\u2019d leave this subreddit, but it\u2019s proof that anything is possible. To those of you who are in deep - I have been there, and I am sorry you\u2019re struggling. But there is hope to recover. You just have to start somewhere. If there\u2019s anything my life has shown me it\u2019s that nothing is promised, and I do not want to spend the one go I have at it bullying myself into nothing. I chose to recover after losing my brother because I did not want to let my illness defeat me. I felt hopeless and lost. But I never gave up. I have faith you can do it too\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb so bye for now everyone. You offered me support when I needed it but I think I am finally ready! Sending peace, and love. Please know you\u2019re not alone\u2764\ufe0f been to hell & back and the other side is SO sweet.",
