  "selftext": "This is kinda hard to explain but I\u2019m sure some of you have the same kind of thing going on\u2026 if I\u2019m \u201cgood\u201d that day, in other words if I managed to restrict and I feel like a successful anorexic, then when I look in the mirror my body looks thin and I feel exhilarated and accomplished. However, if I\u2019ve \u201cfailed\u201d that day, ie ate too many calories, even if I\u2019m just slightly over my set calories,  I look in the mirror and I look bigger. My legs are thicker, my stomach rounder, my arms larger. What the heck? anyone else?? ",
