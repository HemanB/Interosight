I\u2019ve had comments like \u201cwow good job, you must eat so healthy\u201d and and every time they say something like that I cringe internally because I\u2019m trying SO HARD to recover and challenge my food fears and even a bite of something high calorie literally makes me shake from anxiety. I would love for my cart NOT to look so \u201chealthy\u201d and to be able to eat like a normal person, not just the same boring rotation of too-low calorie fruits and veggies, I wish these cashiers would consider how gut wrenching it can be to be congratulated for something so seemingly \u201chealthy\u201d when in reality my ed literally has taken control of my whole life and recovery is the fucking hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to do and listening to my dietitian and increasing calories and new foods feels like torture.

      "body": "As someone who has both worked as a cashier in several places, and also has had an ED for half my life--and throughout those jobs- I'm gonna offer a differing view point here.\n\nAs a cashier, we are instructed to give 'service with a smile' every second we're on the floor. It's part of the job description--making the customer feel welcomed, and eager to come back again. Small talk is a big part of this. And what are we going to talk about? The weather, sure, but its so much easier, and comes more naturally, to glance at a product, make a small comment on it, show interest, and bag it up. Do we remember your face, and what you're buying? No. Believe me, there are way too many customers before and after you for us to then see you in the street and go 'OH MY GOD, IT'S BABY FOOD GIRL'. In the nicest possible way, we don't care about you enough to remember. It's a low paying job, and we need to get it done, preferably with good marks, which brings me on to my next subject:\nHow easy it is to get us fired.\nOne complaint from a customer about you being grumpy or hostile could have you on a warning. A few customers making the same complaints could have you out the door. Easiest way to avoid that? Talking to the customers. Smiling. Showing interest as you serve them.\n\nTo put it simply: as the girl who lived on baby food for a good few months two years ago, I understand your embarrassment. I truly do. But as the cashier, please don't take us doing our job personally. A lot of us are underpaid, understaffed, and that small conversation is us doing our jobs, and also making connection with another human being for possibly the first time in a while.",
