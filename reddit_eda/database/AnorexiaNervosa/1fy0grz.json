I first had disordered eating in 6th grade and from 9th-12th grade struggled heavily with Anorexia with a binge purge subtype. I got better around the age of 18 once I moved out and was able to cook my own food and start enjoying it again but in my twenties ( currently 23 now) I\u2019ve begun having relapses every few months or so. \n\nThey last from a few days to a few weeks and then go away gradually but I still feel weird having these relapses as an adult bc I know better at this point I know what I\u2019m doing but I just don\u2019t care. \n\nI feel like everyone who had MH issues when I  was a teenager has recovered now that they are an adult but I feel still stuck with continuing relapses of all my issues I\u2019ve had for years but can\u2019t say anything abt it and can\u2019t seek proper help bc I can\u2019t afford it \n\nCan anyone relate?

I feel like I can\u2019t get better after being told your metabolism will slow down as you age since I don\u2019t want to gain weight, but I\u2019m also so scared to go \u201cfully in\u201d on starving myself since I can\u2019t not pay bills and such. It\u2019s also so depressing seeing so many people who were sick around the same time as me start to move on and no longer associate with their disordered past. The same goes for people who I knew suffered when I was younger and recovered and are living normal lives when I worry I\u2019ll always have this lingering",

We're all here for each other, regardless of age) but it is a bit different in terms of phases of life (work, relationships, bonds with family). What I will say is, it can happen at any age... there are unique difficulties that arise once you get older but there's nothing weird about having an ED when older. Some of the challenges I have had:  \n-Your body really stops losing the ability to handle it, I had weight issues in my early 20s but it's so different now. My hair, my teeth, my skin, my nails are all shit.  \n-Inability to work. I've had more than one notice put up on my apartment door but I sleep two-three times a day and it's very hard for me to perform at a job... actually about to start training tomorrow and am freaking out because IDK if I can do it but really am facing either homelessness or trying  \n-Lost a lot of familial bonds because I was avoiding them bc I didn't want them to notice or suspect\n\nI don't have health insurance myself, and especially being out of work, it is rough. But check out [anad.org](http://anad.org) there are group sessions you can sign up for, multiple times a week, and also get yourself a free mentor (Go to, \"Get Support,\" at the top of the page). BetterHelp also offers therapists who specialize in EDs, it's about $200/mo which isn't feasible for me anymore... but community support is helpful",
