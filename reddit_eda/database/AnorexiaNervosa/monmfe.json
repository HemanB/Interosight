  "selftext": "As many people know, Nikki Grahame lost her life to anorexia. I'm devastated, but I'm also so angry. I'm so angry that this illness is so destructive, I'm angry Eating Disorder services let her down, I'm angry that the media obsessed with her appearance. UK newspapers that reported her story had adverts for *loosing weight*. Reaching out for help and raising awareness isn't enough anymore, services need funding and the diet industry need sanctions. RIP Nikki, I'm sorry that you were tormented by this horrible disorder.",

      "body": "It\u2019s scared to think about. Once I turn an adult, I\u2019m planning on leaving the ED services as all the therapists treated me like I was a joke and twisted what I said after explaining several times. I tried a new therapist and they did the same. The only doctor that made a huge difference was not even an ED one, they were from A & E. like you know when they soo good and your fed up of the ED and their words are soo kind you just wanna hug them and cry, but then it\u2019s unprofessional for them so have to resist. So shout out to you Bridget, literally only doctor who made everything seem okay even when life was crumbling. The other one being my consultant who listens but I\u2019m terrified of cause I don\u2019t want to be sectioned- that\u2019s the only reason. \n\nFrom personal experience doctors are nicer than ED ones. Or maybe because it was my age they were nice. But I think it\u2019s cause you don\u2019t want them to be scared of doctors and make it feel like you can always go to them. Therapy is 100% effort, it only works if you try.........\n\n\nIdk where this is going \n\n\nIt definitely shouldn\u2019t have happened, there was no reason for it to. Unless it was like no one could\u2019ve predicted like a cardiac arrest, but anything else is pretty preventable if they only would\u2019ve helped her. Sadly, this isn\u2019t the first case and certainly won\u2019t be the last. They\u2019re are going to be may more victims, which will be hard , cause even if we change the media- things slip through but also support groups. And new vulnerable people are \u2018getting taught\u2019 behaviours and it\u2019ll forever be out there \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\n\n\nSo I\u2019m gonna personally apologise to anyone who has been blackmailed by their brain, the media, friends or family into believing that they aren\u2019t good enough so they did what they had to and it never felt enough. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",
