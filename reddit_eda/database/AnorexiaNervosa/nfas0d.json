  "selftext": "I've been in recovery for some time and decided to take on weight lifting. I thought heck, why not, if I'm gonna gain weight I better gain some muscle and become strong.\n\nWell I'm five months into lifting and I've been pretty satisfied with myself. I look leaner, more muscle definition and less \"fat\".\n\nI weighed myself yesterday after avoiding it and I saw that I had gained weight. Don't know why I was expecting myself to be less heavy. Severely restricted and didn't exercise yesterday, because I was so scared (also I was injured).\n\nToday has been tough, assimilating the thought  of me being heavier hasn't been easy at all. 'Health' has always been a bad word to me because I associate it to becoming 'fatter' though I know it's not, but I'm not giving up.\n\nAnd to anyone reading this and struggling, remember, the number on the scale doesn't equal your value. It isn't how you should measure your self-worth. Gaining weight isn't bad. Being healthy isn't bad. So let's all tackle this eating disorder as best as we can.",
