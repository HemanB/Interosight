Delicious high calorie food at the supermarket, or when people bring treats and cake to the office is really scary. I'm afraid my will is going to break and I'll eat it. If it belongs to someone else I won't touch it. But if it's of access to me, it's scary. I don't watch mukbang though. I find the noises and the quantities of food absolutely revolting.",
