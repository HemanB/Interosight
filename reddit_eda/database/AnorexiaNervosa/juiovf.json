At its worst, just standing up causes the hearing to go out almost entirely and is replaced by a ringing for a solid 10 seconds, and can remain mildly muffled for up to a half hour; the vision goes out for roughly 10 seconds as well and is much slower to fade back to normal. Sometimes my legs will just turn to jelly and give out. The lightheadedness can remain for hours. \n\nMine is unrelated to my ED. I was born with it. But the ED exacerbates it a lot.

      "body": "Yes, I would absolutely mention this the next time you\u2019re able to. Everything you\u2019ve described indicates orthostatic issues. The lightheadedness and numb/tingling/cold extremities are generally due to the drop in blood pressure and poor circulation (which are exacerbated by dehydration). Since this is relatively new for you, there are a number of reasons that could be causing it and it\u2019s best for professionals to figure out. \n\nMy best advice is to take your time when getting up. If you need to be on your feet don\u2019t keep your knees locked or legs stationary. Moving your legs helps to keep the circulation going, but I find that squatting down or sitting for maybe a minute every now and then is a nice \u201creset\u201d that gives me a little more time before I run into the other symptoms. And try to stay hydrated and on top of your electrolytes. If you\u2019re going to be somewhere warm or it\u2019s hot out, keep a cold drink to sip so that you don\u2019t overheat. Be safe, and I hope you\u2019re able to get your symptoms under control. \u2665\ufe0f",
