I think about you guys and I really hope you will be able to have a nice Christmas with your families regardless of the food related suffering.\n\nMerry Christmas to you all. It'll get better ! I promise. Cheers",

I respect where you're coming from and I understand you probably mean well, but think of how grouping together an entire community of people who are genuinely struggling might increase the stigma and take away the personal aspect of healing",

I'm trying to be one of the people who take time to understand because it is absolutely essential to deconstruct the stigma around this ED.\n\nI often hear that anorexia is \"rich white girl tantrum\". When you have no idea what EDs are, all you think is \"just eat wtf\". But you guys know better than me that it's more complicated than this and force feeding is one of the fastest ways to bulimia. Plus anorexia is neither exclusive to rich people, nor white people, nor girls..\n\nSo it's very important for people to understand what it's all really about. Especially considering the fact that many people die from it. It's not a simple and innocent problem. It's a very complicated and dangerous one.\n\nSo no, u/BuggysWaifu, I will not be fucking off my own way because I have a role to play. I can't do many things apart from being supportive and spreading the knowledge that I have acquired. But each step counts.\n\nCheers, and merry Christmas \ud83c\udf84",

As a professional anthropologist working for an actual museum in Chicago, it's my job to point out when different cultures are being treated in inappropriate ways. If you look up the definition of a culture, I'm sure you'll see that this community also creates a culture of eating disorders. My opinion is definitely different than yours but I'm not disrespecting anyone or getting angry the way that some of you are attacking me for being honest about how I personally, and not in my original post that I said this was how *i personally* interpreted this. I'm not saying anyone is wrong or right and you would understand that if you read my statements without bias. Maybe take a chill pill and try to read what I'm saying without such an angry preconceived notions.

It really seems like you're trying to ascribe some like, personal emotional truth to the intentions of an online stranger? That's like, really weird to me, and there's certainly not enough to inductively reason your way to that conclusion here. I also just don't see any merit to the idea that you've done anything to protect a culture from mistreatment here. You just yelled at someone trying to show us kindness and solidarity. That's just plain not cool lol.\n\nLike in all honesty you came into this thread emotionally charged, using outright inflammatory language (or as you put it, not being \"overly sensitive\"), just to tone police the criticism you got for it, and try to frame yourself as the *real* adult in the room.\n\nIn my industry we got a saying, don't dish out what you can't serve.",
