  "selftext": "Why is it so hard to get people to understand that i dont just restrict simply bc i hate my body. Yes i dont like the way that i look and my weight definitely plays a role in my anorexia, but i also restrict bc i have a little appetite, i like the control, when my depression is extra bad i lose all want for food, etc. its just hard when my mom says \u201cdont starve yourself, you\u2019re beautiful\u201d when its so much deeper than just my looks.",

Especially when untreated, they become an addiction. Would you tell a heroin addict to \"Stop shooting up\"? No. Telling an anorexic to stop starving themselves or to eat more is effectively the same thing. \n\nIt gets especially hard once you start noticing that your tummy rumbling is making you happy. Hell, sometimes you know that it's not normal and WANT to change but can't actually bring yourself to do so. \n\nAnorexia has the highest mortality rate for a reason...",

      "body": "I know for me it started as completely about weight loss for me. When I was anxious (about literally anything) I lost my appetite, I liked how I lost weight when I didn\u2019t eat. It became very addictive and way too easy. I had no big trauma before I developed my eating disorder. I discovered that it made me feel better when I\u2019m skinnier. I just enjoyed losing weight and felt more confident in myself as my body dysmorphia got worse. I had no idea what anorexia was when I developed it until I was diagnosed.\n\n I\u2019m in recovery now, in therapy, doing somewhat better but for me the weight loss is really central to my ED. Could go deeper like societal standards and pressures, because logically that is an undeniable factor but it really does just feel like an \u201caddiction\u201d to me and less of a coping mechanism. It feels very vain but it\u2019s just habits that are extremely hard to break. I care too much about my appearance and that paired with body dysmorphia is a recipe for disaster. It\u2019s like a drug addiction where I\u2019m physically and mentally dependent on weight loss and exercise.\n\nBut yes, scientifically it has been proven that most people with ED\u2019s have some deeper trauma. It is more often than not a coping mechanism.",
