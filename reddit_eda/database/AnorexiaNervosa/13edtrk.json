  "title": "Feeling guilty over throwing away food my parents made me when I was a teen.",
  "selftext": "My ED started around 13 and it was very bad. My dad would wake up early to make me breakfast until I was about 15. He had his own healthy pancake recipie and would make me pancakes every single day with sunflower seeds or walnuts in them. I didn\u2019t realize how special that was until I got older. And for like a year in middle school my ED was so bad I would hide the pancakes and get rid of them. I would flush the pancakes my dad made me down the toilet. Every. Day.  I am consumed with guilt and sadness over this. More than anything else and all the people my behaviors hurt, this is the worst. \n\nI\u2019m older now. I still live at home but my dad doesn\u2019t make me breakfast anymore because I\u2019m in college and should make it myself. I think about that year or two I wasted so much food, a direct representation of his love. I wish I could go back. I\u2019d do anything to have him do that for me again. But I\u2019m an adult and I have to take care of myself now. He loves me so, so much. So much he woke up early every day to feed me such good food and I just threw it away. fuck, I can\u2019t believe I did that. I feel SO HORRIBLE. \n\nI wish I could go back and relive those days. I mean, I don\u2019t, but I wish I could relive them without all the pain and mental illness. It\u2019s not fair. I will never forgive myself for wasting my dads amazing food. I feel like I was throwing away his love every time I threw away his food. I hate so much that I did that. I wish I could undo it and experience all those pancake mornings over again. I wish I knew that in a few short years those special mornings would be over. \n\nMaybe I\u2019ll ask him to cook me breakfast a couple times a week. I just really miss it.",

Make them for him. \n\nThe best way to heal from grief like this isn\u2019t to run away from it but to let yourself feel it fully - which it sounds like you are doing, so well done - and to find ways to accept the love that was and is real, even if you didn\u2019t fully understand it as a child. You can\u2019t go back to that time but your dad still loves you, and you can take back pieces of that time in other ways - and then it won\u2019t hurt the same way it does now.",

He still had the satisfaction of feeling like he was providing for you, looking after you, and showing you his love in a solid way. You flushing them didnt hurt him and he still had all the benefits of cooking for you\n\nInstead of feeling guilty, try think of this as a relatively harmless lesson to yourself. \n\nI got a new phone and instead of paying outright I got a contract. When interest rates went up I ended up paying way more than I would have. It was annoying but I was grateful it happened because it was only a phone, and will stop me making the same mistake when I buy something expensive like a sofa or car.\n\nTry think of this the same way. There was a time that you didn't appreciate some special moments with your dad as much as you wish you had, or took moments for granted not realising they'd be temporary. That's a lesson you were lucky enough to learn early, and you have the rest of your life to learn from it and value your dad more. Try let it go - it happened, it taught you something, your outlook on life matured, and it'll benefit your relationship in the long run",
