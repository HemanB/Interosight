  "title": "Had the most embarrassing anorexia related moment yesterday",
  "selftext": "Yesterday I was playing some video games with my partner, but the entire time I was feeling like absolute shit. At first  I thought it was nothing more than anxiety sprinkled with sadness, but as the day went on my stomach was annihilating me and I couldn't focus on anything but the pain, so I decided to try the bathroom.\n\nSat down on the toilet, and *nothing* happened. There was just nothing there at all.\n\nAfter around 30 minutes of failure to use the bathroom, I thought that just MAYBE a shower would make me feel better. Clutching my stomach and groaning insufferably, I turned on the water and just SAT. Very quickly I became INSANELY lightheaded on *top* of the nausea, and I felt like I was dying.\n\nBut then, sitting there in agony, I realized that my stupid ass hadn't eaten anything for a WHILE. My body didn't recognize this pain as hunger, and honestly felt more like appendicitis. Realizing that this pain just ***had*** to be hunger, I yelled across the house for my partner to help me by asking her for a pack of Ritz crackers. She ran downstairs to the pantry, grabbed some crackers, and came into the bathroom to help me.\n\nSo, for the next 15 minutes or so, I laid there naked in the shower, groaning like I'd been shot, while my partner hand fed me slightly soggy Ritz. In the moment it felt completely absurd that *this* was what my day had led up to; but you know what? Hunger is ***exactly*** what that pain was, because after I finished the pack, I felt completely fine! Thankfully there was zero judgement from my partner after the situation, but holy shit that poor woman saw me at my absolute lowest that day. Having her hold my hair back while vomiting in the toilet after getting too high off an edible was WAY less embarrassing than *that.*\n\nThere isn't a moral to this story other than the obvious \"anorexia fucking blows\", but I figured I'd share this with you all anyway! Maybe you can get a giggle or two out of my pitiful experience.",
