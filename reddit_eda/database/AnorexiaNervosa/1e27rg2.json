  "selftext": "I was in a REALLY REALLY bad place mentally a few months ago so i joined a pro ana server\n\nFor a week it was great, i would talk to people and get thinspo and all that (also lost weight, it was peak)\n\nanyways, i found out there was a sh part of the server so i clicked on it. OMFG it was people literally cutting so fucking deep\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e, they would brag about the shape the cut their skin  and people encouraged each other and shit (also i have battled with sh before, i understand that they're in a bad place too)\n\nI was so disgusted until i realized that it was the same we did on the pro ana part of the server. Encouraging each other to get skinnier and get deeper into the deadly illness. Like god that was a wake up for me.\n\nI still have anorexia and shit but seriously have not been able to look at thinspo since, it just disgusts me now\n\n(also btw i just found out today that my grandma used to have anorexia, idk)",

Different neurological pathologies entirely. In fact, one could say, they are quite the opposite in that one is trying to control the outcomes through goal-oriented (albeit also destructive) behaviors while the other is reacting to negative emotions, often times not shown how to regulate emotions by their support system.",
