  "selftext": "i hate getting my period because it makes me feel so invalid and like i don\u2019t have an eating disorder. i want to be sicker so badly it\u2019s awful. every part of me gets so happy when i feel like i\u2019m going to pass out or when i feel some type of ed related symptom. i got my period back a few months ago because i\u2019ve been surrounded by people who support and care for me but the ed thoughts don\u2019t go away even if i\u2019m eating slightly more. getting my period back has been one of the hardest things for me since i\u2019m not officially recovering it just feels so defeating knowing physically i\u2019m recovering. what also makes it harder is that at one point when i was small enough i didn\u2019t have my period, so i know it\u2019s possible and now since it\u2019s back i feel horrible and like i don\u2019t have an ed.",
