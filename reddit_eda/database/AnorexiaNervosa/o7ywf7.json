  "selftext": "anyone else in high school taking a health class get kinda triggered? We\u2019re learning about about eating disorders. The definition they put for anorexia nervosa is \u201cWhen a person feels overweight despite being underweight\u201d. and idk but that kinda made me feel like fake cause i\u2019m not underweight. Apparently i\u2019m just in the midst of \u201cdeveloping\u201d an eating disorder. Pretty sure i developed this disorder like 2 years ago but idk maybe i\u2019m just being overly sensitive about this. \n\nIt also talked about what a healthy bmi is, as if i\u2019m not an expert already lol. At least i have a better excuse to check my bmi for the 100th time today.",
