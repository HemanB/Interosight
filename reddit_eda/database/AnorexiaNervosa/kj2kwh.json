  "selftext": "i have this fear that if i go, all the other residents will think i\u2019m a fake bc i\u2019m not extremely underweight. i feel like i need to be a significant amount UNDER my goal weight before actually going bc part of treatment is gaining, right? i want to be healthy & recovered AT my goal weight, if that makes sense. i am all for recovering as far as having a healthy mentality about food, etc. but i don\u2019t believe that being recovered necessarily means i have to weigh more. like i\u2019m okay with gaining a little and recovering as long as i can stay \u201cunderweight\u201d. there are people who are naturally skinny but still healthy. that\u2019s what i want. i don\u2019t want this ED mindset, the guilt, the shame, the lying, the constant worrying about if i\u2019m going to eat or not, what i\u2019m going to eat, how much i\u2019m going to eat, how many calories are in it, how im going to get rid of it, etc. i want to get rid of these toxic thoughts and habits. it\u2019s exhausting to do this every single day. i\u2019m sooo tired. literally. i\u2019m so malnourished. i want to be healthier mentally but stay small. does this even make sense or am i not ready for recovery and just making excuses? idk.",

EDs are often passed on from mother to child. i\u2019m sure you already think of all of this, and i don\u2019t want you too feel unreasonably bad or guilty, but it is objectively true that your ED probably has and will continue to interfere with you ability to be a good mother. something i hate about my ED is how it made me act at odds with my values. i was willing to put my family/friends through a lot of distress to continue in my ED. i hate that it made me put being skinny over my loved ones because i don\u2019t think i\u2019m a vain person. that\u2019s not to say that people with EDs are inherently shallow, image-obsessed, selfish people, but my ED made me that way. having an ED is not a choice, but refusing to recover is. i have struggled a lot with body stuff in recovery and am currently struggling with a lot of relapse urges because of it. i always remember though that leaning into my ED isn\u2019t going to make me happy with my body, ever. when i was at my low weight i wanted to keep losing and losing. i had no perception of how small i was. sure i have body image issues now, but i honestly don\u2019t really feel any worse about my body than i did at my low weight, and because i feel physically and emotionally better it is 100% worth it. now that i\u2019ve worked on recovery, i can recognize that using behaviors will always be antithetical to anything i actually enjoy in life. further along in my life i hope to build muscle and focus on getting stronger rather than shrinking and getting weaker. maybe i won\u2019t love my body, but i\u2019d take feeling neutral about it (and not actively waging war against it) over starving and hating myself any day. the fact that you are able to wish recovery for yourself is something to be very proud of. it\u2019s going to be rough but i can assure you that it is so worth it!",

I am only telling you that because that was the reason I failed the first time, I thought I had outsmarted them and then bam they were like NOPE and I simply couldn\u2019t deal with the feeling after so I never went back. I\u2019m only trying to inform you that recovery itself is uncomfortable and yeah it feels scary but it\u2019s not nearly as bad if you cooperate, resisting makes the default scenarios that result way harder on you and that can easily drive you away so if you\u2019re ready and have such amazing people supporting you, then take advantage of this moment and thank god that you\u2019ve been so blessed and go because it\u2019s never going to feel good or exciting...never not even healthy people would want to relinquish their freedom in that sense. so if you have built momentum and a support system def do it now! especially where you have a daughter think of the impact your health and appearance and relationship with food could have on her. \n\nPlus, you will meet girls that you will grow really close with and that helps a lot! I learned to crochet and knit in my early days of programs! Not all of mine but the intensive ones where I spent significant time I always met at least one or two people who really got it and I felt support from their presence without having to even talk or share. \n\nI am really happy that you\u2019re in such a strong headspace to even talk and share and consider going so give yourself a lot of credit for that! We both know how impossible that point is to even reach at all so kudos to you!!! Try not to compare, you will see girls that may be sicker than you but don\u2019t let make you feel unworthy of being there...I total get the competitive aspect and it\u2019s so hard but just stick with it and take the advice of those who have been there longer they have usually already learned all of the hard ways and can save you a lot of discomfort! \n\nI hope you enjoy tomorrow morning I just got done setting everything up!!! I wish you all the best! You can do this and you will feel so much happier afterwards when you can truly play with your kid and be present for the moment instead of preoccupied with some battle in your head that no one knows is so loud!",

I totally can relate to what you\u2019re saying and feeling and I can tell you from experience, there are going to be 100 reasons to walk out the door every day at treatment, you will be complete out of your comfort zone and expected to comply with their schedules and requirements or given the option to willingly leave. At least that was my experience...and the first two I went to like that I walked right out of and never looked back. My best advice is, if you are put on a weight gain plan, the meals will be really hard, but try and eat the food because if you don\u2019t they make you drink meal replacements and those sit like concrete inside of you! I had a full blown anxiety attack and cried with refusal and panic through my entire first meal but all the girls with me completely understood because they all had been through a first meal too which made me feel less awful. \nI can appreciate your need to get better for your daughter and I commend you for that! I have a 4 year old so I get that part of it, but as I saw someone mentioned treatment is of your own doing, they cannot and will not hold you against your will so if you know that you\u2019re going to go there and be unwilling to cooperate then I would think long and hard about what\u2019s more important to you right now, satisfying your ED or truly changing your habits? \nFor me, I only ever went to treatment for the sake of those close to me and mainly as a means to get people off my back, but I knew the entire time that I had no intention of letting this go and only used these programs as part of a ploy to deceive them that I was recovering so that I could get better at manipulation and hiding it. Obviously that only works so many times, people get tired of the battle and after years of fear and torment, eventually friends and family refused to support my situation and enable my \u2018slow and painful suicide\u2019 anymore. \nFor me my ED has always mattered more than anyone or anything else, it fuels my decisions my thoughts my day my mood every second of my life. But being a parent, you have a real chance at getting away from the toxicity. Wanting to set a better example for my son helped me change things that no program or doctor could in 15 years of trying. I\u2019m still sick and always will be but I\u2019m not on a hospital bed with tubes and wires trying to keep me alive and my son doesn\u2019t have to worry about \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with mommy?\u201d \nThat part feels good, but the sick side of me is furious with myself for not maintaining dangerously low weights and I feel like a weak failure enraged with myself unless I\u2019m actively engaging in triggers, then I feel empowered again. \n\nConsider it honestly with yourself first, better to do now when she is still young then later but I totally get how you feel! I had to leave my son for in house when he was only 4 months old and it was awful! \nGood luck!! Enjoy the holiday morning with your daughter!",

I totally can relate to what you\u2019re saying and feeling and I can tell you from experience, there are going to be 100 reasons to walk out the door every day at treatment, you will be complete out of your comfort zone and expected to comply with their schedules and requirements or given the option to willingly leave. At least that was my experience...and the first two I went to like that I walked right out of and never looked back. My best advice is, if you are put on a weight gain plan, the meals will be really hard, but try and eat the food because if you don\u2019t they make you drink meal replacements and those sit like concrete inside of you! I had a full blown anxiety attack and cried with refusal and panic through my entire first meal but all the girls with me completely understood because they all had been through a first meal too which made me feel less awful. \nI can appreciate your need to get better for your daughter and I commend you for that! I have a 4 year old so I get that part of it, but as I saw someone mentioned treatment is of your own doing, they cannot and will not hold you against your will so if you know that you\u2019re going to go there and be unwilling to cooperate then I would think long and hard about what\u2019s more important to you right now, satisfying your ED or truly changing your habits? \nFor me, I only ever went to treatment for the sake of those close to me and mainly as a means to get people off my back, but I knew the entire time that I had no intention of letting this go and only used these programs as part of a ploy to deceive them that I was recovering so that I could get better at manipulation and hiding it. Obviously that only works so many times, people get tired of the battle and after years of fear and torment, eventually friends and family refused to support my situation and enable my \u2018slow and painful suicide\u2019 anymore. \nFor me my ED has always mattered more than anyone or anything else, it fuels my decisions my thoughts my day my mood every second of my life. But being a parent, you have a real chance at getting away from the toxicity. Wanting to set a better example for my son helped me change things that no program or doctor could in 15 years of trying. I\u2019m still sick and always will be but I\u2019m not on a hospital bed with tubes and wires trying to keep me alive and my son doesn\u2019t have to worry about \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with mommy?\u201d \nThat part feels good, but the sick side of me is furious with myself for not maintaining dangerously low weights and I feel like a weak failure enraged with myself unless I\u2019m actively engaging in triggers, then I feel empowered again. \n\nConsider it honestly with yourself first, better to do now when she is still young then later but I totally get how you feel! I had to leave my son for in house when he was only 4 months old and it was awful! \nGood luck!! Enjoy the holiday morning with your daughter!",

I\u2019m only trying to inform you that recovery itself is uncomfortable and yeah it feels scary but it\u2019s not nearly as bad if you cooperate, resisting makes the default scenarios that result way harder on you and that can easily drive you away so if you\u2019re ready and have such amazing people supporting you, then take advantage of this moment and thank god that you\u2019ve been so blessed and go because it\u2019s never going to feel good or exciting...never not even healthy people would want to relinquish their freedom in that sense. so if you have built momentum and a support system def do it now! especially where you have a daughter think of the impact your health and appearance and relationship with food could have on her. \n\nPlus, you will meet girls that you will grow really close with and that helps a lot! I learned to crochet and knit in my early days of programs! Not all of mine but the intensive ones where I spent significant time I always met at least one or two people who really got it and I felt support from their presence without having to even talk or share. \n\nI am really happy that you\u2019re in such a strong headspace to even talk and share and consider going so give yourself a lot of credit for that! We both know how impossible that point is to even reach at all so kudos to you!!! Try not to compare, you will see girls that may be sicker than you but don\u2019t let make you feel unworthy of being there...I total get the competitive aspect and it\u2019s so hard but just stick with it and take the advice of those who have been there longer they have usually already learned all of the hard ways and can save you a lot of discomfort! \n\nI hope you enjoy tomorrow morning I just got done setting everything up!!! I wish you all the best! You can do this and you will feel so much happier afterwards when you can truly play with your kid and be present for the moment instead of preoccupied with some battle in your head that no one knows is so loud!",

Tools to help you accept the stress that everyone gets, and not let it manifest itself in unhealthy coping mechanisms. \n\nThat may sound simplistic and like yeah right give me a break, but they do help.",

I\u2019m still sick and always will be but I\u2019m not on a hospital bed with tubes and wires trying to keep me alive and my son doesn\u2019t have to worry about \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with mommy?\u201d \nThat part feels good, but the sick side of me is furious with myself for not maintaining dangerously low weights and I feel like a weak failure enraged with myself unless I\u2019m actively engaging in triggers, then I feel empowered again. \n\nConsider it honestly with yourself first, better to do now when she is still young then later but I totally get how you feel! I had to leave my son for in house when he was only 4 months old and it was awful! \nGood luck!! Enjoy the holiday morning with your daughter!",

I am only telling you that because that was the reason I failed the first time, I thought I had outsmarted them and then bam they were like NOPE and I simply couldn\u2019t deal with the feeling after so I never went back. I\u2019m only trying to inform you that recovery itself is uncomfortable and yeah it feels scary but it\u2019s not nearly as bad if you cooperate, resisting makes the default scenarios that result way harder on you and that can easily drive you away so if you\u2019re ready and have such amazing people supporting you, then take advantage of this moment and thank god that you\u2019ve been so blessed and go because it\u2019s never going to feel good or exciting...never not even healthy people would want to relinquish their freedom in that sense. so if you have built momentum and a support system def do it now! especially where you have a daughter think of the impact your health and appearance and relationship with food could have on her. \n\nPlus, you will meet girls that you will grow really close with and that helps a lot! I learned to crochet and knit in my early days of programs! Not all of mine but the intensive ones where I spent significant time I always met at least one or two people who really got it and I felt support from their presence without having to even talk or share. \n\nI am really happy that you\u2019re in such a strong headspace to even talk and share and consider going so give yourself a lot of credit for that! We both know how impossible that point is to even reach at all so kudos to you!!! Try not to compare, you will see girls that may be sicker than you but don\u2019t let make you feel unworthy of being there...I total get the competitive aspect and it\u2019s so hard but just stick with it and take the advice of those who have been there longer they have usually already learned all of the hard ways and can save you a lot of discomfort! \n\nI hope you enjoy tomorrow morning I just got done setting everything up!!! I wish you all the best! You can do this and you will feel so much happier afterwards when you can truly play with your kid and be present for the moment instead of preoccupied with some battle in your head that no one knows is so loud!",

(hugs)\n\nanyone i\u2019ve shared this with usually says \u201cjust eat. you\u2019re not fat\u201d and i know i\u2019m not fat but i FEEL fat and out of control if i eat. i feel so unattractive when i eat. like i\u2019m pigging out. i get super mad if someone looks at me when i\u2019m eating \ud83d\ude2b \n\nand yes, this is more about control than my weight bc i have a lot of trauma in my life and currently, some things are just falling apart so my life feels out of control. i feel like i control my body and my weight. but i do see how this ED is actually controlling me. my weight affects my mood for the day and it affects my family/social life especially when it involves gatherings with food/drinks. \n\ni need to find better coping mechanisms. every time i get upset, my first thought is to starve \ud83d\ude2c SIGHHHHH... honestly, recovery sounds so scary but i know i need to get better, especially for my daughter.",

          "body": "Don\u2019t be too hard on yourself. Most people deal with stress in less than perfect ways (drugs, alcohol, sexual promiscuity, gambling, excessive shopping, etc). So you are not alone in trying to deal with stress in less than perfect ways. \n\nOne thing I said to myself going in was that I was feeling more and more out of control every day, so I\u2019d listen and try whatever they said in the hope that they could do what I couldn\u2019t, which was to loosen the grip this THING had over me. \n\nBut yeah every feeling you have had I have had, people saying \u201cyou\u2019re  skinny, eat\u201d and I\u2019m like \u201cwhat do you know!!\u201d\n\nOr eating a meal and literally afraid to get on the scale, CERTAIN I\u2019ve gained 5-10lbs. Then eventually I get on and I haven\u2019t gained at all. But the fear and anxiety are real, and powerful. \n\nAnother thing about treatment they help give you effective ways to deal with stress. Tools to help you accept the stress that everyone gets, and not let it manifest itself in unhealthy coping mechanisms. \n\nThat may sound simplistic and like yeah right give me a break, but they do help.",

          "body": "you\u2019re lucky to not gain after a meal. i always weigh myself before and after i eat anything so that i \u201cget rid of it\u201d until i\u2019m at the before weight or lower. i won\u2019t even drink a cup of water bc it literally makes me 8 oz heavier. i know how ridiculous this is... \n\nand yes, that\u2019s what i need! healthy coping mechanisms. especially when dealing with stress, trauma, flashbacks, etc. one of the coordinators at the facility sent me the schedule and i saw how many meals there were. i hope they don\u2019t expect me to consume that much to start \ud83d\ude26i also saw \u201cart therapy\u201d and \u201ctrauma/boundaries\u201d so i\u2019m interested to see if those can help me \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb",

          "body": "Oh I would weigh myself religiously three tines a day. Now just 3-4 times a week. Nights after hot yoga were the best because it was certain I\u2019d weigh 3-4lbs less from all the sweat. \n\nMy program made me eat all meals immediately even though I felt sooooo full from breakfast. Eventually my hunger cues returned to a more normal point. \n\nJust try and remember that you\u2019re going to have to sit with really unpleasant emotions and feelings that the eating disorder allow you to ignore. \n\nWith your normal coping mechanisms rejected you\u2019re going to experience a lot of pain and unpleasant emotions until you can begin to incorporate healthier and sustainable coping mechanisms.",
