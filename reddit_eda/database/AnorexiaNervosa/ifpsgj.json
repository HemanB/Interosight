  "selftext": "\nHi everyone so I\u2019ve struggled for restrictive eating disordered behavior patterns since I was maybe 15 or 16 (by the time I hit puberty and started to notice my metabolism to slow a little and be being more prone of weight gain - idk why, maybe due to the media, but I\u2019ve always been very fat-phobic & extremely fearful of becoming obese or even being marginally overweight as I feel I would be ugly and undesired) and ever since, especially since moving into my own apartment my ED & restrictive, anorexic eating patterns and behaviors have worsened in intensity, in terms of the number of rules (very little carbs, fat, sodium and sugar) along w/ occasional guilt binges (eating a Burger King order probably meant for a couple and not finishing it fully & throwing the rest out of disgust and shame for relapsing). I\u2019ve been eating salads paired w/ fruit per w/meal each day to reach my goal. Long story short, the coordinator at internship site of mine for a class km doing looks to be very thin and I get severely triggered and upset because I feel fat in comparison whenever I see her (I analyze how her arms and legs for instance are a lot thinner than mine . How do I stop this unhealthy thinking? Sorry :(",

In real life, it's kind of hard to avoid as much and it can be a struggle when it can be literally ANYONE. Sometimes what I do is I rationalize that this person is either sick like me (which makes me sad and not as resentful) or just naturally like that (which makes me still a little resentful but then I feel less inclined to \"catch up\"). So sorry you're dealing with this. Hope this helps!",
