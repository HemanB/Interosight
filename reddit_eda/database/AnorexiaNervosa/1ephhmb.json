  "selftext": "My son is a beautiful young boy, very sporty, very smart. Whilst at school a few events unknown to us resulted in him thinking he was fat (he was probably less than 8% body fat at the time). Things got worse over six months but we still didn\u2019t realise he had A.N. \nAbout 6 weeks ago I took him to the doctors and mental heath clinic and they immediately noticed what they were dealing with. They have started implementing a \u201cfamily based therapy\u201d approach where they coach us how to respond to our son\u2019s remarks etc and we then take all control of food. We have to choose the food types, the amount and the frequency.\nAfter 3 weeks of this it seems like he is just getting worse and worse and is still losing weight no matter how hard we try to get him to eat. His tantrums have gone next level, it\u2019s like he is possessed and saying terrible things we\u2019ve never heard from him before, even to his grandparents- the people he adores the most), and then switches back to our child and is so concerned he is ruining everyone\u2019s lives and cries for help. \nThe psychiatrist has warned that we may need to medicate him soon and not allow him to play sport (the one thing that makes him happy at the moment). \n\nWe are terrified, heartbroken and don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t know what I am asking in this post, but if you have any tips, or have had similar experiences I would appreciate any knowledge or understanding I can gain. \n\nThanks \n",

      "body": "Hey I understand this. I've had anorexia for 2.5 years and did fbt back at the start. It was a horrendous experience that traumatised my entire family. My parents, like you, were scared and alone and didn't know what to do and fbt was the only offered support in my area.\nI would not recommend it. Instead, engage a dietician and some form of therapy as an absolute priority. If he's involved and invested there is a far higher chance of recovery. I don't know where you are but there are many public mental health services available, or private if that's not feasible. For me, having a space to talk about my emotions and the trauma from fbt was central to my improvement.\nFor me, fbt was extremely invalidating to my person hood but was constantly pushed due to its \"gold standard\" (meaning people just weight restore) when in fact it causes severe trauma. Weight restoration tbh is the last thing to worry about - anorexia is a mental health condition.\nYour son clearly has loving parents who want the best for him, and I pray that he finds his way out. His having a space to be validated and process emotions in a specific, trained environment in the field of mental health is vital and in my experience you just don't get that with fbt.\nAnyway, I'm just an internet stranger and I don't know you but I empathise with your struggle. Look after yourself and learn about real experiences of eds (being on here is an amazing start) and I wish you and especially your son the absolute best.\nHugs \ud83d\udc95",

      "body": "I developed anorexia at about the same age as your son so hopefully I can share some insight you might find helpful. First of all, I\u2019m very sorry you and your family are experiencing this. I realize this is a stressful time for all of you. \n\nDeveloping Ana at such a young age would lead me to believe there is some other underlying mental health condition. OCD, ptsd, anxiety, or something like that. If he isn\u2019t already receiving treatment, I would suggest setting him up with weekly counseling. Not ED focused, just talk therapy. Treating the underlying condition is CRUCIAL for recovery. \n\nYou mentioned that you\u2019ve been in full control of his diet and that he is still losing weight. That tells me he is vomiting, using laxatives, or exercising excessively behind your back. There\u2019s no other explanation and don\u2019t let him convince you there is. Eating disorders make you lie and be sneaky even if it isn\u2019t in your character to do so. Make sure there are no laxatives in the home accessible to him. Read into signs of bulimia (bruised knuckles, hair loss, etc) to see if it fits his behaviors. If he\u2019s running to the bathroom after every meal there\u2019s your answer. I know you are a very involved mama but he might need even MORE supervision to prevent further weight loss. \n\nThe more weight you lose the less of a grip on reality you have because your brain isn\u2019t functioning properly. Which would explain the emotional outbursts and illogical behavior. He\u2019s also getting closer to puberty age so that is probably a factor as well. \n\nGenerally I don\u2019t advise invading your child\u2019s privacy but this is his health and future here. His brain is still developing. I think you should do a quick glance at his social media pages to see if he\u2019s following harmful \u201cpro Ana\u201d content, look in hidy holes in his room for hidden food or vomit, clothing pockets even. I\u2019ve seen people hide food in their hair and under their nails. Be very vigilant. No long sleeves or hoodies at the dinner table. When he grows up he\u2019ll see how much you cared and thank you for it but for now you have to be the bad guy so he has a future. I\u2019m not trying to scare you, but this disease has taken the life of 3 of my friends. 1 at the age of 16. As horrible as you may feel invading his space, it could save his life. \n\nIf all else fails, in-patient treatment is your last resort option. It is effective if done properly. Do your research when finding a facility for him because the care he receives in-patient could make or break his recovery. I\u2019ve been to amazing  in-patient centers that actually care about the patients and I\u2019ve been to facilities where the staff is just there for a paycheck. It makes a huge difference. \n\nYou\u2019re already doing a good job so just keep the ball rolling. Show him how much you care. Make sure he knows no one is angry with him. Wishing you and your family a smooth recovery! I didn\u2019t intend to write such a long response but with him being so young this sounded all too familiar to me",

      "body": "Controlling his behavior is not the way, you need to shower that boy in love especially when he is raging. That behavior is coming from a place of fear and possibly a belief he is unlovely all together & not worthy of eating (speaking from my individual perspective with anorexia). When approaching meals or snacks, be an encourager not an enforcer. When anyone comes in hot and tries to strong arm me into eating, you better believe I\u2019m doubling down and can hold out like nothing else\u2014 a battle over what was only intended as a decline of one meal could send me into a hunger strike for several days depending upon how much force or threat that person tried to impose upon me. That is not because I\u2019m obstinate, but because my eating disorder is the only thing I feel safe and protected by and the thought to relinquish that (especially in a tense environment ) is something I couldn\u2019t endure. If I\u2019d give one piece of advice, please try to separate the eating disorder from your son. Don\u2019t begin treating your son as the disorder when you become frustrated.You might not recognize him as your son when he\u2019s engaging in the eating disorder but try to see past the behaviors. Feeling rejected by a loved one because of the eating disorder is the most alienating experience. Eating disorders are weird, at one moment you feel safe and protected by it, at other moments it feels like you\u2019re enslaved to a cruel demon much more powerful than you who is tormenting your mind  and your to terrified to \u201cdisobey\u201d their (the ED rules )",

      "body": "I've compared it before to addiction. In the same way an alcoholic thinks about alcohol all the time, an anorexic thinks about food all the time. Either restriction, amount, what they have to do for a deficit, etc. Addiction is a disease, anorexia is paradoxical addiction (the addiction is restriction). \n\nThe other similarity is when your loved one has an addiction/eating disorder, you think about where they're gonna get their DOC or food/lack there of from too. So it becomes your co-addiction. \n\n9/10 addiction based diseases have the mental health component. My anorexia is so tied to my OCD and some other variables. You can kill a spider everytime you see one, or you can figure out where they're getting in from and fix the problem more long term. I think finding a good cognitive behavioral therapist might be a good choice, but I don't know much about CBT and children so anyone else can feel free to chime in.  It's the only thing that really ever worked for me. I also have made healthy eating into a game for myself and I keep a food journal and track the macro nutrition so I know I'm getting the most from my food fuel. I will never have a truly happy and healthy relationship with food but I want to LIVE and therapy has helped me realize that's the perogative. \n\nYoure doing your best, and it's SCARY. No one noticed my ED until I was 19 and it started at 10. You're doing so well by him. I promise. Therapy will help him value himself more, he already knows you do. I really hope you get to a better place with this. I can't imagine how scared I'd be if I were one of my kids (I have two little boys myself now).",

I made the decision to admit her to our local children\u2019s hospital, where her doctor was an attending in the ED center. The two weeks gave her some perspective, but in the end, we admitted her to a residential program. \n     All the centers in our state were full, so we had to send her 3 states away. I think I had been away from her maybe twice since she was born and I had to send my baby hours away. But in hindsight, it was the best thing we could have ever done for her. She had 24 hour care, access to therapists, doctors, nurses, dietitians, personal chefs. Her food was monitored, she had both group and personal therapy, and we zoomed in for family sessions. We visited every single week on Fridays. It was incredibly difficult. There were ups and downs. There were tears and arguments, but those eventually gave way to laughs that we hadn\u2019t heard in so long and smiles as she learned more about how to handle herself and accepting who she was. \n    My wife and I learned a lot and realized a lot of what we were doing prior to residential was probably not the best approach, but we learned to forgive ourselves. We are a year out now and we now have a new normal. The ED is still there - I can see it lurking from time to time but we have the tools now to recognize when it appears and how to work through it. \n    The residential program saved her. It was one of the hardest decisions to make, and I fought it for so long, but it truly turned everything around. I\u2019ll pray for you and please know you are not alone.",

Firstly, I would encourage you to have a meeting with his school. It could be there is an exact trigger somewhere and needs to be avoided until he is stronger. \nYoung children can be traumatized easily as they have not developed enough coping skills. It is imperative you find someone who is an eating disorders specialist and not just a general psychiatrist/therapist. It is heartbreaking for family ( I know ) as they want to understand, support and help their child but patience and love are two very important qualities to show him.

I've had it forever, but some of my school friends and their parents had no idea, because I have always felt safe eating around them. \n\nI also find distraction helps, like reading a book with breakfast,  or watching TV. \n\nI have had lots of therapy over the years from specialised therapists, and it really did help me manage it better. But the best advice I got from one of them was that (and you can fact check this) no amount of therapy makes you better. Only eating does. \n\nSo try not to do things which make eating more stressful, or a negative, pressurised, guilt ridden experience. \n\nFind out what \"safe\" foods they have and have them available all the time.  \n\nGood luck OP",

      "body": "Mum you have got this and its not your fault remember that. A lot of parents of kids with anorexia think that it is something they have done wrong but it is not. There is something that i describe as a guilt cycle that happens between parents and children with anorexia. You feel guilty like you have done something wrong, you show anger and distress to the child -> the child feels like they are destroying their life and upsetting everyone -> the child doesn't know how to cope with negative feelings in a healthy way and continues to starve as a way to cope-> you get frustrated and show your distress again. And the cycle repeats. I am a girl not a boy but one thing I think could help you in supporting your boy is to help him to find something (sadly that thing was sport) that he really loves and can devote himself to that is more important than anorexia. Throw him into social groups where he can make friends, learn a skill (that's an important one, anorexics love an ongoing and ever improving project) ect. Your job is to be a solid foundation, treat him the same as if he never was sick, be someone that won't go away if he decides to improve. Something that perpetuates anorexia is the feeling that if you recover people won't love you/ be there for you anymore and you will have to grow up. That's why it develops around puberty usually. You've got this mum, its so hard but you will get through it. I'm sorry and I really feel for you",

I felt horrendous all the time and was extremely dysregulated and in a system void of support, despite having the kindest and most loving parents I could have wanted.\n The reason for this was, from my perspective, a treatment system that refused to acknowledge me as an individual and delve into my own conceptualisation of the illness. For example, a key philosophy of externalising the eating disorder voice did not resonate with me and everything I said was me \"lying or being manipulative\".\nI got out of this cycle of weight gain correlating in my parents' and the doctors' minds to recovery eventually. I refused to continue fbt and my relationship with my parents disintegrated further and further until I began to receive mental health support acknowledging the intersectionality of my personality and my anorexia. This therapist, who has been absolutely key to my improvement, helped me articulate how the controlling nature of FBT was triggering my eating disorder into a violent spiral of >!self harm!< and increasing isolation, and that the best support they could give me was to empower me to engage in and choose the direction of my own treatment.\nI'm not recovered by any stretch, but I'm happier, more fulfilled, have stronger relationships with my family and a healthier relationship to food, and have stopped both the >!self harm and losing weight!<. Talk to your son, find out his perspective, make sure he knows that you're going to support how he deals with his own mental health, and I would suggest finding alternatives to fbt.\nAgain, wishing all the best \ud83d\udc95",

First of all, I\u2019m very sorry you and your family are experiencing this. I realize this is a stressful time for all of you. \n\nDeveloping Ana at such a young age would lead me to believe there is some other underlying mental health condition. OCD, ptsd, anxiety, or something like that. If he isn\u2019t already receiving treatment, I would suggest setting him up with weekly counseling. Not ED focused, just talk therapy. Treating the underlying condition is CRUCIAL for recovery. \n\nYou mentioned that you\u2019ve been in full control of his diet and that he is still losing weight. That tells me he is vomiting, using laxatives, or exercising excessively behind your back. There\u2019s no other explanation and don\u2019t let him convince you there is. Eating disorders make you lie and be sneaky even if it isn\u2019t in your character to do so. Make sure there are no laxatives in the home accessible to him. Read into signs of bulimia (bruised knuckles, hair loss, etc) to see if it fits his behaviors. If he\u2019s running to the bathroom after every meal there\u2019s your answer. I know you are a very involved mama but he might need even MORE supervision to prevent further weight loss. \n\nThe more weight you lose the less of a grip on reality you have because your brain isn\u2019t functioning properly. Which would explain the emotional outbursts and illogical behavior. He\u2019s also getting closer to puberty age so that is probably a factor as well. \n\nGenerally I don\u2019t advise invading your child\u2019s privacy but this is his health and future here. His brain is still developing. I think you should do a quick glance at his social media pages to see if he\u2019s following harmful \u201cpro Ana\u201d content, look in hidy holes in his room for hidden food or vomit, clothing pockets even. I\u2019ve seen people hide food in their hair and under their nails. Be very vigilant. No long sleeves or hoodies at the dinner table. When he grows up he\u2019ll see how much you cared and thank you for it but for now you have to be the bad guy so he has a future. I\u2019m not trying to scare you, but this disease has taken the life of 3 of my friends. 1 at the age of 16. As horrible as you may feel invading his space, it could save his life. \n\nIf all else fails, in-patient treatment is your last resort option. It is effective if done properly. Do your research when finding a facility for him because the care he receives in-patient could make or break his recovery. I\u2019ve been to amazing  in-patient centers that actually care about the patients and I\u2019ve been to facilities where the staff is just there for a paycheck. It makes a huge difference. \n\nYou\u2019re already doing a good job so just keep the ball rolling. Show him how much you care. Make sure he knows no one is angry with him. Wishing you and your family a smooth recovery! I didn\u2019t intend to write such a long response but with him being so young this sounded all too familiar to me",

When anyone comes in hot and tries to strong arm me into eating, you better believe I\u2019m doubling down and can hold out like nothing else\u2014 a battle over what was only intended as a decline of one meal could send me into a hunger strike for several days depending upon how much force or threat that person tried to impose upon me.

Don\u2019t begin treating your son as the disorder when you become frustrated.You might not recognize him as your son when he\u2019s engaging in the eating disorder but try to see past the behaviors.

          "body": "I've compared it before to addiction. In the same way an alcoholic thinks about alcohol all the time, an anorexic thinks about food all the time. Either restriction, amount, what they have to do for a deficit, etc. Addiction is a disease, anorexia is paradoxical addiction (the addiction is restriction). \n\nThe other similarity is when your loved one has an addiction/eating disorder, you think about where they're gonna get their DOC or food/lack there of from too. So it becomes your co-addiction. \n\n9/10 addiction based diseases have the mental health component. My anorexia is so tied to my OCD and some other variables. You can kill a spider everytime you see one, or you can figure out where they're getting in from and fix the problem more long term. I think finding a good cognitive behavioral therapist might be a good choice, but I don't know much about CBT and children so anyone else can feel free to chime in.  It's the only thing that really ever worked for me. I also have made healthy eating into a game for myself and I keep a food journal and track the macro nutrition so I know I'm getting the most from my food fuel. I will never have a truly happy and healthy relationship with food but I want to LIVE and therapy has helped me realize that's the perogative. \n\nYoure doing your best, and it's SCARY. No one noticed my ED until I was 19 and it started at 10. You're doing so well by him. I promise. Therapy will help him value himself more, he already knows you do. I really hope you get to a better place with this. I can't imagine how scared I'd be if I were one of my kids (I have two little boys myself now).",

I made the decision to admit her to our local children\u2019s hospital, where her doctor was an attending in the ED center. The two weeks gave her some perspective, but in the end, we admitted her to a residential program. \n     All the centers in our state were full, so we had to send her 3 states away. I think I had been away from her maybe twice since she was born and I had to send my baby hours away. But in hindsight, it was the best thing we could have ever done for her. She had 24 hour care, access to therapists, doctors, nurses, dietitians, personal chefs. Her food was monitored, she had both group and personal therapy, and we zoomed in for family sessions. We visited every single week on Fridays. It was incredibly difficult. There were ups and downs. There were tears and arguments, but those eventually gave way to laughs that we hadn\u2019t heard in so long and smiles as she learned more about how to handle herself and accepting who she was. \n    My wife and I learned a lot and realized a lot of what we were doing prior to residential was probably not the best approach, but we learned to forgive ourselves. We are a year out now and we now have a new normal. The ED is still there - I can see it lurking from time to time but we have the tools now to recognize when it appears and how to work through it. \n    The residential program saved her. It was one of the hardest decisions to make, and I fought it for so long, but it truly turned everything around. I\u2019ll pray for you and please know you are not alone.",

Forcing him to eat won\u2019t help anything, it will just make him hate and mistrust you, while he starts to hate himself even more. The very, very best thing you can do is make it easy for him to eat. Never comment on his body, good or bad. Don\u2019t comment on calories or the health of food. Just make lots of calorie-dense food. Have it around all the time. Make and buy him any food he asks for. Ask him if there\u2019s anything you could get him that he wants to eat. Eat a family meal three times a day, and invite him to eat, without judgement. I always appreciated it when the family dinner conversation wasn\u2019t about the food or my health, but just\u2026 about what\u2019s going on in our lives. Honestly, family dinner was the difference between my anorexia killing me and me getting out alive. Have his friends over and put snacks out. Think of special occasions to have good food.

My parents, like you, were scared and alone and didn't know what to do and fbt was the only offered support in my area.\nI would not recommend it. Instead, engage a dietician and some form of therapy as an absolute priority. If he's involved and invested there is a far higher chance of recovery. I don't know where you are but there are many public mental health services available, or private if that's not feasible. For me, having a space to talk about my emotions and the trauma from fbt was central to my improvement.\nFor me, fbt was extremely invalidating to my person hood but was constantly pushed due to its \"gold standard\" (meaning people just weight restore) when in fact it causes severe trauma. Weight restoration tbh is the last thing to worry about - anorexia is a mental health condition.\nYour son clearly has loving parents who want the best for him, and I pray that he finds his way out. His having a space to be validated and process emotions in a specific, trained environment in the field of mental health is vital and in my experience you just don't get that with fbt.\nAnyway, I'm just an internet stranger and I don't know you but I empathise with your struggle. Look after yourself and learn about real experiences of eds (being on here is an amazing start) and I wish you and especially your son the absolute best.\nHugs \ud83d\udc95",

I felt horrendous all the time and was extremely dysregulated and in a system void of support, despite having the kindest and most loving parents I could have wanted.\n The reason for this was, from my perspective, a treatment system that refused to acknowledge me as an individual and delve into my own conceptualisation of the illness. For example, a key philosophy of externalising the eating disorder voice did not resonate with me and everything I said was me \"lying or being manipulative\".\nI got out of this cycle of weight gain correlating in my parents' and the doctors' minds to recovery eventually. I refused to continue fbt and my relationship with my parents disintegrated further and further until I began to receive mental health support acknowledging the intersectionality of my personality and my anorexia. This therapist, who has been absolutely key to my improvement, helped me articulate how the controlling nature of FBT was triggering my eating disorder into a violent spiral of >!self harm!< and increasing isolation, and that the best support they could give me was to empower me to engage in and choose the direction of my own treatment.\nI'm not recovered by any stretch, but I'm happier, more fulfilled, have stronger relationships with my family and a healthier relationship to food, and have stopped both the >!self harm and losing weight!<. Talk to your son, find out his perspective, make sure he knows that you're going to support how he deals with his own mental health, and I would suggest finding alternatives to fbt.\nAgain, wishing all the best \ud83d\udc95",
