  "selftext": "I reached my goal weight of (insert insanely low number here) years ago, and ever since then I've been chasing the high, it was insanely low you guys like the amount of starvation and diligence and substances it took to get there was next level, (yes I felt awful, could barely move) and for what, for me to now be underweight and looking back at my achievement like so far out of reach, so far away? After doing that to myself (without any realistic ability to maintaining it or death was soon upon me) now any time I am even significantly underweight I still feel like a failure, my \"lowest weight\" is centuries away, it makes me feel even bigger. And I face it every day, it was much much better to sit in a range of numbers, not life or death numbers.\n\n\\*VERY OFF TOPIC: also my roommate has an ed and F him for telling me I look so good when i'm underweight, like tell me more about how much you care about my health lmao.... that is still bothering me. I'm not discussing any type of food related/ed related topic with him anymore. He can tell me about his groceries, he can ask about mine, but it ends there, I'm not discussing weight loss with him. He hurt my feelings so much with that comment.",

If your roommate has an ED, and knows you have an ED, that kind of comment serves nothing except to try to tear you down and make your roommate feel better about themselves. It\u2019s just guys in the way of a fake compliment. \n\nOr, your roommate\u2019s clearly very disordered mind was speaking up, and either way, their words are bullshit. \n\nAlso, I would even consider setting boundaries about grocery talk, if you can\u2019t stop him from sharing his, you can absolutely set your own boundary that he cannot ask about your groceries or food. You have to prioritize you.",
