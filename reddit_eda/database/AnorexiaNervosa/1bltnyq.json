  "selftext": "So yes like the title says, I just fainted.\n\nDon\u2019t wanna post numbers but it\u2019s been quite a long time since I actually ate anything.\nWoke up about an hour ago and was sitting in my bed while listening to a podcast. Got up to go make some coffee and got really light headed. That\u2019s the last thing I remember. Woke up in the hallway on the ground. \nDoesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to figure out what happened.\nI fucking fainted. I looked at the time and I was out for about 5 minutes.\nI know if I tell my family they will insist I go to an ER. After all my trauma with ER\u2019s I just can\u2019t do it again.\nI knew I had to tell someone so I am posting here. I managed to drink some water and coffee with a tiny amount of cream and I am feeling better but I just wanted to get it out there on what happened.\n\nAlso wanted to say I fucking love everyone on this sub, you guys rock and are my motivation to keep going.\nStay beautiful.\nRegards,\nStella",

      "body": "I recommend a protein shake or weight loss shake. When my ED was its worst I fainted SEVERAL times in public. Once at school I fainted, totally unconscious, near the sinks in the girls bathroom and someone I had never met had to wake me from the bathroom floor. I couldn\u2019t get up right away so she had to get my friend to stay with me until I was ready to stand and walk. I was so weak and tired. Fainted another time in Costco near the exit and woke up laying on the cement floor with a huge crowd of strangers surrounding me. Could\u2019ve been way worse considering the type of cement floor they have at Costco. Could\u2019ve cracked my skull. Fainted once in my kitchen during high school and parents found me unconscious. \n\nWhat I started to do instead of no food per day was drink a weight loss shake in the morning. One at night. Low cal, low fat, you can get low carb/sugar, at least you are taking in vital nutrients. \n\nIt also helped keep me from nausea because I was on antidepressants which eventually my body wouldn\u2019t tolerate on an empty stomach (made me horribly nauseous to the point I had to ask my friend\u2019s mom who drove me to school to pull over so I could throw up on the sidewalk gutter in a residential area on the way to school. Also mortifying) \n\nThe protein shakes or low calorie weight loss shakes helped my blood pressure, blood sugar and nausea a bit. Stopped the fainting. If you continue to not eat at all, the fainting, light-headedness, dizziness, extreme weakness will get worse and it will start to happen in public or around parents/family causing them to freak out about what\u2019s going on with you. I strongly encourage you to try eating or drinking foods that feel safe to you. Apples, berries, bell peppers, carrots, low cal yogurt, olives, pickles, broccoli, green beans, tuna, any lean meats, protein bar, but my best recommendation is protein shakes because they have nutrients and vitamins your body NEEDS. If you aren\u2019t eating, you are severely deficient in vitamins/minerals that will cause damage, sometimes permanent damage.\n\nSome examples of the severe risks malnourishment and vitamin or mineral deficiency can cause:\n\nVitamin D deficiency- Heart problems including CVD, hypertension, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, severe osteoporosis (permanent), low bone density (brittle bones) that makes you extremely vulnerable to bone fractures \n\nVitamin A deficiency- The world\u2019s leading cause of blindness, temporary and permanent eye damage that can result in blindness, severely weakened immune function which increases risk of disease, death by disease and death from infection.\n\nVitamin B12 deficiency - nervous system disorders, fatal and non-fatal coronary disease, stroke, anemia \nFolic Acid deficiency - neurological issues, weakness, mouth sores \n\nIron deficiency- anemia, heart problems, restless leg syndrome \n\nZinc deficiency- eye problems, decline in cardiac function, heart failure, hair loss, eye and skin lesions, the skin, immune dysfunction, more infections than usual, wounds that take a long time to heal, dermatitis, acne, dizziness, fainting, loss of taste and smell, decreased nerve conduction, neuropsychiatric disorders, neurosensory disorders, brain fog, skin rashes, eczema, canker sores\n\nBiotin deficiency- Hair loss, brittle nails, skin rashes \n\nA starving body will start to eat muscle and this always includes the heart which is a muscle. You are doing permanent, irreversible damage to the heart by not eating. I promise you I am not trying to lecture or be patronizing or annoying. I\u2019m saying this because vitamin supplements can help and because protein shakes or even weight loss shakes can provide you these vital nutrients without a lot of calories. You can look up foods rich in each (or any) of those nutrients and see if any of those foods would be safe foods for you. It was this type of information about scientific, factual dangers and symptoms of malnutrition and starvation from my doctor and eating disorder specialist that helped me the most to make changes slowly and willingly. I hope you might save this information. If it doesn\u2019t matter to you now, it may start to matter in the future when you start seeing some of these symptoms taking effect. \n\nI fully understand the struggle, the addiction to the feeling of hunger, discipline, starvation, results, getting smaller, more fragile, and the intense fear of food and calories and fat and sugar and carbs. I totally understand it and have absolutely experienced it. I deeply relate to the feeling. I know it\u2019s a very difficult thing to let go of. Very hard to stop. Usually you don\u2019t care about your health at all. The damage to the body becomes basically irrelevant to people deeply in ED because it\u2019s essentially an addiction and feeding the addiction to starving is paramount when you\u2019re in that deep. Pls just come back to this comment if you ever feel ready. I\u2019m just wishing the best for you. \ud83d\udc9c",

My ex boyfriend has AN and one of the main things that always affected him the most was when other people took what he was doing as attention seeking behavior or that he was enjoying it. \n\nAlso I have noticed the mods on here are pretty strict and if anything in this post came off as PA then it surely would have been taken down by down. \nI see Reddit as a way for people to speak whatever it be that is going on inside the head and that\u2019s what she\u2019s doing.\nTake a look at yourself and the comment you just made.

If you can drink water, do so. A cold cloth on the forehead. If your legs start to feel like jelly, sit asap. It could be good to keep something on you that you can eat in those moments, a sugar free candy, gum, a mint, a few almonds, a granola or protein bar (if you can\u2019t bring yourself to eat the whole thing, eat half, eat a quarter of the bar), whatever you can push yourself to do. any acceptable, non-perishable thing that you can keep in a pocket or purse or backpack. I\u2019ve had people give me one small spoon of peanut butter or a small amount of honey when I\u2019ve fainted or got so light-headed I had to sit. It helped get me home. A couple or few of reduced-fat wheat thins would help. Anything at all.
