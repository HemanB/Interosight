  "selftext": "I have \"typical\" anorexia but I was talking to my psychologist about the differences between typical and atypical AN because I was curious. \n\nI don't know if this is a hot take or completely ignorant, but I feel like they should get rid of atypical anorexia as a diagnosis. Here are my reasonings:\n\nwe know that anorexia is diagnosed when the patient has an intense fear of gaining weight, among many other things. I am reading the DSM-5 as I write this. atypical anorexia is defined as the same criteria, just being a healthy weight or overweight. \n\nI feel like if I was diagnosed with atypical anorexia, it would just motivate me even more to restrict and become typical because I would know that I am a healthy weight or overweight. does that make sense to anyone?\n\nI feel like it is sort of saying to the patient \"yeah you restrict but it isn't helping you achieve your goal because you are still healthy/overweight\". I just feel like it is an incentive to continue the behaviors.\n\ndoes anyone agree",

      "body": "(This is my 3rd time posting this....my comments aren't showing up).\n\nI think it depends on when it's diagnosed tbh. AN isn't usually diagnosed until the sufferer has lost a large percentage of their body weight (which will vary for individuals depending on their SW and rate of weight loss) because they don't seek help until that point. Not because of validity reasons or dx criteria, but because that's just the nature of disease progression. People usually access help in some form once they start dealing with severe health consequences or when their physical state becomes noticeably concerning to those around them. EDs are secretive illnesses and most people don't access help when they notice mild symptoms or they just don't attribute it to their disorder until it becomes clear that the disorder is causing said symptoms.\n\nGiven what I stated above, I personally feel like if someone is dx with AAN very early on, then it may just be too soon to gauge the disorder medically speaking and there's nothing to do but wait and offer mental health resources. If someone is dx with AAN after years into their disorder, I personally feel like it's a different diagnosis or something is legitimately wrong with their body to not have become underweight, again, warranting an entirely separate medical diagnosis. That's my take. The reality is that AN will lead to extreme weight loss and should lead to someone becoming underweight. The time frame in which that happens will vary significantly according to individual circumstances.\n\nSo I'm more interested in the molecular underpinnings of AAN that's diagnosed and remains stagnant over X years while the person is actively restricting their intake as the criteria for AN suggests. I just don't really understand how it's possible otherwise. Someone who goes on to develop AN could have a health scare and wind up in the hospital long before they get worse or reach UW status and yet that doesn't change the fact that they'll meet criteria for AN. It's likely that they either won't disclose such problems and it won't be considered relevant (without the physical appearance of malnutrition). In the past, I imagine this happened anyway and people were just sent home without an AAN diagnosis. Most of that either progressed to AN or morphed into other eating disorders. The AN dx criteria exists for a reason and it's meant to treat severe malnourishment. I still don't understand AAN, but I believe it's either too early of a dx (or used for clinicians to recognize and gauge the disorder earlier) or simply the body's sheer inability to lose weight (which is a totally separate health issue).",

Like I\u2019m sorry, but unless you also suffer from PCOS or disorders that cause similar difficulties with weight loss regardless of eating patterns, I think it\u2019s more likely that you are suffering from something closer to bulimia than anorexia. \n\nIt almost feels like they think anorexia is the pinnacle of disordered eating since doesn\u2019t come with the stigma of admitting you binge eat regularly.

There's already a lot of diagnostic crossover with EDs in the span of a year, which isn't very long. If someone went from AN to AAN in a year, then that suggests something atypical is happening with their body. Realistically, the body should be losing weight and if it's not losing weight amid prolonged restriction, then that is certainly atypical. The idea that X% of people have AAN over AN is just plain wrong in my opinion and it's pseudoscience. It means that they don't have AN, period.",

If they are maintaining a low healthy body weight for instance, then they are healthy because they are maintaining their current health that is suggested to be healthy by medical standards **until proven otherwise**.

With underweights, you are considered healthy if you stop restricting, **AND**, gain weight.\n\nSo of course someone with AAN who started in the obese range and has now reached a normal weight can become quite sick, really fast. If they stop restricting at a normal weight, they are deemed healthy, PERIOD. That is NOT TRUE for someone with typical AN. Maintenance is not enough for them to be deemed healthy by western medicine standards. It's just a fact, and one that I disagree with, because, well, of course *health* isn't *weight based,* or is it? Medicine seems to think so, especially where eating disorders are involved.\n\nThere's usually a baseline cutoff with healthy weight, so someone can be low healthy range, and some doctors will say that is unhealthy for them. If someone has gone from class three obesity to high healthy weight range, I have every reason to believe that they're healthy. A simple fix would be to eat at maintenance level and include vitamins and minerals. Again, that's not the current treatment protocol for someone with AN.\n\nThe degree of psychopathology is more severe because they're not underweight lol..........of course someone with AN who's restricting who doesn't meet the standards of their ideal is going to feel pretty extreme about it. There truly is no difference. Rate of weight loss will inevitably slow down once someone is underweight just based on how the body works. If you are underweight, your risk will always be greater than that someone who isn't underweight and thus, medical intervention is often required or at least enforced. It's just the society we live in. And yet despite the body breaking down slowly, many people with AN have lived for many years, and people find that fascinating.\n\nI won't respond anymore because this argument is making me look bad when I'm not the problem here. Medicine is.\n\nIf you ask me, AAN was created for research purposes and to gauge the difference between drastic weight loss that stops in the healthy range vs AN. It doesn't change anything about the treatments offered to people. Those with AN have one mission; atypical or not. The distinction between the two is quite irrelevant. I think they just got bored and came up with this one.",

Not because of validity reasons or dx criteria, but because that's just the nature of disease progression. People usually access help in some form once they start dealing with severe health consequences or when their physical state becomes noticeably concerning to those around them. EDs are secretive illnesses and most people don't access help when they notice mild symptoms or they just don't attribute it to their disorder until it becomes clear that the disorder is causing said symptoms.\n\nGiven what I stated above, I personally feel like if someone is dx with AAN very early on, then it may just be too soon to gauge the disorder medically speaking and there's nothing to do but wait and offer mental health resources. If someone is dx with AAN after years into their disorder, I personally feel like it's a different diagnosis or something is legitimately wrong with their body to not have become underweight, again, warranting an entirely separate medical diagnosis.

The AN dx criteria exists for a reason and it's meant to treat severe malnourishment. I still don't understand AAN, but I believe it's either too early of a dx (or used for clinicians to recognize and gauge the disorder earlier) or simply the body's sheer inability to lose weight (which is a totally separate health issue).",

          "body": "(This is my 3rd time posting this....my comments aren't showing up).\n\nI think it depends on when it's diagnosed tbh. AN isn't usually diagnosed until the sufferer has lost a large percentage of their body weight (which will vary for individuals depending on their SW and rate of weight loss) because they don't seek help until that point. Not because of validity reasons or dx criteria, but because that's just the nature of disease progression. People usually access help in some form once they start dealing with severe health consequences or when their physical state becomes noticeably concerning to those around them. EDs are secretive illnesses and most people don't access help when they notice mild symptoms or they just don't attribute it to their disorder until it becomes clear that the disorder is causing said symptoms.\n\nGiven what I stated above, I personally feel like if someone is dx with AAN very early on, then it may just be too soon to gauge the disorder medically speaking and there's nothing to do but wait and offer mental health resources. If someone is dx with AAN after years into their disorder, I personally feel like it's a different diagnosis or something is legitimately wrong with their body to not have become underweight, again, warranting an entirely separate medical diagnosis. That's my take. The reality is that AN will lead to extreme weight loss and should lead to someone becoming underweight. The time frame in which that happens will vary significantly according to individual circumstances.\n\nSo I'm more interested in the molecular underpinnings of AAN that's diagnosed and remains stagnant over X years while the person is actively restricting their intake as the criteria for AN suggests. I just don't really understand how it's possible otherwise. Someone who goes on to develop AN could have a health scare and wind up in the hospital long before they get worse or reach UW status and yet that doesn't change the fact that they'll meet criteria for AN. It's likely that they either won't disclose such problems and it won't be considered relevant (without the physical appearance of malnutrition). In the past, I imagine this happened anyway and people were just sent home without an AAN diagnosis. Most of that either progressed to AN or morphed into other eating disorders. The AN dx criteria exists for a reason and it's meant to treat severe malnourishment. I still don't understand AAN, but I believe it's either too early of a dx (or used for clinicians to recognize and gauge the disorder earlier) or simply the body's sheer inability to lose weight (which is a totally separate health issue).",

Maintenance, deficit or surplus is irrelevant. It's the weight criteria. If someone at a severely UW BMI gains to a moderate UW BMI, they still meet criteria for AN despite having gained weight or no longer continuing a level of further restriction that would result in continued weight loss. The same cannot be said for someone who started gaining at a mild-moderate UW BMI.",

If they are restricting, then they should become underweight at some point, otherwise their bodies may be suffering in ways that are preventing that from happening. You can be restrictive without restricting (i.e. consuming less energy than your body requires to maintain healthy function). If they are maintaining a low healthy body weight for instance, then they are healthy because they are maintaining their current health that is suggested to be healthy by medical standards **until proven otherwise**. So if they show no evidence of AN and all its malfunctions, then what is the problem exactly and what is the validity of AAN?",
