She only acted like she cared after I started to get thinner than her. She also tried on my pants and got mad at me because she didn\u2019t fit them. She also is uw and obsessed with health and exercise, Im pretty sure she has an ed herself but she doesn\u2019t recognise it.\n\nShe lost weight after I went on a trip with my dad and is now acting all petite and smol and she is pretty body dismorfic cause she told me that her legs were fatty and she\u2019s a bag of bones.\n\n\nToday we were shopping together and she was all dizzy and was acting up saying that she was weak and whatever. I can\u2019t help it but to be mad at her. She didn\u2019t help me when I was like that but now I have to take care of her? It makes me so mad that she lost weight after everything that Ive told her.
