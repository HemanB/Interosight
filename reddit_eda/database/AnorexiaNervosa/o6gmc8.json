  "selftext": "I\u2019m 24 now female. When I was a teen (back in the kik and tumblr days) this guy reached out to me, talking about how he could help me with losing weight and still hide it from my parents, blah blah blah etc etc. he used to make me feel so uncomfortable because he would make me send almost fully nude pictures for \u201cbody checks\u201d, he knows my first and last name, if I ate over x calories that day he would make me do these super weird \u201cpunishments\u201d of fat grabbing and other things. Never told anyone I would just make up excuses so I couldn\u2019t talk to him any more. This man makes me nervous and extremely uncomfortable and I don\u2019t know how he found my Snapchat. What do i do? Can I just block him? I\u2019m worried he\u2019ll find my other social media accounts.\nEdit: I\u2019m mainly worried about him somehow stalking me or spreading my old pictures because I just have this awful feeling that he still has pictures of from when I was a teen.",
