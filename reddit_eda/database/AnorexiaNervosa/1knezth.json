And with my last time being my shortest and most damaging, 1 year. \nDuring my episodes it was constantly being cold, the anemia, hair growth on my body, and hair loss. In recovery 3 years after my last episode that lasted a year, I have issues with a lot of my organs, still anemic, I have an enlarged spleen, enlarged liver, I never was a drinker and now I can\u2019t drink period. I can\u2019t even have sugar free drinks and only sometimes if it\u2019s in coffee or tea. They prefer I drink them with no sweetener. I can\u2019t even take pain medication unless absolutely dire. I have to tell every doctor, dentist, therapist about all the medical issues I\u2019ve had as a result and it now limits their treatment options for me for things that should be easy fixes because of the organs that have been heavily affected. Because of all this, my body also has a lot of issue absorbing iron and other things. I have contact inflammation and pain. I\u2019ve caused damage to nerves and joints due to malnutrition. I have ruined my metabolism and I can gain weight like crazy if I\u2019m not properly taking care of myself. I also now have fertility issues to. \n\nWe always lol at the effects during the course of the disease but the times we go into recovery, a lot of people don\u2019t realize the dwindling issues that make it not worth it at all.",

It is gross and painful. \n2. Severe immune deficiency. While I generally am sick less often when engaging in behaviors, when I did get sick, it was much worse and took forever to heal. A light cold is knocking me  out right now. Others who I likely got it from were able to function and I am struggling to do so.
