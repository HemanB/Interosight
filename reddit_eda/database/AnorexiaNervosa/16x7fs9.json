I don't know if anyone saw, but I accidentally posted a video of my tarantula here thinking I was in the tarantula subreddit and it stayed there for 5+ minutes. If anyone saw it, I'm really sorry :( I take this kind of thing serious so I felt bad posting something off topic and possibly triggering arachnophobia in a subreddit about a really serious and fatal struggle\n\nYou guys are strong and I believe in you, y'all are valid and I wish you guys the best of luck \ud83d\udc95 Again, I'm really sorry :(",
