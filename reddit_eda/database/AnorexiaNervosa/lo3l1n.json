Would a piece of cake have made any difference whatsoever to my weight today? No way. I could\u2019ve eaten the whole cake, every year, and I bet I\u2019d still be the same weight right down to the gram. But the memories of sitting there awkwardly while my loved ones ate cake that had my name written on them? That\u2019s going to stay with me forever.\n\nEnjoy your day, enjoy nourishing you\u2019re body, and enjoy your piece of cake! Because god knows we deserve it, having to fight this war every single day. Take care of yourself, and happy birthday!",
