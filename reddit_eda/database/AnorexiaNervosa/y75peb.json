  "selftext": "My nan made these lovely little scone/sugar roll things earlier today. They\u2019re fresh, and so I know they\u2019re really nice- she used to make them when I was young and I loved them, so my mum put one in my lunch for tomorrow and I panicked and threw it away. To make it worse I basically destroyed the thing and made it inedible, and then I shoved it in the bottom of the trash. \n\nI\u2019m no stranger to that sort of thing, (honestly I waste a lot of food and I do feel terrible about it) but this seriously ignited something in me. I cried. I went and hugged her and my mum and now here we are. I\u2019m not sure why it scared me like it did, but I really needed to get this off my chest, I\u2019m sorry.",

So I say to him I'm gonna eat it later and then when he's out of the house, I put it in a plastic bag and destroy then put it in the bottom of the bin and then when he comes, I pretend I've eaten and I feel very sluggish I hate wasting food, but I just can't help how i feel when someone Offers me food to eat am scared of eating because afterwards the next day I feel so sluggish sick my body feels like as if a bus ran over me",
