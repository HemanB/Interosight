  "selftext": "LMAO, I gotta vent this one out. The military is notorious for weighing you twice a year and making sure your within their standards, if not you get put on a program called the pork chop platoon I can\u2019t make this shit up\ud83d\ude2d I got really sick, and more girls now are getting sick with it because of this. Eating disorder therapists that the military hires don\u2019t play around id rather go on deployment and sit in the jungle and stare at rocks again then ever come in contact with the ED therapists. I thought anorexia was ruthless until I saw how the military \u201cfixes it\u201d but bottom line they want males and females to be as skinny as possible males can\u2019t be over 18%, but when the girls lose more than what they want they get mad when bro you told her to not eat what did you expect? Showing up to the hikes in the morning when your higherups are on you about not eating to lose weight is in the same category as high school, absolutely diabolical \n\n",

I think people are aware now of the absolute batshit methods servicemembers employ to ensure they don't break tape. A patient at my PHP was initially diagnosed with BED (he was OW ofc so they didn't consider anything else) before he was reclassed as bulimic. He didn't exactly adhere to milieu rules well and would casually drop his methods of passing H/W, and wtfffff. It was shit I've never even seen in all my years in the ED community.\n\nIt wasn't as crazy with me. Just your standard fare of, you know, what some inpatient/res patients do to cheat weigh-in. However, it was way wilder in basic. I had an ED before I joined the military, but if I didn't, I 100% would've developed one from the shit they made me do in basic.\n\nThe irony of all this is that, to my knowledge, H/W was created to ensure servicemembers weren't malnourished.
