I try to express that actually it\u2019s not all it\u2019s cracked up to be. I started feeling that satisfaction feeling. We all love to have our bodies acknowledged because we are literally killing ourselves to have the body we have. You have a good heart for feeling bad about it but don\u2019t. It\u2019s just the ED talking. Like the person above said \u201cguilt is an awful thing\u201d \n\nTake care of yourself \ud83d\udda4",
