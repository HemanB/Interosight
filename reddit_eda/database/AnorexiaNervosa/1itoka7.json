  "selftext": "It genuinely disgusts me that people treat ana and mia like their diets and not disorders!! \u201cWhat i do to trigger my honeymoon phase\ud83e\udd0d\ud83c\udf80\u201d im not saying \u201choneymoon phases\u201d in eds arent a thing im simply saying the bad parts arent looked at! Its always cute, pink, pilates, salad, healthy, happy, shiny hair, clear skin, etc. im tired of eating disorders being so badly represented! In my \u201choneymoon phase\u201d all i eat is soup and bread like im a midevil peasant, consume absolutely no water, go thru 2 diet cokes a day, barely partake in hygiene (showering, brushing my teeth, skincare, etc), get mad at everyone and everything including objects like a broken coffee maker, tv characters that cant hear me, and myself simply for making a weird face that no one say. Its not just honeymoon phases, eating disorders in general are terribly portrayed. Were not all white, female, straight, cisgender, have a good home life, love sports, and are very thin. In media, relapses, severe health risks, whats truly going on in your mind, arent talked abt one bit. Im tired of having this disorder and even more tired of nobody truly understanding me (except yall ofc). Hope yall liked my rant\ud83d\ude0b",
