  "selftext": "As many of you have, I've been struggling over the holidays and am now restricting quite heavily. I'm back to my lowest weight and BMI ever.\n\nI have no motivation to recover and have also found o have zero appetite which makes it even easier to listen to the ED voice. \n\nAlongside this I am pretty bored of life, and suffer from depression. I guess I've given up fighting and am now just waiting for the ED to kill me.\n\nJust wondering if anyone else has gotten to this point? How have they dealt with it?",

It\u2019s no coincidence that most people with the disorder also suffer from extremely low self-confidence and self-harming tendencies. \nI really hope you get better. This must sound superficial from an online stranger, but life is truly worth living, even if we can\u2019t tell yet. I personally like to distract myself by consuming different forms of media, like shows or music. I also like to have daily rituals/parts of the day I\u2019m always looking forward to, even if they seem super small/insignificant to the average person. That ritual is related to eating in my case, since I get very little of that lmao, but if your appetite has vanished, that might not necessarily work for you. Try thinking about all the things you used to enjoy and make sure to re-explore them on a regular basis. That could give you something to look forward to. \n\nAt the end of the day, a therapist would obviously give much more solid advice than I can ever hope to, but if you ever want to talk about anything, feel free to message me. I\u2019ve had suicidal thoughts in the past (though they were decidedly more reactive than my current state of mind lmao), and I\u2019m so grateful that I didn\u2019t listen. \n\nThe gray will fade away eventually, I promise.",

I think the discomfort with life became so acute because of malnutrition I had forgotten that normal life didn\u2019t actually feel like that. I also think the malnutrition itself was giving me low motivation and suicidal thoughts, rather than the other way around, and it was a revelation when I started increasing that motivation just came back because I was feeding myself.

I\u2019d recommend getting on antidepressants, especially a NDRI like Wellbutrin to try to mollify those thoughts then you can work on recovery or whatever else it\u2019s been blocking. It really does help, the not-sad satisfied type of suicidal or apathetic thoughts aren\u2019t your own, they\u2019re just a neurochemical issue that\u2019s fixable.",

Look inward to find what you\u2019re needing that you don\u2019t have and figure out a way to ask for it or seek it out on your own. Get on the right meds I cannot stress this one enough because antidepressants and anti anxiety meds saved my fucking life no joke. Again, look inward and find the things you love about yourself and write them down. I highly recommend journaling just to organize your thoughts. If you\u2019re religious go to church or get involved with some kind of group, idk what your family situation is but spending time with my family is something that has made me a happier person. I understand these are incredibly dark times for you but please listen when I tell you that tomorrow could be different, it could be better and if you find yourself smiling, laughing, just being happy in general recognize that and hold on to that moment and be grateful for whatever you\u2019re personally grateful for. You deserve to be happy just as much as anyone else but some of us (myself included) really have to work harder to be happy it\u2019s not fair but it means you have to personally work on yourself and your mental health. Take a walk and get fresh air, appreciate the beauty of nature, GET A HOBBY seriously whatever you\u2019re passionate about dive into that! For me back then I didn\u2019t know what I was passionate about I wasn\u2019t passionate about anything I just liked watching tv and movies so film & television became a hobby like writing reviews and searching for the next best thing, I also got REALLY in to psychology because I wanted to understand my own mental health issues and how to fix them and how to help some of my family members who have pretty serious mental problems and it turned into me reading and researching and learning all about it and it ended up being my major in college and I\u2019m now working towards a career in psychology. Shit gets better, it just takes a little work. I really really hope this helps I wouldn\u2019t have typed a novel if I didn\u2019t think that sharing my own personal journey and things that helped me if i didn\u2019t think it would be helpful to you!
