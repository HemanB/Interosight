  "title": "My friend died of anorexia today... And on her birthday ",
  "selftext": "I feel so empty, she died of chest infection and previously complicated by pancreatitis all because of Anorexia and its complications\n\nI know she's at a better place and I hope she rests in peace, but everytime she gets hospitalized, I always used to have that feeling that she will be okay, except this time, I felt that I'm dreading that the next update will be her death and it was real, it happened 2 days later after her admission, to hear her death news\n\nI can't help but wonder why... I myself was an anorexia survivor for 3 years and a bulimic for 5 years... I can't say I'm completely recovered but at least I'm past the stage of having to face the dreadful and horrendous complications, so when I think about it... I just wish she was able to win that battle like many others do\n\nI hope every single person dealing with that strenuous battle of Anorexia, would be able to win it against their own thoughts and inner voice... Death is real and it's serious\nLife is too short and were too young to be wasting our energy and years on achieving sth that's only gonna cause our death not even success or triumph \n\nI'm wishing all the warriors and survivors of Anorexia and bulimia on this subreddit all the best and all the luck, and showers of bliss and love ... God chose you to face this battle for a reason, you're extraordinary, you're beyond perfect... Please, don't let Anorexia take ur life away, you deserve much better than that",

I remember my last hug with her, she was literally skin and bones, and she said, \u201cwow you\u2019ve gotten so tall and skinny\u201d I was probably 8 or 9 and I remember thinking \u201c *youre saying that to me!?* \u201c\nTowards the end of her life she looked completely different from how she used to. She used to have beautiful brown hair, always in a ponytail, beautiful freckles\u2026 before she passed, she looked like a ghost. Dull grey skin, hair thinning out so much you could see her scalp.. she was dead long before she died. It kills me, and it scares me since I struggle with an ED, I don\u2019t want my nephews and niece to go through the same pain of losing an aunt like I did. It\u2019s a hard battle in my head..\nI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this, it\u2019s so devastating, and also scary if you have an ED. \nMay she rest in well deserved peace",

      "body": "My friend died sometime yesterday, alone in her bed. She was found after she had not answered her phone for two days and the police were called. She had anorexia for 16 years. She was 28. She had gallstones, pancreatitis, kidney stones, horrific gastroparesis, she had lost a bunch of teeth, had more broken bones than I could count, she\u2019d shaved her head because her hair was so thin and had bald patches, she was a skeleton with skin, skin so thin you could see right threw it\u2026. She had been in and out of treatment many times, it just traumatized her. The last time she actually decided to go get help, she had to be flown to a specialist center in Colorado after being hospitalized and the hospital staff couldn\u2019t hardly stabilize her. She had to sign something to even get admitted there saying that she wouldn\u2019t leave. She was there 3 months, but then somehow was able to check herself out. She didn\u2019t look any better. I spoke to her just a few days before she died and she was still sharp as a tack. I don\u2019t understand, I knew she was too sick to live much longer, but she had been living like this for so long\u2026 I\u2019m not shocked but I think I\u2019m in shock. She had seemed to finally have some things going in lifer that gave her purpose (beyond this heinous disease), her animals were her life, she took fabulous care of them, I just wish she could have done the same for herself. I\u2019m so heartbroken because she was an amazing human and anorexia destroyed her \u2026 it is so maddening. She was herself to the very end but there was this other horrific thing she couldn\u2019t logically control. I have so many questions I never asked.",
