It\u2019s crazy!\n\nI think Dora Tomlinson is a good example of someone who did start out documenting their recovery and now almost never makes any sort of allusion towards her having an ED - it\u2019s no longer part of her identity and that is an indicator that she\u2019s actually recovered - she\u2019s to busy living her life to give it any brain space, let alone air time online",

The people who post all the time about how they used to have an ED and what they eat now are not recovered.  If you're recovered you move on.  You don't keep reliving your ED. The only real accounts are those that ended with the person saying they are not posting anymore because they don't identify with their ED self anymore.\n\nI could see though how having a recovery account might help some people stay accountable as they are recovering.",
