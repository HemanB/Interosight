I am not going to eat it.\u201d\n\nAnd then I wake up in the night to gorge from eating nothing all day while half asleep and what do I go right for? My husband\u2019s food. Then he gets up and I sadly tell him that I ate his thing. \n\nHe is never upset, he is just amazing and perfect. But I feel so bad and embarrassed at the lack of control I have over food I decide will taste good. Uhhh.",
