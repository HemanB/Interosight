But i get where you are right now, so all I\u2019m going to say is that most people want to change something about their body, few look in the mirror and like everything they see. But you can work towards recovery and towards being able to look in the mirror and accepting how you look instead of hating it... I\u2019m not fully recovered yet but I just had this \u201cmoment\u201d when I was in the locker room with my other girl classmates (naked) and I just sorta realized that I actually look good... so my only advise is that recovery is hard and feels like hell and you wanna quit constantly but it is worth it... \nLove\ud83d\udc95",
