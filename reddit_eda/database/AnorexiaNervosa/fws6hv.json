  "selftext": "Dear eating disorder,\n\nYou took away my childhood. You took away the happiness I was supposed to feel and molded it into numbers and depression. You took away the desire to be around people and made me stay indoors to do sit-ups and jumping jacks. You took away my confidence. I avoid shopping as much as I can and wear the same stained shirt for days because any other shirt makes me look big. You made me view everything as a competition. You lied to me. I did not turn beautiful. I turned into something I never wanted to become.",
