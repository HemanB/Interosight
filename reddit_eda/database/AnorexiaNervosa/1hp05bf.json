  "selftext": "Do some of you guys relate to this issue in particular? \n\nI go through periods of time where I'm able to eat takeout or fast foods for a while, but only if my order is EXACTLY what I imagined/expected.\n\nMy bf and I just ordered pizza and the restaurant has a habit of messing up my order. (They forgot to add sauce).\n\nNow the pizza is \"not worth the calories\". It's not good enough to break my fast for it.\n\nMy bf went back to the pizza place just to get the sauce, and I'm feeling guilty as hell. I'm making things unnecessarily complicated. It's like I'm a freak and now I don't deserve pizza in the first place. (I'm spiralling over damn sauce).\n\n I just can't bring myself to touch foods if they are not up to my made-up standard or differ in any way from what I'm used to.\n\nI never really noticed I'm doing this until now. Every relapse makes me more picky.\n\n----\n\n(This is just a small thing I noticed, yes I am diagnosed- no, I do not have autism, just adhd. Just mentioning it before people ask.)",
