      "body": "I apologize in advance for the wall of text. I have a lot of thoughts on this as shame is a large part of why I am where I am now.\n\nI agree with another commenter that shame is often counterproductive to making people with EDs desire recovery. I feel that only adds to the stigma that those with EDs have - I would go so far as to argue shame is actually one of the root motivators for ED behaviors in many people (>!\"I don't want to look like this, people will judge me\"!<, not feeling 'worthy,' etc.). It is for me. \n\nShame also prevents people from admitting they have a problem and seeking help for it. It's a cycle: *external shame (society, friends/family/etc.)* -> *internalized shame* -> *behaviors* -> *stigma about EDs/MH/disabilities* -> *shame about behaviors & struggling* -> *the cycle continues*. \n\nShame is not the healthiest motivator. I will say that if *any type of motivation* makes you want to begin to recover, then use that for a while. However, I strongly suggest working through this shame with a therapist or other trusted mental health professional.\n\nStruggling is OK, especially when some of these things are entirely out of your control. It is OK to need help and to take time off to get better. In fact, it goes to show that you have 1) the capacity to know when you need help and 2) that you are willing to put in the effort to change for the better. Seeking help and working to improve your life when you know something is wrong is always a good thing. \n\nI would suggest reframing it in a way that addresses what you are gaining by choosing to actively recover. Like, you are going to be able to go back to university - and maybe enjoy it at that time, at least more than before. You'll be able to spend time with people you love again. You will be able to participate in society with your head held up high. \n\nAlso just a side note: I am going through a similar situation regarding health concerns as a result of my ED and most likely having to take a semester off to seek help. One of my biggest concerns was also graduating 'on time' - but after speaking to my (academic) advisor, therapist, parents, and more: nobody cares! \n\nNobody cares that you had to take a bit longer to graduate. You may have a question or two asked by a close friend at most, but you literally don't owe anyone an answer! Just be honest and say it was for your physical health. Many, many people take 5 or 6 years to graduate, especially if their degree is a 5-year plan. It is *normal*. I get that part of it is the feeling of being 'behind' your friends but you aren't. It may sound like a cop-out but it really is true. \n\nPlease be kinder to yourself. It sounds like you have been going through a lot. I hope you're able to work on recovery and heal properly.",
