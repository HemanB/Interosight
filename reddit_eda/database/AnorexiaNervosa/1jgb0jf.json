When they delivered our food to the table, she looked at mine in disbelief, \u201cthat\u2019s a huge burger.\u201d Lunch progresses and she looks at my burger a couple more times and eventually says \u201cwhat even is that?\u201d (referring to the breading on my chicken). And one more time for good measure: \u201cI just can\u2019t believe how big that burger is.\u201d Am I stupid or is this situation insanely ironic? How do you recover from ana when living with someone who reinforces it? After I return from residence, I have less than a year left of university until I can move out\u2026how do I not relapse? The best part is, she doesn\u2019t handle criticism well, so \u201cexplaining how I\u2019m feeling\u201d will just make her annoyed. ",

      "body": "I\u2019d also suggest you to talk about this with your future therapist! So hopefully you can develop skills how to cope with your moms comments and behaviour. Also I can relate so much. I went shopping two weeks ago with my mom. We met at 2 pm. As always she told me that she hasn\u2019t eaten anything yet/the whole day. It instantly made me feel bad because I already had breakfast and lunch by that time. In the shopping center she wanted to get something to eat. She got a tiny pretzel. A few hours later we went to a caf\u00e9 near my place. She told me how full she still felt from the pretzel and ordered nothing but black coffee.\nI\u2019m not in recovery atm but still I\u2019m so glad I don\u2019t live with my mom anymore. Her disordered comments are triggering and sometimes even ridiculous. Why is she sharing all this with me? To be fair I never told her about my anorexia diagnosis because she is super delusional about my body and my mental health in general. When I was severely uw and my therapist already threatened me to put me into a hospital against my will, my mom was telling me \u201cyou are thin but not anorexic thin\u201d (I didn\u2019t even ask for her opinion, and yes my bmi was not only in the anorexic range but in the severely anorexic range but I guess my mom knows better \ud83d\ude43). Sorry I didn\u2019t want to make this about me. Just know that I feel you, I can imagine how harmful your mom\u2019s comments can be\u2026 I wish you all the best for your recovery journey \u2764\ufe0f",

Mom will take correction better from a pro. With a mediator you guys can come up with blanket ground rules re: discussing food & mealtime behavior.\n\nYou got two routes with that: you can get into the emotions of it, talk about how these comments make you feel, explain why it\u2019s hard for you and important that she stops this behavior\u2026\n\nOR if you, knowing your mom, think she\u2019ll get too defensive and that route will do more harm than good, then request that the therapist addresses it impartially.\n\nEven something simple from them: \u201cat meal times, no food talk. No commenting on the size of a meal, type of food, moral judgments, etc\u201d. \n\nThey don\u2019t even have to center YOU (& therefore your mother) in the conversation, which could help her not get her back up. Like \u201cthis treatment center & ED professionals have found that any comments about food can be triggering. It is absolutely crucial that you do not make these remarks within the hearing of your child, particularly during meal times. It may not seem like a big deal to you, but to someone with this illness it can be an enormous setback. We ask all families of patients to commit to this prior to discharge.\u201d\n\nSounds silly, but some families even benefit from having a code word that stops a triggering conversation. Like a convo safe word - when said, conversation stops, topic changes AND no breakdown of why the conversation was triggering/hurt feelings/etc  can happen until later when the person who code worded is ready to talk about it. It can be something silly to take the tension out of it too - alakazam! Lily pad! Antelope! Or just \u201cred light!\u201d\n\nUnless you plan to engage in a family-based recovery, you are an adult and have doctors to monitor you. Mom needs to commit to no food comments in your presence, esp at mealtimes. Your treatment team can help make this clear to her.\n\nEdit: if you need anything OP or have any questions or can think of anything I could possibly help you with just PM me! I had an ED for 10 yrs then worked in a treatment center for a while (specifically ran all mealtimes!), been recovered now for a decade. Not an expert, just a peer with some experience. \ud83d\udc95.

I swear all my friends\u2019 moms don\u2019t have body-image/food complexes, which makes having a mother this way feel super isolating\u2014so thank you! That\u2019s so tough. At least you are out of living with her now, but damn if she can make that many comments in such a short visit, I can\u2019t imagine what that would have been like for you to live with (especially with her denial). Also, why do they always assume doctor status? I\u2019m *sure* their *one* encounter of an anorexic girl online/in film 7 years ago makes them qualified to diagnose it. My mom is very aware of my ED (she actually got me into therapy). But her comments are borderline pro-ana, recently they have been about how skinny I have gotten anytime my body is exposed. I got her to help with self tan on my back and she literally sighed when she looked at it & shook her head. Like, how does she not know this not only reinforces my behaviours but also intensifies the self-hatred/disgust so I am further away from recovering, welp. Looking forward to my 3 months off lol.

Also I can relate so much. I went shopping two weeks ago with my mom. We met at 2 pm. As always she told me that she hasn\u2019t eaten anything yet/the whole day. It instantly made me feel bad because I already had breakfast and lunch by that time. In the shopping center she wanted to get something to eat. She got a tiny pretzel. A few hours later we went to a caf\u00e9 near my place. She told me how full she still felt from the pretzel and ordered nothing but black coffee.\nI\u2019m not in recovery atm but still I\u2019m so glad I don\u2019t live with my mom anymore. Her disordered comments are triggering and sometimes even ridiculous. Why is she sharing all this with me? To be fair I never told her about my anorexia diagnosis because she is super delusional about my body and my mental health in general. When I was severely uw and my therapist already threatened me to put me into a hospital against my will, my mom was telling me \u201cyou are thin but not anorexic thin\u201d (I didn\u2019t even ask for her opinion, and yes my bmi was not only in the anorexic range but in the severely anorexic range but I guess my mom knows better \ud83d\ude43). Sorry I didn\u2019t want to make this about me. Just know that I feel you, I can imagine how harmful your mom\u2019s comments can be\u2026 I wish you all the best for your recovery journey \u2764\ufe0f",

Do family sessions. \n\nOnly you can decide to try and get yourself healthy, but you don't have to do it alone. Utilize therapists, peer support, and use the tools that you learn. \n\nAlso...don't give up if you don't get it 100% right off the bat. People struggle and back slide. We all have our moments. But be aware and pick yourself back up again. \n\nYou can't control other people, but you can control your own actions. Don't let her disordered eating become yours. \n\nYou're amazing.

Mom will take correction better from a pro. With a mediator you guys can come up with blanket ground rules re: discussing food & mealtime behavior.\n\nYou got two routes with that: you can get into the emotions of it, talk about how these comments make you feel, explain why it\u2019s hard for you and important that she stops this behavior\u2026\n\nOR if you, knowing your mom, think she\u2019ll get too defensive and that route will do more harm than good, then request that the therapist addresses it impartially.\n\nEven something simple from them: \u201cat meal times, no food talk. No commenting on the size of a meal, type of food, moral judgments, etc\u201d. \n\nThey don\u2019t even have to center YOU (& therefore your mother) in the conversation, which could help her not get her back up. Like \u201cthis treatment center & ED professionals have found that any comments about food can be triggering. It is absolutely crucial that you do not make these remarks within the hearing of your child, particularly during meal times. It may not seem like a big deal to you, but to someone with this illness it can be an enormous setback. We ask all families of patients to commit to this prior to discharge.\u201d\n\nSounds silly, but some families even benefit from having a code word that stops a triggering conversation. Like a convo safe word - when said, conversation stops, topic changes AND no breakdown of why the conversation was triggering/hurt feelings/etc  can happen until later when the person who code worded is ready to talk about it. It can be something silly to take the tension out of it too - alakazam! Lily pad! Antelope! Or just \u201cred light!\u201d\n\nUnless you plan to engage in a family-based recovery, you are an adult and have doctors to monitor you. Mom needs to commit to no food comments in your presence, esp at mealtimes. Your treatment team can help make this clear to her.\n\nEdit: if you need anything OP or have any questions or can think of anything I could possibly help you with just PM me! I had an ED for 10 yrs then worked in a treatment center for a while (specifically ran all mealtimes!), been recovered now for a decade. Not an expert, just a peer with some experience. \ud83d\udc95.
