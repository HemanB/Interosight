She was so small I could count every bone in her spine. I begged her to eat. Her body was so sick that her organs were starting to shut down. On top of that, she has epilepsy, and the more she starved herself, the more she starved her brain, making her seizures more frequent and violent.\n\nI spent a year telling her doctor that something was seriously wrong. I watched her steadily lose weight, I had pictures of the vomit she would hide, but every time, the doctor dismissed my concerns. They\u2019d ask her if she had an eating disorder, she\u2019d lie and say no, and that was the end of it. No follow-up, no real help.\n\nFinally, I took her to the dentist and called ahead to ask if they could tell if someone had an eating disorder. They assured me they could, and sure enough, they confirmed it. That finally got the ball rolling, and she started getting some of the help she needed. Her blood work was all over the place, she had to get labs every two weeks, and after a suicide attempt, she was hospitalized\u2014but never fully admitted.\n\nEvery hospital, every residential program\u2014public and private\u2014denied her. Some wouldn\u2019t take her because of her epilepsy, some because of the anorexia, and some because she had Medicaid. When the ER finally released her five days later, we went home and decided we had to change things. We got rid of the scales, stopped talking about food in numbers, and refused to send her to a so-called treatment center that I wouldn\u2019t trust with my dog, let alone my child.\n\nFast forward to now\u2014she\u2019s been diagnosed with binge eating disorder. Last year, she was severely malnourished at 80 pounds. Now, doctors say she\u2019s obese at 134 pounds.\n\nSo now, I\u2019m stuck. I don\u2019t want to look at the child I begged to eat and tell her to stop. I don\u2019t want to say, \"You\u2019re just bored,\" and risk her spiraling all over again.\n\nAs a mom, as someone on the outside looking in\u2014what do I do? Do I say something? Do I let it go? I just don\u2019t want her trapped in this cycle forever. Any advice would mean the world to me because, honestly, I feel like I keep trying and just keep failing.",

Read about the Minnesota Starvation Experiment to understand what happens to malnourished bodies when they start to recover from starvation. Many (most) people will become heavier than they were before starvation (which is perhaps your daughter\u2019s situation), but if she keeps eating regularly in whatever quantity her starved body asks for, and never ever restricts again, her body will settle into a natural rhythm and possibly release some of the extra weight.\u00a0\n\nPlease ignore doctors who are calling her \u201cobese\u201d (not all doctors understand eating disorder recovery!), and instead take her to a Registered Dietitian specializing in eating disorders. I can recommend some if you\u2019d like.",

          "body": "If anyone has any advice on how to break this vicious cycle, I\u2019m all ears.\n\nShort backstory: This time last year, my then 15/16-year-old daughter was diagnosed with anorexia purging type. She was so small I could count every bone in her spine. I begged her to eat. Her body was so sick that her organs were starting to shut down. On top of that, she has epilepsy, and the more she starved herself, the more she starved her brain, making her seizures more frequent and violent.\n\nI spent a year telling her doctor that something was seriously wrong. I watched her steadily lose weight, I had pictures of the vomit she would hide, but every time, the doctor dismissed my concerns. They\u2019d ask her if she had an eating disorder, she\u2019d lie and say no, and that was the end of it. No follow-up, no real help.\n\nFinally, I took her to the dentist and called ahead to ask if they could tell if someone had an eating disorder. They assured me they could, and sure enough, they confirmed it. That finally got the ball rolling, and she started getting some of the help she needed. Her blood work was all over the place, she had to get labs every two weeks, and after a suicide attempt, she was hospitalized\u2014but never fully admitted.\n\nEvery hospital, every residential program\u2014public and private\u2014denied her. Some wouldn\u2019t take her because of her epilepsy, some because of the anorexia, and some because she had Medicaid. When the ER finally released her five days later, we went home and decided we had to change things. We got rid of the scales, stopped talking about food in numbers, and refused to send her to a so-called treatment center that I wouldn\u2019t trust with my dog, let alone my child.\n\nFast forward to now\u2014she\u2019s been diagnosed with binge eating disorder. Last year, she was severely malnourished at 80 pounds. Now, doctors say she\u2019s obese at 134 pounds.\n\nSo now, I\u2019m stuck.

And it\u2019s almost like the more you focus on it the harder it gets at least in my experience. \n\nI was able to eventually let myself eat freely, but this was at a time when I was really depressed so I kind of just stopped caring about everything. It wasn\u2019t good because for a long time I was just eating a lot,  everything all the time. I couldn\u2019t even say I was binging because there weren\u2019t points of restriction followed by over eating, it was just over eating all the time. \nThis also sucked, but because I didn\u2019t have the energy to restrict or purge, I got out of the cycle and now it\u2019s been a long time since then maybe a year or two and I am finally able to start eating normally, listening to my hunger cues, and making better food choices. \nPlease DM me if you would like. This cycle was my life for years and there was a point that I thought it would be my life forever and now as I am writing this i\u2019m realizing that I haven\u2019t binged or purged or restricted in a long time so it\u2019s possible to get better.",
