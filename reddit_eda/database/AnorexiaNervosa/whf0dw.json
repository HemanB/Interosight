I have resorted back to old habits, but with Dialysis no matter what I do to curve my weight back to what it used to be, which was underweight, nothing works, so I been super obsessed with my body and weight; I feel gross and nasty and it's lower my self esteem tremendously, which I hate because I was always secure about myself therefore I was confident, but not I'm a shell of a person that I was. \n\n\nI'm so sorry that you are losing weight because of your circumstances, I hope you are able to get better fanatically, but I do admire that you take care of your baby and make sure she doesn't go hungry. \n\nThat was me before Dialysis, I didn't consciously restrict, and that's why I'm still in denial. My eating habits were eating portions that I would stop when I'm full or not at all because I take Adderall for my ADHD and drink lots of coffee. \n\nBefore, I would always say I was Natrually Thin because I was, but now idk. It's something I can't really talk to my psychiatrist because I don't want my ADHD medication being taken from because I truly need it for school and being able to do everyday things. \n\n\nI'm sorry that you are poor, and I hope things turn around for you and your family. \n\nI hope you're well under the circumstances \ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udd79\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4",

I took a different job where I'm not stressed all the time, I'm bringing my hobbies back around, and I'm starting to enjoy living again. Honestly I found my peace through Jesus Christ. No lie, he's really all I have. Other than him, I had to look at things like this: My sickness was in my head but crossed over to my body, and I suffered greatly from it (and still have a few leftover symptoms), but the only way to make things better is by taking action, whether that's just deciding to get fresh air or go for a walk; maybe read a few pages or a chapter from a book I like, playing a different game, or trying something brand new to you--not caught in my thoughts, but being present (as much as possible) in the moment.\u00a0\n\n\nGrounding techniques I learned online are helping, as well as watching therapy content from good folks on YT and such. I bought some self help books (Anger, How to Pray, and Traumatized) and they have been helping. I'm also looking into getting more books and just trying to learn to *actually* take it easy, and not just saying it. When I'm around close people now, I try to stay engaged more/longer and step out of my situation (it's a little brain/body break) and get connected; I'm not ignoring my situation but not giving it all my energy and attention all the time. I hope this helps a bit, and you can DM me if you want to chat more friend \ud83d\ude01 \ud83d\udc99",

Then she blows up about me eating her candy.  \n\nShe buys fancy cookies, I'll leave it go, she eats ONE... I finally start eating them, all gone in two days, then she notices it in the trash and yells, and I say you opened it a week ago.  She says, well you don't have to eat them so fast.  \n\nI wish we could leave a restaurant without a take out box. She ordered a side of pasta salad the other night with a half order of broiled fish. I don't like to look at her eating. I finish a brisket sandwich, I lean back and she is just tossing these noodles all around the bowl. There were like 22 of them in the bowl to start, at this point there have to be about 18 left... toss toss.  I'm like damn just eat one why are you playing with them.  Then she asks for the take out box.... for a pasta side salad that was like 1/2 cup and she takes it home for tomorrow's lunch.\n\nMy lady is off the fucking rails, I am having a very very hard time. We have been together 35 years, and our marriage is on the rocks, because she it \"too dry\" to have any fun anymore.  I find it hard to deal with a woman that now looks like a boy.\n\nWe have two grown adult kids, she points out how other woman have a nice but, or nice hair.  I'm like... oh fu$king thanks for pointing that woman's but out to me. Yeh, that's good to know you are comparing yourself to healthy people and wonder why you aren't health looking eating broiled half-orders of fish at a BBQ establishment. Italian restruarant she orders fish... complains.  I'm like no s%it, the fish here is bad, just like a fish house's lasagna is likely to be bad.\n\nI'm tired of this...  I've compassionately confronted her, I've told her to get counciling.\n\nNo luck,",
