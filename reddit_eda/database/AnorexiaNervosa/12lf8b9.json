  "selftext": "I\u2019m relapsing again and I don\u2019t understand why I get such a dopamine rush from restricting. I become aware of it when I think about how little I ate on a given day and it makes me feel good, but I don\u2019t get why my brain finds it so rewarding. If anyone has insight into what neurotransmitters are working I would like to hear it",
