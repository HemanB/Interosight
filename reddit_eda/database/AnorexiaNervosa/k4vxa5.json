  "selftext": "this is scary to admit, but sometimes i feel like i want my friend to starve herself too. she\u2019s quite a bit overweight and i judge her a lot for it. i DO NOT want her to have to live with the constant pain and struggle of this disorder that i do, and the thought of that makes me really sad cus she\u2019s a good person and doesn\u2019t deserve that. yet she\u2019s trying to lose weight but still eats a ton and eats junk food. whenever she talks about how she\u2019s not losing weight or how much she eats i have to fight the urge not to suggest how much i ate to lose weight, or appetite suppressing tips. i never have said anything, but i always feel like i really really want to. i hate having this disorder and i want to get better but i also am kinda proud of myself for how much weight i\u2019ve lost and just wish i could give that to her so she wouldn\u2019t be so insecure about her body. i just feel really guilty about this and hope other people out there can relate :/",
