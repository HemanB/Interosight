  "selftext": "Let me explain, for example let\u2019s say I was weighting weight A, and I feel comfortable weighting that, but trough any means I pass from weight A to weight B which is lower. Now, If I go back to weight A Im going to feel awful.. so I rather stay in weight B, but suddenly I pass to weight C, now that I\u2019m weighing weight C it scares me to go back to weight B, despite the fact that I was comfortable in those weights before.\n\nI feel like it\u2019s the overall fear of gaining but then again, if it goes on like this then it\u2019s going to reach a point when it\u2019s going to be weight Z and thats bad.",
