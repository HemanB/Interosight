  "selftext": "I am SO full of shit. I sent the single most pretentious hypocritical photo to all my friends today telling everyone that I\u2019m no longer at an underweight BMI, I eat 3 normal meals a day, and I\u2019m living my best life!!!!!! But the truth is that I hate every moment of this, I absolutely cannot stand the sight and thought of all the weight I worked so hard to lose coming back onto my body. I\u2019ve started throwing up after meals again even though I HATE doing it, just because my family is so happy to see me eating and if I stop they\u2019ll be worried. It\u2019s so awful and exhausting pretending to be in recovery for other people, but I also know that a full on visible relapse will make me a burden on everyone again and I can\u2019t have that either. *tears out hair*",

You are so so so strong and you\u2019re making so much progress. I was in your shoes and I was always so close to breakdowns everyday. I hated people congratulating me for getting better and I hated people being concerned for what I was doing. I told myself I was fine. But I wasn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t want to be healthy even though I knew I was killing myself. Everyone\u2019s eye opener is different but mine was realizing how I only have one shot at life and that one day I will have an experience that will make me think \u201cI\u2019m glad I stayed\u201d no matter how long it takes, that moment will come. Recovery was *so* hard for me, I wished to die. Once I was fully recovered, everything got so much easier and I felt like a new person. I\u2019d have bad days where I\u2019d be tempted to relapse but I kept thinking \u201cmy body deserves better. It\u2019s been fighting for so long, my brain can\u2019t control me.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s so hard and I\u2019m honestly tearing up writing this, but ik you\u2019ve got it. I\u2019ve been there. Recovery is harder than anything, but here\u2019s me, talking from the other end of timeline. The feeling of being recovered, even if only 80% of the way, is so refreshing and euphoric. Instead of *pushing* myself at working out and crying every night, I *pushed* myself to eat and get through it; because I am strong. *you* are strong. It\u2019s the same mental energy, just focusing on something else. Don\u2019t doubt yourself. You\u2019ve gotten so far. You can make it. There will be ups and down. Mama raised no quitter. Don\u2019t let your brain let you say that you\u2019re a quitter. I have my faith in you even in your darkest days. Ily:\u2019) <3",

I told my friends I checked myself into a phych ward and disipeared for 3 months and if I was seen i would say I was visiting or picking up more stuff to bring to the hospital. I don't want to be known as the anorexic girl anymore and if they think I'm recovered they might get off my case",

      "body": "Thank you so much for your kind words. Honestly they made me tear up too. I just find it so unbearable how recovery \u201con the surface\u201d can be so different to how I feel inside. Yes, I eat now, and I\u2019m back at a healthy BMI, but it all feels so fake and performative because I don\u2019t actually feel any better and all I want is to go back to starving in peace. You\u2019re definitely right that recovery has to be more than just eating. It needs to be feeling okay about eating too, and changing the direction of my focus. Thank you again for your sweet words and I am so proud of you too for getting where you are. \u2764\ufe0f",
