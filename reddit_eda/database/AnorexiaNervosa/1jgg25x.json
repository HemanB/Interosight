  "selftext": "EDIT: I\u2019m in no way shaming people with obesity for using glp1 meds. It\u2019s actuwllt\nIncredible that they have these meds to help\nFolks who have obesity.  My issue is with the people who don\u2019t have obesity but they are somehow getting these drugs and losing tons of weight and it\u2019s just enforcing Ed behaviors and lifestyle for them. Tons of woman in Hollywood, probably hundreds of thousands of  people who don\u2019t have much weight to lose at all, but they are becoming sick and ill both physically and mental from these drugs. Hence why I labeled it as Anorexia in an Injection. \n\noverweight or obese people are taking ozempic and other glp1s and they are saying all their food noise and food obsession has lifted and just gone away. Isn\u2019t that nice? Meanwhile, All of us idiots with anorexia are just raw dogging it because well, it\u2019s a fucking real mental illness. But now people are paying to inject themselves with drugs to help them basically form anorexic tendencies \n\n Having an Ed  is misery. But society now glamorizes it and everyone wants to low key be anorexic now. Cool. What I would do for my food noise and obsession to go away. How life would be so different. But of course we can\u2019t be on these drugs because we don\u2019t need to lose weight obviously\u2026 but wouldn\u2019t it be cool if they could make a drug for food noise to go away regardless of weight ",

Doctor would stop script before it got to that point in follow-up appointments. And if someone is buying GLP-1 off market to use/abuse, this may be shocking, they could very well have an ED or even AN. \n\nThere is no social hierarchy of who suffers the most or most noble when it comes to this shit.",

Obese folks also fall into this. Obesity comes with insulin resistance issues because higher lipids means higher androgen which helps reduce insulin sensitivity.\n\nAll that im saying thr general situation.

I wasn\u2019t overweight when I took it, I lied about my weight and went on an app. Which actually blows my mind to this day how easy it is to get. But did it cause my relapse? No. In fact, my metabolism was already messed up due to my ed, and even in recovery I could only eat up to a certain borderline healthy amount before gaining weight. So it did help me in that aspect. But the weight came off slower, over many months in fact the same weight I lost from restriction came off a lot faster, which is fewer months. It did help with my food noise, and alcohol consumption in the event of eating or drinking due to stress or boredom. And I got up to the highest Ozempic dosing too before stopping because I couldn\u2019t deal with the exhaustion it gave me. And I also take adhd medication. So you would think it be some super golden weight loss cure all but no it wasn\u2019t. I think if anything people are getting the results they want because they stop snacking throughout the day and eat when they are hungry.

I wasn\u2019t overweight when I took it, I lied about my weight and went on an app. Which actually blows my mind to this day how easy it is to get. But did it cause my relapse? No. In fact, my metabolism was already messed up due to my ed, and even in recovery I could only eat up to a certain borderline healthy amount before gaining weight. So it did help me in that aspect. But the weight came off slower, over many months in fact the same weight I lost from restriction came off a lot faster, which is fewer months. It did help with my food noise, and alcohol consumption in the event of eating or drinking due to stress or boredom. And I got up to the highest Ozempic dosing too before stopping because I couldn\u2019t deal with the exhaustion it gave me. And I also take adhd medication. So you would think it be some super golden weight loss cure all but no it wasn\u2019t. I think if anything people are getting the results they want because they stop snacking throughout the day and eat when they are hungry. Which is the case why people are known to not eat full portions of their meals on it because they stop when they are full. That\u2019s really all it does.",
