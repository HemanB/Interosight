It's been years and shit, I'm like 23...\n\nIt's normal, it feels natural, and although I talk about it a lot, in reality I genuinely barely think about anything ED related in a day, it's all so mundane that my mind barely registers it Al\n\nIts comfortable, I benefit to some degree from the routine, the rules, all that shit, it brings me some degree of comfort, which I likewise barely perceive \n\nI guess at this point, this is kinda just how I live?\n\nYes I'm making the lifestyle comparison, and no not any of that pro ana cringe, no I don't mean it like that... it's just, it feels so much like just a way of being, it's crazy how something so serious and deadly can become normal to someone\n\nHonestly if I'm gonna be honest, I even get some amount of joy from behaviours, hitting goals, I am actually not fat for the first time in 12 years, how can I not be happy? How the fuck am I ever supposed to get better when...\n\nIt all feels so normal? Like nothings wrong...\n\nI'm disabled, my muscles are non existent..  I need to at times ask strangers in the street to help me carry bags onto the tram\n\nYet I feel normal, like nothings wrong, like I'm meant to be this way\n\nWhat the hell...",

Two years ago I finally found a therapist (not a psychiatrist) who specialized in ED. I\u2019ve been seeing her two years & she has opened up so many doors for me with her referrals & stuff. Really advocating for me to get to a psych & get some meds for my other mental issues.\n\nStating goals was also helpful. Two years ago I was being cheated on etc & I told my therapist upfront that recovery wasn\u2019t on my radar yet, that I was drowning & really just needed her to listen. It took over a year but once I got some sense of safety, I felt ok to make some appointments because I knew I had her to run back to if the psychiatrist disregarded me.\n\nI\u2019m wishing you the best, recovery or not \u2764\ufe0f if you ever need people to listen, I\u2019m here & so is the rest of this group.
