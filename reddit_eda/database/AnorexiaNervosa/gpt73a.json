Like for example, yesterday my family had a brunch that I couldn\u2019t really get out of eating that was more calories than I would usually eat in an entire day. I felt so bad about it that I just went on to binge throughout the day. Anyone else?",

If that happens, I will punish myself by eating barely anything for a couple of days afterwards. I guess it has to do with insulin excretion, but also with psychology: Once I fuck up a little bit, I feel like everything is lost and I might as well fuck up big time.",
