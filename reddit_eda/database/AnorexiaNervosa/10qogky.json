But I can promise you it will be better for your body and health long term to eat more over time \u2764\ufe0f I don't know if it'll help but it's important to remember that if you're having trouble losing weight it's because the body is trying so hard to keep itself alive and it knows it's not supposed to be underweight. Only 5% of anorexic people are underweight and we treat it like it's the way we're supposed to look or how our body should automatically react. There's a good chance the weight you're trying to reach is impossible to get to or will kill you once you get there because your body can't go on. I promise no amount of food will hurt you more than this will",
