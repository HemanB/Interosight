  "title": "Going to inpatient",
  "selftext": "Wow. After struggling for almost a decade I'm finally getting help. I'm going to inpatient treatment in a few days and I'm fucking terrified but also fucking ready as I'll ever be. I gave up doing so much that I loved because of ana - I ended my competitive figure skating career, gave up pole vault and cross country because of health issues, skipped out on countless social events and trips because of the food, and even I dropped out of fucking college because I was too sick to even get to class (planning to return after treatment though). I want to have the power back to live my life how I want to but I've also been sick for so long that I don't even know what parts of me are actually *me* and what is ana. I think I'll be in treatment for a while; most places wouldn't even admit me because my BMI is too low and it'll take weeks just to get medically stable. I also have other pretty severe mental health issues and I'd be going to the psych ward right now if I didn't have an ED. I haven't even told my friends or roommates where I'm going, or that I'm even sick, or that I dropped out of school. They'll come back from spring break and I'll be gone with no explanation and we probably won't see each other for months. So yeah. It's been hard to admit to myself how sick I am and that I deserve to be happy and get help but fucking did it and I'm going to fucking recover and get my degree and figure skate again and live my life how I (and all of you reading this) deserve to fucking live it because (say it with me!) I AM WORTHY OF RECOVERY AND I DESERVE HAPPINESS. Wish me luck I guess :)\n\nUpdate: So I went to treatment. I spent 4 months in inpatient and it was quite the ride. But I made it. And I\u2019m almost 2 years in recovery! I\u2019m back in school acing my classes, got an undergrad research position, and am even thinking about grad school. I have so many amazing friends now and a great support system. I even got a cat last year, and she is absolutely the love of my life. None of these things were even options when I was sick. Going to treatment 100% changed my life. I\u2019m truly living a life I never thought was possible before. Don\u2019t get me wrong, recovery is a rollercoaster and I have my ups and downs to this day. I still hear ana whispering in my head wanting me to be sick again, and I think she will always be there- but she doesn\u2019t control me anymore. If you\u2019re considering going to treatment or getting help in any way, know it will be scary and one of the hardest things you\u2019ll ever do in your life. You\u2019ll step into the hospital and every cell in your body will be begging to leave. But please stay. Treatment truly turned my life around for the better and I am so so thankful to be in recovery.",

My big hope for you is that you meet a gifted therapist with warm immediacy who builds an alliance with you that you trust. Therapy really can work, but there has to be a good fit and good chemistry, along with both sides being willing to cone to the table and repair \"alliance ruptures\", little disagreements that take on painful symbolism or a comment that doesn't sit right or feel good. We become more well in community, in relationship, so the people who you entrust to companion you on your journey to health have to be right for you.",
