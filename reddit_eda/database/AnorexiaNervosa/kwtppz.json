I went to get my first COVID vaccine and the RN saw my arm and literally said, \u201cthis is the smallest arm I have ever given a vaccine to on a grown woman.\u201d\nI literally did not know how to respond. I kept of thinking of the stupid water weight I gained in a day. Body dysmorphia is real and I never realized it until today.",
