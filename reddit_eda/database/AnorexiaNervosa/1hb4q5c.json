      "body": "A long time ago - I don\u2019t remember how - there was an app I came across called AvoMD. It helps medical professionals screen and treat many different conditions. It follows only the clinical guidelines made by reputable bodies. \n\nSearch for \u201cEating Disorders (APA)\u201d and select for an assessment. You will act as a professional assessing yourself. Answer the questions, which will ask you about your symptoms and behaviours that you have presented in the past 3 months. After, it will generate a suggested diagnosis and provide an explanation.\n\nGiven the brief information you post, my guess is you fall under the Other Specified Feeding Eating Disorder (OSFED) umbrella, subcategory Atypical Anorexia Nervosa. This term is used for those who have impacts similar to those with pure AN but have not been underweight. \n\nRemember, however, using that app and my preceeding thought is not to be used as a self-diagnosis. I recommend using the app but only as a tool to aid in your medical advocacy. You can use the results to discuss with a doctor to help them understand your issue. You could hopefully then be referred to an ED specialized provider who will provide a proper assessment. \n\nFor educational purposes, I\u2019ll share briefly about myself\u2026 I was once underweight due to AN, but now I am not. However, certain thoughts and behaviours remain. My label is now upgraded to AN Partial Remission. You can see how the ED diagnostic criteria is complex\u2026 Ironically it\u2019s set up this way to be inclusive to a variety of struggles and differentiate levels of psycho-physiological states.",

It follows only the clinical guidelines made by reputable bodies. \n\nSearch for \u201cEating Disorders (APA)\u201d and select for an assessment. You will act as a professional assessing yourself. Answer the questions, which will ask you about your symptoms and behaviours that you have presented in the past 3 months. After, it will generate a suggested diagnosis and provide an explanation.\n\nGiven the brief information you post, my guess is you fall under the Other Specified Feeding Eating Disorder (OSFED) umbrella, subcategory Atypical Anorexia Nervosa. This term is used for those who have impacts similar to those with pure AN but have not been underweight. \n\nRemember, however, using that app and my preceeding thought is not to be used as a self-diagnosis. I recommend using the app but only as a tool to aid in your medical advocacy. You can use the results to discuss with a doctor to help them understand your issue. You could hopefully then be referred to an ED specialized provider who will provide a proper assessment. \n\nFor educational purposes, I\u2019ll share briefly about myself\u2026 I was once underweight due to AN, but now I am not. However, certain thoughts and behaviours remain. My label is now upgraded to AN Partial Remission.

There are other ways to be diagnosed with AN.\n\n1. If we're going off the ICD-11, you may also get diagnosed with AN if you experience rapid weight loss. \"Rapid weight loss [...] may replace the low body weight guideline as long as other diagnostic requirements are met.\" (source: ICD-11). \n\n2. If we're going off the DSM-V, the equivalent would be a diagnosis of atypical anorexia nervosa, which says \"All of the criteria for anorexia nervosa are met, except that despite significant weight loss, the individual\u2019s weight is within or above the normal range.\" (source: DSM-V) Atypical anorexia nervosa is still very much anorexia nervosa. \n\n3. If we're going off the ICD-10, it's pretty similar to the DSM-V. There is the option to diagnose someone with atypical anorexia nervosa: \"Disorders that fulfil some of the features of anorexia nervosa but in which the overall clinical picture does not justify that diagnosis.\" (source: ICD-10)\n\n4. There is also the option of doctors diagnosing someone outside of the guidelines if they think the diagnosis is appropriate. For example, in Germany, some places will diagnose you with ASD instead of a \"subtype\", despite ASD not being recognized as a diagnosis in the currently used guideline (ICD-10). They recognize that the subtypes are outdated, as is diagnosing people with them. They will still use them to bill health insurances since they are forced to, but yeah. \n\nRegarding not knowing anything about AN, anorexia nervosa isn't a weight based disorder. People are sick at any weight, they suffer at any weight, it can be fatal at any weight. Thinking otherwise is outdated, and spreading that kind of attitude will get people hurt or even killed because they'll think they aren't sick enough\u2014something a lot of us are already struggling with. \n\nComing onto a post and essentially saying \"you don't belong here, you weigh too much\" is so incredibly misguided, demeaning, and harmful. Saying the diagnostic criteria don't allow for diagnosis of AN unless you're severely underweight is wrong. \n\nAnorexia nervosa is a mental disorder characterized by thoughts and behavior, not by weight. Diagnostic guidelines are oftentimes years, if not decades, behind on research (as evidenced by lots of stuff, for example ASD). Using them to justify keeping people who struggle and need help out is plain wrong, especially when you don't even seem to know the diagnostic criteria you're talking about, because, as I've hopefully made clear, you can, in fact, get diagnosed with AN at any weight.",

I recommend using the app but only as a tool to aid in your medical advocacy. You can use the results to discuss with a doctor to help them understand your issue.

My care team said my weight was the least important factor given that: \n\n1) I lost like 80lbs in 6months. \n2) I have a persistent fear of gaining weight. \n3) I restrict(ed) my intake to the point of fainting, having heart palpitations and low blood pressure & sugar. \n4) I have an excessive preoccupation with my body shape. \n5) I overexercise constantly.\n6) Obsessively count calories. \n\nMy team explained that the behaviors and how they affect me matter a lot more than the scale.\n\nSo yes, while low weight is one criterion for being diagnosed with AN, there are anorexics who are not underweight.",

And I felt like I was fat since I hit puberty at about the age of 10 I\u2019d say..

We all deserve care at any given time, but with the levels/intensity varying.

Speaking of, the DSM V is not the only manual to identify and diagnose mental health disorders. For example, we have the ICD, created by WHO and favored in Europe (as opposed to the DSM V in Canada and America). the ICD definitely mentions a low weight as a criteria for diagnosing anorexia, but they add this: \n\n\u201cRapid weight loss (e.g., more than 20% of total body weight within 6\u2009months) may replace the low body weight guideline as long as other diagnostic requirements are met.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m not UW and I\u2019ve been formally diagnosed with AN. My care team said my weight was the least important factor given that: \n\n1) I lost like 80lbs in 6months. \n2) I have a persistent fear of gaining weight. \n3) I restrict(ed) my intake to the point of fainting, having heart palpitations and low blood pressure & sugar. \n4) I have an excessive preoccupation with my body shape. \n5) I overexercise constantly.\n6) Obsessively count calories. \n\nMy team explained that the behaviors and how they affect me matter a lot more than the scale.\n\nSo yes, while low weight is one criterion for being diagnosed with AN, there are anorexics who are not underweight.",

      "body": "Well that\u2019s very nice of you and a smart thing to do. What better way to understand something than to go to the source. \n\nI think the efficacy of adolescent treatment is key to best outcomes and relapse prevention. I think EDs first happen in adolescence.. at least this is true for me. When I was inpatient one time, all the focus was on eating and nothing else. I was made to feel like I had done something wrong and to be ashamed of it. I wasn\u2019t made to understand why it was wrong except that I needed to follow a bunch of rules while in the hospital. So all I focused on was just being obedient to gtf out of there. But if the program had a more intimate experience than being cold, then I think I could\u2019ve been a lot better than I am today, where years later I have relapsed as an adult. \n\nWhat do I mean by that\u2026 Well we had groups stuff but it was mostly relaxation based: arts, meditation, goals for the week, reading, very elementary school-esque. I think what I needed more was for someone to act as a mentor, to sit with me, talk to me, and help me understand more about myself and the disorder. I still don\u2019t even know wtf I did the first time around as a kid. I just started restricting for almost no reason and wound up X pounds unintentionally lol. I needed someone to help me sort that out. More importantly, I needed someone to help me realize that there was more to life than following a bunch of self-imposed rules. But how do you know there is more to something if all you know is what you\u2019re used to? So to help me know what I wanted out of life, to know an ED would never let me get there, that\u2019s what I feel I could\u2019ve used most as an adolescent. \n\nThe problem was that much of the communication of my treatment went to my parents. I guess legally and logically the responsibility was on them to help me navigate these things. And the only thing that was communicated to me was about how much more food I would need to eat. But that was the flaw\u2026 bless my parents but they were knuckleheads lmao. My mom told me she barely could absorb everything the doctors threw at her at meetings and my dad may as well have just been in space for the whole thing. So now you have a breakdown because if the docs expect parents to do x and y but the parents don\u2019t understand what they\u2019re really doing and the intricacies of it all, then none of it gets relayed to the kid and certain things are left unaddressed. \n\nI wish I was more involved in my own treatment as an adolescent in that critical time. If I was treated like an adult in terms of direct doc to patient communication, being on par with my parents rather than my parents being middlemen for me, then I could\u2019ve been more empowered. And again if there was more of an individual-intimate-therapeutic emphasis, where we dig deep and talk deep things like future and life goals, I could\u2019ve easily left this thing in the dust. If we do our best to make kids realize just how much worthy they are and the untapped potential they have when unbothered by an ED, and not make them feel that recovery is just about shoving food in their mouth, they can go on to leave this thing behind and never think twice about it ever again. \n\nDid not plan to write all this, but as you said you want to know more about the unmet needs and what is most helpful - I hope you find this insightful.",

Someone who is UW is more at risk of certain issues than someone who is average BMI or overweight (who have their own separate high risk issues in comparison to someone who is UW).",

You don\u2019t have these problems that they do.* Then it feels like *Ok bet I\u2019ll get there*. \n\nBy no means is it the criteria fault. We just have to be better at interpreting and addressing it in the real world. For patients, we have to not read it as some sort of hierarchy.

      "body": "Thank you for telling your story, I really appreciate it! From the outside, it sounds like you and your family were given a treatment plan of family based treatment (FBT). I suggest looking that up and seeing if it resonates with you. I can understand why this treatment plan really didn't work for you, particularly if you really needed that individual support.\n\nFBT is often a really difficult treatment plan if everyone isn't on board (particularly the young person) as this is a treatment mostly done by the family at home, with some support offered by health professionals. The main tenants are weight restoration and restoring control of eating to the young person. However, this is mostly achieved by parents policing how much food the young person eats, when they eat, and trying to prevent the young person from engaging in behaviours that they were either engaging in before, or new behaviours that the young person has learned to engage with their eating disorder (e.g. purging, extreme food restriction, avoidance of eating in front of others). Parents should be taught how to do this, but obviously as your parents said, it is a lot of information, and stressful for everyone at home.\n\nThe health professionals involved should be able to assess if FBT isn't actually working for the family and the young person, and should work towards tailoring the program towards strategies that will actually help. This is where you should have definitely been included in the involved in the treatment process (probably even earlier, right at the start) and been receiving your own tailored support. Everything should have been explored with you and you should have given your consent to be involved in any therapies that you needed.\n\nJust to touch on your earlier comments about the hospital and relaxation-based therapies, again options should have been explored with you. Peer-support can be amazing for some people, and I'm disappointed that it wasn't offered to you when a mentor could have been critical as a support person. It's also important for a clinician to understand the story of the person and their ED to be able to provide the best treatments possible. Do they need to be the best evidence-based treatments (like FBT)? I don't think so if they don't actually help the person. I find it frustrating when it could be easier by just treating the patient like a person, and ask what they want and what they think might help them!\n\nI'm very sorry, it sounds like these health professionals and the system really let you down. Unfortunately, its not uncommon for people to feel this way, and it really is a shame that when people are at a point that they really support, and have access to it, they don't actually receive needed treatment.",

Not to disparage anyone here, but I think it is helpful to put people into subcategories so that they can get a tailored support plan to get the help they need as individuals. Someone who is UW is more at risk of certain issues than someone who is average BMI or overweight (who have their own separate high risk issues in comparison to someone who is UW).",

I bet many read OSFED-AAN as like *We\u2019re gonna give you this Other label because yeah you\u2019re kinda anorexic but not fully. You don\u2019t have these problems that they do.* Then it feels like *Ok bet I\u2019ll get there*. \n\nBy no means is it the criteria fault. We just have to be better at interpreting and addressing it in the real world. For patients, we have to not read it as some sort of hierarchy. And for professionals, they need to make sure patients don\u2019t feel unimportant, not to downplay it, and to give them appropriate-level treatment asap. We all deserve care at any given time, but with the levels/intensity varying. This just has to be better reflected in reality. \n\nI think the easier it is to navigate the system and access treatment, the less it\u2019ll matter about the classification.

          "body": "Well that\u2019s very nice of you and a smart thing to do. What better way to understand something than to go to the source. \n\nI think the efficacy of adolescent treatment is key to best outcomes and relapse prevention. I think EDs first happen in adolescence.. at least this is true for me. When I was inpatient one time, all the focus was on eating and nothing else. I was made to feel like I had done something wrong and to be ashamed of it. I wasn\u2019t made to understand why it was wrong except that I needed to follow a bunch of rules while in the hospital. So all I focused on was just being obedient to gtf out of there. But if the program had a more intimate experience than being cold, then I think I could\u2019ve been a lot better than I am today, where years later I have relapsed as an adult. \n\nWhat do I mean by that\u2026 Well we had groups stuff but it was mostly relaxation based: arts, meditation, goals for the week, reading, very elementary school-esque. I think what I needed more was for someone to act as a mentor, to sit with me, talk to me, and help me understand more about myself and the disorder. I still don\u2019t even know wtf I did the first time around as a kid. I just started restricting for almost no reason and wound up X pounds unintentionally lol. I needed someone to help me sort that out. More importantly, I needed someone to help me realize that there was more to life than following a bunch of self-imposed rules. But how do you know there is more to something if all you know is what you\u2019re used to? So to help me know what I wanted out of life, to know an ED would never let me get there, that\u2019s what I feel I could\u2019ve used most as an adolescent. \n\nThe problem was that much of the communication of my treatment went to my parents. I guess legally and logically the responsibility was on them to help me navigate these things. And the only thing that was communicated to me was about how much more food I would need to eat. But that was the flaw\u2026 bless my parents but they were knuckleheads lmao. My mom told me she barely could absorb everything the doctors threw at her at meetings and my dad may as well have just been in space for the whole thing. So now you have a breakdown because if the docs expect parents to do x and y but the parents don\u2019t understand what they\u2019re really doing and the intricacies of it all, then none of it gets relayed to the kid and certain things are left unaddressed. \n\nI wish I was more involved in my own treatment as an adolescent in that critical time. If I was treated like an adult in terms of direct doc to patient communication, being on par with my parents rather than my parents being middlemen for me, then I could\u2019ve been more empowered. And again if there was more of an individual-intimate-therapeutic emphasis, where we dig deep and talk deep things like future and life goals, I could\u2019ve easily left this thing in the dust. If we do our best to make kids realize just how much worthy they are and the untapped potential they have when unbothered by an ED, and not make them feel that recovery is just about shoving food in their mouth, they can go on to leave this thing behind and never think twice about it ever again. \n\nDid not plan to write all this, but as you said you want to know more about the unmet needs and what is most helpful - I hope you find this insightful.",

There\u2019s a lot you\u2019ll experience physically and mentally, and you may not be equipped to handle it by yourself. You\u2019ll have conflicting emotions, and your initial thoughts will grow loud. It\u2019ll be good to have professionals to bounce everything off of and to get reassurance that you\u2019re on the right track. Particularly, you\u2019ll want someone to bounce thoughts off of as it pertains to your fears, motivations, and ambitions, in of terms both being for and against having an ED. \n\nAnd I imagine your gf will be happy to be on this journey with you. You might want to consider what is more ambitious: having a life with an ED or having a life with your gf. If that\u2019s not a troll account - it appears your gf shared her thoughts under our comment thread. She\u2019s as distraught as you are, but as long as you don\u2019t give up she sounds willing to be by your side in all this. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a stronger motivator for anything than love. But that\u2019s not to say you should recover solely for the sake of someone else. You should try again mainly because you love yourself enough to believe that you deserve something better in life. Wanting to spend your life with someone else is usually a good catalyst for that.",
