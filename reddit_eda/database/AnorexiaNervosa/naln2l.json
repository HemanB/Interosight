  "selftext": "Lmao I keep lurking on hEaLthY aNd sLoW weight loss subreddits and blogs and they all give a warm welcome to those fasting gurus who say borderline pro ana shit about not needing food and \u00ab\u00a0your body already has enough fat to feed on\u00a0\u00bb... \n\nSome of them even post results of their week long water fasts (which even I, with all my self loathing and motivation, would never be able to complete) and actively encourage everyone to do it, but if you made a post saying you eat ||redacted|| cals a day and it works and you feel so amazing!!! they\u2019d bash you and probably ban you as well. \n\nThe hypocrisy really disgusts me, the people who shame pro ana teens are literally the same who will starve for a week and call it spiritual, purifying, enlightening and whatnot. And mind you, they\u2019re not actually religious/spiritual people, their goal is the same as ours and everyone knows it. Anyway chile",

Now, it genuinely probably works for some people to, I don't know, go to bed and then not have breakfast and just eat a bigger lunch or something! Good for them! \n\nWhat *isn't* healthy, and what dips its toes into the realm of disordered behavior, is conflating your periods with no food with some kind of holier-than-thou ascended righteousness. Yes, I saw a post the other day where someone was basically talking about feeling pure without food to slow them down. For some subs it's way worse (once saw a post talking about drinking your own piss or whatever  instead of eating, can't exactly remember the details but it stands out because it was fucked).\n\nHell, maybe a lot of people even start off with a healthy/ok mindset about how to care for themselves when going without sustinence for extended time periods, but then they see other people in the community fasting for longer, eating less when they *do* eat, and logging every little thing (I'm sure someone is off somewhere right now looking up how to log saliva or air idk whatever the new unsafe and \"naughty\" thing is)",
