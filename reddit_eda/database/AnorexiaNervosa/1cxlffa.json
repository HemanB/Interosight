  "selftext": "Cannot even explain how flatly suicidal it makes me. I really like her otherwise, but this is the thing that is making me want to drop therapy. She\u2019s supposed to be the best in this field for miles around and if I quit I won\u2019t get any other help. We are the same height, so I KNOW for a fact that she is underweight, to the point that I can make an educated guess on her weight. It is extremely unambiguous. Weight distribution, muscle mass, it\u2019s all moot here. She wears skin tight, body hugging dresses and there\u2019s no question about it. I\u2019m not underweight and I don\u2019t want to talk about my food stuff with her because I can\u2019t get past how she obviously restricts too but isn\u2019t allowed to confirm that. She isn\u2019t battling any other illness that would cause her to lose weight, cancer treatments, insulin resistance, etc. I hate the thought of her privately gloating over her tiny size while I\u2019ve been binging for months following a wave of reactive eating and extreme hunger. She\u2019s seeing me in real time put on dozens of pounds while she daintily perches her tiny body on a sofa across from me. \n\n\nI just feel like an idiot. I hate this. ",

      "body": "You are not an idiot, it is ok that these thoughts have come up, comparison and pre-occupation with body image/size, and the size/habits of others are natural points for us to focus on when we have an ed. So forgive yourself first for having these thoughts.\n\nI'd say you have 2 options; either share with her that you feel uncomfortable discussing food with her or find another therapist.  If she asks why? let her know that it is because you find it difficult to get past the fact that she is very petite herself. If you want a respectful way to frame this, go in with \"I\" statements, and explain why you are feeling uncomfortable.. make it about your thoughts/feelings about your recovery and the therapy process, that is not overstepping, that is what you are there for.--- and if she really is a good therapist, she should be able to talk through this with you in a positive manner for your recovery and will help you move forward with the process. You don't have to ask about her weight or habits, and she is not obligated to share them with you, but you can tell her you notice she is small for her frame and that brings up negative feelings about your own recovery and body changes.\n\nIts possible shes naturally that slim, its also possible she is not. I honestly wouldn't be wholly shocked if she has had her own issues with food, people in health care and therapists are not immune to having their own issues, and it may even be an asset for her- she has a unique insight into eds if she has suffered with one herself.\n\nIf you really don't see this as something you can reframe or work through with her, then find someone else. She might be the best or most perfect therapist for someone else, but maybe she isn't the right practitioner for you. That's not a terrible thing, but just be sure you line up some possibilities first, and test them out, don't let the ed win by allowing you to stop when you're getting through some of the most difficult parts of recovery.",

I was dealing with a restrictive eating disorder, and I started seeing a new therapist, who must have been upwards of 400 pounds. Not only was I honestly terrified that I would end up looking like her if I recovered from my ED, but I also didn\u2019t feel comfortable talking to a person of her stature about my restrictive eating disorder, especially since I was underweight. She ended up dropping me as a client after I ended up in the hospital for an attempt on my life, but I moved on and tried other therapists and eventually found one that I really connect with and feel comfortable confiding in and talking to.\n\nYour relationship with your therapist should be one in which you\u2019re comfortable talking, and you are able to get the help you need. Ultimately you are in therapy for your own benefit, and if you have a problem with your therapist or simply don\u2019t connect, there\u2019s plenty of therapists out there.

But if you didn\u2019t know that, you\u2019d assume I was just restricting. Point being, you assuming that she has an ED and is gloating etc. is entirely projection, and not based in fact. \n\nI think your two main options here are to find a new therapist or, if possible and if you think it would be better, continue to see this one by telehealth where you don\u2019t have to see her body.",

Being skinny doesn\u2019t mean someone under-eats just like how someone overweight doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t struggle with an eating disorder.  Anyway good advice. \ud83d\udc4d",

It is her responsibility as the professional to consider how her behavior might affect her clients. Choosing to wear very tight clothes when being visibly underweight is questionable at least.",
