I am not scared of the end result but I am of the individual weight gains and feeling in my body which I am forced to when I feel full and uncomfortable. Feeling empty helps me to detach from my body and this is why weight gain makes me feel suicidal. Though if I am honest with myself when I am using ED behaviours I still feel suicidal.",
