Everywhere you hear about anorexia, every time public figures or something talk about, it's always JUST about being thin. For me it's so much deeper than that.\n\n Like idk about you but I feel like, for me and my anorexia, the obsession with a having a death-like child-like frame is a symptom of my anorexia, Anorexia being a coping mechanism for a deeper issue. Childhood trauma to be specific. \n\nIm genuinely wondering if anyone relates to this.",

At that point, you may be on a hospital bed sobbing and shaking in fear and regret that you don't actually want to die, but at that point, the damage will be done. There is no more chance of recovery. It is just waiting for the inevitable. And it's not just mentally painful then, your entire body will be malfunctioning and likely in an extreme amount of pain. You may have to wear diapers and you will essentially be treated like a 2 year old. Your brain will have lost a lot of matter and you will no longer have the thinking or communicative ability you once had. Your loved ones will have to watch this in utter horror.\u00a0\nSo while I do understand, because I was there once, death from Anorexia can be extremely gruesome and drawn out.",

      "body": "It doesn't really matter how I feel. When I got skinny, I just felt nothing or extreme euphoria. It was harder when the weight gain caught up to me because of recovery efforts. That's when I was suicidal for a really long time. I was very physically sick, and I don't mean skinny. My body was just giving up. But before relapsing, I remember being very depressed over the seizures I was experiencing. I figured I could get help if I lost the weight or that it would somehow help me, but I was very wrong about that. Despite everything I've been through, I'll never not long for what I felt and what I didn't feel when I was skinny. It just felt right. \n\nI think it's bad that being sick like that is somehow better than being sick when you're fat. So I'm coming to understand that I think we're all just sick inside our bodies, and you can either feel less sick because you can't feel it or you can feel more of everything. So that's really what it comes down to, and if I have a choice, then I choose to feel better even if there's a greater potential for even worse health at a faster rate. I hope that makes sense. We're sick either way. Do you want to feel better about it? My lung capacity rises with less food and that means I'm able to run, which means I'm able to produce more endorphins. At the end of the day, it enhances your quality of life even if my lows are lower, even if I'm a bit more isolated (who wants to be surrounded by people who don't care to understand anyway?).",

I believe it to be another addiction as well, a coping mechanism for trauma. So many addicts talk about their traumas. I was abused by a medical doctor at age 9 which is when I feel my body dysmorphia began. That coupled with both parents being obsessed with their weight. It\u2019s all so overwhelming. I\u2019m sorry that you want to die. I have had phases where I felt that way to a degree. But I just want to say that it can turn around, and when it does, you can be grateful you never acted on it. I also relate to wanting the childlike body forever. It feels ethereal and makes me feel untouchable, and keeps me unattractive to the opposite sex. I\u2019ve always felt abused and sexually taken advantage of and can\u2019t stand to be seen as a sex object. Especially after the trauma at age 9. I\u2019m truly hoping you have a change of heart. I found a reason to take better care of myself after I got my dog. First dog I ever had and wish I got one sooner. There is no love even similar to that of a pet IMO.",

Every day I wake up with nothing to do but restrict and exercise. I don't leave the house because there's nowhere to go. And there's no signs of this ever changing; I've been pretty alone my entire life. When I was in grade school, I used to bring my family's landline phone with me when we went out in the hope that someone from my class would call me to hang out and no one ever did. I'm in my late 20s now and it's never been any different.",
