  "title": "My friend is getting euthanised tomorrow.",
  "selftext": "My friend (F26) and I (F28) have been friends for almost 15 years. We met on a proana site, but then began to support each other through recovery. I managed to come out the other side 'recovered' but she has been battling for over ten years now. She lives in Holland where Euthanasia is legal and I live in the UK. She has just rang me to say that she is going to be euthanised tomorrow and to say goodbye. I have so many mixed feelings, I want her to be able to have a choice and not to suffer anymore, but I don't know what else to do or say. I feel like I want to talk to her all night but she is very tired and saving the last moments for her dad, but now I am just lying awake thinking about everything and replaying all our conversations in my head about what I could have said or done. I'm doing everything I can not to say please don't leave, but I think she has been classed as 'terminal' (if that can even be guaranteed?) I don't even know what question I am asking here, I just want to know what other people have been through and if it's similar, how did you get through it and is there anything I should ask, say or do before she leaves?\n\n**Edit for responses:** I just want to say thank you to everyone who has left comments. It's been comforting to know I was able to get to say everything I wanted while hearing from others. I may not have replied to all comments but I have read all of them and am truly grateful for everyone taking time out of their day to offer words of support. <3",

I wonder if they add these cases into the statistics where it shows it\u2019s the deadliest mental illness. \n\nThe sadness, confusion, and anguish with this fucking disorder must be hitting you hard right now, and to respect her decision, and not beg her to stay I know couldn\u2019t have been easy. I know how hard it was to lose my grandparents after they lived mostly healthy lives, for 8-9 decades and trying to bargain with god or whatever is out there to give me just one more year, one more month, one more day. Or my two aunts passing away in their 40s even though they were terribly sick with cancer, then my uncle last year in his 60s still I imagined got to live more than your best friend. It all just doesn\u2019t seem fair.  Please don\u2019t inadvertently relapse from the sadness. If you catch yourself slipping take care she will want you to. \n\nI want to say to you something like \u201cmaybe she\u2019ll change her mind last minute\u201d or have a revelation that she can find a way out. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair to you though, or realistic if her Drs signed off on it. I think if a Dr had any inkling that someone may change their mind they wouldn\u2019t go through with it, and I imagine there\u2019s a lengthy therapy process beforehand to make sure they really understand what they\u2019re getting into. I can hope that for you, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something that realistically would happen. \n\nMaybe send her a text or email just one last \u201cI love you forever \u201c my best friend and I before this or depression even became prevalent in our lives made a pact on how we\u2019d let one another know we were lurking and haunting the other whoever goes first. It was a dark conversation, but at the same time we came up with out there shit nobody else would know besides the two of us so we both laughed and cried a lot that night. She\u2019ll be with you. Idk if god is real but I don\u2019t believe death is the end only because I\u2019ve had some run ins that couldn\u2019t be explained. \n\nI\u2019ll be keeping you both, and her dad in my thoughts. \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb you got a great community that is here for you.

Perhaps I can provide a little more explanation as I come from the Netherlands and follow the political discussions surrounding euthanasia.  In the Netherlands it is also possible to obtain euthanasia for psychologically unbearable suffering, without the prospect of improvement.  Just as with a physical condition that never gets better, this can also be requested in extreme cases with a psychological condition.  It only remains a discussion when it is 'unbearable suffering' and also when there is no longer any prospect of improvement.  The process to obtain euthanasia often takes at least 2 years and several doctors and psychiatrists must agree that the suffering is unbearable and hopeless before approval is given.  With only a diagnosis of AN, even after 10 years you will not receive euthanasia, then there is more to be done, so the situation is considered to be that recovery is no longer possible and life is unbearable.",

      "body": "I'm so sorry for both of you. What a devastating situation. Unfortunately, I don't have answers on what you should say or do because I don't think there are any. Euthanasia and suicide are still such a stigmatised topic that it's barely discussed, making it more socially divisive. \n\nAll I do know is she would have undergone so many assessments to make sure this decision can be considered in her best interest, so it's not an impulsive decision. Saying goodbye is heartbreaking, and it never feels right or enough. My personal opinion about assisted suicide is that a person with capacity should be allowed to decide when their suffering is too unbearable and gives them a way out that won't leave their loved ones in shock or wondering if it was their fault (comparing to suicide). Take comfort knowing you were with her on this lonely journey where she didn't have to go through anorexia alone for 15 years. It's incredibly painful when we lose animals by putting them down, but a time comes when their suffering becomes too much for us to force them to keep going through solely because we don't want to say goodbye. We can choose when ending our pets' pain is the only way we can stop them from suffering and allow them to rest in some comfort. My opinion is that humans should be able to choose a controlled, peaceful end where they have the chance to say goodbye to their loved ones. Nevertheless, it's still shocking and devastating for everyone involved. I'm so sorry for your loss. Try to take comfort that her suffering has stopped, and she has chosen to be at peace.",

OP I would go to a therapist and find one that deals with grief and the loss of someone to this process. I think there is nothing anyone could do to change her plight. It just is as it is.

Perhaps I can provide a little more explanation as I come from the Netherlands and follow the political discussions surrounding euthanasia.  In the Netherlands it is also possible to obtain euthanasia for psychologically unbearable suffering, without the prospect of improvement.  Just as with a physical condition that never gets better, this can also be requested in extreme cases with a psychological condition.  It only remains a discussion when it is 'unbearable suffering' and also when there is no longer any prospect of improvement.  The process to obtain euthanasia often takes at least 2 years and several doctors and psychiatrists must agree that the suffering is unbearable and hopeless before approval is given.  With only a diagnosis of AN, even after 10 years you will not receive euthanasia, then there is more to be done, so the situation is considered to be that recovery is no longer possible and life is unbearable.",

Perhaps I can provide a little more explanation as I come from the Netherlands and follow the political discussions surrounding euthanasia.  In the Netherlands it is also possible to obtain euthanasia for psychologically unbearable suffering, without the prospect of improvement.  Just as with a physical condition that never gets better, this can also be requested in extreme cases with a psychological condition.  It only remains a discussion when it is 'unbearable suffering' and also when there is no longer any prospect of improvement.  The process to obtain euthanasia often takes at least 2 years and several doctors and psychiatrists must agree that the suffering is unbearable and hopeless before approval is given.  With only a diagnosis of AN, even after 10 years you will not receive euthanasia, then there is more to be done, so the situation is considered to be that recovery is no longer possible and life is unbearable.",

I am lucky that almost or all of my damage is reversible or I am able to live with it. Before I went to one of my more recent treatment centers my mom told me something (horrible to say and broke me and didn\u2019t help at all). She said that she does view my anorexia as terminal, and that everytime I start recovery I will always relapse again. I knew the same thing about me was true though. And it was, until it wasn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know what changed in me, but between that treatment stay, traveling this past January, and starting another treatment this past February, I\u2019m almost fully recovered now. And I really don\u2019t see the signs in myself that I will ever go back to behaviors. I started treatment with a chronic AN/SEED approach in mind, thinking I would just learn to life with it until I die young, but I\u2019m pretty much past that and am almost fully recovered now. I wish I knew how to unlock this realization in everyone but I don\u2019t.
