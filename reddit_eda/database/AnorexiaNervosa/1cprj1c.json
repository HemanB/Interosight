  "selftext": "Hey everyone. I\u2019m an Artist and I\u2019m currently doing a series of drawing disorders.\nFor the next one I want to portray Anorexia.\nBut I want to do it in a way, that doesn\u2019t include lazy cliches like mirrors, scales, apples. And I also don\u2019t want to portray any specific body types because I do not want to add to the misconception that only underweight people have anorexia. Also extreme bodies specifically might be triggering to those who are affected. And the last thing I want to do is to hurt or worsen anyone\u2019s condition. The health of my followers (and people in general) comes first.\n\nSo here is my solution:\nI want to draw a Beautiful, glowing tree that gets chopped down by its dryade. \nAnd I want the dryade to be possessed by some sort of shadowy monster. (I\u2019ll add a picture of the rough sketch.) \n\nBut I want to hear your opinion. Is this a okay way of doing it? Am I missing important aspects? \n\nI would be more than thankful for your help.\n",

      "body": "This is such a hauntingly beautiful way to depict anorexia, and I think you did it really well without using any clich\u00e9s. Oftentimes, I think artists depict anorexia as a mix of wanting to lose weight and extreme body dysmorphia, but I think they don\u2019t understand the aspects of wanting to have control over something in your life, etc. \n\nI think the \u2018possession\u2019 part of your drawing perfectly illustrates how our bodies are, in a way, addicted to control, even if it harms us in the end.\n\nThank you for the art.",

      "body": "This is absolutely amazing! I wonder if the dryade could be growing out of the base of the tree to depict that this destruction ultimately comes from within? I love that it looks afraid and a little possessed, like it is afraid of itself and the harm it\u2019s causing itself\u2026 but doesn\u2019t know how to stop.",

      "body": "I like this take and creativity. \n\nCould the dryad be covered in a reflective material? Mirrors and reflections are so deeply ingrained in the disorder, both from a literal and metaphorical point. Literal because, obviously, but metaphorical because everything you see, do, hear or experience is somehow a reflection of your worth and ability, which turned inward becomes an extension of the war against yourself: 'If I were X then Y wouldn't happen' etc.",
