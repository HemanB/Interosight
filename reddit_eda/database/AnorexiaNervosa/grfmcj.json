  "selftext": "For example, I get wayyyyy too excited when I break a previous \u201crecord\u201d of mine for how long I\u2019ve gone without eating. Like I genuinely feel a sense of pride, which I logically know is really problematic, but it makes me feel good about myself and as a result I continue the cycle. To make matters worse, I do the same thing with water. It is not uncommon for me to go two full days without drinking any water at all. I even fantasize about being kidnapped and having all access to food/water cut off entirely, which I feel is probably a pretty good indicator of my overall mental state...\n\nI know deep down that I am really sick and need to seek help but at the same time I literally do not care...I\u2019m not sure how to get out of this mental block and start actually giving a fuck about my health.",
