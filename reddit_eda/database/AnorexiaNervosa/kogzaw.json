  "selftext": "At work the other day, I showed one of my co-workers a photo from me at a healthy weight, to show her a cute pair of shoes. She completely ignored the shoes and immediately started asking me how I lost weight. I try to be open about my illness at work, as it often directly affects my work performance. When I told her that I have anorexia; her first response was: \u201coh wow! I could never do that, I don\u2019t have enough will power. Wish I could lose weight like that.\u201d  I feel super uncomfortable. All my other co-workers have been incredibly kind and understanding, one of them even going so far as to stock the break room fridge with one of my safe foods. I\u2019m really scared that the next time we work together, I\u2019ll have a panic attack or get really triggered. Should I talk to someone about it? Should I talk to my boss, or the co-worker who praised my sick body? Do I just let it go? This has been weighing on me.",

I\u2019m sorry your coworker said that :( I think it\u2019s really cool that you\u2019re open about it. It shouldn\u2019t be your job to educate her, but if you\u2019re up to it, I wonder if you could say something about it to her and maybe she would understand.",

Honestly, all employers should do this, since almost everyone has some sort of issue that deeply affects them like this. \n\nI've been in your shoes, but instead of praising it (1 or 2 people did this), most of them bullied me for it. I know how rough it is, and I, as well as the people of this subreddit, are here for you. I really hope you can work something out between you and your boss and/or coworkers to make it a safer place for everyone.",
