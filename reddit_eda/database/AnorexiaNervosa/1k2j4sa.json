  "selftext": "Just wanted to ask the question. How many of you were obese before your eating disorder and are now at a healthy weight/ underweight? \nA few people I\u2019ve had conversations with here say that they started off obese. \n\nMy BMI was VERY high. I\u2019m talking like super morbid obese high. \n\nI\u2019m now normal weight but like Jesus, I\u2019ve lost so much, and my weight loss is just constantly praised because I was obese before. Doctors won\u2019t take me seriously because now my weight is just normal but like I\u2019ve lost almost half my entire starting body weight in 6 months and I\u2019m fainting from showering.\n\nAnyone else facing the same thing?",

      "body": "When I was young I was very thin and could not put on weight and was very insecure. I had a child at 18 and my metabolism was never the same. I have been overweight for most of my adult life. Had bouts of ED but never lasted. I have had some serious life issues within the last year and a half which caused me to gain at first, but then I slowly started to restrict. I kicked it into high gear in December and have lost a dramatic amount of weight. My face looks like it\u2019s melting from extra skin. My scrubs at work are so big. I have had several coworkers mention my weight loss or ask me out of concern. My clients will mostly say I look great. I have one that\u2019s brutally honest with me and told me my scrubs looked \u201catrocious\u201d and was offering to buy me new ones. I went home that night and got cheap ones off amazon a size smaller. Well those are too big too. I have earned the nickname \u201cskinny minnie\u201d by a couple coworkers, which is not a nickname I am used to by any means. Part of me is proud and feels good. The other part is annoyed and self conscious when people bring it up. Nobody ever would say to me \u201cyou\u2019ve gained a ton of weight since your wedding\u201d even though that was the truth. I feel as though if you were formally obese it\u2019s more noticeable and acceptable. \u201cYou\u2019re getting healthier! You look fantastic! I wish I could do that.\u201d Mixed with concern that I have some sort of illness or are chalking it up to the stress in my life. My doctor congratulated me at my last appointment. I have been seeing him my whole life. I felt like I betrayed him. \n\nAs far as the fainting, I would be concerned. Do you live alone? You might want to discuss at least the fainting with your dr. You don\u2019t have to fully disclose but they should know. I have a husband that I know would find me if that happened. I have not had that feeling or really anything but the occasional headache so I have no incentive to stop.",

But I was happy then. I didn\u2019t think I was ugly, I didn't really care what others thought about me, I wasn't obsessed at all in how I looked or how I was perceived by others. While now at the lower end of a healthy weight and diagnosed with anorexia, I am so obsessed with how I look. Not just my weight and my body, but what I wear, if it's trendy, how my hair looks, everything. Also, now I do think that I am really fat, while I know logically it's not true it still feels like it. While when I was actually big, I never really felt like it. Sometimes, I miss the old me because she loved herself no matter what she looked like. I think my brain hasn't really adjusted to my body being this different. Because now I see myself how I used to look like and not how I look like now. I also think having been obese makes recovery somehow different than if you haven't been big. Like we all know, being fat is a huge fear of someone with anorexia. But I think it's different if you actually have been big, if it was a reality. But that's just a thought of mine. \nI really wish that all of us can recover and become happy and confident no matter what we look like.",

Kept buying a size smaller only to need ANOTHER size down within the next week or two. It\u2019s so freaking expensive.\n\nAnd in regards to the health side of stuff.. I was feeling just fine too originally, but in the last 2 or 3 weeks I\u2019ve started to feel like my body is literally shutting down. I\u2019m tired, I have brain fog, I\u2019m constantly freezing, on my days off work, all I want to do is lay down and rest. I can barely manage stairs anymore, I have headaches daily. Thank god I live with my partner too.\nThe thing that\u2019s troubling me most though is my kidneys. Or atleast that\u2019s what I think it is. \nI went to my doctor yesterday who took a urine sample, there was blood & glucose in it so she said it was likely a kidney infection and prescribed antibiotics. \n\nI\u2019m not convinced that is the problem though as you typically have a fever and stuff with a kidney infection.",

I have been overweight for most of my adult life. Had bouts of ED but never lasted. I have had some serious life issues within the last year and a half which caused me to gain at first, but then I slowly started to restrict. I kicked it into high gear in December and have lost a dramatic amount of weight. My face looks like it\u2019s melting from extra skin. My scrubs at work are so big. I have had several coworkers mention my weight loss or ask me out of concern. My clients will mostly say I look great. I have one that\u2019s brutally honest with me and told me my scrubs looked \u201catrocious\u201d and was offering to buy me new ones. I went home that night and got cheap ones off amazon a size smaller. Well those are too big too. I have earned the nickname \u201cskinny minnie\u201d by a couple coworkers, which is not a nickname I am used to by any means. Part of me is proud and feels good. The other part is annoyed and self conscious when people bring it up. Nobody ever would say to me \u201cyou\u2019ve gained a ton of weight since your wedding\u201d even though that was the truth. I feel as though if you were formally obese it\u2019s more noticeable and acceptable. \u201cYou\u2019re getting healthier! You look fantastic! I wish I could do that.\u201d Mixed with concern that I have some sort of illness or are chalking it up to the stress in my life. My doctor congratulated me at my last appointment. I have been seeing him my whole life. I felt like I betrayed him. \n\nAs far as the fainting, I would be concerned. Do you live alone? You might want to discuss at least the fainting with your dr. You don\u2019t have to fully disclose but they should know. I have a husband that I know would find me if that happened.
