  "selftext": "For context my family went on a trip a while ago and we did a lot of swimming in the lake. My 3 siblings and I wanted to climb on each others shoulders and try to knock each other into the water, just typical fun stuff. I then discovered now all of my siblings, who are younger than me, could lift me up. Even the youngest who is tiny could lift me. My siblings were surprised too, and we all started comparing weights. I found out that I was smaller in weight to my brother and my sister. My brother is taller than me, so that wasn't too much of a surprise that he weighed more, but my sister is around my height. I felt delighted immediately, then I felt sick to my stomach. What is wrong with me? Feeling happy that I weigh less than my siblings? That's disgusting. But yet I can't help but feel strangely happy and overjoyed to be the sk\\*nniest out of my siblings. It feels so wrong and twisted and I hate it.",

You obviously love them too much to hurt them, and you recognize that it\u2019s not a healthy thought. And yes, I\u2019ve been there, and feel like a disgusting human being; I\u2019ve been happy that I weigh less than my daughter! How sick is that. I\u2019ve never admitted it before, and I feel humiliated and ashamed. Well, now that I have the topic of conversation for my next therapy session...",
