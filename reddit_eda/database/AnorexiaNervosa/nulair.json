  "selftext": "Genuine question, I don\u2019t understand. Normally, I have opinions, points of views, ways of thinkings etc that I have arguments to support and that I\u2019m usually open to debate. I have a brain.\n\nWhy does my ED go straight AGAINST those opinions, without any logical or rational arguments? I\u2019m not talking about the behavior of fearing food etc, but the motivations and opinions tied to it. \n\nFor example, why can I write two whole paragraphs about \u00ab\u00a0women shouldn\u2019t weigh more than xx kilos\u00a0\u00bb, and think every word of it, even though I don\u2019t actually believe it in the slightest? Like, I actually have arguments that my ED sees as valid, but that I would see as sexist and senseless, but I still agree with them, but I don\u2019t... What\u2019s the deal here?",

So, when I hear the ED voices, I process it almost as a comment from someone else in the room.\n\nBefore I did this, it felt like the ED thoughts were my own, and that I was more or less fighting myself every time. Seeing the illness as something separate from me helped me understand how to respond to it. It takes time, but I found this technique very useful.\n\nEDs are terrible, but realizing how irrational they are is part of the healing process.",

Despite the fact that  tuesdays recipe is lemon basil, and the shrimp recipe I want to try is spicy, it just uses a bit of lemon to enhance the shrimp, so they\u2019re not really similar? And I\u2019m not allowed to make rice Wednesday either because I\u2019m having rice on Thursday - despite the fact that I often meal prep, and therefor *often* eat a meal with rice three or four days in a row, but I can\u2019t make it fresh two nights running? For reasons. And God Forbid I don\u2019t weigh out my bowl of strawberries to the gram - but if I eat a handful of grapes from the display while grocery shopping it\u2019s fine, don\u2019t need to count them. Oh, and I can\u2019t waste x calories on a tablespoon of low cal soy sauce, BUT I can drink a x calorie Gatorade Zero and don\u2019t even need to log it!!
