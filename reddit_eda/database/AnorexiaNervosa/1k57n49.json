  "title": "What I learned from not recovering early",
  "selftext": "It makes me sad to see some people with anorexia say they need to lose more weight or become sicker, so that it feels worth it to get better. Or so more people will show concern for them. As someone who has had anorexia for 19 years and has never fully recovered from it, here is what I learned from putting off help, from avoiding treatment and essentially staying sick for so long\n\nWhen the anorexic voice is shouting at you that you need to lose more weight so you feel valid, that thought pattern is an indication of just how sick you already are. Healthy people don't wish they were sicker. So if you ever think to yourself \"I feel like I need to lose just a little more weight and then people will take me seriously,\" that is when you have a problem. And your problem is serious\n\nThe thing is, you could become emaciated and be admitted to a hospital. You won't feel like recovering, even then. The malnourishment will affect your thinking. You may not actually feel ill. But doctors are telling you otherwise. You may still believe that you need to become even worse. You are chasing after a feeling of validation. But even at your sickest, you will never feel it.\n\nI felt the same way, at the time of my inpatient treatments for anorexia. I was severely ill. But certainly didn't see it. When my treatment team told me they thought I was at risk of dying and they would not allow me to leave the hospital, I did not believe them and refused to listen.\n\nEach time I asked to leave the inpatient centers I was at, I was told no. They told me they were worried I would die if I left the hospital. Sounds like that would make a person snap out of what they are doing, doesn't it? But not with anorexia. That's why this disorder is so scary. Each day, different plates of food were placed in front of me. While nurses sat beside me so I couldn't get rid of the food. I struggled to get through each meal. But I knew if I did not eat the food, I would get a feeding tube. So day after day, I had to sit through breakfast, lunch, dinner and several snacks, consuming every morsel. While my eating disorder brain shouted at me to get home and lose the weight\n\nThey didn't want me to burn off the calories I was eating. So they wanted us all to sit down and not stand as much, after we finished eating. If you had to go off and get blood tests down stairs or talk to one of your therapists, some people were so sick, they moved them around in a wheelchair. I was the only anorexic person who wouldn't get in the wheelchair to go downstairs. I didn't feel like I needed it. My body temperature was so low when I first got there, they put a warming blanket on me to get my temperature up. I did not feel like I needed a warming blanket. But I had to sit there with it on. They told me my weight was so low, that it was affecting the function of my organs. My response was \"I would just like to go home and lose weight again.\"  When you are ill, you aren't always going to feel like you are ill. And starvation affects your thinking. So I was really not interested in being helped. But I knew the only way out the hospital was to eat the food and do what they said. I did not go to residential or outpatient afterwards because I wanted out of that controlled type of environment. And residential sounded scary to me at the time. I didn't even consider it. I just instantly refused.\n\nSo there was never a point during my inpatient hospitalizations where I thought \"I am really sick and these people are absolutely right. There is a reason they are working on refeeding me and why they want me to go to more treatment after I leave here.\" Those thoughts didn't cross my mind. I was younger and had only been anorexic for two years at that point. Because of my age at the time, my brain likely wasn't fully developed. Malnourishment was affecting my thinking. And while I gained some weight during treatment, I never fully restored my weight. I was at a healthy weight for my age and height before my eating disorder, but I have never returned to that weight. So this caused further problems. After leaving inpatient, I lost every pound I gained. During my second hospitalization, I became even sicker. I weighed even less during the second inpatient admission than the first one. This was the hospital specifically designed for those with anorexia, where I was really scared. This was the hospital where they wanted to give me a feeding tube, because I was refusing food. And you know what? I didn't feel sick enough, validated or like people were trying to look after me and help me. When I heard the words \"You aren't eating so you are getting a feeding tube,\" I got so scared and, after that, I agreed to start eating. They are basically trying to keep you from dying. There were people of all ages in the hospital. Some were recovering and some were really sick. Even when you are really sick, you are never going to feel valid. I did not view treatment as people trying to save me at the time. I viewed treatment as people trying to take away my control. I was angry at my parents for driving me to both inpatient centers and leaving me there. I wanted to go back home with them whenever they came to visit. I felt like my choices were taken from me. All the weight I gained was lost. I didn't learn anything from being in the hospital. I only had negative feelings towards the places I went to and never wanted to go back\n\nFast forward to now. It is years after my inpatient hospitalizations. I am still very sick and have severe and enduring anorexia. For years, I remained malnourished and at a low weight. I tried a few therapists and attempts at outpatient treatment. Nothing that stuck with me and got me to change my thinking. No further inpatient treatments. For a long time, my body kept going. The first medical complication I ended up with was osteoporosis. I was younger during my inpatient stays, so because I was renourished right away, my body was more resilient and healed from the damage. I put more strain and stress on my body by continuing to starve it. Now my anorexia is affecting my organs. Some of my medical complications are possibly permanent. I did not know starvation could damage the bladder and cause things like frequent urination. But it can happen, even when you do not think it can happen to you. By not treating my disorder, and never coming to terms with how ill I truly was at the time of my inpatient stays, my disorder just grew more severe. The ed thoughts louder, the behaviors more engrained. I am on palliative care for my anorexia. My parents are still helping me but I know that it makes them sad I have not managed to fully recover from my disorder. I am trying to remain positive. I am glad I am still here. I want to work on getting better, even if it is going to be difficult\n\nThere was a girl in inpatient who became a very good friend of mine. She was a few years older than me. She was severely ill, like me. We enjoyed each other's company during our hospital stays. She had been through repeated inpatient stays. She was so ill, but could not see it. She was emaciated, but asked me if she looked fat during my last week there. Hearing her say that made me sad. But it's really what she thought, no matter how many people in treatment tried to tell her, otherwise. Anorexic people often have a distorted view of themselves. You can be really thin, and think you need to be thinner. You could be thin and actually see yourself as overweight. She stayed in touch with me for a few years after I got out of the hospital. She never fully recovered. I am sure that she never reached a point where she truly felt sick enough. She starved herself for so long, that her body simply couldn't handle it anymore. She passed away five years after I met her. During those five years, I stayed in touch with her by calling her on the phone and sending her letters. Her death really affected me. But I did not reach out for help for my anorexia after she died. I got worse\n\nSo if there is anything to take away from this post, it is this. Your eating disorder has one single purpose. And that is to make you unhappy. Your reasons for developing this illness will be different from another person's. Every person deserves to feel like they are not alone. And like things can get better for them. I do not think recovery is impossible for me, but it is more difficult because I have been sick for so long. I have to work really hard to change certain behaviors. Some days, this feels impossible. No matter how low your weight goes, whether you have had a feeding tube or have never had a feeding tube, no matter how many medical complications you end up getting, and no matter how many inpatient stays you have gone through, you will never feel valid. You will never feel sick enough. Your illness will convince you that you aren't that bad and things could be worse. Becoming sicker just makes you sicker. I wish I had not put off getting help. I wish I had not waited until I developed medical complications to get help. Now I am in physical pain and older, with an eating disorder. Now, I have to fight even harder than before. Because now, my body isn't as healthy as it once was. You don't think an eating disorder will become chronic, certainly not when you are younger and it just started. If you end up becoming chronic, it is not your fault and you deserve to feel supported. There is hope for everyone to improve. Although this disorder does have a high death rate. People did everything possible to help my friend that died but she was just too ill. I still think about her often. So if you are struggling and not feeling valid, I want to remind you that you are valid. Whether you have suffered for a year or 20 years. And you deserve better",
