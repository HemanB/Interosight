That was hard to deal with mentally, but I just let my body have what it wanted. I train aerial circus consistently so I tried to keep up as much as I could. It was pretty rough for a while. I tried not to overdue it because my body is going through a big change. This past week I\u2019m finally starting to feel strong again and starting to care less and less about what and when I\u2019m eating. The crazy hunger is gone now. I feel like my body is starting to do what it was meant to do. I was so scared I was going to gain a million pounds the first few weeks, but that seemed to be an irrational fear. (I\u2019d seen a few recovery posts that scared me to be completely honest) I\u2019ve barely gained weight, but my body is so different now and I\u2019m starting to actually and actively love with it for the first time.",
