Told nobody this not even myself... When I found out that being underweight could interfere with puberty those habits were set in stone for me. Not that it helped even in that regard, ofc...\n\nControl. Body image. Obsessed with maintaining a look that separated me from other people without having to reveal what I actually liked. Something that could look accidental or unintentional. A desire to hurt and punish myself, whom I hated. Numbing the pain. Increasing the pain. Chasing a societal feminine ideal in the only ways I could.\n\nWhile I had it I never considered myself to have it and never sought medical attention. Now that I have it under better control I wouldn't qualify for it. Feel like a faker, and back to punishing myself with a starve day I go.\nI still associate abstaining from eating with moral and financial positivity.",

A bunch of reasons (this is gonna be super SUPER long, IM SO SORRY)\n\nI was a very naturally skinny kid when I was about 6-8 everything was great, I ate a TON of shit I didn\u2019t need, everything was fine, I did a lot of exercise too and I loved it. And btw my family has always been a very looks judging family. Till I went into elementary school and found myself victim of like kids bullying me just because I was different and I did different things that them (I\u2019m autistic, it\u2019s not that noticeable now but as a kid apparently it was), then when I turned 9 I decided I was too lazy to do sports and I actually wanted to do more interesting stuff for me like drawing or whatever, and so I did.  I naturally gained  weight since I still ate like shit (like almost every kid does), but I couldn\u2019t care I didn\u2019t even notice. However when I was about ten i remember going to my grandmothers house (who Is sadly a terrible person for no reason) and I remember her telling me how I had gotten sm fatter and how I looked like a bad and unfemenine, how I needed to be more like my cousin, who was a tall skinny girl, and I did wanna be her so bad. Anyways. When I turned about 11 we got sent to quarantine, I felt very anxious all the time, I was young however I did understand that the pandemic was smth huge and I was scared of it being like that forever. I used to eat A LOT. During online classes, at night, morning, noon, anytime of the day I was eating. I got very much so fatter, but this time I actually did feel disgusted with how I looked. Then in 2020-2021 I made a small friend school group. Then that same 2021, the first year of middle school, a few weeks after starting school I got \u201couted\u201d because our group chat leaked. All my friends dumped me, all of them, I was completely alone. I remember me trying to understand why and me trying to stay being friends, them telling me I was a freak and how my personality was un likable. \n\nThen I got into depressive episode, I was completely devastated, so I stopped eating, not even noticing it, just because of stress my appetite was gone. Then about a month after i remember ppl telling me how good I looked and asking me what o was doing, I was so confused until I realized I was no longer \u201cfat\u201d. That for some reason made me realize that ppl \u201cliked\u201d me if I was skinny, but also made me like myself when I wasn\u2019t eating. Then, that exact week I decided to do it on purpose I wanted to see myself being \u201cperfect\u201d, I started skipping lunch and stuff, but it never was like actual fasting.\n\nOver time it turned more obsessive and more and more and I actually started fasting and purging when accidentally eating what I considered was \u201ctoo much\u201d. Then my life got a lil better, I made more friends, this was in 8th grade. I was better I even got a gf and all and I was hyped that someone could love me.\n\nEverything turned upside down when that same person tried to SA while we hanged out in her bedroom. I remember it took me about a month to speak up to my mother about it, I felt so guilty, even tho it wasn\u2019t my fault. Then right before summer I broke it up with her. And that summer I just went into the worse place my mental health had ever been, I was starving for so long on purpose and at the same time pushing myself to the brim playing tennis about 6 hours per day, fueled by absolutely no food, only gum. But after that summer and like 3 suicide attempts and a GOOD fucking long time in therapy i feel a lot better and igs my body is recovered, even tho now i sorta feel disgusted by it slightly, idk i feel a lil off by it.",

I've struggled with anxiety since toddler years (I have proof) but depression didn't hit until sophomore year in high school. I never had more than a few close friends, and was picked on and bullied from 5th grade on for being a \"too smart for my own good\"  a \"goody-goody\",  \"tattle-tale\"  and \"by-the-book\" kind of kid with (at the time) undiagnosed ADHD. Teachers said I always tested well, but often daydreamed in class and had to be in control of any group assignments. Looking back on this 25-ish year old entry, seems like a wide combination of factors. I don't think an eating disorder ever has one 'specific' trigger, more like a culmination of mental, physical, and emotional factors that result in a higher percentage of risk to develop one, with one or more small factors that tip the metaphorical scales.",

That scared me & when it was everywhere in the news, online & everyone talking about that I really started to loose it mentally,.. I didn\u2019t trust any food that didn\u2019t already come wrapped - like bananas & nuts - that was pretty much my diet ( even really now ) Because of my other health issues my immune system was highly compromised so was told by my team of Drs that I had to self isolate - I had just finished with a partner of 7yrs & lived on my own, this combination has led me to today where I am now on a 2wk watch & wait Referal for upper GI Cancer ( Tummy cancer ) I know I have caused a lot of damage from my eating habits or lack of but COVID , living on my own, isolation & having OCD around germs & some foods anyway sent me down this path! I still haven\u2019t fully got any help but just this wk finally my local Eating disorder clinic has been in contact after being on its list mostly throughout COVID & up until now. At present I feel out of control with my health & eating is the one thing I have control over. I have everything crossed that these tests coming up prove my bad thoughts wrong. I want a better relationship with food & to get better. Am a newly joined member so hopefully I can find some support here. Sorry for the ramble guys\ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

I'm sure you have become successful in other areas of your life outside of your eating disorder, please do try to recognize how far you have come since your TBI and everything you have survived! \n\nI love animals, and really need contact with them for self-soothing...I truly fall apart without that contact. When I was 10, my family moved to a country in Europe that required all outside animals to be quarantined for 4 months. So our family dog was under lockdown during my most difficult period of adjustment ever, dealing with culture-shock and struggling to make friends. This isn't when my eating disorder really started, but I did start obsessively tracking caloric intake/output, exercising in my bedroom in the middle of the night, and I became a vegetarian (not that this is a bad thing, 26 years later I am still proud to be a vegetarian). This is also the first time I experienced depression -- 26 years later it is still ruining my life. We got our precious pup back after 4 months, but my personality and behaviors had already changed for the worse. Like you, I had already become depressed, angry, irritable, and anxious. While our dog still provided me comfort and allowed me to self-soothe, my new personality and behaviors were set in stone.\n\nI'm so sorry, I didn't mean to make this about *me me me*, I just felt compelled to share my story. I can relate to your feelings of loss, confusion, anger, and depression, and the personality changes that came with that. I can also relate to ED early intervention not working, and still struggling many years later. I feel for you -- please do take care of yourself, and know that I'm rooting for your recovery, even though I'm just a Reddit stranger! \ud83d\udc95",
