I don't starve myself to the point of passing out or needing hospitalization (yet and I hope not to) but I am triggered by large meals, obcessively calorie count, and will aggressively restrict my caloric intake to try and meet some arbitrary guideline that itself is far below where I should be for someone of my height/weight/physical activity, etc. \n\nI struggle every day to try and eat enough and it really fucks with my head when I do because it feels like too much or whatever. Some days I'm great, other days I'm freaking out because I allowed myself to have a little thing. \n\nJust because the 'wound' isn't mortal doesn't mean the 'wound' isn't damaging.",

      "body": "Absolutelyyyyyy! That\u2019s just the ED hard at work trying to convince you it\u2019s not there as it kills you lol - it\u2019s a sneaky bastard like that. Sometimes It\u2019s even like carbon monoxide poisoning, invisible and pervasive until it kills you all at once in your sleep. How can you get help for your problem when the problem itself argues with you about its existence, right? Eating disorders are especially isolating because of that and it makes it feel so lonely and anxiety inducing to talk about what you\u2019re going through because you\u2019re terrified people will say \u2018you don\u2019t look sick\u2019 or will deny your pain and experience because of what they think eating disorders are. But ED\u2019s are a MENTAL disorder, and the mental pain and effect on your life are just a much a part of the disease and the toll it takes as any weight loss or bodily damage, most likely more so for a lot of individuals. I feel like a fraud whenever I eat a normal amount and don\u2019t immediately hate myself. But even reading that back\u2026. It\u2019s just classic ED ammunition. I\u2019m doubting my eating disorder and pain because of a moment where I wasn\u2019t suffering and filled with such self loathing over a sandwich that I need to punish myself ??? That\u2019s just another indication of the disorder. Take care of yourself!!!! There\u2019s no one way an eating disorder looks or manifests or feels , and your pain deserves to be alleviated and you deserve to be healthy and have joy no matter what the sickness or anyone else tells you",
