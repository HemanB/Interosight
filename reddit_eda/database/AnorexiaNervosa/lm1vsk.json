  "selftext": "that was such a large title but i can\u2019t eat a slice of cake that\u2019s put in front of me for the absolute life of me but if the whole cake is right there then i can take a fork and eat it directly from the whole cake. same way with ice cream i can\u2019t eat it out of a bowl or a cone, but if i have the whole carton and a spoon then i can eat it totally fine. granted i feel guilty after eating it no matter what, but i won\u2019t cry over it or get anxious. this is probably just a me thing but who knows might as well ask",
