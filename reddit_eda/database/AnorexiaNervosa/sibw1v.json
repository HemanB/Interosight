      "body": "I experienced this a lot until recently, but I've made a few changes that help me feel full without guilt and shame. I'm still unwell, and undereating, so I wouldn't say these are necessarily \"healthy\" tips, but they do help me feel more in control around food when I choose to eat.\n\nCurrently, I try to prepare balanced meals that incorporate my fear foods in small ways *and* hit all the major food groups -- carbs, fat, protein, fiber, etc. I used to volume eat because I'd get so ravenous that I felt like I needed a huge portion, but I think this was actually counterintuitive. The unbalanced nutrition (lots of fiber, not much else) didn't keep me satisfied, and eating so much made me feel like I'd \"binged\" even when the food I consumed was low-calorie.\n\nNow, I try to eat small portions of fear foods, like real bread and cheese, with larger (but not massive) portions of vegetables, fruit, or other higher-volume foods. I find that this satisfies me emotionally and physically, as I'm not eating around my cravings, but I'm full enough from higher-volume foods that I don't feel the need to binge on fear foods.\n\nI also try to plate everything nicely and designate time for meals, so I'm not stuffing food into my mouth in the kitchen. This doesn't necessarily mean eating extremely slowly and chewing each bite 300 times or anything, but spacing the meal out over at least a few minutes helps me feel like I'm in control and puts me in tune with my fullness cues. Typically, I'll also watch a podcast or a YouTube video or Netflix show while I eat, so I'm able to enjoy my meal without fixating on the thought that I'm *eating,* which can be triggering in itself. (Since I've portioned out my meal beforehand, there's no worry about accidentally overeating, as I might do if I was eating chips from a bag.)\n\nFinally, I *generally* try to avoid \"fake\" foods if I can help it, unless I actually like them. In my experience, they tend to make me feel weird physically, or they leave a weird aftertaste, or they remind me of the \"non-diet\" version of the food that I'd rather be consuming, or I associate them with restriction and sadness and anorexia rather than pleasure and enjoyment of food, which I'm trying to emphasize.\n\nI think this approach to food is still pretty neurotic and restrictive -- it's definitely not where I want to be -- but I don't constantly feel like shit all the time anymore, and I've even found a lot of pleasure and happiness in meals recently. So, I hope this at least helps as a form of harm reduction.",

Since I restrict by massive amounts at times i end up extremely hungry and obviously i ignore that as long as i can but then of course we all have to eat eventually so when that time comes ill eat one low calorie thing but usually since i restricted by massive amounts prior to that, i end up 'binging' a little and since i got a tiny stomach that makes me so full. I really dont get a break  haha. \n\nI put binging in '' mainly because ordinary diet people would probably still say it is too little lmao but i personally think its way too much and i feel so so so so guilty after\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude14",
