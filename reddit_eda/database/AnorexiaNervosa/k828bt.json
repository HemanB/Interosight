  "selftext": "On the one hand, my anorexia gets such a kick out of people eating because \u201cooo yay they\u2019re consuming more calories than me!\u201d BUT, on the other hand, I absolutely despise, for example, my grandma, because she is CONSTANTLY eating. I think that it stems from jealousy that she just eats freely (and consumes a LOT of calories) and doesn\u2019t care. \n\nSuch a stupid contradictory, illogical illness. Has 2 opposing answers for EVERY situation",
