  "selftext": "I have an event to go to at the end of the week and instead of starving myself to fit into a now too tight dress, I bought a new one a size up! I\u2019m so happy that anorexia brain didn\u2019t take over and despite the larger size, I don\u2019t feel bad about my body! As another plus, I\u2019m actually enjoying working out for the first time in my life and I don\u2019t feel like I need to restrict all the time! I\u2019m so happy I chose to recover, it\u2019s so much better than the alternative!",
