I also found the ending she received in Skins Pure to be comforting and inspiring.

It romanticized and infantilized AN. Created lots of thinspo to be spread around to vulnerable people in ED spaces. Had an already thin actress with a history of ED lose weight and claimed they \"did it in a healthy way\". \n\nThe RTC in the movie was a joke. And IIRC (though I definitely could be wrong) the only people who struggled with BED or bulimia were women of color, while all the AN patients were white.  \n\nThe relationship between Keanu Reeves' character and his patients/clients seemed inappropriate (which especially bummed me out because I actually think he could play a great ED therapist with the right script and directing). The romance between Luke & Ellen was unpleasant and pointless (even though that toxicity *could* have been utilized to benefit the story/character growth/etc). And how they handled the storyline of the woman who miscarried... There's so much more I could go on about but I'll stop now x . x\n\nIt just felt like so much wasted potential that resulted in a shallow film at best and an actively harmful film at worst.",

It romanticized and infantilized AN. Created lots of thinspo to be spread around to vulnerable people in ED spaces. Had an already thin actress with a history of ED lose weight and claimed they \"did it in a healthy way\". \n\nThe RTC in the movie was a joke. And IIRC (though I definitely could be wrong) the only people who struggled with BED or bulimia were women of color, while all the AN patients were white.  \n\nThe relationship between Keanu Reeves' character and his patients/clients seemed inappropriate (which especially bummed me out because I actually think he could play a great ED therapist with the right script and directing). The romance between Luke & Ellen was unpleasant and pointless (even though that toxicity *could* have been utilized to benefit the story/character growth/etc). And how they handled the storyline of the woman who miscarried... There's so much more I could go on about but I'll stop now x . x\n\nIt just felt like so much wasted potential that resulted in a shallow film at best and an actively harmful film at worst.",
