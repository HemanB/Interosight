  "selftext": "Literally everyone keeps asking me and I just shrug and awkwardly laugh. People that I have not had an actual conversation with feel like it\u2019s okay to comment on me and ask me and every time I think \u2018yes that means I\u2019m skinnier\u2019 but also I\u2019m like shut up and stop commenting or asking me. I\u2019m not going well obviously but all people see is the weight. That\u2019s what I see too but Idek there\u2019s so many emotions that go through my head and I wanna just either scream, smile or cry. This is the only place I think people would get it and anyway thanks for letting me vent :)))))",

So many people asked me how I did it, even just like the cashier at the grocery store I usually go to. People who were strangers I just said I did it by starving myself which usually shuts them up pretty quick. It really does suck knowing that you have a problem you need to fix when everyone around you is acting like you\u2019re amazing for it. Ultimately no one has the right to ask u that question and they only do because society has taught them to think that way. I just try not to take it to heart.",
