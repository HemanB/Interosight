I dealt with something similar. \nWhen I was relapsing I finally admitted I needed help and at the urging of my family and a few close friends went to my doctor - I had lost a lot of weight in a short amount of time, my OCD was out of control, i was using ED behaviors left and right and I was underweight. My doctor, who knew my history with an ED told me I could still lose another 5 lbs - THEN he would 'start to get concerned'. I wasn't sick enough yet for him. He told me to hire a personal trainer and tone up and I'd be happier.\nI left that appointment and canceled all future ones. I ended up losing those magical 5 lbs and a hell of a lot more because i used his words justify what I was doing to everyone - \"Doctor says I'm fine!\" I shut down and gave up completely for months.\nThere is no such thing as not sick enough. You are sick regardless of how much you weigh if you're using behaviors. Comments like these make my blood boil.",
