  "title": "The reality of anorexia nervosa",
  "selftext": "Anorexia nervosa is not a diet. It's not a weight loss method. It's a devastating mental illness. It is not about being superficial, or trying to look a certain way. It's about being in extreme mental and emotional pain, feeling uncomfortable and not knowing how to cope with those feelings. It's not something you choose to do. Everyone develops the illness for different reasons. Everyone struggles in different ways. At first, you start off wanting to lose a few pounds. You get locked into the habit of constantly checking your weight. You see the number on the scale go down, and yet, you are never satisfied. For some reason, when you reach one number, you set the goal lower. And you keep losing weight. And that is why it is unhelpful to shame or scold a person with an eating disorder and demand they eat more. It is not that easy. And because it's a mental illness, it takes lots of support and treatment to overcome it. Even with treatment, many people with anorexia wind up relapsing. It is often a very isolating disorder. I think a person has to be very unhappy in order to continue to starve themselves. But no one chooses this disorder. It can cause severe medical complications. And it has one of the highest mortality rates of any mental illness. Even though I now experience painful and severe complications from my disorder, I find it very difficult to fully recover. Everyone has their own definition of what recovery looks like. Some people find inpatient treatment helpful and some people recover quickly. And some people are chronic sufferers and will struggle with this disorder for years. There is one thing we all have in common. Everyone with this disorder is hurting, mentally, emotionally, physically. No number will ever be good enough. No number is perfect. Reaching a certain number won't suddenly make you a happier person. Whatever was driving you to starve yourself at the beginning, will not suddenly go away, because you become sicker. For me, focusing so much on losing weight just made me more obsessive. I miss the days where I woke up and didn't think about or worry about my weight or the number on the scale. But those days seem so far away now, like a distant memory. I was happier before I was anorexic. I became more depressed, with the more weight I lost. Yet, I still can't let go of my disorder, even though it's caused me awful medical issues and pain. Whatever the person's reasons are for starving themselves, they aren't choosing it. And I wish people who have never experienced anorexia for themselves, wouldn't be so quick to judge those who suffer from it. What people with anorexia need is compassion and understanding. The illness already makes the person feel alone. Shaming them for something they didn't choose to develop is never the answer. This illness isn't your fault",
