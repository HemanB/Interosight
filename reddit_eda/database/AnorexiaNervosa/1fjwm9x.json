I tried to play it off, but he kept dogging on me until I just snapped and told him about my ed. it got awkward and I could tell he felt bad but that just destroyed my chance of ever recovering. I want to cry but I\u2019m holding it in. I feel horrible about myself and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever feel confident.",
