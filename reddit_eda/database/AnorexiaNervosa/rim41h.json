  "selftext": "They\u2019re there for a reason\u2026.\n\n\nIt seems like there are slowly more and more people on here who are asking if they\u2019re anorexic, posting calorie counts and weight numbers, asking for recommendations on laxatives or supplements, asking about specific safe foods, all of which are clearly stated in the guidelines as not being allowed. Also seeing more people post who make clear that they don\u2019t have anorexia at all nor are posting about a loved one who does but come on here to ask about fasting or non-related health issues. Like if you say in your post \u201cidk if this is the right sub for this\u201d then FIND OUT from the guidelines before posting where they make it really clear? Is that too much to ask?\n\nIdk maybe I\u2019m alone in this. I don\u2019t mean to be excluding at all and I\u2019m so sorry if this isn\u2019t an appropriate post, mods feel free to take down if necessary. I\u2019ll probably delete this soon cus I feel really anxious posting it and nervous that if I\u2019m wrong someone will be mean to me:( I know it\u2019s dumb but anxietyyy\n\nI\u2019m so grateful for this sub and the community we have here is so kind and supportive. I guess I\u2019m just wondering if anyone else has noticed this too? Idk maybe I\u2019m just projecting cus I\u2019m in a really vulnerable place in recovery rn:/",

I hope you continue to reach out for support and community, there are so many of us who are more mindful of language and I\u2019m seeing that folks who unintentionally break the sub rules are usually super receptive to being alerted of the particular guideline they might be breaking. This remains such a gentle and compassionate space and I\u2019m understanding that it takes a village to keep it safe for all of us. Sending you big hugs and all the support you need\u2764\ufe0f",
