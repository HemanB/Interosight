  "selftext": "All I wanted was to challenge myself and eat a fear food. I thought that a hamburger from mc Donald's would be a great start since the calories are listed online and I know all the ingredients but still have no control over the cooking process.. And I did it! \n\nI was so excited but when I told my 2 close friends, they said it's unhealthy and that I could've made a healthier version at home. I feel so guilty.. at home I would just eat my low calorie safe food, why would I willingly make burgers at home??\n\nNow out of spite I want to get worse in order to hurt them through hurting myself. The little voice in my head got so much stronger again, in a matter of minutes. My edgy ed brain is screaming \"Get so bad that you'll have to be hospitalized.\"\n\nAnyway yeah I'm not eating burgers again, sorry for the rant \ud83d\ude2d",

He's helped me with some cooking challenges like oils, we've cooked together and I've taught him how to cook fish. He's explained things come with time. That he had issues with recovery and help.  Along with going to the grocery store before I would get professional help. He bridged the gap to keep me out of the hospital again. I cook dinner for my room mate and I most nights. Some times he helps or hangs out. And has been learning how to properly help. At first he was avoiding some foods or things to not freak me out. And I had to tell him to do it. My friend who is also recovered kinda had given me the tools to be anorexic. I didn't know the tricks. While  talking about it he would laugh about some the things he did. When I had a bad episode and had lost a lot of control. I made it to my normal point them remembered all our conversations. So it's actually taught me to be careful when talking about it. It's like having a bomb recipe in a weird way. It's also weird because I have atypical anorexia, so it adds a different layer to everything.",

It had gotten so bad that I was squeezing them on paper tissues to get as much oil out as possible..so embarrassing.. I couldn't deal with it anymore so I had given up and stopped going to McDonald's altogether. I've come a long way since then but with those unnecessary comments it felt more like defeat than success.\n\nI think you should just go for it! It's not as scary as it seems! The burger patty tastes \u00d710000 better and it's so much more filling and satisfying than the dry ass nuggets! Next thing I plan to get is the cheeseburger, then the double cheeseburger \ud83e\udd70",

If I eat something that doesn't taste exceptionally good, I get disappointed like it was a \"waste of calories\". I'm just trying to be as hungry as possible when I challenge myself, then most things taste good. I'm not sure if it's the best approach, but if I'm not too hungry it's very hard for me to just go eat outside.\nThat's so nice of your friend!! In your case you could let your friend cook for you or you guys can cook together so you don't have 100% control over the portions and ingredients?",
