  "selftext": "Today my grandmother (who has struggled with anorexia) pulled me aside and told me if I didn\u2019t start eating I was going to die, and that my great grandmother died because she wouldn\u2019t eat\n(Which is what caused My grandmothers recovery). I didn\u2019t even know that was how my great grandmother passed away. The way she looked at me was haunting. I\u2019m not in recovery, but it was enough to make me think about it for a minute.",
