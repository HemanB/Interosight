My suggestion would be to do research on doctors and find one that aligns with you. If you\u2019re not comfortable telling your gp then it feels like maybe you aren\u2019t compatible with them. You deserve a dr you can confide in. Testosterone can certainly cause issues with weight gain so that\u2019s definitely a possibility but you shouldn\u2019t be eating in a deficit and gaining still. If anything I\u2019d think you just wouldn\u2019t lose. My anorexia just came back maybe 6 months ago. I was recovering and pretty fat. My primary care refused to believe I was anorexic because of that. I stopped seeing any Drs until now cuz my hair has started to fall out. I hope you can find someone who can look into this for you.

My suggestion would be to do research on doctors and find one that aligns with you. If you\u2019re not comfortable telling your gp then it feels like maybe you aren\u2019t compatible with them. You deserve a dr you can confide in. Testosterone can certainly cause issues with weight gain so that\u2019s definitely a possibility but you shouldn\u2019t be eating in a deficit and gaining still. If anything I\u2019d think you just wouldn\u2019t lose. My anorexia just came back maybe 6 months ago. I was recovering and pretty fat. My primary care refused to believe I was anorexic because of that. I stopped seeing any Drs until now cuz my hair has started to fall out. I hope you can find someone who can look into this for you. I\u2019m wishing you so much luck \u2764\ufe0f",
