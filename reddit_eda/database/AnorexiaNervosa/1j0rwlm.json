  "selftext": "God I\u2019m so happy I have the energy to engage in hobbies. I\u2019ve been hoarding soooo many Lego sets over the past Christmas\u2019 and birthdays and I finally have the motivation and energy to do them. Before I couldn\u2019t even focus on anything as I was just so drained all the time, food focused and just basically brain dead lol. I even bought myself a new set\ud83d\ude01And I made my bf a valentines card. This is fucking amazing. I have fucking energy and can use my brain lol\n\nSome pics!!\ud83d\ude38\ud83d\ude38 I feel super proud!\n\nI bought so much craft stuff too with my Christmas money!! Not gonna buy more Lego tho because it\u2019s expensive and I\u2019ve got loads of other craft stuff I\u2019ve hoarded over the years I can do\ud83d\ude05I\u2019ve got clay hoarded from years ago that\u2019s still good and so many \u2018build this tiny house\u2019 sets that my bf has got me for Christmas. I bought so many cool buttons second hand tho that are super cool. I feel really good right now even tho I\u2019ve been having a mental breakdown the whole day from my extreme hunger, legit just crying and stuffing my face the whole damn day, but it\u2019s worth it to be able to live life\ud83e\udef6\ud83e\udef6 \n",
