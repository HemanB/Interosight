      "body": "Definitely. I was diagnosed with OCD and anxiety a few years before the onset of my ed and my diagnoses of anorexia. When anorexia spiraled out of control for me, my ocd practically vanished (obsessive thoughts and tendencies took on new forms with my ed, like numbers + counting every single calorie) and the anxiety over contamination (like even sitting on public seats or touching public door handles) numbed down and was no concern to me anymore. All of my energy was consumed by my ed and it was a relief from ocd. In recovery from anorexia, ocd has begun to pop up for me once again and it\u2019s super discouraging. It\u2019s like I\u2019m losing control over my food by trying to stick to recovery, so instead my ocd is returning to once again give me anxiety over things I thought I\u2019d gotten over.",

The brain is like fuck this -too much serotonin, therefore it down regulates production, reduces receptors. The brain is used to the new \"normal\". A very slow weaning process leaves the brain at the \"programmed level\" theoretically.",
