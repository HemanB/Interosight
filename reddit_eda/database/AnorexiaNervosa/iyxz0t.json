  "selftext": "You see, I never saw myself really fat, but I always thought I looked a healthy weight, not really knowing how skinny I actually looked. Looking back at photos, if I saw myself like that I would've stopped. I genuinely thought I was healthy weight.  Also I had a virtue to not feel any looseness in my body as I misinterpreted that as fat, not loose skin. As a result I had hospitalised myself. Now as a CrossFit trainee I have realised that I can be healthy without starving myself and healthy is eating more than I was. The changes to my body were incredible. I saw my muscles coming back and I was no longer a young boy to feel sorry for. I was a man. I looked taller, more muscular and ever since CrossFit I am defeatinf anorexia. Who knew? I really wish that you guys take this and be less fearful of gaining weight. Yes some differences are noticeable, but these are good differences that make you look and feel so much better. You won't ever get fat, in fact you'll still look thin. Trust me from experience, don't let anorexia shroud you in fear.",
