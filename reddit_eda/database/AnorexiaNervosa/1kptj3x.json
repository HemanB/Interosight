I think the label \u201catypical\u201d going away in future DSM guidelines if I had to predict it. I am diagnosed with AN-R but I certainly didn\u2019t start significantly UW and had I gotten help sooner, atypical would\u2019ve been my Dx. Now that I\u2019ve been working toward recovery, my dx hasn\u2019t changed but my weight has\u2026 I think \u2018atypical\u2019 makes people overthink everything. \n\nAlso I objectively think labels are stupid. Like I understand when it\u2019s necessary for medication but I avoided getting a dx at all costs. I\u2019ve never understood needing a specific label to feel valid in this specific disease. Logistically an ED diagnosis fucks with your chances of getting good life insurance and how medical professionals treat you down the line. It didn\u2019t feel validating for me to get a diagnosis, it felt like a sentence. I also hate that *SOME* people with AN gatekeep it from those with \u2018atypical.\u2019 It is perpetuating a huge issue. If disordered eating is caught early and not reliant on reaching a certain weight before getting a certain diagnosis, I\u2019m certain the competitive element would see a huge decrease. And people would be more likely to seek help earlier. \n\nHIGHLY recommend everyone reads the book \u201cDead Weight\u201d by Emmeline Clein. It is so eye-opening on how the DSM and medical professionals, as well as fellow ED sufferers perpetuate this illness. The hierarchy of ED\u2019s is killing people and we need to talk about that.",
