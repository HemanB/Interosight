It still hurts, but restricting and eating can't take that pain away. \n\nMy advice is to try to love yourself like you would your daughter. Start journaling. Start listening inward. Talk to a professional if you need to. (Someone who understands exposure and trauma therapy.) \n\nFollow food and body positive blogs and pages.

Divide your meal and leave the other parts on the counter, fridge or microwave. Outta sight outta mind. Once you\u2019re done with the first portion you can move onto the next. No need to rush, it\u2019s not a race! As far as a distraction goes if you\u2019re able to watch YouTube, or listen to music while you eat I highly suggest that. Go for one of your comfort movies.

When you feel too full or eat a cheat meal, it's not just that you're scared of having gained a tiny bit of weight. It's a breach on the standards you've set for yourself, a betrayal in some way. If you broke out of the routine this once, it's just the first step in your life falling into complete chaos.   \n when I was at my worst, just a slight feeling of fullness would make me feel worthless and scared. It's such a silly thing when you try to explain someone who is well, but to an anorexic it really can feel like the end of the world.",
