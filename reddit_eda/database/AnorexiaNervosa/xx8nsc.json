      "body": "When I weighed more I was actually happier like I had a greater sense of well being in general. I was enjoying eating and drinking whatever I felt like. I found myself way happier despite it being in the back of my head that I am not at my ideal weight. Also, I worked out 30 min per day, 5 days per week. I actually had the energy to get up and move and do things.   \n\n\nNow that I'm a much lower weight I do feel like I'm missing. My energy level is just awful. Sure, I feel more willing to be seen in public but I want to enjoy a piece of warm molten lava cake, or have some pizza and beer on the weekend. I want to go out with family/friends and not spend 20 minutes eyeballing the calorie content. I miss when I could go out to eat and not have an internal meltdown if there are no healthy options and then fear what my family will think of me if I choose not to order anything or eat something there.  \n\n\nI'm even scared of being involuntarily hospitalized. I'm trying to recover from this by figuring out how to moderate but in general, yes being smaller feels great but there is also a lot of happiness to be found in letting yourself enjoy delicious foods and not weighing yourself all the time etc. Anyways sorry for the rant. I just feel like it's a trade off and with ED it's so hard to find a balance especially with self-esteem issues ):",
