  "title": "Having a visible ED makes not having money REALLY awkward",
  "selftext": "I\u2019m underweight, which I only mention because I think that\u2019s the reason people act weird about it. I went to an auto shop today because my battery isn\u2019t working. When he told me how much they cost I cried, which is embarrassing enough. It\u2019s not as bad as having your card declined on a $3 purchase or something, like plenty of people don\u2019t just casually have $200! I don\u2019t even think that reveals me to be low income tbh. He said we could try charging my battery to see if that helps, so I was hanging around the store for about half an hour while it charged. I took off my hoodie and coat because it would be a while and if I get used to inside temperature with them on then I\u2019m fucked for outside. They offered me a candy bar and I thanked them but politely turned them down. Something that isn\u2019t strange or sus. \n\nI could hear them whispering to each other, like \u201cwhen do you think was the last time she had a meal?\u201d \n\nThey thought I was starving. Like, going hungry. \n\nSuper awkward. I wanted to disappear, to disintegrate. To cease to exist. \n\nThey offered me a muffin from like a 4 pack and stressed that if I didn\u2019t eat it, it\u2019d be thrown away. I did not want this muffin, but it felt like it\u2019d be selfish to turn it down. They were trying to be so nice, and I\u2019m out here misleading people just by existing in my body. I feel so guilty and horrible. \n\nMy finances are basically nonexistent right now, but they didn\u2019t even know that. They just knew I didn\u2019t have $200 and look like this.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time people have come to that assumption, like people offer to buy my groceries for me kind of a lot if they see me checking out, especially if they see me change my mind about something. I don\u2019t let them, it just feels so wrong. But this was the worst it\u2019s ever been, I think because I heard them mention my weight/body. I don\u2019t normally have such blatant confirmation, like usually I can try to think that maybe I\u2019m reading too much into something even though I don\u2019t believe that. There\u2019s that doubt there that there just isn\u2019t here.",

And like I have a friend who gets $250 a month in food stamps, and that\u2019s such an insane amount of food money to me\u2026 I know a few complete meals (like all the food groups) that I can make 6 servings of for like $3. My brain doesn\u2019t let me eat them anymore, but still I mean canned veggies are $0.50 per can. When I think of what I\u2019d do if I had such a crazy high food budget I think of expensive things like fibre one bars, shirataki noodles, etc and it feels like that would be wasting the government\u2019s money because it\u2019s not even like a necessity it\u2019s just things that would make my days easier and less stressful. I\u2019m not sure how much sense that makes",
