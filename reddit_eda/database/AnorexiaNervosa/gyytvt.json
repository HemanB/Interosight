  "selftext": "Before y\u2019all go crazy. I KNOW pro Ana subs are unhealthy. I get it. But some days that sense of community was all that kept me from going off the deep end. Plenty of support on this platform for those ready to recover but what about those of us who aren\u2019t there yet. It\u2019s so hard not to have a place where I won\u2019t be judged for the sick part of me that wants to keep going with this life as dysfunctional as it may be. But I need community too. On those subs I could post without worrying about violating the rules and hurting others. It might not have been healthy but it kept me from doing something stupid when I felt alone and worthless. Now it\u2019s gone. So thanks Reddit",

It IS unhealthy and we shouldn't have communities that are absolutely unhealthy.   \n\n\nAnd having a community that puts people who have an illness together so that they can continue the illness is not something we should aspire to. You do not need to confer with other anorexic people to continue your own destructive habits, and I think it is appropriate to stop that communities, because it does not help anyone.   \n\n\nNow I also understand that you want to look at other examples and point them out as well. That is fair, but that is a completely separate and independent conversation than this one. Each sub (or topic) can stand on its own in terms of whether it should be here on Reddit. \n\nI am recovering, I will always be recovering, and I feel that it should be the goal of all of us to get to recovery and acceptance. We shouldn't have subs that do the opposite, and I feel that the arguments for keeping such subs are more about enabling behavior than stopping it.",
