  "selftext": "It hurts when people call you a fatphobic when you're trying to talk about your anorexia. I know that I can't speak for all anorexics since some of them might be fatphobic. But in with that same logic, people can't just call me a fatphobic because I'm anorexic.\n\nYes, I want to be skinny, yes I don't like the fact I look fat, but I can't care less how fat you are. I think that _I_ look ugly because of _my_ fat. I think that _I'll_ only look pretty if _I'm_ skinny. I think that _I'll_ be more liked if _I_ lost weight. \n\nHonestly, I never looked at someone \"fat\" and thought \"wow, they are so ugly\". I don't judge others with the same scale I judge myself. In fact, every time I look at all of those gorgeous people who are scientifically overweight, I feel jealous that they can be beautiful without needing to lose weight. It's just not fair. I'm trying so hard to be accepted and some people just look wonderful no matter what they do.\n\nSo yeah, I'm not fatphobic.",
