I like taking pictures so taking a bunch and editing them for lighting was something that distracted me. Otherwise I really didn't get out of bed, and it was that way for months unless I was going to school. I understand it seems like that's bull, and I respect that, but taking stuff like this gave me some ounce of feeling a sliver of comfort in my skin while relapsing. Since eating again and regain financial control and life balancing back out and trauma being processed, yeah I was able to come off suicide watch. I was becoming thinner by the day and dropped 10 pounds in less than a week, and it was going down more. It was a horrendous time, but I didn't really let people in to see it because I was raised to keep stuff like that going on in mt life inside until the door is closed. Taking pictures like this made my friends less worried since they felt the same thing you do, looks okay. \n\nJust because someone looks okay, doesn't mean they are. Look at several people that committed suicide that laughed and smiled all the time and did silly things. If you're going to believe that I wasn't in fact in a bad place, thats okay. But, yeah. I took pictures like this to feel better and essentially feed my anorexia more control because it felt like controlling my eating would somehow balance the lack of control in my life. \n\nI'm sorry if it appears I'm making fun of it or blowing it out of proportion. My teacher brought it up to my guidance counselor because of his concerns about me, who then called the cops for a wellness check a couple days after speaking with me. Doctors bounced me on a few medications until they found one that treated bipolar depression. \n\nI hope that clears it up. I can always explain more if need be, I get it seems insensitive and I don't mean for that.\n\nEdit- also my doctors made 2 appointments a week and instead of the usual 30 minutes they do, I would be with them for up to two or three hours sometimes because I was falling apart. They suggested hospitalization but I rejected that because I explained it would make me worse being away from my home and responsibility that was already overflowing. I've been seeing my doctors for a year and thats why they decided that if I wasn't going to do inprogram treatment, I was going to check in twice a week and discuss everything in detail. Now I see them once a week, or did until this outbreak happened",
