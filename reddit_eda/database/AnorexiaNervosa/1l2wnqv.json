No child needs to know how to track their weight, count cals, or moralize food. \n\nI do think preventative anti ED lessons need to be taught\u2014 IE all foods fit, ads don\u2019t take away, HAES, and the importance of all macro and micro nutrients. \n\nYou would be shocked how many kids are being taught to restrict in a disordered way, as early as elementary school.",

Like how do we teach kids healthy eating and at the same time not teach them to moralise food? I think about this all the time and I have no idea what the solution would be. You can\u2019t deny the objective fact that the majority of kids are eating too much and not moving enough - the stats don\u2019t lie, but EDs are also a massive problem (and I\u2019m definitely not trying to downplay them). Ahhh it\u2019s so tricky.",
