  "title": "A very hard but wholesome interaction at the store",
  "selftext": "I have a pretty hard time actually buying food at the grocery store and spend most of my time longingly staring at food. Particularly at sweets like baked goods, cookies, icecream, etc. \n\nWell earlier I was doing just that in the food lion  icecream section. I was slowly pacing the aisle, painfully pondering their wide variety of delicious sounding icecreams, wanting nothing more than to buy every flavor and scarf down in the car but alas, I told myself no - I can't - and went to turn and walk away. \n\n\"Have you ever had this flavor?\" an older man asks me while pointing at the mint chocolate chip Tillamook flavor. He already had 3 different gallon tubs of the same brand in his cart. \n\n\"Huh?\" I deadpanned, not processed what he asked me for a moment until I realized, \"Oh, no. But I do like that brand, and mint chocolate chip. I'm sure it's good.\" \n\n\"It's my favorite. If I had nothing but a five this is what I'd get.\" He notes the price tag and proceeds while pulling out his wallet. \"Here look. If I'll have a five in here you should try it.\" \n\nI internally panicked. I can't get icecream. There are too many calories and I'll probably eat the whole tub at once. This cannot be happening to me. I think the world might actually end right here right now. I am going to die.\n\n\"No, no, no, it's fine really - you don't have to!\" \n\nHe wouldn't take no for an answer and handed me the five dollar bill he found from his wallet. \"It's fine really, get yourself something. Even if it's not mint. I don't work here or nothing, I just love this stuff.\" He smiled and walked off without giving me any time to do anything other than sheepishly smile and thank him. \n\nHe wasn't judging me, my appearance, thinking I look grotesque and undeserving of icecream. He was unashamed to have 3 full tubs in his own cart and was only trying to spread some joy. It's moments like this that make me DESPISE my disorder because it takes moments of happiness and can absolutely kill my mood. \n\nThe thought of buying this icecream now feels like an unbearable pressure and I feel so scared. There's a million disordered thoughts going through my head and this extremely kind interaction with a stranger now holds so much potential to ruin my day. \n\nI didn't know what to do and stood there frozen for what felt like an eternity trying to navigate the absolute warzone in my mind. I could feel my heart in my chest and the only thing that brought me back to reality was realized I kept forgetting to breathe and now feel faint.\n\nIt might sit in the freezer till it's bad, I might binge and purge the whole thing. I don't know. But I do know I don't want this disorder to ruin kind moments where all someone wants to do is spread a little happiness, and to share something they enjoy with another person. \n\nSo today I came home with a tub of tillamook campfire peanut butter cup. Maybe next time I'll get mint. ",
