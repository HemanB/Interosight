  "selftext": "So I was very aware that have and ED would put me at a higher risk for getting this. But because I\u2019m a teenager I assumed \u201cI\u2019d be fine\u201d. I now have a horrible cough, feel short of breath, and am running a fever. My family is trying to get me a test tomorrow. And I\u2019m very scared that I won\u2019t be okay because my immune system is so bad right now. I already feel so crappy and weak. I don\u2019t know why exactly I\u2019m posting this but I figured you\u2019d all understand my fears.\n\n\nEdit- Hey guys, thank for all the kind words and support. It truly means so much and has really been pushing me forward, I even ate breakfast this morning which is something I haven\u2019t done in I don\u2019t even know how long. So thank you all\ud83e\udd0d",

Those plants can help your immune system and have some antivirotic tendencies, it's not a cure, but if it will make you feel only 1 % better, it's worth to try it.

The danger is hospitals running low on things to help with pneumonia. At my worst simple colds turned into pneumonia 4/5 times, literally had it three times in a year and them again the following summer. The sad truth is that in some of the harder hit countries they are having to make some hard decisions on who gets the limited supplies based on likelihood of survival, and us ED folks aren't anywhere near the top of the list.",
