However somewhere along the way it became an obsession and I was fixated on it, even once I was at a healthy weight I just couldnt stop. I cant remember when the lines started to blur but I believe I was already susceptible to developing an ED because of my medical history and losing weight just triggered that course of events.",

I was good at eating just enough in front of people to not raise suspicions but really I was basically not eating anything. I\u2019m currently less than a year recovered right now and pregnant with our first child. I still have urges to restrict because of how I feel in a body bigger than I\u2019ve ever had. But I work hard to remind myself that if I don\u2019t eat, our son won\u2019t eat, and that\u2019s a terrifying thought I refuse to give into.

People notice when someone has a peculiar or different diet or eating habits, out of the ordinary obsessive compulsions, if they exercise a lot or if their weight decreases. The insecurities and depression can lead a lot of sufferers to feel isolated and they want to discuss all these confusing thoughts online where it feels safe and you don't feel so alone or weird.

Lots of people have disordered eating or have done extreme diets but don\u2019t have an eating disorder.\n\nFor me it came late. I grew up with my AN grandmother and obese mother. My grandma was always telling me I need to eat less and \u201cboys won\u2019t like you if you eat\u201d (I was already right above underweight), while my mom was constantly talking about how fat and ugly she was and that she\u2019s worthless because of it. I had bad body image but didn\u2019t really do much about it. Then I got my first job and started binging on food like crazy. Gained weight and that just made my imagine worse. I definitely already had disordered eating mostly from anxiety and depression long before this too.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I was 20 and me and my fianc\u00e9 split after he cheated 13 times, my best friend died, and I fell into such a huge depression I just stopped eating basically. My grandma would tell me she was so proud and I looked great constantly after I started losing from this, and my mom would tell me how jealous she was of how small I was. It felt good, so even after I started feeling better, I continued to restricted and it became the only thing I cared about or would make me feel good about myself. I recovered, then a few years later developed an alcohol addiction and once I was out of that I relapsed. One of the things that was keeping me from drinking again was telling myself how much calories were in it and that drinking makes you gain weight like crazy. Still stuck in that relapse at 27 now",

Thinness isn\u2019t just perceived as a physical trait, it\u2019s also seen as a virtue. I think this is why AN is perceived SO differently on a societal level compared to any other eating disorder.\n\nWhen most people think of AN, the first thing that comes to mind isn\u2019t that it\u2019s a debilitating mental illness. Most people just think that anorexia means that someone has successfully made themselves very very thin. A lot of people just see restriction as a means to an end, and that it takes a lot of self-discipline and suffering to reach this \u201cideal\u201d body type. Anorexia is alluring to people in a way that other eating disorders generally aren\u2019t.",

My grandma was always telling me I need to eat less and \u201cboys won\u2019t like you if you eat\u201d (I was already right above underweight), while my mom was constantly talking about how fat and ugly she was and that she\u2019s worthless because of it.

I definitely already had disordered eating mostly from anxiety and depression long before this too.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I was 20 and me and my fianc\u00e9 split after he cheated 13 times, my best friend died, and I fell into such a huge depression I just stopped eating basically. My grandma would tell me she was so proud and I looked great constantly after I started losing from this, and my mom would tell me how jealous she was of how small I was. It felt good, so even after I started feeling better, I continued to restricted and it became the only thing I cared about or would make me feel good about myself. I recovered, then a few years later developed an alcohol addiction and once I was out of that I relapsed. One of the things that was keeping me from drinking again was telling myself how much calories were in it and that drinking makes you gain weight like crazy. Still stuck in that relapse at 27 now",

If people got off insta, went outside, and looked around at what people really look like, I know they wouldn't be seeing that. AN is not all that common, especially not in our obesogenic society. \n\nNote that they also said prevalence of AN specifically, not eds in general. The other eds are much more common, with ednos making up the biggest percentage by far iirc. I don't know if they include atypical AN in that statistic since it is under the EDNOS umbrella but as upsetting as it is, I personally think it is best to go off professional diagnoses for an attempt at a statistic like that (which will never be perfectly accurate anyway) rather than going off self reported polls that include self diagnosers, people that simply don't meet the diagnostic criteria, people that crash dieted a week before prom and talk the rest of their life about that \"time they were anorexic\", etc. You wouldn't get accurate results, especially since AN is put on a pedestal compared to other eds so a significant portion of people who clinically fit the diagnostic criteria for a different ed would likely self report AN instead, especially ednos sufferers, and especially ones that aren't professionally diagnosed.",

But food is everywhere. You strive for idealistic self and you never reach it bc ana takes and never gives. Chasing the dragon. \n\nBut i feel im out of my depth here. Relapse happens. The only reason i recovered was at first bc i feared social exclusion due to skipping school. My relationsship with food is still not perfect 13 years later - but hey i never relapsed.

For me, I\u2019m on a taper off methadone and it messed with my metabolism so it\u2019s a weird place to be in. Honestly I\u2019m not complaining except I feel like I\u2019m not worthy of the weight loss.",

          "body": "Omg. I couldn\u2019t imagine tapering off Methadone *and* dealing with an ED (whether actively struggling, in recovery, or recovered) so I commend you for that. I have been on Subs for 10+ years, so I\u2019m very familiar with the physical and mental aspects of being on an opioid for maintenance. \n\nAside from that, it\u2019s totally okay that you ask! To be honest I know I\u2019m losing the weight because of restriction. I haven\u2019t been able to correct those behaviors completely. At times I eat more regularly and most of the time I restrict. I also use laxatives, quite often. So there\u2019s several factors involved. I\u2019m trying to get over the \u201ccontrol\u201d aspect of the restriction, but my god is it difficult. I want to give it up but it just isn\u2019t that simple. My brain is wired to restrict and control to the detriment of my own health, and the associated behaviors are extremely hard to change.",
