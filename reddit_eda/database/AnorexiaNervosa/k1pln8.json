Please don't include any guilt within your meals this evening. \nEnjoy your mashed potatoes and pie. You deserve the world\ud83d\udc9c\nTry your best to stay strong today. Thanksgiving is a very hard day for some people, focus on what you're grateful for, because your gratitude is more than the number on a scale. You can do anything",
