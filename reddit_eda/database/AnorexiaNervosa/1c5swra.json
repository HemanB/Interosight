  "selftext": "I personally would like not to see people's \" recovery meals\" or \" safe foods\" photographed in this sub. If you are on the road to recovery, I am proud of you and I understand wanting to share these wins. However, to some this can be deeply unhelpful, esp. if someone has extreme hunger, or eats more than you are showing-- I don't see how portraying an aesthetic meal, whether its for recovery or not is particularly helpful in this context. I'm sorry, I want to be as supportive of everyone's journey but I think there are 100 places where food pics are accepted around the web, can we be careful about posting specifics here.",
