  "title": "You won't stop once you reach a certain weight",
  "selftext": "You think you have things under control at first. You start restricting your food intake and losing weight. You reach a number you have in your head. But you don't stop at that number, because this is a serious mental illness. And there is no off switch. You will never feel sick enough, underweight enough. You can start to look visibly ill, and you may think at that point, you are going to turn things around. Pursue recovery, because you've finally proved at this point you are sick. But you won't. In fact, resistance to treatment and finding comfort in this disorder, being in denial of how ill you are, is very common. I remember being hospitalized, severely ill, with failing health and people afraid I would die. I didn't have good insight back then. I thought everyone worried about me and trying to make me eat was wrong. That's what this disorder does to you. You can be in a hospital, emaciated, about to get a feeding tube because you are refusing to eat, and you still won't see it. I didn't see it at that time. My only focus at that point in time was my weight and what the scale was saying. Instead of thinking about the fact that people in the hospital were trying to get me healthier, all I thought about was my weight. I was younger, so I wasn't focused on the future consequences. And there are consequences to staying sick, remaining in a malnourished body. There are side effects to starving yourself. It is different for everyone. Maybe you start to notice you get cold easier and can no longer stay warm. Maybe you start losing energy and your bones start to weaken. Maybe you find it's hard to sleep at night. Your mind starts only focusing on what you eat, what you weigh. All other concerns drift into the background. Hopefully, you have people around you that try to get you to understand that what you are doing is deadly and that you need help. Maybe you will recover early, and find a way out of this disorder, before it becomes chronic. Maybe you accept to go to treatment and be refed. You accept help, knowing help means weight gain and letting go of the ed behaviors. Some people do very well in treatment and they never go on to be chronic. But for others, they don't respond the same to hospitalization. They stay sick for years, medical complications become worse. And full recovery seems impossible at times. But if you go through treatment, and it doesn't work, maybe it was not you that resisted the treatment. Maybe the treatment given was done poorly and people didn't tailor things to fit your needs. Everyone is different. Everyone reacts differently to treatment. Some fight the process. Some go along with it. It's not easy for anyone. And at any point in your disorder, whether you have been sick for two years and twenty years, you can suffer medical complications. You do not have to feel sick, to be sick. If you had asked me at the time of my inpatient hospitalizations if I felt sick and like I needed to be there, I would have said no. I was in denial. I didn't feel any pain or discomfort at the time, even though I was near death. No matter how many times people repeated to me they were afraid I was going to die, my illness had taken over and malnourishment was clouding my thinking. And I couldn't agree to what they said. I eventually agreed to eat, but only under pressure, because I felt I had no other choice. And when you go through treatment, and you aren't willing to see you have a problem, then you are going to have a difficult time getting better. When I was younger, I was unaware of all the terrible consequences. I had no idea there were so many side effects. Many they will not tell you about and you often do not consider things, until one day, they hit you and then you can't stop thinking about the damage done to your body. Damage from anorexia can be silent. It can occur for many years. Because this illness is an addiction, you may think because you do not feel bad, physically, that you can keep going. But your body can only take so much. I wish I could reverse time, and go back to the moments people were telling me to treat this early. I pushed away help after my hospitalizations, believing I could go home, retreat into the safety and comfort of my disorder, which was actually anything but safe. For years, my disorder grew more and more severe. And I avoided further hospitalization, for the fear it would be another repeated cycle. Then, my body began to show signs of damage. I have a hard time controlling my bladder, and get frequent and painful urination. This symptom basically keeps me staying at home all the time. And I have found no way to reverse it. It's not just frequency but constant pain. And this will erode your self esteem quickly. I wish I was warned about anorexia and bladder issues. But I had no idea. And that is the most devastating thing about this disorder. It silently takes away your comfort, your peace of mind, and steals little bits of your health in the most cruel ways. My digestive system is damaged from all the stress. Years of remaining at a low weight, never fully restoring my weight to a healthy level, has caused organ damage. I used to be able to eat and gain weight. But now, my body doesn't respond to food the same way, and I lose weight, unintentionally. It's not just weight loss, but chronic pain, stomach issues, and a general weak feeling. I was unaware that palliative care for anorexia existed. But I find myself on palliative care. I was unaware my disorder would become deeply entrenched. I was unaware these medical issues would have such a huge impact on my quality of life. Once a disorder becomes chronic, it is not impossible to get better. But you need support and understanding. With this disorder, it consumes your thoughts. You do not know why, but that number you see on the scale means so much. Yet, you long for a life free from this disorder and you try to be positive. But with anorexia, also comes depression. You do not see things in the same way that a healthy person without anorexia sees things. People say \"go to treatment\" and maybe things will get better. But a lot of people with anorexia fear change, fear changing what they are doing, even when a part of them understands the harm this disorder is causing them. Even if you wind up with very painful medical complications, even when people are waring you that you can die, even when you are a chronic sufferer, on palliative care, and feeling unsure about recovery, you will never feel sick enough. You will try to convince yourself that you can keep going like this. But that is just the disorder lying to you. Anorexia isn't fun. Anorexia isn't peaceful. Anorexia doesn't give you a break when you get tired of it. I try to be hopeful I can get better. What that may look like, I cannot predict. But I do miss the days when I did not have an eating disorder in my life. It's not glamorous or fun to suffer. If you do not feel sick or worthy enough to get help, that is already a sign of how much you deserve support. Not only support, but understanding. Whether you are in recovery, younger with an ed, older with an ed, or chronic, everyone deserves respect and compassion. Because this illness is not your fault",
