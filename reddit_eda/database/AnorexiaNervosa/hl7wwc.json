  "selftext": "So today my step dad asked me if I wanted some Subway and I challenged my ED and said yes! I got a veggie sub and ate it until I was full and I am just feeling so good about myself right now! I am trying to start eating intuitively too it's quite an adjustment but I really want to get better and not let food control my thoughts 24/7 and prevent me from having a good time",
