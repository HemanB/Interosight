  "selftext": "Why just WHY are we so obsessed with that damn thigh gap? Everytime I see mine I get such a calm almost euphoric feeling and my mood gets better, how twisted is that?? As soon as it disappears or doesnt show as much as I want it to I restrict like a maniac and feel awful. For me the thigh gap is my ultimate goal and I look for it in every mirror I pass and it\u2019s so tiring\u2026 I\u2019m so tired. I do body checks in the mirror maybe a hundred times a day.  \nI just want it to stop. I want to be free from this sick obsession and live a free happy life and focus on the good things in life. Instead I let my body and the fixation on food decide what mood I\u2019m having every damn day. \nHow do I recover from this mess?",

I should focus on making that sensation LESS triggering\u2026honestly feel like I\u2019ll probably always have this issue.

My anorexia is brought on by depression, and when that thigh gap starts, my anxiety skyrockets. I become obsessively self-conscious, I realize I am too thin and hate it... the stress makes my appetite even worse...by this point, the thought of food is nauseating and thus the behavior ends up spiraling. I am not sure what support group to join because I don't feel I fit this support group. :( I am sorry for all of you struggling with this because I can only imagine how much harder it is to fight a illness that your mind is telling you is \"good\".",
