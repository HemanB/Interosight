      "body": "As someone who has been called skinny my whole life, even prior to my eating disorder, it definitely contributed to the development of my anorexia. As a kid and a teenager I constantly had people telling me I was skinny (not always meant as a compliment) but it resulted in me viewing myself as fat if I\u2019m not the skinniest person in the room because the only thing people ever said about my body was that I was skinny. Of course that\u2019s not the only reason for my eating disorder developing but it played an massive part in how I viewed my body growing up, and even now at 21 I still can\u2019t escape it. I\u2019m sure it sucks from your perspective and I can fully understand how that would hurt, but it sucks to have people assume things about you based on your body regardless of your weight.",
