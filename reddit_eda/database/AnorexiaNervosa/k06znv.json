  "selftext": "So my mom has massive anorexic tendencies but she's not anorexic. While I got diagnosed with anorexia a few weeks back (she doesn't know, just my dad), and I highly suspect I inherited it from her. The only difference is that hers remains hidden while mine blew up. \n\nNow, I decided to challenge myself to eating a banana cause I really really wanted to eat one and I wanted to beat the fear of fruits that I have. Because I, with all my heart, love fruits and know they're extremely healthy. \n\nAnyway, I grabbed the banana and sat next to her and she went like: \"be sure not to have more than two a day.\"\n\nMy hands were already shaking from having the banana, but I turned to her and asked why and SHE LEGIT SAID: Carbs. \n\nLike, mom, I'm in tears. Why did you have to say such a thing??? Of all times??? \n\nI felt like I was going to break down, I swear.",
