Don't comment on other people's looks, generally, unless they ask you specifically, and even then there's only so much you can say that is actually acceptable. \n\nThe problem is that our whole culture is built around shaming people who don't fit our ideals. Whether it's your grandparents or your parents commenting on your body, or strangers' bodies, or the paparazzi and media dragging celebrities for their perceived \"flaws\".\n\nYou have to be skinny, and athletic, feminine as a woman, masculine as a man. Anything outside of that is seen as undesirable. Everyone perpetuates that by teaching children, teaching their viewers, teaching their friends that it's acceptable to shame and comment, that it's the normal thing to do; they don't realize it's harmful. To them it's normal. Still doesn't excuse it, though.",
