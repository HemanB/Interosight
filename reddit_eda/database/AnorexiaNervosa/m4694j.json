  "selftext": "Like do any of you guys have this weird ED fueled thing with sex? Like I think one thing that caused my ED was hooking up with so many guys because I was so desperate to be loved my thought process was \u201cif I give them what they want they\u2019ll stay\u201d (spoiler alert- they didn\u2019t) but then that kinda morphed into me hating my body and seeing that guys only wanna use me for my body and they don\u2019t care about how I am as a person but now I\u2019m uncomfortable during sex because I\u2019m embarrassed of my body and I try not to do random one time hookups anymore. Like if I\u2019m hanging out with a guy I\u2019ll tell him I don\u2019t hook up on the first date. Like since my ED started my relationship with sex has changed. Does anyone else have a similar problem?",
