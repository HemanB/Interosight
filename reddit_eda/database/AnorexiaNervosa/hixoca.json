I feel like I can go a whole day without eating but if I eat once I can\u2019t stop. I hate this because if I decide I\u2019m going to eat healthily, I just binge.",

      "body": "I go through phases, like sometimes I\u2019m just so disinterested in eating and food is not appealing at all and during these times, my appetite is never aroused after eating something. But there are other phases I go through where I need to eat just to not pass out or to make it through class. It really sucks but during those times, my appetite is voracious after I eat and I really need to just drink water and suffer through it. I honestly think for me it\u2019s a stress response. If I\u2019m pretty stressed out about school or work my appetite is a force to be reckoned with. But I would just say drink a lot of water and try to not even think about wandering into the kitchen to just look at food. Try to keep yourseld busy!",

Your body is literally so damaged that it needs energy to repair itself. It's because of this that you'll probably want to binge a bit in the beginning but guess what: that's okay. If you honour that hunger, it eventually goes away and you'll be able to eat structured meals without being constantly ravenous. I promise you it's worth it.
