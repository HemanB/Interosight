Looking back it was extreamly obvious i was autistic but i was a people pleasing girl in the 90s and early 2000s so i went under the radar. A lot of my later food struggles stemmed from food aversions. So many foods gross me out or are inedible. I got diagnosed with AFRID around age 12. Then a lot of it stemmed from my mom. She was abusive and controlling and impossible to please. She controlled every aspect of my life and nothing was ever good enough. I wasn't ever good enough. She also made me sick on purpose when I was really young and only treated me kindly and lovingly when I was actually sick or went along with her stories about made up symptoms. She liked getting sympathy attention. I think i started restricting to feel a sense of control over something in my life. My mom often tried to feed me foods I just couldn't handle from AFRID/autism and I felt like I had no control over anything but aside from take me to the hospital to be force fed she couldn't make me eat. She did take me to the hospital and even 5150ed me. It was the right call but her motives weren't good. She loved how sick I was. So I believe my ed got worse because my mom treated me better than ever before when I was so thin you could see every bone in my body. You could even see my heart pumping in my chest at one point. I think she wanted me to die from it to get the sympathy from that. Because she stopped taking me to doctors and kind of encouraged my ed in later years. I was totally dependent on her too. \n\nGetting better in my late 20s was the biggest \"f you\" to her.",
