  "selftext": "Long vent: \nThey always leave food that has to be refrigerated out. \nAnd they use expired food in their cooking. I know it\u2019s technically safe to eat food after the best before date but I just can\u2019t stop thinking about it if I do eat something after the expired date. \nEveryone gets so angry and yells at me, telling me things like \u201cwell you\u2019ve lived this long with my cooking and you\u2019re not dead yet!\u201d\n\nThey also microwave non safe microwave plastic and styrofoam plates. I tell them they shouldn\u2019t do that but they do it anyway. \nThey reuse plastic bottles for water, which I think we\u2019re supposed to use the bpa safe containers. But if I tell them that they won\u2019t listen. \nThe water they bring from the store just doesn\u2019t taste right either; it leaves you with a dry mouth. \n\nThey also eat all of the food and leave me with nothing. My youngest sister is the worst. My mom bought a family chip sized bag and she\u2019s already scarfing it down. She never leaves me any snacks to eat because they\u2019re always gone in a day. \nI love this place but I can\u2019t wait to be on my own as eat at my own pace with food that have been properly cleaned of and taken care of. \n\nEven the eggs are expired now something I usually eat, and the bread smells too sour. \nWhenever there\u2019s nothing to eat I make an egg sandwich with mayo. \n\nJust a vent.",

      "body": "Oh my god! My partners grandparents are the same! And they think freezing food keeps it from expiring. It's like, yeah that keeps it longer but not forever. But they literally told me it keeps it fresh FOREVER! Last year, When I was helping them cook dinner, I realized I needed chicken, and she got a bag of frozen chicken out of the freezer that she packaged herself. And it had a date on it that she wrote. It was NINE YEARS OLD! Freezing things helps, but household freezers are not cold enough to preserve something like that for that long! And she got mad at me when I said it wasn't good anymore and I won't use it, giving me the whole \"freezer\" speech. Ultimately I threw it away. \n\n\nBut another time I needed pie crusts so I was gonna have my partner run to the store, but no no she handed me a pie crust from the freezer that had a date in the year 2013! First of all, freezing pie crust makes it gross, secondly I wasnt gonna use that freezer burned, poisonous mess! Again, she got upset. Again, last year..\n\n\nIt was so bad that my partners mother had to come over and scrub their fridge and frezer because the ice cubes coming out there were discolored and smelled like rot! And they used them and didn't get what was wrong. And one time when she was pregnant, she needed to eat something and was given a snack bar that expired in 2009. This was in 2013. Before she cleaned out their fridge. It made her so sick she threw up. \nWhy don't people understand that best by dates are there for a reason and food going bad is a serious issue and eating it can cause very real pronlems.\n\n\nLong rant, sorry. I feel your pain though.",

I have a theory it's because we never really had much money growing up but that's another issue. She'll keep food years passed their used by date, leave food our for days at a time before putting it away and specifically buys meat closer to its used by date because it's cheaper and freezes them. Growing up she's serve us frozen meals and food two years passed their used by date and the other day (I'm vegan so she doesn't go near my food thankfully) she served frozen enchiladas that had a used by date from 2018. \n    It physically makes me sick. When I had my wisdom teeth pulled a few weeks ago I had a breakdown and went through the cupboards and threw out everything that was too far passed its used by date. For which I got yelled at and now all the food is back where it was.\n\nAnd now I compulsively check used by dates, smell my food before using it. A lot of my issues with food stem from this specific issue of her serving me food like this.\n\nEdit: words bc I don't have my glasses on and probably should",
