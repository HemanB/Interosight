The truth is most likely you\u2019ll always deal with the dysmorphia and struggle with your relationship with food. The important thing is sustainability especially in those times where the dysphoria is strong. Maybe you skipped a meal, maybe you ate more than you intended to. You\u2019re still here, you\u2019re still important, most importantly your loved. Recovery is such a slippery slope because unlike drugs you can\u2019t quit starvation or BED the way you can with drugs. I recommend working towards body neutrality instead of body positivity, it\u2019s far easier to feel ok with yourself",
