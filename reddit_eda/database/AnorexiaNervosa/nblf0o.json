  "selftext": "i\u2019ve struggled with anorexia for almost 7 years now and since december 2020 it\u2019s been at an all time bad. i\u2019ve had long periods of getting bored of my eating disorder but this is the first time i\u2019m considering serious all in recovery. i\u2019m not quite at the line where anyone can just admit me to a hospital or anything but my therapists and doctors agree that when i\u2019m ready i should go for residential treatment. \n\ni\u2019m fucking terrified i really can\u2019t imagine my life without this and i\u2019m just scared. but yesterday i made a list of all the foods i\u2019m going to eat when i\u2019m ready and gave myself a lot of challenges. i need to makeup for all the foods and memories i missed because i\u2019ve been sick. i\u2019m terrified but also i\u2019m getting a little excited",

I did that the first time and nothing really (mentally) changed.\n\nHowever, now that I'm 1.5 years into my recovery journey, I can write the things that have been worth it. They are also the results of a long journey towards bettering myself as a person in general, so some things may not be tied to Anorexia recovery alone:\n\n* More energy and less brain-fog. No muscles cramping. Not feeling like dying or collapsing while simply laughing because you have not eaten in 3 days;\n* You have much more time and attention given to passions or even simple things you weren't able to focus on before because of Anorexia. You can finally think of pursuing (or getting back to) a hobby or taking care of your stuff and/or yourself, without allowing your mind to constantly obsess over food, body, exercise and similar things;\n* Food is demystified. It's not particularly bad or incredibly good. It's just a tasty fuel. You need it to survive, but you are also allowed to enjoy it without spending too much time on it. In my case, I've got even more into cooking and baking as a passion, completely ditching \"safe\" alternatives;\n* This is even more of a conscious choice: you have to start accepting and even liking your body. What has helped me, especially at the beginning, was taking a lot of selfies and pictures, in order to have an idea of what I objectively look like. Granted, I was losing weight (it's too complicated to write it here, but I was losing weight in a \"healthy\" way which actually triggered my recovery, funnily enough...);\n* You start dreading less and less going out. You start to love putting on pretty clothes that you \"had saved\" for when you truly would have reached your ultimate-UW (AKA never). I'm currently at the stage when 30-40% of the times I look at the mirror and tell myself, \"Wow, I actually look pretty\". This used to be 0% of times at my worst points. It's an impressive improvement for me;\n* Academically speaking, with less brain fog, your grades will improve. Your reflexes will better, too;\n* This is more of a self-improvement thing: you start seeing your worth, especially after realising it is not tied to your weight/body. And, as a consequence, you become more confident, at least in the way you tackle life. I've started being more assertive and standing my ground more. This has made me end a year-long friendship with someone extremely toxic (I was friend with this person because I wanted to help them, but they were dragging me down and making me miserable. They had nothing to do with Anorexia and the ED world, though). And, it will make you be more selective of the people you choose to interact with. You *can control* this side of your life, instead of focusing on food/body. I'm still shy/reserved, but I tolerate less crap;\n* Clearly depressive thoughts will start going away, while the ones that are not tied to your physical appearance will be much clearer, so that you can know how to deal with them (therapy, for example);\n* The urge to get back sometimes rears back in, but you need to power through and overcome it;\n\nReally, Anorexia has taken so much from me in the brief period it was acute (mid-2018 until late 2019). I'm sure there's more, but these are the things I've been able to experience so far.\n\nStay strong. This is a tough illness \u2764\u2764",
