  "selftext": "Today I cooked (two examples of today), and I\u2019m still so incredibly in disbelief that I finally eat full meals without overthinking it.\n\nDuring my eating disorder, that was always a thought for the future\u2026 something I believed I\u2019d never have again, that I\u2019d never be able to eat a whole meal again.\n\nBut I actually did it. Sometimes I still can\u2019t believe it\u2026 that\u2019s why I\u2019m sharing my joy here right now.\n ",
