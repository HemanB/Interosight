I recommend avoiding recovery content in TT, because the same tags are used in wltok: ed, wieiad, prorecovery, foodtok...\n\nTiktok algorithm is inmaculate. Any like, comment, tags, or even watching a whole video, gets registered into your personal data (that you can download if you're curious)\n\nSo you need to curate your fyp again. Block tags, search different videos you like, and interact with that other content **like crazy.** Everything will go back to normal eventually",

I remember realizing years into my ED how toxic and influential (in a negative way) those covers and stories had on me and how I looked at food/dealt with food etc. \n\nPLEASE delete all socials for the first 30 days of trying to gain some of YOU back, tiktok especially is absolutely terrible. It\u2019s why I literally ONLY comment on videos of cats/animals and horror film related things so my algorithm gives me very minimal triggers. \n\nPlease eat your sandwich, you deserve it!",

Video after video is about restricting and unhealthy weight loss, people body checking (unhealthily) and EVEN USING IT AS A WEIGHT DIARY!!! When you report the videos and accounts, TikTok does nothing and says it is not a violation. I had to delete it because it's becoming too much.",

Unfortunately, the algorithm seems to have more control over what we consume than we do at this point. The only solution is to METICULOUSLY choose \u201cnot interested\u201d when u see posts like that (still doesn\u2019t prevent it completely), or just delete social media. Honestly, it\u2019s hard, but after the first hump, being social media free has made my life so much better many times!",
