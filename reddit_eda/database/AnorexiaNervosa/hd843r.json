  "selftext": "i\u2019ve struggled with eating problems a couple years back before i truly broke the habit. eating too little soon became eating too much. as of recently i\u2019ve fallen into obsessing over every little thing i eat. i\u2019m falling back into old ed habits but one thing i\u2019ve realized is that when in this time of obsessing and restricting, i find myself urging a lot of other people around me to eat. a couple of them have had ed\u2019s in the past as well but i don\u2019t know why i want to make sure people to eat. i don\u2019t know if it\u2019s me being caring and wanting to make sure people eat, if seeing people in the act of eating is satisfying, or if seeing people eat a lot more than me is a nice thought. i\u2019m not too sure. does anyone else have this problem who struggles with an ED?",
