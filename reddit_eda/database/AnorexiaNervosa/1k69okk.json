I\u2019ve never been an active person at all\u2026 But I do have back problems so could probably rest more. I use my upper body damn near constantly. But \u201cexercise\u201d is sort of a loose term right? Idk. I\u2019m probably not making sense. I think I push myself to the limit in ways that aren\u2019t obvious.
