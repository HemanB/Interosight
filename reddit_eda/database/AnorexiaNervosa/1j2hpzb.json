I\u2019ve been in treatment before and I know I don\u2019t want to go back but a lot of the things I learned from that experience were really useful and i\u2019m able to implement them in my own way. I also have frequent doctors appointments to monitor the refeeding process and am on a waitlist for therapy. Other than that it\u2019s just a matter of pushing myself in ways I never have before and it\u2019s hard and scary but not as scary as the alternative to me. I want a better life than the one my ED has given me.",
