  "selftext": "After three months of being stuck in quasi-recovery, I've decided that I'm done with this. This ED has taken so much from me that I used to love and all I've got in return is months of bad memories clouded by brain fog. So, I've told one of my family members so the problem is officially out of my hands and this ED will no longer control me.\n\nI used to love biscuits and now they scare me, so I've brought a variety pack and I'm going to challenge myself to eat at least one per day regardless of anything else. I'm choosing biscuits over my ED.",
