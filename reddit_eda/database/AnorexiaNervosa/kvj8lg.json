  "selftext": "i feel like an imposter because of how easily i could eat food. i restrict every day and i usually just have one meal at the end. it\u2019s usually on the bigger side but still way under the recommended amount of calories for my height and weight. i eat that no problem. i just see how ana is portrayed in media with stick thin girls who can\u2019t even have food in their mouths or swallow, and it makes me feel like i\u2019m faking this. does anyone have any signs that made them realize it\u2019s real? i know i can\u2019t know for sure unless i go get diagnosed but i want to know other peoples experiences and what made them know. i especially want to hear from people who are not underweight or aren\u2019t the \u201cposter child\u201d for ana",

Let\u2019s compare it to cancer, for example, maybe you start feeling bad but you don\u2019t want to say anything about it or do anything about it because you\u2019re just avoiding the fact that you could be sick and need help, and maybe when you do realise it\u2019s something serious it\u2019s too late and nothing can stop your condition from getting worse. But if you do realise there\u2019s something wrong with you and you get help on time, maybe it doesn\u2019t even look like you\u2019re sick but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not.",

      "body": "my personal opinion is that how you feel about eating directly correlates to your mental status and circumstances surrounding your current stage in this disorder. for example I have struggled with this for nearly 20 years and there were times where I could eat specific foods and also periods where sitting at a table with a meal staring back at me would trigger an extreme anxiety attack and I would cry the entire time out of fear and frustration that I could not bring myself to face eating. part of this had to do with the circumstance, when I was free to exercise constantly and eat selectively I was extremely sick but the conditions were within my control so my \u201cmeals\u201d felt more manageable. When I was forced to eat under supervision and refused the freedom to even walk, meals were more terrifying than the idea of letting spiders crawl all over me. I had allowed me ed to distort my thoughts on food so much that eating felt equally as scary to me as asking someone to do the one thing they fear the most. (Imagine you\u2019re afraid of heights and forced you to go base-jumping) it doesn\u2019t matter what the distortion is or how you look, Ana is a mental disorder that prevents you from having a healthy relationship with food regardless of your size and shape. I was equally as sick, if not more sick when I had the freedom to exercise and eat on my terms than when I was anxiety filled at a table. It fully depended on how much control over my life I had and when all of that was taken away from me it made eating 1000 times harder. Whatever you feel, don\u2019t allow that to fuel your ed into making you sicker. You are valid and you don\u2019t need to be knocking on deaths door to feel adequate. Being that sick sucks and it should never be glorified. I wish you well!",
