  "selftext": "It\u2019s funny how no one in my life shows any concern. I have no friends in real life. I guess I have many acquaintances via social media, but none of that is real. Well I\u2019ve been relapsing hard the last several months and I guess I\u2019ve lost weight. I thought I maintained but I don\u2019t know since I don\u2019t weigh myself. No one in my physical reality shows any concern so it makes me feel like my Ed isn\u2019t that bad. Then I post things on IG and all of a sudden I have two \u201cfriends\u201d reach out to me with concern about my weight loss. No body gives a flying fuck about me, until weight loss is in the picture. That\u2019s funny, because I remember when I was a healthy bmi, and my Ed was in such a horrible place, purging, over exercising, self harming, but no one cared then because I looked normal. my family all lives far away and they have no idea how sick I am. And no one around me seems to care either. Im severely depressed and going through some sort of depressive episode. Life seems pointless ",

They comment frequently on how much weight Ive lost and how thin I am (I was overweight and now quite a bit under), but I brush them off and tbh I tell them I'm OK and at a healthy weight just at the very lower end of it. I'm not sure if they believe it as my daughter sort of sarcastically makes comments and says things. However, I'm certain no one has the slightest idea about me ED. They live closely, and when they are around for visits, which usually mean meals, I try not to restrict or mainly put safe foods on my plate to hide, so it's my fault. Even my husband doesn't call me out on it. He is also the only person who hasn't mentioned my weight loss once. It's isolating, to be sure, but I'm not sure I'm ready to face it yet and telling them I would be facing it. I think I want someone to notice to make me face it, like when I was an alcoholic 15 years ago, and my parents noticed and forced me to confront it when I wouldn't. Sorry, I didn't mean to hijack your post, but explain my situation to ask if that is in anyway how you feel? If so you are not alone",

My mom told me, \"Every other woman has struggled with food at some point. You're not special. You just have to learn to deal with it like the rest of us.\"\n\nSo, I put myself on a very restrictive meal plan because that's the only way I knew how to stop. After I started rapidly losing weight, suddenly, my mom pretended to be all concerned, like, \"If you don't gain weight, I'm going to force you into residential!\" Absolutely kills me. I swear she just doesn't want me to be skinny \ud83d\ude12",

I\u2019m happy being underweight and anorexic compared to how I felt back then. So if someone were to comment on my body if I gain a few lbs, game over. I would have a fuckkng nervous breakdown",

Someone will always be taller and someone else shorter, and people talking about it is fucking stupid but they do, doesn't make one better than the other regardless of opinion. It helps a little bit personally or I spiral, it helps hold that feeling back a bit",
