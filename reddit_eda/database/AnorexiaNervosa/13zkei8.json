  "selftext": "I\u2019ve always wondered how people with ana make it when they\u2019re eating very few calories. Do their organs not shut down? I suffered with an eating disorder for a few years and I am recovered now, but I never struggled with severe anorexia. Does the body only begin to cannibalize the organs after all of their fat storage is gone? What is the process?",

      "body": "You do start to die.  Even if you are still chubby.  As it has been explained to my by doctors and dieticians, your body only really has two stages of metabolism.  When you eat too little and are starving, you are starving.  There isn't easy starving or less starving, it is starving to death as you start to die.\n\nWhen you are starving your body no longer has enough energy, even if it is in a coma, even if it consumes as much of your body fat a day that it possibly can.  But your heart MUST beat. That is all your body knows.  So it starts killing anything it can to feed your blood and your heart.  It eats your kidney, your brain, your liver, your bones, even your heart.  It takes anything it can to make sure your heart is still beating in the morning. In reality, what starts to give out first depends a lot on what nutrients you are most devoid of.  But you are starving to death.  \n\nIt's an emergency measure, it can't last forever.  It is like when a plane depressurizes spontaneously and the masks drop down.  It isn't an endless supply of less convenient oxygen.  It's a small supply to give the pilot ten minutes to drop the plane to below a safe altitude where people will hopefully be able to breathe enough to not sustain brain damage.  Your body does everything it can to keep you going because we are animals. Hopefully if it can just get you over that mountain and into that valley, there will be an apple tree or a dead antelope or a pile of edible mushrooms something.\n\nSome people feel better, like they have unlimited energy.  Some people feel as if they are on their deathbed, a walking corpse slowly phasing through the mesh of the world till she dissappears.  Most people I know ping pong between the two. The voice in your head gets louder, you are still surviving still pushing forward, deeper, harder.  You don't feel hungry and when you do, you hogtie it like a captured animal, you tame it.  It becomes a vicious spiral.  People ask you to get help but you are finally so close to making a difference, to being small enough or invisible enough or real enough, to have earned whatever you have spent your whole life feeling like you weren't even worthy of living for.\n\nAnd then it cuts deep.  Your body is different, weight always comes off weird when starving, so you look alien at any BMI, your breasts gone, muscles gone, hair thinning, and then... Maybe you have back pain and your urine is dark or you start having heart fluttering and chest pain.  You don't know what to do about it what to make of it because you haven't had a clear thought in months that wasn't just shame. It takes you longer than you would expect, sometimes days, sometimes weeks, but you come to understand you are dying. You are no longer trading just your relationships and joy and energy and passion over in exchange for the whispers that promise you value, belonging, and control, you are trading your life.\n\nThat is when a lot of people seek help.  But that point can come at any weight. When I was a teenager I got help before that point and I was quite underweight.  My relapse 10 years later, I hit that point as my heart started to fail crossing from obese to overweight. And treatment is still reletively the same because whether someone is fat or not, they need to learn not to be so scared of being fat that their fear controls them.  They have to be able to live in their skin and not panic regardless of where there is fat on their body.\n\nYou didn't ask about this part, but the unfortunate reality of the body just knowing starving and not starving is that stabilizing can be super hard.  When you start eating again the body expects the organs to function normally.  It starts indescriminately balancing your nutrients across your body again, but your nutrient starved organs are already in a massive deficit and begin to starve even more.  This is called Refeeding Syndrome and can also kill you.  In order to avoid it, food has to be titrated back up, allowing nutrient levels to slowly rise along with metabolism, so that when metabolic recovery occurs, the organs can take it.\n\nBecause of these factors, Anorexia is the second deadliest mental illness, behind only opiate use disorder.  We can and do die, and even if we don't, at some point we have to emotionally contend with having spent months to years slowly dying.\n\nHope this helps a bit.  It is long, but like I wanted to try to capture why it is more complicated than just not eating and subsequently just eating again. I have survived rape, severe child abuse, disability, and homelessness and it is Anorexia that has left me broken and sobbing, rending my soul more times than I can count.\n\nETA:  I did some further research[further research ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2440847/) on Refeeding Syndrome and it is definitely complicated but along the lines of what I describe. There are multiple key nutrients that can be incredibly low in anorexia patients.  Phosphorus and magnesium being two big ones and the spike in metabolism does cause a redistribution of them in the body. Basically when your metabolism kicks back in your body drives up it's insulin production among other things.  It starts trying to meet a higher energy demand by metabolizing food and fat.  Those chemical reactions both require many electrolytes and other nutrients.  Because the body has been draining its nutrient supplies for so long, it can't sustain the reaction and starts dipping into core stores in ways that are dangerous.  A very small portion of people with anorexia experience refeeding syndrome, but that portion is much higher for those given formula to stabilize during recovery.  Many formulas have since been adjusted to add these nutrients in, but there is still a danger.   Hopefully this helps clarify things for some people.\n\nAs to the other things I have said, there is actually a dietitian in this thread under me who has a super incredible explanation of how all these internal mechanics work and how we build up damage in our bodies from malnutrition.

That said, most anorexics are not eating as little as stereotypes would lead you to believe. But also, anorexics die all the time. Most anorexics I know, though, go through phases of semi-recovery, then phases of using behaviors really severely, then back. People with very severe anorexia will not be functioning normally, if you are restricting very low for more than a few months you will start to have very severe side effects, that\u2019s when people end up in treatment; for many this is a cycle that will repeat for years. For people with very severe anorexia they may get so sick they are admitted involuntarily, get to a discharge weight, and then within a year or two be back in treatment, until they die. It happens.",

          "body": "You do start to die.  Even if you are still chubby.  As it has been explained to my by doctors and dieticians, your body only really has two stages of metabolism.  When you eat too little and are starving, you are starving.  There isn't easy starving or less starving, it is starving to death as you start to die.\n\nWhen you are starving your body no longer has enough energy, even if it is in a coma, even if it consumes as much of your body fat a day that it possibly can.  But your heart MUST beat. That is all your body knows.  So it starts killing anything it can to feed your blood and your heart.  It eats your kidney, your brain, your liver, your bones, even your heart.  It takes anything it can to make sure your heart is still beating in the morning. In reality, what starts to give out first depends a lot on what nutrients you are most devoid of.  But you are starving to death.  \n\nIt's an emergency measure, it can't last forever.  It is like when a plane depressurizes spontaneously and the masks drop down.  It isn't an endless supply of less convenient oxygen.  It's a small supply to give the pilot ten minutes to drop the plane to below a safe altitude where people will hopefully be able to breathe enough to not sustain brain damage.  Your body does everything it can to keep you going because we are animals. Hopefully if it can just get you over that mountain and into that valley, there will be an apple tree or a dead antelope or a pile of edible mushrooms something.\n\nSome people feel better, like they have unlimited energy.  Some people feel as if they are on their deathbed, a walking corpse slowly phasing through the mesh of the world till she dissappears.  Most people I know ping pong between the two. The voice in your head gets louder, you are still surviving still pushing forward, deeper, harder.  You don't feel hungry and when you do, you hogtie it like a captured animal, you tame it.  It becomes a vicious spiral.  People ask you to get help but you are finally so close to making a difference, to being small enough or invisible enough or real enough, to have earned whatever you have spent your whole life feeling like you weren't even worthy of living for.\n\nAnd then it cuts deep.  Your body is different, weight always comes off weird when starving, so you look alien at any BMI, your breasts gone, muscles gone, hair thinning, and then... Maybe you have back pain and your urine is dark or you start having heart fluttering and chest pain.  You don't know what to do about it what to make of it because you haven't had a clear thought in months that wasn't just shame. It takes you longer than you would expect, sometimes days, sometimes weeks, but you come to understand you are dying. You are no longer trading just your relationships and joy and energy and passion over in exchange for the whispers that promise you value, belonging, and control, you are trading your life.\n\nThat is when a lot of people seek help.  But that point can come at any weight. When I was a teenager I got help before that point and I was quite underweight.  My relapse 10 years later, I hit that point as my heart started to fail crossing from obese to overweight. And treatment is still reletively the same because whether someone is fat or not, they need to learn not to be so scared of being fat that their fear controls them.  They have to be able to live in their skin and not panic regardless of where there is fat on their body.\n\nYou didn't ask about this part, but the unfortunate reality of the body just knowing starving and not starving is that stabilizing can be super hard.  When you start eating again the body expects the organs to function normally.  It starts indescriminately balancing your nutrients across your body again, but your nutrient starved organs are already in a massive deficit and begin to starve even more.  This is called Refeeding Syndrome and can also kill you.  In order to avoid it, food has to be titrated back up, allowing nutrient levels to slowly rise along with metabolism, so that when metabolic recovery occurs, the organs can take it.\n\nBecause of these factors, Anorexia is the second deadliest mental illness, behind only opiate use disorder.  We can and do die, and even if we don't, at some point we have to emotionally contend with having spent months to years slowly dying.\n\nHope this helps a bit.  It is long, but like I wanted to try to capture why it is more complicated than just not eating and subsequently just eating again. I have survived rape, severe child abuse, disability, and homelessness and it is Anorexia that has left me broken and sobbing, rending my soul more times than I can count.\n\nETA:  I did some further research[further research ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2440847/) on Refeeding Syndrome and it is definitely complicated but along the lines of what I describe. There are multiple key nutrients that can be incredibly low in anorexia patients.  Phosphorus and magnesium being two big ones and the spike in metabolism does cause a redistribution of them in the body. Basically when your metabolism kicks back in your body drives up it's insulin production among other things.  It starts trying to meet a higher energy demand by metabolizing food and fat.  Those chemical reactions both require many electrolytes and other nutrients.  Because the body has been draining its nutrient supplies for so long, it can't sustain the reaction and starts dipping into core stores in ways that are dangerous.  A very small portion of people with anorexia experience refeeding syndrome, but that portion is much higher for those given formula to stabilize during recovery.  Many formulas have since been adjusted to add these nutrients in, but there is still a danger.   Hopefully this helps clarify things for some people.\n\nAs to the other things I have said, there is actually a dietitian in this thread under me who has a super incredible explanation of how all these internal mechanics work and how we build up damage in our bodies from malnutrition. I highly suggest reading their comment if you want to learn more.",

When I began recovery, it wasn\u2019t much of a process. I simply started eating normally again after years, and this meant greasy and unhealthy food sometimes. I\u2019m wondering why I didn\u2019t experience refeeding syndrome even though I didn\u2019t titrate back up. Does everyone who faces eating disorders for a long time experience it? Additionally, you said something along the lines of \u201cstarving is just as dangerous at any weight\u201d and I\u2019ve wondered about this, always being slightly above average weight. Does the body not burn in order, like, does it not always start with fat storage, go to muscle, and then organs? It can begin anywhere when it\u2019s starving? is this why it\u2019s just as dangerous at any weight? Because you\u2019re burning fat, muscle, and organs, and you\u2019re depriving your body of nutrients?",

A very small portion of people with anorexia experience refeeding syndrome, but that portion is much higher for those given formula to stabilize during recovery.  Many formulas have since been adjusted to add these nutrients in, but there is still a danger.

When you eat too little and are starving, you are starving.  There isn't easy starving or less starving, it is starving to death as you start to die.\n\nWhen you are starving your body no longer has enough energy, even if it is in a coma, even if it consumes as much of your body fat a day that it possibly can.  But your heart MUST beat. That is all your body knows.  So it starts killing anything it can to feed your blood and your heart.  It eats your kidney, your brain, your liver, your bones, even your heart.  It takes anything it can to make sure your heart is still beating in the morning. In reality, what starts to give out first depends a lot on what nutrients you are most devoid of.  But you are starving to death.  \n\nIt's an emergency measure, it can't last forever.  It is like when a plane depressurizes spontaneously and the masks drop down.  It isn't an endless supply of less convenient oxygen.  It's a small supply to give the pilot ten minutes to drop the plane to below a safe altitude where people will hopefully be able to breathe enough to not sustain brain damage.  Your body does everything it can to keep you going because we are animals. Hopefully if it can just get you over that mountain and into that valley, there will be an apple tree or a dead antelope or a pile of edible mushrooms something.\n\nSome people feel better, like they have unlimited energy.  Some people feel as if they are on their deathbed, a walking corpse slowly phasing through the mesh of the world till she dissappears.  Most people I know ping pong between the two. The voice in your head gets louder, you are still surviving still pushing forward, deeper, harder.  You don't feel hungry and when you do, you hogtie it like a captured animal, you tame it.  It becomes a vicious spiral.  People ask you to get help but you are finally so close to making a difference, to being small enough or invisible enough or real enough, to have earned whatever you have spent your whole life feeling like you weren't even worthy of living for.\n\nAnd then it cuts deep.  Your body is different, weight always comes off weird when starving, so you look alien at any BMI, your breasts gone, muscles gone, hair thinning, and then... Maybe you have back pain and your urine is dark or you start having heart fluttering and chest pain.  You don't know what to do about it what to make of it because you haven't had a clear thought in months that wasn't just shame. It takes you longer than you would expect, sometimes days, sometimes weeks, but you come to understand you are dying. You are no longer trading just your relationships and joy and energy and passion over in exchange for the whispers that promise you value, belonging, and control, you are trading your life.\n\nThat is when a lot of people seek help.  But that point can come at any weight. When I was a teenager I got help before that point and I was quite underweight.  My relapse 10 years later, I hit that point as my heart started to fail crossing from obese to overweight. And treatment is still reletively the same because whether someone is fat or not, they need to learn not to be so scared of being fat that their fear controls them.  They have to be able to live in their skin and not panic regardless of where there is fat on their body.\n\nYou didn't ask about this part, but the unfortunate reality of the body just knowing starving and not starving is that stabilizing can be super hard.  When you start eating again the body expects the organs to function normally.  It starts indescriminately balancing your nutrients across your body again, but your nutrient starved organs are already in a massive deficit and begin to starve even more.  This is called Refeeding Syndrome and can also kill you.  In order to avoid it, food has to be titrated back up, allowing nutrient levels to slowly rise along with metabolism, so that when metabolic recovery occurs, the organs can take it.\n\nBecause of these factors, Anorexia is the second deadliest mental illness, behind only opiate use disorder.

          "body": "You do start to die.  Even if you are still chubby.  As it has been explained to my by doctors and dieticians, your body only really has two stages of metabolism.  When you eat too little and are starving, you are starving.  There isn't easy starving or less starving, it is starving to death as you start to die.\n\nWhen you are starving your body no longer has enough energy, even if it is in a coma, even if it consumes as much of your body fat a day that it possibly can.  But your heart MUST beat. That is all your body knows.  So it starts killing anything it can to feed your blood and your heart.  It eats your kidney, your brain, your liver, your bones, even your heart.  It takes anything it can to make sure your heart is still beating in the morning. In reality, what starts to give out first depends a lot on what nutrients you are most devoid of.  But you are starving to death.  \n\nIt's an emergency measure, it can't last forever.  It is like when a plane depressurizes spontaneously and the masks drop down.  It isn't an endless supply of less convenient oxygen.  It's a small supply to give the pilot ten minutes to drop the plane to below a safe altitude where people will hopefully be able to breathe enough to not sustain brain damage.  Your body does everything it can to keep you going because we are animals. Hopefully if it can just get you over that mountain and into that valley, there will be an apple tree or a dead antelope or a pile of edible mushrooms something.\n\nSome people feel better, like they have unlimited energy.  Some people feel as if they are on their deathbed, a walking corpse slowly phasing through the mesh of the world till she dissappears.  Most people I know ping pong between the two. The voice in your head gets louder, you are still surviving still pushing forward, deeper, harder.  You don't feel hungry and when you do, you hogtie it like a captured animal, you tame it.  It becomes a vicious spiral.  People ask you to get help but you are finally so close to making a difference, to being small enough or invisible enough or real enough, to have earned whatever you have spent your whole life feeling like you weren't even worthy of living for.\n\nAnd then it cuts deep.  Your body is different, weight always comes off weird when starving, so you look alien at any BMI, your breasts gone, muscles gone, hair thinning, and then... Maybe you have back pain and your urine is dark or you start having heart fluttering and chest pain.  You don't know what to do about it what to make of it because you haven't had a clear thought in months that wasn't just shame. It takes you longer than you would expect, sometimes days, sometimes weeks, but you come to understand you are dying. You are no longer trading just your relationships and joy and energy and passion over in exchange for the whispers that promise you value, belonging, and control, you are trading your life.\n\nThat is when a lot of people seek help.  But that point can come at any weight. When I was a teenager I got help before that point and I was quite underweight.  My relapse 10 years later, I hit that point as my heart started to fail crossing from obese to overweight. And treatment is still reletively the same because whether someone is fat or not, they need to learn not to be so scared of being fat that their fear controls them.  They have to be able to live in their skin and not panic regardless of where there is fat on their body.\n\nYou didn't ask about this part, but the unfortunate reality of the body just knowing starving and not starving is that stabilizing can be super hard.  When you start eating again the body expects the organs to function normally.  It starts indescriminately balancing your nutrients across your body again, but your nutrient starved organs are already in a massive deficit and begin to starve even more.  This is called Refeeding Syndrome and can also kill you.  In order to avoid it, food has to be titrated back up, allowing nutrient levels to slowly rise along with metabolism, so that when metabolic recovery occurs, the organs can take it.\n\nBecause of these factors, Anorexia is the second deadliest mental illness, behind only opiate use disorder.  We can and do die, and even if we don't, at some point we have to emotionally contend with having spent months to years slowly dying.\n\nHope this helps a bit.  It is long, but like I wanted to try to capture why it is more complicated than just not eating and subsequently just eating again. I have survived rape, severe child abuse, disability, and homelessness and it is Anorexia that has left me broken and sobbing, rending my soul more times than I can count.\n\nETA:  I did some further research[further research ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2440847/) on Refeeding Syndrome and it is definitely complicated but along the lines of what I describe. There are multiple key nutrients that can be incredibly low in anorexia patients.  Phosphorus and magnesium being two big ones and the spike in metabolism does cause a redistribution of them in the body. Basically when your metabolism kicks back in your body drives up it's insulin production among other things.  It starts trying to meet a higher energy demand by metabolizing food and fat.  Those chemical reactions both require many electrolytes and other nutrients.  Because the body has been draining its nutrient supplies for so long, it can't sustain the reaction and starts dipping into core stores in ways that are dangerous.  A very small portion of people with anorexia experience refeeding syndrome, but that portion is much higher for those given formula to stabilize during recovery.  Many formulas have since been adjusted to add these nutrients in, but there is still a danger.   Hopefully this helps clarify things for some people.\n\nAs to the other things I have said, there is actually a dietitian in this thread under me who has a super incredible explanation of how all these internal mechanics work and how we build up damage in our bodies from malnutrition.

I have survived rape, severe child abuse, disability, and homelessness and it is Anorexia that has left me broken and sobbing, rending my soul more times than I can count.\n\nETA:  I did some further research[further research ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2440847/) on Refeeding Syndrome and it is definitely complicated but along the lines of what I describe. There are multiple key nutrients that can be incredibly low in anorexia patients.  Phosphorus and magnesium being two big ones and the spike in metabolism does cause a redistribution of them in the body. Basically when your metabolism kicks back in your body drives up it's insulin production among other things.  It starts trying to meet a higher energy demand by metabolizing food and fat.  Those chemical reactions both require many electrolytes and other nutrients.  Because the body has been draining its nutrient supplies for so long, it can't sustain the reaction and starts dipping into core stores in ways that are dangerous.  A very small portion of people with anorexia experience refeeding syndrome, but that portion is much higher for those given formula to stabilize during recovery.  Many formulas have since been adjusted to add these nutrients in, but there is still a danger.   Hopefully this helps clarify things for some people.\n\nAs to the other things I have said, there is actually a dietitian in this thread under me who has a super incredible explanation of how all these internal mechanics work and how we build up damage in our bodies from malnutrition. I highly suggest reading their comment if you want to learn more.",

          "body": "You do start to die.  Even if you are still chubby.  As it has been explained to my by doctors and dieticians, your body only really has two stages of metabolism.  When you eat too little and are starving, you are starving.  There isn't easy starving or less starving, it is starving to death as you start to die.\n\nWhen you are starving your body no longer has enough energy, even if it is in a coma, even if it consumes as much of your body fat a day that it possibly can.  But your heart MUST beat. That is all your body knows.  So it starts killing anything it can to feed your blood and your heart.  It eats your kidney, your brain, your liver, your bones, even your heart.  It takes anything it can to make sure your heart is still beating in the morning. In reality, what starts to give out first depends a lot on what nutrients you are most devoid of.  But you are starving to death.  \n\nIt's an emergency measure, it can't last forever.  It is like when a plane depressurizes spontaneously and the masks drop down.  It isn't an endless supply of less convenient oxygen.  It's a small supply to give the pilot ten minutes to drop the plane to below a safe altitude where people will hopefully be able to breathe enough to not sustain brain damage.  Your body does everything it can to keep you going because we are animals. Hopefully if it can just get you over that mountain and into that valley, there will be an apple tree or a dead antelope or a pile of edible mushrooms something.\n\nSome people feel better, like they have unlimited energy.  Some people feel as if they are on their deathbed, a walking corpse slowly phasing through the mesh of the world till she dissappears.  Most people I know ping pong between the two. The voice in your head gets louder, you are still surviving still pushing forward, deeper, harder.  You don't feel hungry and when you do, you hogtie it like a captured animal, you tame it.  It becomes a vicious spiral.  People ask you to get help but you are finally so close to making a difference, to being small enough or invisible enough or real enough, to have earned whatever you have spent your whole life feeling like you weren't even worthy of living for.\n\nAnd then it cuts deep.  Your body is different, weight always comes off weird when starving, so you look alien at any BMI, your breasts gone, muscles gone, hair thinning, and then... Maybe you have back pain and your urine is dark or you start having heart fluttering and chest pain.  You don't know what to do about it what to make of it because you haven't had a clear thought in months that wasn't just shame. It takes you longer than you would expect, sometimes days, sometimes weeks, but you come to understand you are dying. You are no longer trading just your relationships and joy and energy and passion over in exchange for the whispers that promise you value, belonging, and control, you are trading your life.\n\nThat is when a lot of people seek help.  But that point can come at any weight. When I was a teenager I got help before that point and I was quite underweight.  My relapse 10 years later, I hit that point as my heart started to fail crossing from obese to overweight. And treatment is still reletively the same because whether someone is fat or not, they need to learn not to be so scared of being fat that their fear controls them.  They have to be able to live in their skin and not panic regardless of where there is fat on their body.\n\nYou didn't ask about this part, but the unfortunate reality of the body just knowing starving and not starving is that stabilizing can be super hard.  When you start eating again the body expects the organs to function normally.  It starts indescriminately balancing your nutrients across your body again, but your nutrient starved organs are already in a massive deficit and begin to starve even more.  This is called Refeeding Syndrome and can also kill you.  In order to avoid it, food has to be titrated back up, allowing nutrient levels to slowly rise along with metabolism, so that when metabolic recovery occurs, the organs can take it.\n\nBecause of these factors, Anorexia is the second deadliest mental illness, behind only opiate use disorder.  We can and do die, and even if we don't, at some point we have to emotionally contend with having spent months to years slowly dying.\n\nHope this helps a bit.

It is like when a plane depressurizes spontaneously and the masks drop down.  It isn't an endless supply of less convenient oxygen.  It's a small supply to give the pilot ten minutes to drop the plane to below a safe altitude where people will hopefully be able to breathe enough to not sustain brain damage.

      "body": "I\u2019ve just learned if refeeding syndrome and I am afraid like no other time. Not even being dx with MS. How do you avoid this? Do you need to work with someone? If so who? I was going to buckle down ask yet again for an appetite stimulant and hopefully start eating every single day. Since I\u2019m in pain a lot from MS, I sleep a lot. I miss eating. Drinking water. It complicated and I don\u2019t need to rattle on about it. My private primary has known for a few years now (this time, and a few years a few years before this time) that I struggle to eat, I\u2019m not hungry. I am underweight, not hugely, but I want 10 pounds on me and have been down much lower. She just says meal plan. If I could do that I wouldn\u2019t have this issue. I don\u2019t know who to turn to for help. I desperately need help. I really thought, well I will ask my old psychiatrist for the antipsychotic that makes you hungry (I forgot name right now). He isn\u2019t a therapist on disordered eating. But I have been on it before for anxiety and didn\u2019t know it would make me so uncomfortable hungry. As in he gave me a small amount to sleep. But it made me so hungry I couldn\u2019t sleep\u2014I would have to eat and eat\u2014abs I never felt full until it wore off. I did not have an issue with eating at that time so we stopped it. But I thought I could ask him for it again so I can have an appetite that breaks through all the pain I am in and the depression from basically being bedbound from pain (MS). \n\nMy bloodwork for last few years comes back weird abs my primary says oh must be malnutrition. But does nothing to help. I reached out about being afraid I\u2019m dehydrated all the time and she said as long as I ate abs just drank water I didn\u2019t need anything else to rehydrate. But I\u2019m not eating and I don\u2019t drink as much water as I should because again I\u2019m asleep. She is a private 24/7 doctor I have stayed with when she stopped taking insurance abs went private. But she is not helping. Not really. It is like she just doesn\u2019t understand that all these things are real. My blood work says so. \n\nSo now what do I do? I\u2019m terrified to start just normal eating again because of syndrome. Plus I feel sick and full super fast\u2014stomach shrunk? I don\u2019t know why. I\u2019m afraid. I just fall asleep and don\u2019t realize it. I hurt. My dad just died that threw me off big time too. I\u2019m very aware of death. \n\nI don\u2019t want to die. I want to be normal again. I do have injuries that disabled me beyond MS. That sent me into this latest spiral almost 3 years ago. I need that addressed to, mostly pain. And the trauma of how it happened. But I want to be me again. I want to be a mom to my darling child again. She was barely 5 when those injuries happened and just turned 8. I want to be with her not in bed. I want to eat with her. I wish I had her appetite! She is growing always and is very tall, I am very short. I watch her and I am so ashamed I can\u2019t eat like her, that I don\u2019t join her when she wants me to sit and eat with her. I do not. I\u2019m in bed.  I\u2019m so ashamed. I don\u2019t want to die. \n\nBut now if I start to eat again I can sue just from eating? I read this earlier tonight on Mayo by accident. I had no idea. \n\nCan you or anyone please tell me how to put my nutrition in order again? Can I die if I do this alone? I would love local resources, but I\u2019m afraid to out myself where I live. Someone please, what do I do? \n\nI\u2019m so terrified of Covid because I am immune compromised. I could never ever see myself in patient. I know that sounds like I\u2019m a freak\u2014-but it is a huge fear of mine. Not dying of Covid, of becoming more disabled. That limits my options plus I have zero support for my child on nights my husband works. It is one night out of house, and one in house. I have no support for her. None. He does everything except those two nights. But we have no one not one friend or family member who can help cover that night he teaches in city. I am so trapped by fear. I am desperately seeking help. I need to feel safe in my own body. I never have, and now even less so, how is that even  possible? \n\nHelp please. Where and who can help me? What is first step? If I start eating more  will this syndrome happen? It is terrifying.",

I have survived rape, severe child abuse, disability, and homelessness and it is Anorexia that has left me broken and sobbing, rending my soul more times than I can count.\n\nETA:  I did some further research[further research ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2440847/) on Refeeding Syndrome and it is definitely complicated but along the lines of what I describe. There are multiple key nutrients that can be incredibly low in anorexia patients.  Phosphorus and magnesium being two big ones and the spike in metabolism does cause a redistribution of them in the body. Basically when your metabolism kicks back in your body drives up it's insulin production among other things.  It starts trying to meet a higher energy demand by metabolizing food and fat.  Those chemical reactions both require many electrolytes and other nutrients.  Because the body has been draining its nutrient supplies for so long, it can't sustain the reaction and starts dipping into core stores in ways that are dangerous.  A very small portion of people with anorexia experience refeeding syndrome, but that portion is much higher for those given formula to stabilize during recovery.  Many formulas have since been adjusted to add these nutrients in, but there is still a danger.   Hopefully this helps clarify things for some people.\n\nAs to the other things I have said, there is actually a dietitian in this thread under me who has a super incredible explanation of how all these internal mechanics work and how we build up damage in our bodies from malnutrition. I highly suggest reading their comment if you want to learn more.",

It eats your kidney, your brain, your liver, your bones, even your heart.  It takes anything it can to make sure your heart is still beating in the morning.

It is like when a plane depressurizes spontaneously and the masks drop down.  It isn't an endless supply of less convenient oxygen.  It's a small supply to give the pilot ten minutes to drop the plane to below a safe altitude where people will hopefully be able to breathe enough to not sustain brain damage.

It becomes a vicious spiral.  People ask you to get help but you are finally so close to making a difference, to being small enough or invisible enough or real enough, to have earned whatever you have spent your whole life feeling like you weren't even worthy of living for.\n\nAnd then it cuts deep.  Your body is different, weight always comes off weird when starving, so you look alien at any BMI, your breasts gone, muscles gone, hair thinning, and then... Maybe you have back pain and your urine is dark or you start having heart fluttering and chest pain.  You don't know what to do about it what to make of it because you haven't had a clear thought in months that wasn't just shame. It takes you longer than you would expect, sometimes days, sometimes weeks, but you come to understand you are dying. You are no longer trading just your relationships and joy and energy and passion over in exchange for the whispers that promise you value, belonging, and control, you are trading your life.\n\nThat is when a lot of people seek help.

This is called Refeeding Syndrome and can also kill you.  In order to avoid it, food has to be titrated back up, allowing nutrient levels to slowly rise along with metabolism, so that when metabolic recovery occurs, the organs can take it.\n\nBecause of these factors, Anorexia is the second deadliest mental illness, behind only opiate use disorder.  We can and do die, and even if we don't, at some point we have to emotionally contend with having spent months to years slowly dying.\n\nHope this helps a bit.

There are multiple key nutrients that can be incredibly low in anorexia patients.  Phosphorus and magnesium being two big ones and the spike in metabolism does cause a redistribution of them in the body. Basically when your metabolism kicks back in your body drives up it's insulin production among other things.  It starts trying to meet a higher energy demand by metabolizing food and fat.

Because the body has been draining its nutrient supplies for so long, it can't sustain the reaction and starts dipping into core stores in ways that are dangerous.  A very small portion of people with anorexia experience refeeding syndrome, but that portion is much higher for those given formula to stabilize during recovery.  Many formulas have since been adjusted to add these nutrients in, but there is still a danger.   Hopefully this helps clarify things for some people.\n\nAs to the other things I have said, there is actually a dietitian in this thread under me who has a super incredible explanation of how all these internal mechanics work and how we build up damage in our bodies from malnutrition.

This is perfectly normal, as your body is a powerful self-repairing machine. All it needs is food and rest, and you are back to restored the next day.\n\nThis is why starving is so dangerous. If you don't eat, the body has a multitude of mechanisms to try to keep you going, take away from here to put there and so on. But it is designed to repair from food, so if you are not eating you are on a constant decline deteriorating your body all over. And the longer you stay on that track, the worse things get. Also, it's not going to sculpt itself the way you want it to in your mind. It won't just take fat from your chosen problem areas. It's going to eat up your muscles, let the joints deteriorate, etc. It's going to take from all over to keep going and it's not trying at all to be aesthetic. \n\n\\---\n\nAnd I'll add one more thing about weight loss. We in nutrition of course support weight loss goals. But the last thing we want to see is someone not eating, because it's actually counter productive. Your body shuts down, your systems lose their capabilities, and we can't do any exercise training because there's no repair phase without food.\n\nSo what we really want is for people to eat sufficient calories to keep all body systems going, and make sure those calories are high quality foods that provide all the nutrition the body needs to keep itself healthy. Because under that regime, you can lose body fat while feeling good, retain your full capabilities, and your strength, and we can even keep working on sculpting up doing exercise. \n\nBut if you don't eat, you are taking all the tools away. The body can't repair, your energy tanks, we can't do any training. And the damage you are causing your joints, internal organs and so on, will hold us back for a long time even after you start eating again because we have to go easy, and deal with a permanent knee pain, or whatever other problem you gave yourself from starving.\n\nSo to recap, if you really want progress in body changes, then make sure you are eating enough to keep your body healthy and cooperating with the weight loss process. As a rule of thumb, you need to eat enough that you have sufficient resources to be healthy, and enough energy to maintain an exercise program. That's the winning path. We can achieve great outcomes better and faster if we keep the body provided with the basic resources it needs daily.",

Additionally, you said something along the lines of \u201cstarving is just as dangerous at any weight\u201d and I\u2019ve wondered about this, always being slightly above average weight. Does the body not burn in order, like, does it not always start with fat storage, go to muscle, and then organs? It can begin anywhere when it\u2019s starving? is this why it\u2019s just as dangerous at any weight?

      "body": "Thank you for your thoughtful questions. I will do my best to answer them.\n\nNo, not everyone experiences refeeding syndrome.  There are several risk factors for refeeding syndrome and it is more a thing to be cautious of than something that happens to everyone, sorta like how when you dock a boat, you often bump the dock, but only so often is it hit hard enough to damage one or the other. One of those risk factors is how much of your body mass you have lost and I (with my measly personal experience to reference) have met more people who experienced it in relapse than in their initial disorder.  Maybe this it because our first time we tend to ease in from a lifetime of developing unhealthy coping strategies and then we have a period of indecision and internal conflict when we are struggling with whether we are ready to get better.  That said, that is why a lot of people who need to be weight stabilized quickly are stabilized under supervision including ECGs and stuff.\n\nThere are also other physical symptoms that come with eating again.  This can include pain and bloating from an intestinal tract no longer as used to digestion.  When I started recovery, I would cry and compare food to chemotherapy as I knew it was making me better, but it made me so sick. (I had just walked alongside my sister through her second battle with leukemia) \n\nAll this is to say that you are not bad if your body was just able to eat again.  I am happy you were so lucky it is a thing to be proud of that your body was still able to start healing so immediately.  It is also there for the others reading to remind them that what they experienced was very real and taxing and that they are not alone either and have something to be proud of for surviving through it.\n\nAs to the order issue... The answer is yes and no.  Yes.  Your body does prefer to eat fat and then muscle, and then organs in that order, but it is also more complicated than that. You can drive a vast distance only fueling at the same station if it is done in many little trips.  If you drive a vast distance in one direction, you have to compromise.  Your body can only burn so much fat in one day and it can only convert so much muscle and still help you reach that oasis overflowing with fruit somewhere on the horizon.\n\nTo put it the other way, think about it from your body's perspective.  Let's say that (how to do this without numbers?) you need a small bucket of energy, pretend it is just like marbles.  It would prefer to just use food to fill the bucket, but you give it two handfuls.  That is only enough to fill a bit of the bucket. So then it goes to fat stores, but it is only able to consume so much fat in a day, like how you cannot instantly burn a log in it's entirety. So that is only a bit more of the bucket.  Now the bucket is only half full.  So then it tries to make the bucket smaller, to cut some off, so it makes you tired, hopes you will stay still today if there really is no food to be found. But there is still a deficit. It tries to take some muscle, but again, there can only be so much taken and so it only puts one handful in the bucket. So it needs more.  That is when it takes from your organs.  Because if it doesn't fill the metaphorical bucket, then the organs will die anyway.\n\nBasically it has to do not with the change itself, but the rate of change.  The boundary between weight loss and starvation is when food and fat alone can no longer fill that bucket. That is why \"healthy\" calorie deficits are small. We push things farther and that is why we get hurt.\n\nThe nutrients are also big because eating your fat and muscle does not give the bocy back much more than energy. If there are nutritional deficits, your body will start leeching them from the parts of the body that need them most sooner.\n\nThis also all needs to be fitted with the tagine that biology is weird and complicated and that for all of our studies, most of what we have formed are statistics and laws of averages.  There are always outliers and things continue to surprise us and defy solid definition.  It is a field of generalizations and probabilities as is medicine, which is why contemporary doctoring models push provider/patient communication to feel out the right path together.",

When you eat too little and are starving, you are starving.  There isn't easy starving or less starving, it is starving to death as you start to die.\n\nWhen you are starving your body no longer has enough energy, even if it is in a coma, even if it consumes as much of your body fat a day that it possibly can.  But your heart MUST beat. That is all your body knows.  So it starts killing anything it can to feed your blood and your heart.  It eats your kidney, your brain, your liver, your bones, even your heart.  It takes anything it can to make sure your heart is still beating in the morning. In reality, what starts to give out first depends a lot on what nutrients you are most devoid of.  But you are starving to death.  \n\nIt's an emergency measure, it can't last forever.  It is like when a plane depressurizes spontaneously and the masks drop down.  It isn't an endless supply of less convenient oxygen.  It's a small supply to give the pilot ten minutes to drop the plane to below a safe altitude where people will hopefully be able to breathe enough to not sustain brain damage.  Your body does everything it can to keep you going because we are animals. Hopefully if it can just get you over that mountain and into that valley, there will be an apple tree or a dead antelope or a pile of edible mushrooms something.\n\nSome people feel better, like they have unlimited energy.  Some people feel as if they are on their deathbed, a walking corpse slowly phasing through the mesh of the world till she dissappears.  Most people I know ping pong between the two. The voice in your head gets louder, you are still surviving still pushing forward, deeper, harder.  You don't feel hungry and when you do, you hogtie it like a captured animal, you tame it.  It becomes a vicious spiral.  People ask you to get help but you are finally so close to making a difference, to being small enough or invisible enough or real enough, to have earned whatever you have spent your whole life feeling like you weren't even worthy of living for.\n\nAnd then it cuts deep.  Your body is different, weight always comes off weird when starving, so you look alien at any BMI, your breasts gone, muscles gone, hair thinning, and then... Maybe you have back pain and your urine is dark or you start having heart fluttering and chest pain.  You don't know what to do about it what to make of it because you haven't had a clear thought in months that wasn't just shame. It takes you longer than you would expect, sometimes days, sometimes weeks, but you come to understand you are dying. You are no longer trading just your relationships and joy and energy and passion over in exchange for the whispers that promise you value, belonging, and control, you are trading your life.\n\nThat is when a lot of people seek help.  But that point can come at any weight. When I was a teenager I got help before that point and I was quite underweight.  My relapse 10 years later, I hit that point as my heart started to fail crossing from obese to overweight. And treatment is still reletively the same because whether someone is fat or not, they need to learn not to be so scared of being fat that their fear controls them.  They have to be able to live in their skin and not panic regardless of where there is fat on their body.\n\nYou didn't ask about this part, but the unfortunate reality of the body just knowing starving and not starving is that stabilizing can be super hard.  When you start eating again the body expects the organs to function normally.  It starts indescriminately balancing your nutrients across your body again, but your nutrient starved organs are already in a massive deficit and begin to starve even more.  This is called Refeeding Syndrome and can also kill you.  In order to avoid it, food has to be titrated back up, allowing nutrient levels to slowly rise along with metabolism, so that when metabolic recovery occurs, the organs can take it.\n\nBecause of these factors, Anorexia is the second deadliest mental illness, behind only opiate use disorder.  We can and do die, and even if we don't, at some point we have to emotionally contend with having spent months to years slowly dying.\n\nHope this helps a bit.  It is long, but like I wanted to try to capture why it is more complicated than just not eating and subsequently just eating again. I have survived rape, severe child abuse, disability, and homelessness and it is Anorexia that has left me broken and sobbing, rending my soul more times than I can count.\n\nETA:  I did some further research[further research ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2440847/) on Refeeding Syndrome and it is definitely complicated but along the lines of what I describe. There are multiple key nutrients that can be incredibly low in anorexia patients.

People ask you to get help but you are finally so close to making a difference, to being small enough or invisible enough or real enough, to have earned whatever you have spent your whole life feeling like you weren't even worthy of living for.\n\nAnd then it cuts deep.  Your body is different, weight always comes off weird when starving, so you look alien at any BMI, your breasts gone, muscles gone, hair thinning, and then... Maybe you have back pain and your urine is dark or you start having heart fluttering and chest pain.  You don't know what to do about it what to make of it because you haven't had a clear thought in months that wasn't just shame. It takes you longer than you would expect, sometimes days, sometimes weeks, but you come to understand you are dying. You are no longer trading just your relationships and joy and energy and passion over in exchange for the whispers that promise you value, belonging, and control, you are trading your life.\n\nThat is when a lot of people seek help.  But that point can come at any weight. When I was a teenager I got help before that point and I was quite underweight.  My relapse 10 years later, I hit that point as my heart started to fail crossing from obese to overweight. And treatment is still reletively the same because whether someone is fat or not, they need to learn not to be so scared of being fat that their fear controls them.  They have to be able to live in their skin and not panic regardless of where there is fat on their body.\n\nYou didn't ask about this part, but the unfortunate reality of the body just knowing starving and not starving is that stabilizing can be super hard.  When you start eating again the body expects the organs to function normally.  It starts indescriminately balancing your nutrients across your body again, but your nutrient starved organs are already in a massive deficit and begin to starve even more.  This is called Refeeding Syndrome and can also kill you.  In order to avoid it, food has to be titrated back up, allowing nutrient levels to slowly rise along with metabolism, so that when metabolic recovery occurs, the organs can take it.\n\nBecause of these factors, Anorexia is the second deadliest mental illness, behind only opiate use disorder.  We can and do die, and even if we don't, at some point we have to emotionally contend with having spent months to years slowly dying.\n\nHope this helps a bit.  It is long, but like I wanted to try to capture why it is more complicated than just not eating and subsequently just eating again. I have survived rape, severe child abuse, disability, and homelessness and it is Anorexia that has left me broken and sobbing, rending my soul more times than I can count.\n\nETA:  I did some further research[further research ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2440847/) on Refeeding Syndrome and it is definitely complicated but along the lines of what I describe. There are multiple key nutrients that can be incredibly low in anorexia patients.  Phosphorus and magnesium being two big ones and the spike in metabolism does cause a redistribution of them in the body. Basically when your metabolism kicks back in your body drives up it's insulin production among other things.  It starts trying to meet a higher energy demand by metabolizing food and fat.  Those chemical reactions both require many electrolytes and other nutrients.  Because the body has been draining its nutrient supplies for so long, it can't sustain the reaction and starts dipping into core stores in ways that are dangerous.  A very small portion of people with anorexia experience refeeding syndrome, but that portion is much higher for those given formula to stabilize during recovery.  Many formulas have since been adjusted to add these nutrients in, but there is still a danger.   Hopefully this helps clarify things for some people.\n\nAs to the other things I have said, there is actually a dietitian in this thread under me who has a super incredible explanation of how all these internal mechanics work and how we build up damage in our bodies from malnutrition. I highly suggest reading their comment if you want to learn more.",

          "body": "You do start to die.  Even if you are still chubby.  As it has been explained to my by doctors and dieticians, your body only really has two stages of metabolism.  When you eat too little and are starving, you are starving.  There isn't easy starving or less starving, it is starving to death as you start to die.\n\nWhen you are starving your body no longer has enough energy, even if it is in a coma, even if it consumes as much of your body fat a day that it possibly can.  But your heart MUST beat. That is all your body knows.  So it starts killing anything it can to feed your blood and your heart.  It eats your kidney, your brain, your liver, your bones, even your heart.  It takes anything it can to make sure your heart is still beating in the morning. In reality, what starts to give out first depends a lot on what nutrients you are most devoid of.  But you are starving to death.  \n\nIt's an emergency measure, it can't last forever.  It is like when a plane depressurizes spontaneously and the masks drop down.  It isn't an endless supply of less convenient oxygen.  It's a small supply to give the pilot ten minutes to drop the plane to below a safe altitude where people will hopefully be able to breathe enough to not sustain brain damage.  Your body does everything it can to keep you going because we are animals. Hopefully if it can just get you over that mountain and into that valley, there will be an apple tree or a dead antelope or a pile of edible mushrooms something.\n\nSome people feel better, like they have unlimited energy.  Some people feel as if they are on their deathbed, a walking corpse slowly phasing through the mesh of the world till she dissappears.  Most people I know ping pong between the two. The voice in your head gets louder, you are still surviving still pushing forward, deeper, harder.  You don't feel hungry and when you do, you hogtie it like a captured animal, you tame it.  It becomes a vicious spiral.  People ask you to get help but you are finally so close to making a difference, to being small enough or invisible enough or real enough, to have earned whatever you have spent your whole life feeling like you weren't even worthy of living for.\n\nAnd then it cuts deep.  Your body is different, weight always comes off weird when starving, so you look alien at any BMI, your breasts gone, muscles gone, hair thinning, and then... Maybe you have back pain and your urine is dark or you start having heart fluttering and chest pain.  You don't know what to do about it what to make of it because you haven't had a clear thought in months that wasn't just shame. It takes you longer than you would expect, sometimes days, sometimes weeks, but you come to understand you are dying. You are no longer trading just your relationships and joy and energy and passion over in exchange for the whispers that promise you value, belonging, and control, you are trading your life.\n\nThat is when a lot of people seek help.  But that point can come at any weight. When I was a teenager I got help before that point and I was quite underweight.  My relapse 10 years later, I hit that point as my heart started to fail crossing from obese to overweight. And treatment is still reletively the same because whether someone is fat or not, they need to learn not to be so scared of being fat that their fear controls them.  They have to be able to live in their skin and not panic regardless of where there is fat on their body.\n\nYou didn't ask about this part, but the unfortunate reality of the body just knowing starving and not starving is that stabilizing can be super hard.  When you start eating again the body expects the organs to function normally.  It starts indescriminately balancing your nutrients across your body again, but your nutrient starved organs are already in a massive deficit and begin to starve even more.  This is called Refeeding Syndrome and can also kill you.  In order to avoid it, food has to be titrated back up, allowing nutrient levels to slowly rise along with metabolism, so that when metabolic recovery occurs, the organs can take it.\n\nBecause of these factors, Anorexia is the second deadliest mental illness, behind only opiate use disorder.  We can and do die, and even if we don't, at some point we have to emotionally contend with having spent months to years slowly dying.\n\nHope this helps a bit.  It is long, but like I wanted to try to capture why it is more complicated than just not eating and subsequently just eating again. I have survived rape, severe child abuse, disability, and homelessness and it is Anorexia that has left me broken and sobbing, rending my soul more times than I can count.\n\nETA:  I did some further research[further research ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2440847/) on Refeeding Syndrome and it is definitely complicated but along the lines of what I describe. There are multiple key nutrients that can be incredibly low in anorexia patients.  Phosphorus and magnesium being two big ones and the spike in metabolism does cause a redistribution of them in the body. Basically when your metabolism kicks back in your body drives up it's insulin production among other things.  It starts trying to meet a higher energy demand by metabolizing food and fat.  Those chemical reactions both require many electrolytes and other nutrients.  Because the body has been draining its nutrient supplies for so long, it can't sustain the reaction and starts dipping into core stores in ways that are dangerous.  A very small portion of people with anorexia experience refeeding syndrome, but that portion is much higher for those given formula to stabilize during recovery.  Many formulas have since been adjusted to add these nutrients in, but there is still a danger.   Hopefully this helps clarify things for some people.\n\nAs to the other things I have said, there is actually a dietitian in this thread under me who has a super incredible explanation of how all these internal mechanics work and how we build up damage in our bodies from malnutrition. I highly suggest reading their comment if you want to learn more.",

Maybe you have back pain and your urine is dark or you start having heart fluttering and chest pain.  You don't know what to do about it what to make of it because you haven't had a clear thought in months that wasn't just shame.

You are no longer trading just your relationships and joy and energy and passion over in exchange for the whispers that promise you value, belonging, and control, you are trading your life.\n\nThat is when a lot of people seek help.

My relapse 10 years later, I hit that point as my heart started to fail crossing from obese to overweight. And treatment is still reletively the same because whether someone is fat or not, they need to learn not to be so scared of being fat that their fear controls them.  They have to be able to live in their skin and not panic regardless of where there is fat on their body.\n\nYou didn't ask about this part, but the unfortunate reality of the body just knowing starving and not starving is that stabilizing can be super hard.  When you start eating again the body expects the organs to function normally.  It starts indescriminately balancing your nutrients across your body again, but your nutrient starved organs are already in a massive deficit and begin to starve even more.  This is called Refeeding Syndrome and can also kill you.  In order to avoid it, food has to be titrated back up, allowing nutrient levels to slowly rise along with metabolism, so that when metabolic recovery occurs, the organs can take it.\n\nBecause of these factors, Anorexia is the second deadliest mental illness, behind only opiate use disorder.  We can and do die, and even if we don't, at some point we have to emotionally contend with having spent months to years slowly dying.\n\nHope this helps a bit.  It is long, but like I wanted to try to capture why it is more complicated than just not eating and subsequently just eating again. I have survived rape, severe child abuse, disability, and homelessness and it is Anorexia that has left me broken and sobbing, rending my soul more times than I can count.\n\nETA:  I did some further research[further research ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2440847/) on Refeeding Syndrome and it is definitely complicated but along the lines of what I describe. There are multiple key nutrients that can be incredibly low in anorexia patients.  Phosphorus and magnesium being two big ones and the spike in metabolism does cause a redistribution of them in the body. Basically when your metabolism kicks back in your body drives up it's insulin production among other things.  It starts trying to meet a higher energy demand by metabolizing food and fat.  Those chemical reactions both require many electrolytes and other nutrients.  Because the body has been draining its nutrient supplies for so long, it can't sustain the reaction and starts dipping into core stores in ways that are dangerous.  A very small portion of people with anorexia experience refeeding syndrome, but that portion is much higher for those given formula to stabilize during recovery.  Many formulas have since been adjusted to add these nutrients in, but there is still a danger.   Hopefully this helps clarify things for some people.\n\nAs to the other things I have said, there is actually a dietitian in this thread under me who has a super incredible explanation of how all these internal mechanics work and how we build up damage in our bodies from malnutrition. I highly suggest reading their comment if you want to learn more.",

When I began recovery, it wasn\u2019t much of a process. I simply started eating normally again after years, and this meant greasy and unhealthy food sometimes. I\u2019m wondering why I didn\u2019t experience refeeding syndrome even though I didn\u2019t titrate back up. Does everyone who faces eating disorders for a long time experience it? Additionally, you said something along the lines of \u201cstarving is just as dangerous at any weight\u201d and I\u2019ve wondered about this, always being slightly above average weight. Does the body not burn in order, like, does it not always start with fat storage, go to muscle, and then organs? It can begin anywhere when it\u2019s starving? is this why it\u2019s just as dangerous at any weight? Because you\u2019re burning fat, muscle, and organs, and you\u2019re depriving your body of nutrients?",

This is perfectly normal, as your body is a powerful self-repairing machine. All it needs is food and rest, and you are back to restored the next day.\n\nThis is why starving is so dangerous. If you don't eat, the body has a multitude of mechanisms to try to keep you going, take away from here to put there and so on. But it is designed to repair from food, so if you are not eating you are on a constant decline deteriorating your body all over. And the longer you stay on that track, the worse things get. Also, it's not going to sculpt itself the way you want it to in your mind. It won't just take fat from your chosen problem areas. It's going to eat up your muscles, let the joints deteriorate, etc. It's going to take from all over to keep going and it's not trying at all to be aesthetic. \n\n\\---\n\nAnd I'll add one more thing about weight loss. We in nutrition of course support weight loss goals. But the last thing we want to see is someone not eating, because it's actually counter productive. Your body shuts down, your systems lose their capabilities, and we can't do any exercise training because there's no repair phase without food.\n\nSo what we really want is for people to eat sufficient calories to keep all body systems going, and make sure those calories are high quality foods that provide all the nutrition the body needs to keep itself healthy. Because under that regime, you can lose body fat while feeling good, retain your full capabilities, and your strength, and we can even keep working on sculpting up doing exercise. \n\nBut if you don't eat, you are taking all the tools away. The body can't repair, your energy tanks, we can't do any training. And the damage you are causing your joints, internal organs and so on, will hold us back for a long time even after you start eating again because we have to go easy, and deal with a permanent knee pain, or whatever other problem you gave yourself from starving.\n\nSo to recap, if you really want progress in body changes, then make sure you are eating enough to keep your body healthy and cooperating with the weight loss process. As a rule of thumb, you need to eat enough that you have sufficient resources to be healthy, and enough energy to maintain an exercise program. That's the winning path. We can achieve great outcomes better and faster if we keep the body provided with the basic resources it needs daily.",

Basically when your metabolism kicks back in your body drives up it's insulin production among other things.  It starts trying to meet a higher energy demand by metabolizing food and fat.  Those chemical reactions both require many electrolytes and other nutrients.  Because the body has been draining its nutrient supplies for so long, it can't sustain the reaction and starts dipping into core stores in ways that are dangerous.  A very small portion of people with anorexia experience refeeding syndrome, but that portion is much higher for those given formula to stabilize during recovery.  Many formulas have since been adjusted to add these nutrients in, but there is still a danger.   Hopefully this helps clarify things for some people.\n\nAs to the other things I have said, there is actually a dietitian in this thread under me who has a super incredible explanation of how all these internal mechanics work and how we build up damage in our bodies from malnutrition. I highly suggest reading their comment if you want to learn more.",

When I began recovery, it wasn\u2019t much of a process. I simply started eating normally again after years, and this meant greasy and unhealthy food sometimes. I\u2019m wondering why I didn\u2019t experience refeeding syndrome even though I didn\u2019t titrate back up. Does everyone who faces eating disorders for a long time experience it? Additionally, you said something along the lines of \u201cstarving is just as dangerous at any weight\u201d and I\u2019ve wondered about this, always being slightly above average weight. Does the body not burn in order, like, does it not always start with fat storage, go to muscle, and then organs? It can begin anywhere when it\u2019s starving? is this why it\u2019s just as dangerous at any weight? Because you\u2019re burning fat, muscle, and organs, and you\u2019re depriving your body of nutrients?",

          "body": ">\u201cstarving is just as dangerous at any weight\u201d\n\nI'm formally trained in nutrition, so I wanted to step in as a PSA.\n\nEverything you do all day puts wear and tear on your body. This is perfectly normal, as your body is a powerful self-repairing machine. All it needs is food and rest, and you are back to restored the next day.\n\nThis is why starving is so dangerous. If you don't eat, the body has a multitude of mechanisms to try to keep you going, take away from here to put there and so on. But it is designed to repair from food, so if you are not eating you are on a constant decline deteriorating your body all over. And the longer you stay on that track, the worse things get. Also, it's not going to sculpt itself the way you want it to in your mind. It won't just take fat from your chosen problem areas. It's going to eat up your muscles, let the joints deteriorate, etc. It's going to take from all over to keep going and it's not trying at all to be aesthetic. \n\n\\---\n\nAnd I'll add one more thing about weight loss. We in nutrition of course support weight loss goals. But the last thing we want to see is someone not eating, because it's actually counter productive. Your body shuts down, your systems lose their capabilities, and we can't do any exercise training because there's no repair phase without food.\n\nSo what we really want is for people to eat sufficient calories to keep all body systems going, and make sure those calories are high quality foods that provide all the nutrition the body needs to keep itself healthy. Because under that regime, you can lose body fat while feeling good, retain your full capabilities, and your strength, and we can even keep working on sculpting up doing exercise. \n\nBut if you don't eat, you are taking all the tools away. The body can't repair, your energy tanks, we can't do any training. And the damage you are causing your joints, internal organs and so on, will hold us back for a long time even after you start eating again because we have to go easy, and deal with a permanent knee pain, or whatever other problem you gave yourself from starving.\n\nSo to recap, if you really want progress in body changes, then make sure you are eating enough to keep your body healthy and cooperating with the weight loss process. As a rule of thumb, you need to eat enough that you have sufficient resources to be healthy, and enough energy to maintain an exercise program. That's the winning path. We can achieve great outcomes better and faster if we keep the body provided with the basic resources it needs daily.",

      "body": "I understand this as an explanation of how the body works. I know this is an old post but I desperately need help. I posted this above too. Can you please give advice on how to recover? My post above:\n\nI\u2019ve just learned if refeeding syndrome and I am afraid like no other time. Not even being dx with MS. How do you avoid this? Do you need to work with someone? If so who? I was going to buckle down ask yet again for an appetite stimulant and hopefully start eating every single day. Since I\u2019m in pain a lot from MS, I sleep a lot. I miss eating. Drinking water. It complicated and I don\u2019t need to rattle on about it. My private primary has known for a few years now (this time, and a few years a few years before this time) that I struggle to eat, I\u2019m not hungry. I am underweight, not hugely, but I want 10 pounds on me and have been down much lower. She just says meal plan. If I could do that I wouldn\u2019t have this issue. I don\u2019t know who to turn to for help. I desperately need help. I really thought, well I will ask my old psychiatrist for the antipsychotic that makes you hungry (I forgot name right now). He isn\u2019t a therapist on disordered eating. But I have been on it before for anxiety and didn\u2019t know it would make me so uncomfortable hungry. As in he gave me a small amount to sleep. But it made me so hungry I couldn\u2019t sleep\u2014I would have to eat and eat\u2014abs I never felt full until it wore off. I did not have an issue with eating at that time so we stopped it. But I thought I could ask him for it again so I can have an appetite that breaks through all the pain I am in and the depression from basically being bedbound from pain (MS).\n\nMy bloodwork for last few years comes back weird abs my primary says oh must be malnutrition. But does nothing to help. I reached out about being afraid I\u2019m dehydrated all the time and she said as long as I ate abs just drank water I didn\u2019t need anything else to rehydrate. But I\u2019m not eating and I don\u2019t drink as much water as I should because again I\u2019m asleep. She is a private 24/7 doctor I have stayed with when she stopped taking insurance abs went private. But she is not helping. Not really. It is like she just doesn\u2019t understand that all these things are real. My blood work says so.\n\nSo now what do I do? I\u2019m terrified to start just normal eating again because of syndrome. Plus I feel sick and full super fast\u2014stomach shrunk? I don\u2019t know why. I\u2019m afraid. I just fall asleep and don\u2019t realize it. I hurt. My dad just died that threw me off big time too. I\u2019m very aware of death.\n\nI don\u2019t want to die. I want to be normal again. I do have injuries that disabled me beyond MS. That sent me into this latest spiral almost 3 years ago. I need that addressed to, mostly pain. And the trauma of how it happened. But I want to be me again. I want to be a mom to my darling child again. She was barely 5 when those injuries happened and just turned 8. I want to be with her not in bed. I want to eat with her. I wish I had her appetite! She is growing always and is very tall, I am very short. I watch her and I am so ashamed I can\u2019t eat like her, that I don\u2019t join her when she wants me to sit and eat with her. I do not. I\u2019m in bed.  I\u2019m so ashamed. I don\u2019t want to die.\n\nBut now if I start to eat again I can sue just from eating? I read this earlier tonight on Mayo by accident. I had no idea.\n\nCan you or anyone please tell me how to put my nutrition in order again? Can I die if I do this alone? I would love local resources, but I\u2019m afraid to out myself where I live. Someone please, what do I do?\n\nI\u2019m so terrified of Covid because I am immune compromised. I could never ever see myself in patient. I know that sounds like I\u2019m a freak\u2014-but it is a huge fear of mine. Not dying of Covid, of becoming more disabled. That limits my options plus I have zero support for my child on nights my husband works. It is one night out of house, and one in house. I have no support for her. None. He does everything except those two nights. But we have no one not one friend or family member who can help cover that night he teaches in city. I am so trapped by fear. I am desperately seeking help. I need to feel safe in my own body. I never have, and now even less so, how is that even  possible?\n\nHelp please. Where and who can help me? What is first step? If I start eating more  will this syndrome happen? It is terrifying.",

          "body": "You do start to die.  Even if you are still chubby.  As it has been explained to my by doctors and dieticians, your body only really has two stages of metabolism.  When you eat too little and are starving, you are starving.  There isn't easy starving or less starving, it is starving to death as you start to die.\n\nWhen you are starving your body no longer has enough energy, even if it is in a coma, even if it consumes as much of your body fat a day that it possibly can.  But your heart MUST beat. That is all your body knows.  So it starts killing anything it can to feed your blood and your heart.  It eats your kidney, your brain, your liver, your bones, even your heart.  It takes anything it can to make sure your heart is still beating in the morning. In reality, what starts to give out first depends a lot on what nutrients you are most devoid of.  But you are starving to death.  \n\nIt's an emergency measure, it can't last forever.  It is like when a plane depressurizes spontaneously and the masks drop down.  It isn't an endless supply of less convenient oxygen.  It's a small supply to give the pilot ten minutes to drop the plane to below a safe altitude where people will hopefully be able to breathe enough to not sustain brain damage.  Your body does everything it can to keep you going because we are animals. Hopefully if it can just get you over that mountain and into that valley, there will be an apple tree or a dead antelope or a pile of edible mushrooms something.\n\nSome people feel better, like they have unlimited energy.  Some people feel as if they are on their deathbed, a walking corpse slowly phasing through the mesh of the world till she dissappears.  Most people I know ping pong between the two. The voice in your head gets louder, you are still surviving still pushing forward, deeper, harder.  You don't feel hungry and when you do, you hogtie it like a captured animal, you tame it.  It becomes a vicious spiral.  People ask you to get help but you are finally so close to making a difference, to being small enough or invisible enough or real enough, to have earned whatever you have spent your whole life feeling like you weren't even worthy of living for.\n\nAnd then it cuts deep.  Your body is different, weight always comes off weird when starving, so you look alien at any BMI, your breasts gone, muscles gone, hair thinning, and then... Maybe you have back pain and your urine is dark or you start having heart fluttering and chest pain.  You don't know what to do about it what to make of it because you haven't had a clear thought in months that wasn't just shame. It takes you longer than you would expect, sometimes days, sometimes weeks, but you come to understand you are dying. You are no longer trading just your relationships and joy and energy and passion over in exchange for the whispers that promise you value, belonging, and control, you are trading your life.\n\nThat is when a lot of people seek help.  But that point can come at any weight. When I was a teenager I got help before that point and I was quite underweight.  My relapse 10 years later, I hit that point as my heart started to fail crossing from obese to overweight. And treatment is still reletively the same because whether someone is fat or not, they need to learn not to be so scared of being fat that their fear controls them.  They have to be able to live in their skin and not panic regardless of where there is fat on their body.\n\nYou didn't ask about this part, but the unfortunate reality of the body just knowing starving and not starving is that stabilizing can be super hard.  When you start eating again the body expects the organs to function normally.  It starts indescriminately balancing your nutrients across your body again, but your nutrient starved organs are already in a massive deficit and begin to starve even more.  This is called Refeeding Syndrome and can also kill you.  In order to avoid it, food has to be titrated back up, allowing nutrient levels to slowly rise along with metabolism, so that when metabolic recovery occurs, the organs can take it.\n\nBecause of these factors, Anorexia is the second deadliest mental illness, behind only opiate use disorder.  We can and do die, and even if we don't, at some point we have to emotionally contend with having spent months to years slowly dying.\n\nHope this helps a bit.  It is long, but like I wanted to try to capture why it is more complicated than just not eating and subsequently just eating again. I have survived rape, severe child abuse, disability, and homelessness and it is Anorexia that has left me broken and sobbing, rending my soul more times than I can count.\n\nETA:  I did some further research[further research ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2440847/) on Refeeding Syndrome and it is definitely complicated but along the lines of what I describe. There are multiple key nutrients that can be incredibly low in anorexia patients.

As a rule of thumb, you need to eat enough that you have sufficient resources to be healthy, and enough energy to maintain an exercise program. That's the winning path. We can achieve great outcomes better and faster if we keep the body provided with the basic resources it needs daily.",

There are multiple key nutrients that can be incredibly low in anorexia patients.  Phosphorus and magnesium being two big ones and the spike in metabolism does cause a redistribution of them in the body. Basically when your metabolism kicks back in your body drives up it's insulin production among other things.  It starts trying to meet a higher energy demand by metabolizing food and fat.  Those chemical reactions both require many electrolytes and other nutrients.  Because the body has been draining its nutrient supplies for so long, it can't sustain the reaction and starts dipping into core stores in ways that are dangerous.  A very small portion of people with anorexia experience refeeding syndrome, but that portion is much higher for those given formula to stabilize during recovery.  Many formulas have since been adjusted to add these nutrients in, but there is still a danger.   Hopefully this helps clarify things for some people.\n\nAs to the other things I have said, there is actually a dietitian in this thread under me who has a super incredible explanation of how all these internal mechanics work and how we build up damage in our bodies from malnutrition.

When I began recovery, it wasn\u2019t much of a process. I simply started eating normally again after years, and this meant greasy and unhealthy food sometimes. I\u2019m wondering why I didn\u2019t experience refeeding syndrome even though I didn\u2019t titrate back up. Does everyone who faces eating disorders for a long time experience it? Additionally, you said something along the lines of \u201cstarving is just as dangerous at any weight\u201d and I\u2019ve wondered about this, always being slightly above average weight. Does the body not burn in order, like, does it not always start with fat storage, go to muscle, and then organs? It can begin anywhere when it\u2019s starving? is this why it\u2019s just as dangerous at any weight? Because you\u2019re burning fat, muscle, and organs, and you\u2019re depriving your body of nutrients?",

          "body": "Thank you for your thoughtful questions. I will do my best to answer them.\n\nNo, not everyone experiences refeeding syndrome.  There are several risk factors for refeeding syndrome and it is more a thing to be cautious of than something that happens to everyone, sorta like how when you dock a boat, you often bump the dock, but only so often is it hit hard enough to damage one or the other. One of those risk factors is how much of your body mass you have lost and I (with my measly personal experience to reference) have met more people who experienced it in relapse than in their initial disorder.  Maybe this it because our first time we tend to ease in from a lifetime of developing unhealthy coping strategies and then we have a period of indecision and internal conflict when we are struggling with whether we are ready to get better.  That said, that is why a lot of people who need to be weight stabilized quickly are stabilized under supervision including ECGs and stuff.\n\nThere are also other physical symptoms that come with eating again.  This can include pain and bloating from an intestinal tract no longer as used to digestion.  When I started recovery, I would cry and compare food to chemotherapy as I knew it was making me better, but it made me so sick. (I had just walked alongside my sister through her second battle with leukemia) \n\nAll this is to say that you are not bad if your body was just able to eat again.  I am happy you were so lucky it is a thing to be proud of that your body was still able to start healing so immediately.  It is also there for the others reading to remind them that what they experienced was very real and taxing and that they are not alone either and have something to be proud of for surviving through it.\n\nAs to the order issue... The answer is yes and no.  Yes.  Your body does prefer to eat fat and then muscle, and then organs in that order, but it is also more complicated than that. You can drive a vast distance only fueling at the same station if it is done in many little trips.  If you drive a vast distance in one direction, you have to compromise.  Your body can only burn so much fat in one day and it can only convert so much muscle and still help you reach that oasis overflowing with fruit somewhere on the horizon.\n\nTo put it the other way, think about it from your body's perspective.  Let's say that (how to do this without numbers?) you need a small bucket of energy, pretend it is just like marbles.  It would prefer to just use food to fill the bucket, but you give it two handfuls.  That is only enough to fill a bit of the bucket. So then it goes to fat stores, but it is only able to consume so much fat in a day, like how you cannot instantly burn a log in it's entirety. So that is only a bit more of the bucket.  Now the bucket is only half full.  So then it tries to make the bucket smaller, to cut some off, so it makes you tired, hopes you will stay still today if there really is no food to be found. But there is still a deficit. It tries to take some muscle, but again, there can only be so much taken and so it only puts one handful in the bucket. So it needs more.  That is when it takes from your organs.  Because if it doesn't fill the metaphorical bucket, then the organs will die anyway.\n\nBasically it has to do not with the change itself, but the rate of change.  The boundary between weight loss and starvation is when food and fat alone can no longer fill that bucket. That is why \"healthy\" calorie deficits are small. We push things farther and that is why we get hurt.\n\nThe nutrients are also big because eating your fat and muscle does not give the bocy back much more than energy. If there are nutritional deficits, your body will start leeching them from the parts of the body that need them most sooner.\n\nThis also all needs to be fitted with the tagine that biology is weird and complicated and that for all of our studies, most of what we have formed are statistics and laws of averages.  There are always outliers and things continue to surprise us and defy solid definition.  It is a field of generalizations and probabilities as is medicine, which is why contemporary doctoring models push provider/patient communication to feel out the right path together.",

      "body": "Autophagy is a kind of catch-all term to refer to the body's ability to reuse and recycle cells.\n\nThe human body is a powerful self-healing machine, and is capable of incredible feats of adaptation to all things including diets, climates, lifestyles, exercise and so on.\n\nIn the simplest of terms, effective capacity for adaptation requires both the ability to build up and the ability to tear down. It wouldn't be an adaptation machine if it could only go one way, if it could only build things up but had no capacity to make things smaller. Autophagy is a term that refers to the body's processes on the \"tear down\" side of its ability for self-healing and adaptation.\n\nBoth build up and tear down happen all the time, at the same time, all day. Your body is constantly doing maintenance, self-healing and adaptation. In some area of your body, it might be doing some build up of muscles that you had to use today. In another area of your body, it might be decommissioning old cells, and weakening some muscles you haven't used in weeks and it thinks you no longer plan to use as much.\n\nYour body doesn't really need guidance on when to do tear down tasks, and you don't have much say in the matter other than to provide the resources and lifestyle choices and let the body do its thing. Your body will automatically remove unneeded cells, reuse energy cells like fat and muscle as needed, and weaken muscles that have not been in use. You can definitely accelerate this process by eating at a caloric deficit, but there's only so much you want to push your body in this direction because it's going to run its own show.\n\nFor instance, for people that are not eating enough food, for every 3lbs of body weight that you lose, 1lb might be from muscle mass lost. Your body decides that you are starving and then you probably don't need the muscles, and starts to tear them down for fuel. In the world of fitness and nutrition this is terrible, because building muscles is expensive (resource-wise) and hard to do (workout-wise), so giving up on some of your most precious cells due to misguided eating is a travesty.\n\nThe gold standard for weight loss in fitness is to optimize your calories so that you have enough nutrition so that the body doesn't go into starvation protocols, while also maintaining a strength training regime to signal to your body that the muscles are indeed needed and not to be consumed for fuel. This means a person would eat enough calories to keep healthy and enough energy to exercise, and would exercise regularly while maintaining a reasonable caloric deficit (eat less than you need to maintain your weight, but without going so far to threaten your body with starvation). Under these conditions, we know that the body will continue to sculpt via build up and tear down, but overall will allow the muscle mass to remain and focus primarily on burning the fat stores for energy. This is the mode that a fitness or nutrition coach want. This is the best winning condition to strive for.\n\nStudies show that people that strive for this regime, will lose a lot less muscle along their weight loss journey. And those that optimize this regime can actually gain muscle (if that's their goal because it takes a lot of hard work in resistance training) while losing fat.\n\n\\---\n\nAlso, because I haven't said it yet and its an important tidbit: exercise can burn more energy than you can lose through starvation.\n\nWe see pro athletes easily burn 10k calories in a day from just doing their craft. When your body is optimized like a performance machine, it can do quick work of calories and body fat. But on the opposite end, during starvation, your metabolism may get so slow that even if you are not eating anything at all you might only be losing 800 calories per day.\n\n800 calories is the average workout of a 200lb man doing serious resistance training. So an average person that is conditioned for the gym, could easily lose the same 800 calories just by doing a workout, while the person starving has to be miserable all day, not eating anything at all, letting their body break down and become endangered, jut to lose the same calories as a regular man doing a workout.\n\nThis is why I said it's not just safer to lose weight while eating healthy, it is also more effective and faster. Not to mention that the nutrient-deprived starved body shape is not what you see in magazines. The shape people want is that of a person that has healthy strength, and that simply cannot be achieved by starving. So might as well work on both at the same time, by maintaining a healthy level of calories and keeping up with a workout plan.\n\nIf you are really serious about faster body changes, then seek to turn your body into an optimized machine so that it can go through calories faster. Otherwise known as the most vanilla advice we've all heard already: eat healthy and exercise more.",

When I began recovery, it wasn\u2019t much of a process. I simply started eating normally again after years, and this meant greasy and unhealthy food sometimes. I\u2019m wondering why I didn\u2019t experience refeeding syndrome even though I didn\u2019t titrate back up. Does everyone who faces eating disorders for a long time experience it? Additionally, you said something along the lines of \u201cstarving is just as dangerous at any weight\u201d and I\u2019ve wondered about this, always being slightly above average weight. Does the body not burn in order, like, does it not always start with fat storage, go to muscle, and then organs? It can begin anywhere when it\u2019s starving? is this why it\u2019s just as dangerous at any weight? Because you\u2019re burning fat, muscle, and organs, and you\u2019re depriving your body of nutrients?",

This is perfectly normal, as your body is a powerful self-repairing machine. All it needs is food and rest, and you are back to restored the next day.\n\nThis is why starving is so dangerous. If you don't eat, the body has a multitude of mechanisms to try to keep you going, take away from here to put there and so on. But it is designed to repair from food, so if you are not eating you are on a constant decline deteriorating your body all over. And the longer you stay on that track, the worse things get. Also, it's not going to sculpt itself the way you want it to in your mind. It won't just take fat from your chosen problem areas. It's going to eat up your muscles, let the joints deteriorate, etc. It's going to take from all over to keep going and it's not trying at all to be aesthetic. \n\n\\---\n\nAnd I'll add one more thing about weight loss. We in nutrition of course support weight loss goals. But the last thing we want to see is someone not eating, because it's actually counter productive. Your body shuts down, your systems lose their capabilities, and we can't do any exercise training because there's no repair phase without food.\n\nSo what we really want is for people to eat sufficient calories to keep all body systems going, and make sure those calories are high quality foods that provide all the nutrition the body needs to keep itself healthy. Because under that regime, you can lose body fat while feeling good, retain your full capabilities, and your strength, and we can even keep working on sculpting up doing exercise. \n\nBut if you don't eat, you are taking all the tools away. The body can't repair, your energy tanks, we can't do any training. And the damage you are causing your joints, internal organs and so on, will hold us back for a long time even after you start eating again because we have to go easy, and deal with a permanent knee pain, or whatever other problem you gave yourself from starving.\n\nSo to recap, if you really want progress in body changes, then make sure you are eating enough to keep your body healthy and cooperating with the weight loss process. As a rule of thumb, you need to eat enough that you have sufficient resources to be healthy, and enough energy to maintain an exercise program. That's the winning path. We can achieve great outcomes better and faster if we keep the body provided with the basic resources it needs daily.",

When I began recovery, it wasn\u2019t much of a process. I simply started eating normally again after years, and this meant greasy and unhealthy food sometimes. I\u2019m wondering why I didn\u2019t experience refeeding syndrome even though I didn\u2019t titrate back up. Does everyone who faces eating disorders for a long time experience it? Additionally, you said something along the lines of \u201cstarving is just as dangerous at any weight\u201d and I\u2019ve wondered about this, always being slightly above average weight. Does the body not burn in order, like, does it not always start with fat storage, go to muscle, and then organs? It can begin anywhere when it\u2019s starving? is this why it\u2019s just as dangerous at any weight? Because you\u2019re burning fat, muscle, and organs, and you\u2019re depriving your body of nutrients?",

          "body": ">\u201cstarving is just as dangerous at any weight\u201d\n\nI'm formally trained in nutrition, so I wanted to step in as a PSA.\n\nEverything you do all day puts wear and tear on your body. This is perfectly normal, as your body is a powerful self-repairing machine. All it needs is food and rest, and you are back to restored the next day.\n\nThis is why starving is so dangerous. If you don't eat, the body has a multitude of mechanisms to try to keep you going, take away from here to put there and so on. But it is designed to repair from food, so if you are not eating you are on a constant decline deteriorating your body all over. And the longer you stay on that track, the worse things get. Also, it's not going to sculpt itself the way you want it to in your mind. It won't just take fat from your chosen problem areas. It's going to eat up your muscles, let the joints deteriorate, etc. It's going to take from all over to keep going and it's not trying at all to be aesthetic. \n\n\\---\n\nAnd I'll add one more thing about weight loss. We in nutrition of course support weight loss goals. But the last thing we want to see is someone not eating, because it's actually counter productive. Your body shuts down, your systems lose their capabilities, and we can't do any exercise training because there's no repair phase without food.\n\nSo what we really want is for people to eat sufficient calories to keep all body systems going, and make sure those calories are high quality foods that provide all the nutrition the body needs to keep itself healthy. Because under that regime, you can lose body fat while feeling good, retain your full capabilities, and your strength, and we can even keep working on sculpting up doing exercise. \n\nBut if you don't eat, you are taking all the tools away. The body can't repair, your energy tanks, we can't do any training. And the damage you are causing your joints, internal organs and so on, will hold us back for a long time even after you start eating again because we have to go easy, and deal with a permanent knee pain, or whatever other problem you gave yourself from starving.\n\nSo to recap, if you really want progress in body changes, then make sure you are eating enough to keep your body healthy and cooperating with the weight loss process. As a rule of thumb, you need to eat enough that you have sufficient resources to be healthy, and enough energy to maintain an exercise program. That's the winning path. We can achieve great outcomes better and faster if we keep the body provided with the basic resources it needs daily.",

          "body": "I understand this as an explanation of how the body works. I know this is an old post but I desperately need help. I posted this above too. Can you please give advice on how to recover? My post above:\n\nI\u2019ve just learned if refeeding syndrome and I am afraid like no other time. Not even being dx with MS. How do you avoid this? Do you need to work with someone? If so who? I was going to buckle down ask yet again for an appetite stimulant and hopefully start eating every single day. Since I\u2019m in pain a lot from MS, I sleep a lot. I miss eating. Drinking water. It complicated and I don\u2019t need to rattle on about it. My private primary has known for a few years now (this time, and a few years a few years before this time) that I struggle to eat, I\u2019m not hungry. I am underweight, not hugely, but I want 10 pounds on me and have been down much lower. She just says meal plan. If I could do that I wouldn\u2019t have this issue. I don\u2019t know who to turn to for help. I desperately need help. I really thought, well I will ask my old psychiatrist for the antipsychotic that makes you hungry (I forgot name right now). He isn\u2019t a therapist on disordered eating. But I have been on it before for anxiety and didn\u2019t know it would make me so uncomfortable hungry. As in he gave me a small amount to sleep. But it made me so hungry I couldn\u2019t sleep\u2014I would have to eat and eat\u2014abs I never felt full until it wore off. I did not have an issue with eating at that time so we stopped it. But I thought I could ask him for it again so I can have an appetite that breaks through all the pain I am in and the depression from basically being bedbound from pain (MS).\n\nMy bloodwork for last few years comes back weird abs my primary says oh must be malnutrition. But does nothing to help. I reached out about being afraid I\u2019m dehydrated all the time and she said as long as I ate abs just drank water I didn\u2019t need anything else to rehydrate. But I\u2019m not eating and I don\u2019t drink as much water as I should because again I\u2019m asleep. She is a private 24/7 doctor I have stayed with when she stopped taking insurance abs went private. But she is not helping. Not really. It is like she just doesn\u2019t understand that all these things are real. My blood work says so.\n\nSo now what do I do? I\u2019m terrified to start just normal eating again because of syndrome. Plus I feel sick and full super fast\u2014stomach shrunk? I don\u2019t know why. I\u2019m afraid. I just fall asleep and don\u2019t realize it. I hurt. My dad just died that threw me off big time too. I\u2019m very aware of death.\n\nI don\u2019t want to die. I want to be normal again. I do have injuries that disabled me beyond MS. That sent me into this latest spiral almost 3 years ago. I need that addressed to, mostly pain. And the trauma of how it happened. But I want to be me again. I want to be a mom to my darling child again. She was barely 5 when those injuries happened and just turned 8. I want to be with her not in bed. I want to eat with her. I wish I had her appetite! She is growing always and is very tall, I am very short. I watch her and I am so ashamed I can\u2019t eat like her, that I don\u2019t join her when she wants me to sit and eat with her. I do not. I\u2019m in bed.  I\u2019m so ashamed. I don\u2019t want to die.\n\nBut now if I start to eat again I can sue just from eating? I read this earlier tonight on Mayo by accident. I had no idea.\n\nCan you or anyone please tell me how to put my nutrition in order again? Can I die if I do this alone? I would love local resources, but I\u2019m afraid to out myself where I live. Someone please, what do I do?\n\nI\u2019m so terrified of Covid because I am immune compromised. I could never ever see myself in patient. I know that sounds like I\u2019m a freak\u2014-but it is a huge fear of mine. Not dying of Covid, of becoming more disabled. That limits my options plus I have zero support for my child on nights my husband works. It is one night out of house, and one in house. I have no support for her. None. He does everything except those two nights. But we have no one not one friend or family member who can help cover that night he teaches in city. I am so trapped by fear. I am desperately seeking help. I need to feel safe in my own body. I never have, and now even less so, how is that even  possible?\n\nHelp please. Where and who can help me? What is first step? If I start eating more  will this syndrome happen? It is terrifying.",

          "body": "You do start to die.  Even if you are still chubby.  As it has been explained to my by doctors and dieticians, your body only really has two stages of metabolism.  When you eat too little and are starving, you are starving.  There isn't easy starving or less starving, it is starving to death as you start to die.\n\nWhen you are starving your body no longer has enough energy, even if it is in a coma, even if it consumes as much of your body fat a day that it possibly can.  But your heart MUST beat. That is all your body knows.  So it starts killing anything it can to feed your blood and your heart.  It eats your kidney, your brain, your liver, your bones, even your heart.  It takes anything it can to make sure your heart is still beating in the morning. In reality, what starts to give out first depends a lot on what nutrients you are most devoid of.  But you are starving to death.  \n\nIt's an emergency measure, it can't last forever.  It is like when a plane depressurizes spontaneously and the masks drop down.  It isn't an endless supply of less convenient oxygen.  It's a small supply to give the pilot ten minutes to drop the plane to below a safe altitude where people will hopefully be able to breathe enough to not sustain brain damage.  Your body does everything it can to keep you going because we are animals. Hopefully if it can just get you over that mountain and into that valley, there will be an apple tree or a dead antelope or a pile of edible mushrooms something.\n\nSome people feel better, like they have unlimited energy.  Some people feel as if they are on their deathbed, a walking corpse slowly phasing through the mesh of the world till she dissappears.  Most people I know ping pong between the two. The voice in your head gets louder, you are still surviving still pushing forward, deeper, harder.  You don't feel hungry and when you do, you hogtie it like a captured animal, you tame it.  It becomes a vicious spiral.  People ask you to get help but you are finally so close to making a difference, to being small enough or invisible enough or real enough, to have earned whatever you have spent your whole life feeling like you weren't even worthy of living for.\n\nAnd then it cuts deep.  Your body is different, weight always comes off weird when starving, so you look alien at any BMI, your breasts gone, muscles gone, hair thinning, and then... Maybe you have back pain and your urine is dark or you start having heart fluttering and chest pain.  You don't know what to do about it what to make of it because you haven't had a clear thought in months that wasn't just shame. It takes you longer than you would expect, sometimes days, sometimes weeks, but you come to understand you are dying. You are no longer trading just your relationships and joy and energy and passion over in exchange for the whispers that promise you value, belonging, and control, you are trading your life.\n\nThat is when a lot of people seek help.  But that point can come at any weight. When I was a teenager I got help before that point and I was quite underweight.  My relapse 10 years later, I hit that point as my heart started to fail crossing from obese to overweight. And treatment is still reletively the same because whether someone is fat or not, they need to learn not to be so scared of being fat that their fear controls them.  They have to be able to live in their skin and not panic regardless of where there is fat on their body.\n\nYou didn't ask about this part, but the unfortunate reality of the body just knowing starving and not starving is that stabilizing can be super hard.  When you start eating again the body expects the organs to function normally.  It starts indescriminately balancing your nutrients across your body again, but your nutrient starved organs are already in a massive deficit and begin to starve even more.  This is called Refeeding Syndrome and can also kill you.  In order to avoid it, food has to be titrated back up, allowing nutrient levels to slowly rise along with metabolism, so that when metabolic recovery occurs, the organs can take it.\n\nBecause of these factors, Anorexia is the second deadliest mental illness, behind only opiate use disorder.  We can and do die, and even if we don't, at some point we have to emotionally contend with having spent months to years slowly dying.\n\nHope this helps a bit.  It is long, but like I wanted to try to capture why it is more complicated than just not eating and subsequently just eating again. I have survived rape, severe child abuse, disability, and homelessness and it is Anorexia that has left me broken and sobbing, rending my soul more times than I can count.\n\nETA:  I did some further research[further research ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2440847/) on Refeeding Syndrome and it is definitely complicated but along the lines of what I describe. There are multiple key nutrients that can be incredibly low in anorexia patients.  Phosphorus and magnesium being two big ones and the spike in metabolism does cause a redistribution of them in the body. Basically when your metabolism kicks back in your body drives up it's insulin production among other things.  It starts trying to meet a higher energy demand by metabolizing food and fat.  Those chemical reactions both require many electrolytes and other nutrients.  Because the body has been draining its nutrient supplies for so long, it can't sustain the reaction and starts dipping into core stores in ways that are dangerous.  A very small portion of people with anorexia experience refeeding syndrome, but that portion is much higher for those given formula to stabilize during recovery.  Many formulas have since been adjusted to add these nutrients in, but there is still a danger.

          "body": "Thank you for your thoughtful questions. I will do my best to answer them.\n\nNo, not everyone experiences refeeding syndrome.  There are several risk factors for refeeding syndrome and it is more a thing to be cautious of than something that happens to everyone, sorta like how when you dock a boat, you often bump the dock, but only so often is it hit hard enough to damage one or the other. One of those risk factors is how much of your body mass you have lost and I (with my measly personal experience to reference) have met more people who experienced it in relapse than in their initial disorder.  Maybe this it because our first time we tend to ease in from a lifetime of developing unhealthy coping strategies and then we have a period of indecision and internal conflict when we are struggling with whether we are ready to get better.  That said, that is why a lot of people who need to be weight stabilized quickly are stabilized under supervision including ECGs and stuff.\n\nThere are also other physical symptoms that come with eating again.  This can include pain and bloating from an intestinal tract no longer as used to digestion.  When I started recovery, I would cry and compare food to chemotherapy as I knew it was making me better, but it made me so sick. (I had just walked alongside my sister through her second battle with leukemia) \n\nAll this is to say that you are not bad if your body was just able to eat again.  I am happy you were so lucky it is a thing to be proud of that your body was still able to start healing so immediately.  It is also there for the others reading to remind them that what they experienced was very real and taxing and that they are not alone either and have something to be proud of for surviving through it.\n\nAs to the order issue... The answer is yes and no.  Yes.  Your body does prefer to eat fat and then muscle, and then organs in that order, but it is also more complicated than that. You can drive a vast distance only fueling at the same station if it is done in many little trips.  If you drive a vast distance in one direction, you have to compromise.  Your body can only burn so much fat in one day and it can only convert so much muscle and still help you reach that oasis overflowing with fruit somewhere on the horizon.\n\nTo put it the other way, think about it from your body's perspective.  Let's say that (how to do this without numbers?) you need a small bucket of energy, pretend it is just like marbles.  It would prefer to just use food to fill the bucket, but you give it two handfuls.  That is only enough to fill a bit of the bucket. So then it goes to fat stores, but it is only able to consume so much fat in a day, like how you cannot instantly burn a log in it's entirety. So that is only a bit more of the bucket.  Now the bucket is only half full.  So then it tries to make the bucket smaller, to cut some off, so it makes you tired, hopes you will stay still today if there really is no food to be found. But there is still a deficit. It tries to take some muscle, but again, there can only be so much taken and so it only puts one handful in the bucket. So it needs more.  That is when it takes from your organs.  Because if it doesn't fill the metaphorical bucket, then the organs will die anyway.\n\nBasically it has to do not with the change itself, but the rate of change.  The boundary between weight loss and starvation is when food and fat alone can no longer fill that bucket. That is why \"healthy\" calorie deficits are small. We push things farther and that is why we get hurt.\n\nThe nutrients are also big because eating your fat and muscle does not give the bocy back much more than energy. If there are nutritional deficits, your body will start leeching them from the parts of the body that need them most sooner.\n\nThis also all needs to be fitted with the tagine that biology is weird and complicated and that for all of our studies, most of what we have formed are statistics and laws of averages.  There are always outliers and things continue to surprise us and defy solid definition.  It is a field of generalizations and probabilities as is medicine, which is why contemporary doctoring models push provider/patient communication to feel out the right path together.",

One of those risk factors is how much of your body mass you have lost and I (with my measly personal experience to reference) have met more people who experienced it in relapse than in their initial disorder.  Maybe this it because our first time we tend to ease in from a lifetime of developing unhealthy coping strategies and then we have a period of indecision and internal conflict when we are struggling with whether we are ready to get better.  That said, that is why a lot of people who need to be weight stabilized quickly are stabilized under supervision including ECGs and stuff.\n\nThere are also other physical symptoms that come with eating again.  This can include pain and bloating from an intestinal tract no longer as used to digestion.  When I started recovery, I would cry and compare food to chemotherapy as I knew it was making me better, but it made me so sick. (I had just walked alongside my sister through her second battle with leukemia) \n\nAll this is to say that you are not bad if your body was just able to eat again.  I am happy you were so lucky it is a thing to be proud of that your body was still able to start healing so immediately.  It is also there for the others reading to remind them that what they experienced was very real and taxing and that they are not alone either and have something to be proud of for surviving through it.\n\nAs to the order issue... The answer is yes and no.  Yes.  Your body does prefer to eat fat and then muscle, and then organs in that order, but it is also more complicated than that. You can drive a vast distance only fueling at the same station if it is done in many little trips.  If you drive a vast distance in one direction, you have to compromise.  Your body can only burn so much fat in one day and it can only convert so much muscle and still help you reach that oasis overflowing with fruit somewhere on the horizon.\n\nTo put it the other way, think about it from your body's perspective.  Let's say that (how to do this without numbers?) you need a small bucket of energy, pretend it is just like marbles.  It would prefer to just use food to fill the bucket, but you give it two handfuls.  That is only enough to fill a bit of the bucket. So then it goes to fat stores, but it is only able to consume so much fat in a day, like how you cannot instantly burn a log in it's entirety. So that is only a bit more of the bucket.  Now the bucket is only half full.  So then it tries to make the bucket smaller, to cut some off, so it makes you tired, hopes you will stay still today if there really is no food to be found. But there is still a deficit. It tries to take some muscle, but again, there can only be so much taken and so it only puts one handful in the bucket. So it needs more.  That is when it takes from your organs.  Because if it doesn't fill the metaphorical bucket, then the organs will die anyway.\n\nBasically it has to do not with the change itself, but the rate of change.  The boundary between weight loss and starvation is when food and fat alone can no longer fill that bucket. That is why \"healthy\" calorie deficits are small. We push things farther and that is why we get hurt.\n\nThe nutrients are also big because eating your fat and muscle does not give the bocy back much more than energy. If there are nutritional deficits, your body will start leeching them from the parts of the body that need them most sooner.\n\nThis also all needs to be fitted with the tagine that biology is weird and complicated and that for all of our studies, most of what we have formed are statistics and laws of averages.  There are always outliers and things continue to surprise us and defy solid definition.  It is a field of generalizations and probabilities as is medicine, which is why contemporary doctoring models push provider/patient communication to feel out the right path together.",

          "body": "You do start to die.  Even if you are still chubby.  As it has been explained to my by doctors and dieticians, your body only really has two stages of metabolism.  When you eat too little and are starving, you are starving.  There isn't easy starving or less starving, it is starving to death as you start to die.\n\nWhen you are starving your body no longer has enough energy, even if it is in a coma, even if it consumes as much of your body fat a day that it possibly can.  But your heart MUST beat. That is all your body knows.  So it starts killing anything it can to feed your blood and your heart.  It eats your kidney, your brain, your liver, your bones, even your heart.  It takes anything it can to make sure your heart is still beating in the morning. In reality, what starts to give out first depends a lot on what nutrients you are most devoid of.  But you are starving to death.  \n\nIt's an emergency measure, it can't last forever.  It is like when a plane depressurizes spontaneously and the masks drop down.  It isn't an endless supply of less convenient oxygen.  It's a small supply to give the pilot ten minutes to drop the plane to below a safe altitude where people will hopefully be able to breathe enough to not sustain brain damage.  Your body does everything it can to keep you going because we are animals. Hopefully if it can just get you over that mountain and into that valley, there will be an apple tree or a dead antelope or a pile of edible mushrooms something.\n\nSome people feel better, like they have unlimited energy.  Some people feel as if they are on their deathbed, a walking corpse slowly phasing through the mesh of the world till she dissappears.  Most people I know ping pong between the two. The voice in your head gets louder, you are still surviving still pushing forward, deeper, harder.  You don't feel hungry and when you do, you hogtie it like a captured animal, you tame it.  It becomes a vicious spiral.  People ask you to get help but you are finally so close to making a difference, to being small enough or invisible enough or real enough, to have earned whatever you have spent your whole life feeling like you weren't even worthy of living for.\n\nAnd then it cuts deep.  Your body is different, weight always comes off weird when starving, so you look alien at any BMI, your breasts gone, muscles gone, hair thinning, and then... Maybe you have back pain and your urine is dark or you start having heart fluttering and chest pain.  You don't know what to do about it what to make of it because you haven't had a clear thought in months that wasn't just shame. It takes you longer than you would expect, sometimes days, sometimes weeks, but you come to understand you are dying. You are no longer trading just your relationships and joy and energy and passion over in exchange for the whispers that promise you value, belonging, and control, you are trading your life.\n\nThat is when a lot of people seek help.  But that point can come at any weight. When I was a teenager I got help before that point and I was quite underweight.  My relapse 10 years later, I hit that point as my heart started to fail crossing from obese to overweight. And treatment is still reletively the same because whether someone is fat or not, they need to learn not to be so scared of being fat that their fear controls them.  They have to be able to live in their skin and not panic regardless of where there is fat on their body.\n\nYou didn't ask about this part, but the unfortunate reality of the body just knowing starving and not starving is that stabilizing can be super hard.  When you start eating again the body expects the organs to function normally.  It starts indescriminately balancing your nutrients across your body again, but your nutrient starved organs are already in a massive deficit and begin to starve even more.  This is called Refeeding Syndrome and can also kill you.  In order to avoid it, food has to be titrated back up, allowing nutrient levels to slowly rise along with metabolism, so that when metabolic recovery occurs, the organs can take it.\n\nBecause of these factors, Anorexia is the second deadliest mental illness, behind only opiate use disorder.  We can and do die, and even if we don't, at some point we have to emotionally contend with having spent months to years slowly dying.\n\nHope this helps a bit.  It is long, but like I wanted to try to capture why it is more complicated than just not eating and subsequently just eating again. I have survived rape, severe child abuse, disability, and homelessness and it is Anorexia that has left me broken and sobbing, rending my soul more times than I can count.\n\nETA:  I did some further research[further research ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2440847/) on Refeeding Syndrome and it is definitely complicated but along the lines of what I describe. There are multiple key nutrients that can be incredibly low in anorexia patients.  Phosphorus and magnesium being two big ones and the spike in metabolism does cause a redistribution of them in the body. Basically when your metabolism kicks back in your body drives up it's insulin production among other things.  It starts trying to meet a higher energy demand by metabolizing food and fat.  Those chemical reactions both require many electrolytes and other nutrients.  Because the body has been draining its nutrient supplies for so long, it can't sustain the reaction and starts dipping into core stores in ways that are dangerous.  A very small portion of people with anorexia experience refeeding syndrome, but that portion is much higher for those given formula to stabilize during recovery.  Many formulas have since been adjusted to add these nutrients in, but there is still a danger.   Hopefully this helps clarify things for some people.\n\nAs to the other things I have said, there is actually a dietitian in this thread under me who has a super incredible explanation of how all these internal mechanics work and how we build up damage in our bodies from malnutrition. I highly suggest reading their comment if you want to learn more.",

This is perfectly normal, as your body is a powerful self-repairing machine. All it needs is food and rest, and you are back to restored the next day.\n\nThis is why starving is so dangerous. If you don't eat, the body has a multitude of mechanisms to try to keep you going, take away from here to put there and so on. But it is designed to repair from food, so if you are not eating you are on a constant decline deteriorating your body all over. And the longer you stay on that track, the worse things get. Also, it's not going to sculpt itself the way you want it to in your mind. It won't just take fat from your chosen problem areas. It's going to eat up your muscles, let the joints deteriorate, etc. It's going to take from all over to keep going and it's not trying at all to be aesthetic. \n\n\\---\n\nAnd I'll add one more thing about weight loss. We in nutrition of course support weight loss goals. But the last thing we want to see is someone not eating, because it's actually counter productive. Your body shuts down, your systems lose their capabilities, and we can't do any exercise training because there's no repair phase without food.\n\nSo what we really want is for people to eat sufficient calories to keep all body systems going, and make sure those calories are high quality foods that provide all the nutrition the body needs to keep itself healthy. Because under that regime, you can lose body fat while feeling good, retain your full capabilities, and your strength, and we can even keep working on sculpting up doing exercise. \n\nBut if you don't eat, you are taking all the tools away. The body can't repair, your energy tanks, we can't do any training. And the damage you are causing your joints, internal organs and so on, will hold us back for a long time even after you start eating again because we have to go easy, and deal with a permanent knee pain, or whatever other problem you gave yourself from starving.\n\nSo to recap, if you really want progress in body changes, then make sure you are eating enough to keep your body healthy and cooperating with the weight loss process. As a rule of thumb, you need to eat enough that you have sufficient resources to be healthy, and enough energy to maintain an exercise program. That's the winning path. We can achieve great outcomes better and faster if we keep the body provided with the basic resources it needs daily.",

It wouldn't be an adaptation machine if it could only go one way, if it could only build things up but had no capacity to make things smaller. Autophagy is a term that refers to the body's processes on the \"tear down\" side of its ability for self-healing and adaptation.\n\nBoth build up and tear down happen all the time, at the same time, all day. Your body is constantly doing maintenance, self-healing and adaptation. In some area of your body, it might be doing some build up of muscles that you had to use today. In another area of your body, it might be decommissioning old cells, and weakening some muscles you haven't used in weeks and it thinks you no longer plan to use as much.\n\nYour body doesn't really need guidance on when to do tear down tasks, and you don't have much say in the matter other than to provide the resources and lifestyle choices and let the body do its thing. Your body will automatically remove unneeded cells, reuse energy cells like fat and muscle as needed, and weaken muscles that have not been in use. You can definitely accelerate this process by eating at a caloric deficit, but there's only so much you want to push your body in this direction because it's going to run its own show.\n\nFor instance, for people that are not eating enough food, for every 3lbs of body weight that you lose, 1lb might be from muscle mass lost. Your body decides that you are starving and then you probably don't need the muscles, and starts to tear them down for fuel. In the world of fitness and nutrition this is terrible, because building muscles is expensive (resource-wise) and hard to do (workout-wise), so giving up on some of your most precious cells due to misguided eating is a travesty.\n\nThe gold standard for weight loss in fitness is to optimize your calories so that you have enough nutrition so that the body doesn't go into starvation protocols, while also maintaining a strength training regime to signal to your body that the muscles are indeed needed and not to be consumed for fuel. This means a person would eat enough calories to keep healthy and enough energy to exercise, and would exercise regularly while maintaining a reasonable caloric deficit (eat less than you need to maintain your weight, but without going so far to threaten your body with starvation). Under these conditions, we know that the body will continue to sculpt via build up and tear down, but overall will allow the muscle mass to remain and focus primarily on burning the fat stores for energy. This is the mode that a fitness or nutrition coach want. This is the best winning condition to strive for.\n\nStudies show that people that strive for this regime, will lose a lot less muscle along their weight loss journey. And those that optimize this regime can actually gain muscle (if that's their goal because it takes a lot of hard work in resistance training) while losing fat.\n\n\\---\n\nAlso, because I haven't said it yet and its an important tidbit: exercise can burn more energy than you can lose through starvation.\n\nWe see pro athletes easily burn 10k calories in a day from just doing their craft. When your body is optimized like a performance machine, it can do quick work of calories and body fat. But on the opposite end, during starvation, your metabolism may get so slow that even if you are not eating anything at all you might only be losing 800 calories per day.\n\n800 calories is the average workout of a 200lb man doing serious resistance training. So an average person that is conditioned for the gym, could easily lose the same 800 calories just by doing a workout, while the person starving has to be miserable all day, not eating anything at all, letting their body break down and become endangered, jut to lose the same calories as a regular man doing a workout.\n\nThis is why I said it's not just safer to lose weight while eating healthy, it is also more effective and faster. Not to mention that the nutrient-deprived starved body shape is not what you see in magazines. The shape people want is that of a person that has healthy strength, and that simply cannot be achieved by starving. So might as well work on both at the same time, by maintaining a healthy level of calories and keeping up with a workout plan.\n\nIf you are really serious about faster body changes, then seek to turn your body into an optimized machine so that it can go through calories faster. Otherwise known as the most vanilla advice we've all heard already: eat healthy and exercise more.",

I told my husband he needs to go with me to my primary but he won\u2019t go until next Thursday and I admit I am very anxious and afraid. I have tried to explain to her over and over that between pain and fatigue from MS I am in bed most of the day and sleep way way too much as I can\u2019t stay awake. She says I\u2019m depressed. Well sure that would depress anyone I would think\u2014but depression isn\u2019t why I don\u2019t eat. I don\u2019t feel heard by her or my husband. I have a dietitian at my MS Center\u2014I can reach out to her again. She knows this happened once before and has now happened again but this time is worse because of the extreme pain and not being able to move without pain. She originally recommended the Orgain. She said a few months ago to keep up with those as well as other meal ideas, however I haven\u2019t been able to eat the meals, I seriously feel sick when I eat. It isn\u2019t normal.

This is perfectly normal, as your body is a powerful self-repairing machine. All it needs is food and rest, and you are back to restored the next day.\n\nThis is why starving is so dangerous. If you don't eat, the body has a multitude of mechanisms to try to keep you going, take away from here to put there and so on. But it is designed to repair from food, so if you are not eating you are on a constant decline deteriorating your body all over. And the longer you stay on that track, the worse things get. Also, it's not going to sculpt itself the way you want it to in your mind. It won't just take fat from your chosen problem areas. It's going to eat up your muscles, let the joints deteriorate, etc. It's going to take from all over to keep going and it's not trying at all to be aesthetic. \n\n\\---\n\nAnd I'll add one more thing about weight loss. We in nutrition of course support weight loss goals. But the last thing we want to see is someone not eating, because it's actually counter productive. Your body shuts down, your systems lose their capabilities, and we can't do any exercise training because there's no repair phase without food.\n\nSo what we really want is for people to eat sufficient calories to keep all body systems going, and make sure those calories are high quality foods that provide all the nutrition the body needs to keep itself healthy. Because under that regime, you can lose body fat while feeling good, retain your full capabilities, and your strength, and we can even keep working on sculpting up doing exercise. \n\nBut if you don't eat, you are taking all the tools away. The body can't repair, your energy tanks, we can't do any training. And the damage you are causing your joints, internal organs and so on, will hold us back for a long time even after you start eating again because we have to go easy, and deal with a permanent knee pain, or whatever other problem you gave yourself from starving.\n\nSo to recap, if you really want progress in body changes, then make sure you are eating enough to keep your body healthy and cooperating with the weight loss process. As a rule of thumb, you need to eat enough that you have sufficient resources to be healthy, and enough energy to maintain an exercise program. That's the winning path. We can achieve great outcomes better and faster if we keep the body provided with the basic resources it needs daily.",

          "body": "I understand this as an explanation of how the body works. I know this is an old post but I desperately need help. I posted this above too. Can you please give advice on how to recover? My post above:\n\nI\u2019ve just learned if refeeding syndrome and I am afraid like no other time. Not even being dx with MS. How do you avoid this? Do you need to work with someone? If so who? I was going to buckle down ask yet again for an appetite stimulant and hopefully start eating every single day. Since I\u2019m in pain a lot from MS, I sleep a lot. I miss eating. Drinking water. It complicated and I don\u2019t need to rattle on about it. My private primary has known for a few years now (this time, and a few years a few years before this time) that I struggle to eat, I\u2019m not hungry. I am underweight, not hugely, but I want 10 pounds on me and have been down much lower. She just says meal plan. If I could do that I wouldn\u2019t have this issue. I don\u2019t know who to turn to for help. I desperately need help. I really thought, well I will ask my old psychiatrist for the antipsychotic that makes you hungry (I forgot name right now). He isn\u2019t a therapist on disordered eating. But I have been on it before for anxiety and didn\u2019t know it would make me so uncomfortable hungry. As in he gave me a small amount to sleep. But it made me so hungry I couldn\u2019t sleep\u2014I would have to eat and eat\u2014abs I never felt full until it wore off. I did not have an issue with eating at that time so we stopped it. But I thought I could ask him for it again so I can have an appetite that breaks through all the pain I am in and the depression from basically being bedbound from pain (MS).\n\nMy bloodwork for last few years comes back weird abs my primary says oh must be malnutrition. But does nothing to help. I reached out about being afraid I\u2019m dehydrated all the time and she said as long as I ate abs just drank water I didn\u2019t need anything else to rehydrate. But I\u2019m not eating and I don\u2019t drink as much water as I should because again I\u2019m asleep. She is a private 24/7 doctor I have stayed with when she stopped taking insurance abs went private. But she is not helping. Not really. It is like she just doesn\u2019t understand that all these things are real. My blood work says so.\n\nSo now what do I do? I\u2019m terrified to start just normal eating again because of syndrome. Plus I feel sick and full super fast\u2014stomach shrunk? I don\u2019t know why. I\u2019m afraid. I just fall asleep and don\u2019t realize it. I hurt. My dad just died that threw me off big time too. I\u2019m very aware of death.\n\nI don\u2019t want to die. I want to be normal again. I do have injuries that disabled me beyond MS. That sent me into this latest spiral almost 3 years ago. I need that addressed to, mostly pain. And the trauma of how it happened. But I want to be me again. I want to be a mom to my darling child again. She was barely 5 when those injuries happened and just turned 8. I want to be with her not in bed. I want to eat with her. I wish I had her appetite! She is growing always and is very tall, I am very short. I watch her and I am so ashamed I can\u2019t eat like her, that I don\u2019t join her when she wants me to sit and eat with her. I do not. I\u2019m in bed.  I\u2019m so ashamed. I don\u2019t want to die.\n\nBut now if I start to eat again I can sue just from eating? I read this earlier tonight on Mayo by accident. I had no idea.\n\nCan you or anyone please tell me how to put my nutrition in order again? Can I die if I do this alone? I would love local resources, but I\u2019m afraid to out myself where I live. Someone please, what do I do?\n\nI\u2019m so terrified of Covid because I am immune compromised. I could never ever see myself in patient. I know that sounds like I\u2019m a freak\u2014-but it is a huge fear of mine. Not dying of Covid, of becoming more disabled. That limits my options plus I have zero support for my child on nights my husband works. It is one night out of house, and one in house. I have no support for her. None. He does everything except those two nights. But we have no one not one friend or family member who can help cover that night he teaches in city. I am so trapped by fear. I am desperately seeking help. I need to feel safe in my own body. I never have, and now even less so, how is that even  possible?\n\nHelp please. Where and who can help me? What is first step? If I start eating more  will this syndrome happen? It is terrifying.",

          "body": "Thank you for your thoughtful questions. I will do my best to answer them.\n\nNo, not everyone experiences refeeding syndrome.  There are several risk factors for refeeding syndrome and it is more a thing to be cautious of than something that happens to everyone, sorta like how when you dock a boat, you often bump the dock, but only so often is it hit hard enough to damage one or the other. One of those risk factors is how much of your body mass you have lost and I (with my measly personal experience to reference) have met more people who experienced it in relapse than in their initial disorder.  Maybe this it because our first time we tend to ease in from a lifetime of developing unhealthy coping strategies and then we have a period of indecision and internal conflict when we are struggling with whether we are ready to get better.  That said, that is why a lot of people who need to be weight stabilized quickly are stabilized under supervision including ECGs and stuff.\n\nThere are also other physical symptoms that come with eating again.  This can include pain and bloating from an intestinal tract no longer as used to digestion.  When I started recovery, I would cry and compare food to chemotherapy as I knew it was making me better, but it made me so sick. (I had just walked alongside my sister through her second battle with leukemia) \n\nAll this is to say that you are not bad if your body was just able to eat again.  I am happy you were so lucky it is a thing to be proud of that your body was still able to start healing so immediately.  It is also there for the others reading to remind them that what they experienced was very real and taxing and that they are not alone either and have something to be proud of for surviving through it.\n\nAs to the order issue... The answer is yes and no.  Yes.  Your body does prefer to eat fat and then muscle, and then organs in that order, but it is also more complicated than that. You can drive a vast distance only fueling at the same station if it is done in many little trips.  If you drive a vast distance in one direction, you have to compromise.  Your body can only burn so much fat in one day and it can only convert so much muscle and still help you reach that oasis overflowing with fruit somewhere on the horizon.\n\nTo put it the other way, think about it from your body's perspective.  Let's say that (how to do this without numbers?) you need a small bucket of energy, pretend it is just like marbles.  It would prefer to just use food to fill the bucket, but you give it two handfuls.  That is only enough to fill a bit of the bucket. So then it goes to fat stores, but it is only able to consume so much fat in a day, like how you cannot instantly burn a log in it's entirety. So that is only a bit more of the bucket.  Now the bucket is only half full.  So then it tries to make the bucket smaller, to cut some off, so it makes you tired, hopes you will stay still today if there really is no food to be found. But there is still a deficit. It tries to take some muscle, but again, there can only be so much taken and so it only puts one handful in the bucket. So it needs more.  That is when it takes from your organs.  Because if it doesn't fill the metaphorical bucket, then the organs will die anyway.\n\nBasically it has to do not with the change itself, but the rate of change.  The boundary between weight loss and starvation is when food and fat alone can no longer fill that bucket. That is why \"healthy\" calorie deficits are small. We push things farther and that is why we get hurt.\n\nThe nutrients are also big because eating your fat and muscle does not give the bocy back much more than energy. If there are nutritional deficits, your body will start leeching them from the parts of the body that need them most sooner.\n\nThis also all needs to be fitted with the tagine that biology is weird and complicated and that for all of our studies, most of what we have formed are statistics and laws of averages.  There are always outliers and things continue to surprise us and defy solid definition.  It is a field of generalizations and probabilities as is medicine, which is why contemporary doctoring models push provider/patient communication to feel out the right path together.",

When you eat too little and are starving, you are starving.  There isn't easy starving or less starving, it is starving to death as you start to die.\n\nWhen you are starving your body no longer has enough energy, even if it is in a coma, even if it consumes as much of your body fat a day that it possibly can.  But your heart MUST beat. That is all your body knows.  So it starts killing anything it can to feed your blood and your heart.  It eats your kidney, your brain, your liver, your bones, even your heart.  It takes anything it can to make sure your heart is still beating in the morning. In reality, what starts to give out first depends a lot on what nutrients you are most devoid of.  But you are starving to death.  \n\nIt's an emergency measure, it can't last forever.  It is like when a plane depressurizes spontaneously and the masks drop down.  It isn't an endless supply of less convenient oxygen.  It's a small supply to give the pilot ten minutes to drop the plane to below a safe altitude where people will hopefully be able to breathe enough to not sustain brain damage.  Your body does everything it can to keep you going because we are animals. Hopefully if it can just get you over that mountain and into that valley, there will be an apple tree or a dead antelope or a pile of edible mushrooms something.\n\nSome people feel better, like they have unlimited energy.  Some people feel as if they are on their deathbed, a walking corpse slowly phasing through the mesh of the world till she dissappears.  Most people I know ping pong between the two. The voice in your head gets louder, you are still surviving still pushing forward, deeper, harder.  You don't feel hungry and when you do, you hogtie it like a captured animal, you tame it.  It becomes a vicious spiral.  People ask you to get help but you are finally so close to making a difference, to being small enough or invisible enough or real enough, to have earned whatever you have spent your whole life feeling like you weren't even worthy of living for.\n\nAnd then it cuts deep.  Your body is different, weight always comes off weird when starving, so you look alien at any BMI, your breasts gone, muscles gone, hair thinning, and then... Maybe you have back pain and your urine is dark or you start having heart fluttering and chest pain.  You don't know what to do about it what to make of it because you haven't had a clear thought in months that wasn't just shame. It takes you longer than you would expect, sometimes days, sometimes weeks, but you come to understand you are dying. You are no longer trading just your relationships and joy and energy and passion over in exchange for the whispers that promise you value, belonging, and control, you are trading your life.\n\nThat is when a lot of people seek help.  But that point can come at any weight. When I was a teenager I got help before that point and I was quite underweight.  My relapse 10 years later, I hit that point as my heart started to fail crossing from obese to overweight. And treatment is still reletively the same because whether someone is fat or not, they need to learn not to be so scared of being fat that their fear controls them.  They have to be able to live in their skin and not panic regardless of where there is fat on their body.\n\nYou didn't ask about this part, but the unfortunate reality of the body just knowing starving and not starving is that stabilizing can be super hard.  When you start eating again the body expects the organs to function normally.  It starts indescriminately balancing your nutrients across your body again, but your nutrient starved organs are already in a massive deficit and begin to starve even more.  This is called Refeeding Syndrome and can also kill you.  In order to avoid it, food has to be titrated back up, allowing nutrient levels to slowly rise along with metabolism, so that when metabolic recovery occurs, the organs can take it.\n\nBecause of these factors, Anorexia is the second deadliest mental illness, behind only opiate use disorder.  We can and do die, and even if we don't, at some point we have to emotionally contend with having spent months to years slowly dying.\n\nHope this helps a bit.  It is long, but like I wanted to try to capture why it is more complicated than just not eating and subsequently just eating again. I have survived rape, severe child abuse, disability, and homelessness and it is Anorexia that has left me broken and sobbing, rending my soul more times than I can count.\n\nETA:  I did some further research[further research ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2440847/) on Refeeding Syndrome and it is definitely complicated but along the lines of what I describe. There are multiple key nutrients that can be incredibly low in anorexia patients.  Phosphorus and magnesium being two big ones and the spike in metabolism does cause a redistribution of them in the body. Basically when your metabolism kicks back in your body drives up it's insulin production among other things.  It starts trying to meet a higher energy demand by metabolizing food and fat.  Those chemical reactions both require many electrolytes and other nutrients.  Because the body has been draining its nutrient supplies for so long, it can't sustain the reaction and starts dipping into core stores in ways that are dangerous.  A very small portion of people with anorexia experience refeeding syndrome, but that portion is much higher for those given formula to stabilize during recovery.  Many formulas have since been adjusted to add these nutrients in, but there is still a danger.   Hopefully this helps clarify things for some people.\n\nAs to the other things I have said, there is actually a dietitian in this thread under me who has a super incredible explanation of how all these internal mechanics work and how we build up damage in our bodies from malnutrition. I highly suggest reading their comment if you want to learn more.",

When I began recovery, it wasn\u2019t much of a process. I simply started eating normally again after years, and this meant greasy and unhealthy food sometimes. I\u2019m wondering why I didn\u2019t experience refeeding syndrome even though I didn\u2019t titrate back up. Does everyone who faces eating disorders for a long time experience it? Additionally, you said something along the lines of \u201cstarving is just as dangerous at any weight\u201d and I\u2019ve wondered about this, always being slightly above average weight. Does the body not burn in order, like, does it not always start with fat storage, go to muscle, and then organs? It can begin anywhere when it\u2019s starving? is this why it\u2019s just as dangerous at any weight? Because you\u2019re burning fat, muscle, and organs, and you\u2019re depriving your body of nutrients?",

This is perfectly normal, as your body is a powerful self-repairing machine. All it needs is food and rest, and you are back to restored the next day.\n\nThis is why starving is so dangerous. If you don't eat, the body has a multitude of mechanisms to try to keep you going, take away from here to put there and so on. But it is designed to repair from food, so if you are not eating you are on a constant decline deteriorating your body all over. And the longer you stay on that track, the worse things get. Also, it's not going to sculpt itself the way you want it to in your mind. It won't just take fat from your chosen problem areas. It's going to eat up your muscles, let the joints deteriorate, etc. It's going to take from all over to keep going and it's not trying at all to be aesthetic. \n\n\\---\n\nAnd I'll add one more thing about weight loss. We in nutrition of course support weight loss goals. But the last thing we want to see is someone not eating, because it's actually counter productive. Your body shuts down, your systems lose their capabilities, and we can't do any exercise training because there's no repair phase without food.\n\nSo what we really want is for people to eat sufficient calories to keep all body systems going, and make sure those calories are high quality foods that provide all the nutrition the body needs to keep itself healthy. Because under that regime, you can lose body fat while feeling good, retain your full capabilities, and your strength, and we can even keep working on sculpting up doing exercise. \n\nBut if you don't eat, you are taking all the tools away. The body can't repair, your energy tanks, we can't do any training. And the damage you are causing your joints, internal organs and so on, will hold us back for a long time even after you start eating again because we have to go easy, and deal with a permanent knee pain, or whatever other problem you gave yourself from starving.\n\nSo to recap, if you really want progress in body changes, then make sure you are eating enough to keep your body healthy and cooperating with the weight loss process. As a rule of thumb, you need to eat enough that you have sufficient resources to be healthy, and enough energy to maintain an exercise program. That's the winning path. We can achieve great outcomes better and faster if we keep the body provided with the basic resources it needs daily.",

Can you please give advice on how to recover? My post above:\n\nI\u2019ve just learned if refeeding syndrome and I am afraid like no other time. Not even being dx with MS. How do you avoid this? Do you need to work with someone? If so who? I was going to buckle down ask yet again for an appetite stimulant and hopefully start eating every single day. Since I\u2019m in pain a lot from MS, I sleep a lot. I miss eating. Drinking water. It complicated and I don\u2019t need to rattle on about it. My private primary has known for a few years now (this time, and a few years a few years before this time) that I struggle to eat, I\u2019m not hungry. I am underweight, not hugely, but I want 10 pounds on me and have been down much lower. She just says meal plan. If I could do that I wouldn\u2019t have this issue. I don\u2019t know who to turn to for help. I desperately need help. I really thought, well I will ask my old psychiatrist for the antipsychotic that makes you hungry (I forgot name right now). He isn\u2019t a therapist on disordered eating. But I have been on it before for anxiety and didn\u2019t know it would make me so uncomfortable hungry. As in he gave me a small amount to sleep. But it made me so hungry I couldn\u2019t sleep\u2014I would have to eat and eat\u2014abs I never felt full until it wore off. I did not have an issue with eating at that time so we stopped it. But I thought I could ask him for it again so I can have an appetite that breaks through all the pain I am in and the depression from basically being bedbound from pain (MS).\n\nMy bloodwork for last few years comes back weird abs my primary says oh must be malnutrition. But does nothing to help. I reached out about being afraid I\u2019m dehydrated all the time and she said as long as I ate abs just drank water I didn\u2019t need anything else to rehydrate. But I\u2019m not eating and I don\u2019t drink as much water as I should because again I\u2019m asleep. She is a private 24/7 doctor I have stayed with when she stopped taking insurance abs went private. But she is not helping. Not really. It is like she just doesn\u2019t understand that all these things are real. My blood work says so.\n\nSo now what do I do? I\u2019m terrified to start just normal eating again because of syndrome. Plus I feel sick and full super fast\u2014stomach shrunk? I don\u2019t know why. I\u2019m afraid. I just fall asleep and don\u2019t realize it. I hurt. My dad just died that threw me off big time too. I\u2019m very aware of death.\n\nI don\u2019t want to die. I want to be normal again. I do have injuries that disabled me beyond MS. That sent me into this latest spiral almost 3 years ago. I need that addressed to, mostly pain. And the trauma of how it happened. But I want to be me again. I want to be a mom to my darling child again. She was barely 5 when those injuries happened and just turned 8. I want to be with her not in bed. I want to eat with her. I wish I had her appetite! She is growing always and is very tall, I am very short. I watch her and I am so ashamed I can\u2019t eat like her, that I don\u2019t join her when she wants me to sit and eat with her. I do not. I\u2019m in bed.  I\u2019m so ashamed. I don\u2019t want to die.\n\nBut now if I start to eat again I can sue just from eating? I read this earlier tonight on Mayo by accident. I had no idea.\n\nCan you or anyone please tell me how to put my nutrition in order again? Can I die if I do this alone? I would love local resources, but I\u2019m afraid to out myself where I live. Someone please, what do I do?\n\nI\u2019m so terrified of Covid because I am immune compromised. I could never ever see myself in patient. I know that sounds like I\u2019m a freak\u2014-but it is a huge fear of mine. Not dying of Covid, of becoming more disabled. That limits my options plus I have zero support for my child on nights my husband works. It is one night out of house, and one in house. I have no support for her. None. He does everything except those two nights. But we have no one not one friend or family member who can help cover that night he teaches in city. I am so trapped by fear. I am desperately seeking help. I need to feel safe in my own body. I never have, and now even less so, how is that even  possible?\n\nHelp please. Where and who can help me? What is first step? If I start eating more  will this syndrome happen? It is terrifying.",

          "body": "You do start to die.  Even if you are still chubby.  As it has been explained to my by doctors and dieticians, your body only really has two stages of metabolism.  When you eat too little and are starving, you are starving.  There isn't easy starving or less starving, it is starving to death as you start to die.\n\nWhen you are starving your body no longer has enough energy, even if it is in a coma, even if it consumes as much of your body fat a day that it possibly can.  But your heart MUST beat. That is all your body knows.  So it starts killing anything it can to feed your blood and your heart.  It eats your kidney, your brain, your liver, your bones, even your heart.  It takes anything it can to make sure your heart is still beating in the morning. In reality, what starts to give out first depends a lot on what nutrients you are most devoid of.  But you are starving to death.  \n\nIt's an emergency measure, it can't last forever.  It is like when a plane depressurizes spontaneously and the masks drop down.  It isn't an endless supply of less convenient oxygen.  It's a small supply to give the pilot ten minutes to drop the plane to below a safe altitude where people will hopefully be able to breathe enough to not sustain brain damage.  Your body does everything it can to keep you going because we are animals. Hopefully if it can just get you over that mountain and into that valley, there will be an apple tree or a dead antelope or a pile of edible mushrooms something.\n\nSome people feel better, like they have unlimited energy.  Some people feel as if they are on their deathbed, a walking corpse slowly phasing through the mesh of the world till she dissappears.  Most people I know ping pong between the two. The voice in your head gets louder, you are still surviving still pushing forward, deeper, harder.  You don't feel hungry and when you do, you hogtie it like a captured animal, you tame it.  It becomes a vicious spiral.  People ask you to get help but you are finally so close to making a difference, to being small enough or invisible enough or real enough, to have earned whatever you have spent your whole life feeling like you weren't even worthy of living for.\n\nAnd then it cuts deep.  Your body is different, weight always comes off weird when starving, so you look alien at any BMI, your breasts gone, muscles gone, hair thinning, and then... Maybe you have back pain and your urine is dark or you start having heart fluttering and chest pain.  You don't know what to do about it what to make of it because you haven't had a clear thought in months that wasn't just shame. It takes you longer than you would expect, sometimes days, sometimes weeks, but you come to understand you are dying. You are no longer trading just your relationships and joy and energy and passion over in exchange for the whispers that promise you value, belonging, and control, you are trading your life.\n\nThat is when a lot of people seek help.  But that point can come at any weight. When I was a teenager I got help before that point and I was quite underweight.  My relapse 10 years later, I hit that point as my heart started to fail crossing from obese to overweight. And treatment is still reletively the same because whether someone is fat or not, they need to learn not to be so scared of being fat that their fear controls them.  They have to be able to live in their skin and not panic regardless of where there is fat on their body.\n\nYou didn't ask about this part, but the unfortunate reality of the body just knowing starving and not starving is that stabilizing can be super hard.  When you start eating again the body expects the organs to function normally.  It starts indescriminately balancing your nutrients across your body again, but your nutrient starved organs are already in a massive deficit and begin to starve even more.  This is called Refeeding Syndrome and can also kill you.  In order to avoid it, food has to be titrated back up, allowing nutrient levels to slowly rise along with metabolism, so that when metabolic recovery occurs, the organs can take it.\n\nBecause of these factors, Anorexia is the second deadliest mental illness, behind only opiate use disorder.  We can and do die, and even if we don't, at some point we have to emotionally contend with having spent months to years slowly dying.\n\nHope this helps a bit.  It is long, but like I wanted to try to capture why it is more complicated than just not eating and subsequently just eating again. I have survived rape, severe child abuse, disability, and homelessness and it is Anorexia that has left me broken and sobbing, rending my soul more times than I can count.\n\nETA:  I did some further research[further research ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2440847/) on Refeeding Syndrome and it is definitely complicated but along the lines of what I describe. There are multiple key nutrients that can be incredibly low in anorexia patients.  Phosphorus and magnesium being two big ones and the spike in metabolism does cause a redistribution of them in the body. Basically when your metabolism kicks back in your body drives up it's insulin production among other things.  It starts trying to meet a higher energy demand by metabolizing food and fat.  Those chemical reactions both require many electrolytes and other nutrients.  Because the body has been draining its nutrient supplies for so long, it can't sustain the reaction and starts dipping into core stores in ways that are dangerous.  A very small portion of people with anorexia experience refeeding syndrome, but that portion is much higher for those given formula to stabilize during recovery.  Many formulas have since been adjusted to add these nutrients in, but there is still a danger.   Hopefully this helps clarify things for some people.\n\nAs to the other things I have said, there is actually a dietitian in this thread under me who has a super incredible explanation of how all these internal mechanics work and how we build up damage in our bodies from malnutrition. I highly suggest reading their comment if you want to learn more.",

          "body": "I really appreciate the thoroughness of your response. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. I have a couple additional questions if you feel comfortable answering. When I began recovery, it wasn\u2019t much of a process. I simply started eating normally again after years, and this meant greasy and unhealthy food sometimes. I\u2019m wondering why I didn\u2019t experience refeeding syndrome even though I didn\u2019t titrate back up. Does everyone who faces eating disorders for a long time experience it? Additionally, you said something along the lines of \u201cstarving is just as dangerous at any weight\u201d and I\u2019ve wondered about this, always being slightly above average weight. Does the body not burn in order, like, does it not always start with fat storage, go to muscle, and then organs? It can begin anywhere when it\u2019s starving? is this why it\u2019s just as dangerous at any weight? Because you\u2019re burning fat, muscle, and organs, and you\u2019re depriving your body of nutrients?",

          "body": ">\u201cstarving is just as dangerous at any weight\u201d\n\nI'm formally trained in nutrition, so I wanted to step in as a PSA.\n\nEverything you do all day puts wear and tear on your body. This is perfectly normal, as your body is a powerful self-repairing machine. All it needs is food and rest, and you are back to restored the next day.\n\nThis is why starving is so dangerous. If you don't eat, the body has a multitude of mechanisms to try to keep you going, take away from here to put there and so on. But it is designed to repair from food, so if you are not eating you are on a constant decline deteriorating your body all over. And the longer you stay on that track, the worse things get. Also, it's not going to sculpt itself the way you want it to in your mind. It won't just take fat from your chosen problem areas. It's going to eat up your muscles, let the joints deteriorate, etc. It's going to take from all over to keep going and it's not trying at all to be aesthetic. \n\n\\---\n\nAnd I'll add one more thing about weight loss. We in nutrition of course support weight loss goals. But the last thing we want to see is someone not eating, because it's actually counter productive. Your body shuts down, your systems lose their capabilities, and we can't do any exercise training because there's no repair phase without food.\n\nSo what we really want is for people to eat sufficient calories to keep all body systems going, and make sure those calories are high quality foods that provide all the nutrition the body needs to keep itself healthy. Because under that regime, you can lose body fat while feeling good, retain your full capabilities, and your strength, and we can even keep working on sculpting up doing exercise. \n\nBut if you don't eat, you are taking all the tools away. The body can't repair, your energy tanks, we can't do any training. And the damage you are causing your joints, internal organs and so on, will hold us back for a long time even after you start eating again because we have to go easy, and deal with a permanent knee pain, or whatever other problem you gave yourself from starving.\n\nSo to recap, if you really want progress in body changes, then make sure you are eating enough to keep your body healthy and cooperating with the weight loss process. As a rule of thumb, you need to eat enough that you have sufficient resources to be healthy, and enough energy to maintain an exercise program. That's the winning path. We can achieve great outcomes better and faster if we keep the body provided with the basic resources it needs daily.",

          "body": "I understand this as an explanation of how the body works. I know this is an old post but I desperately need help. I posted this above too. Can you please give advice on how to recover? My post above:\n\nI\u2019ve just learned if refeeding syndrome and I am afraid like no other time. Not even being dx with MS. How do you avoid this? Do you need to work with someone? If so who? I was going to buckle down ask yet again for an appetite stimulant and hopefully start eating every single day. Since I\u2019m in pain a lot from MS, I sleep a lot. I miss eating. Drinking water. It complicated and I don\u2019t need to rattle on about it. My private primary has known for a few years now (this time, and a few years a few years before this time) that I struggle to eat, I\u2019m not hungry. I am underweight, not hugely, but I want 10 pounds on me and have been down much lower. She just says meal plan. If I could do that I wouldn\u2019t have this issue. I don\u2019t know who to turn to for help. I desperately need help. I really thought, well I will ask my old psychiatrist for the antipsychotic that makes you hungry (I forgot name right now). He isn\u2019t a therapist on disordered eating. But I have been on it before for anxiety and didn\u2019t know it would make me so uncomfortable hungry. As in he gave me a small amount to sleep. But it made me so hungry I couldn\u2019t sleep\u2014I would have to eat and eat\u2014abs I never felt full until it wore off. I did not have an issue with eating at that time so we stopped it. But I thought I could ask him for it again so I can have an appetite that breaks through all the pain I am in and the depression from basically being bedbound from pain (MS).\n\nMy bloodwork for last few years comes back weird abs my primary says oh must be malnutrition. But does nothing to help. I reached out about being afraid I\u2019m dehydrated all the time and she said as long as I ate abs just drank water I didn\u2019t need anything else to rehydrate. But I\u2019m not eating and I don\u2019t drink as much water as I should because again I\u2019m asleep. She is a private 24/7 doctor I have stayed with when she stopped taking insurance abs went private. But she is not helping. Not really. It is like she just doesn\u2019t understand that all these things are real. My blood work says so.\n\nSo now what do I do? I\u2019m terrified to start just normal eating again because of syndrome. Plus I feel sick and full super fast\u2014stomach shrunk? I don\u2019t know why. I\u2019m afraid. I just fall asleep and don\u2019t realize it. I hurt. My dad just died that threw me off big time too. I\u2019m very aware of death.\n\nI don\u2019t want to die. I want to be normal again. I do have injuries that disabled me beyond MS. That sent me into this latest spiral almost 3 years ago. I need that addressed to, mostly pain. And the trauma of how it happened. But I want to be me again. I want to be a mom to my darling child again. She was barely 5 when those injuries happened and just turned 8. I want to be with her not in bed. I want to eat with her. I wish I had her appetite! She is growing always and is very tall, I am very short. I watch her and I am so ashamed I can\u2019t eat like her, that I don\u2019t join her when she wants me to sit and eat with her. I do not. I\u2019m in bed.  I\u2019m so ashamed. I don\u2019t want to die.\n\nBut now if I start to eat again I can sue just from eating? I read this earlier tonight on Mayo by accident. I had no idea.\n\nCan you or anyone please tell me how to put my nutrition in order again? Can I die if I do this alone? I would love local resources, but I\u2019m afraid to out myself where I live. Someone please, what do I do?\n\nI\u2019m so terrified of Covid because I am immune compromised. I could never ever see myself in patient. I know that sounds like I\u2019m a freak\u2014-but it is a huge fear of mine. Not dying of Covid, of becoming more disabled. That limits my options plus I have zero support for my child on nights my husband works. It is one night out of house, and one in house. I have no support for her. None. He does everything except those two nights. But we have no one not one friend or family member who can help cover that night he teaches in city. I am so trapped by fear. I am desperately seeking help. I need to feel safe in my own body. I never have, and now even less so, how is that even  possible?\n\nHelp please. Where and who can help me? What is first step? If I start eating more  will this syndrome happen? It is terrifying.",

          "body": "Thavk you so much for your kindness. I do drink Orgain Nutrition Shakes, in hopes it has the nutrients I need, macro and micro. I told my husband he needs to go with me to my primary but he won\u2019t go until next Thursday and I admit I am very anxious and afraid. I have tried to explain to her over and over that between pain and fatigue from MS I am in bed most of the day and sleep way way too much as I can\u2019t stay awake. She says I\u2019m depressed. Well sure that would depress anyone I would think\u2014but depression isn\u2019t why I don\u2019t eat. I don\u2019t feel heard by her or my husband. I have a dietitian at my MS Center\u2014I can reach out to her again. She knows this happened once before and has now happened again but this time is worse because of the extreme pain and not being able to move without pain. She originally recommended the Orgain. She said a few months ago to keep up with those as well as other meal ideas, however I haven\u2019t been able to eat the meals, I seriously feel sick when I eat. It isn\u2019t normal. I\u2019m afraid.",
