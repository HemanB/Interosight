Your ED, and what you have gone through and go through because of it, is valid and you are always deserving of recovery.",

You are still completely valid, it\u2019s just different types of brains reacting differently to an eating disorder. In the end I guess it helped me a little because I was able to finally decide and commit to recovery, while before I was fighting it. XX",

I'll be really stressed about it but if I'm out with people I can definitely switch into \"eat like you're not a crazy person\" mode. I also will stop restricting for a while, still stressing about food but not under eating, gain XX lbs, then go back to a big deficit. It definitely makes it easy for me to conclude that I don't have a problem with food/weight lol.",
