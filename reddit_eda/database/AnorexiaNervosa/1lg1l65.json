If you don\u2019t eat you\u2019ll just loose weight until your body gives out, and that\u2019s not how it works when you\u2019re at a lower weight. \n\nAnd OP you ARE valid for this. I feel the same way, and I really agree with you. I\u2019ve been in forced recovery for over a year now, and I eat even more (in volume) than the people around me. Most people just don\u2019t know what like foods are high In volume (low cal), and what foods are low volume (high cal)",
