  "selftext": "Everybody is saying now that I look \"so healthy\" and \"so much better\" because it's very obvious I've gained weight since I stopped doing drugs about two months ago... and it's killing me. I'm sure we can all agree that us people with EDs don't like to be told we \"look healthy\" because our goal is to look practically unhealthily skinny, right? Or at least that's my goal...\n\nThis is so triggering. I've been so triggered for weeks now. I feel like I'll never lose this weight and I'll just keep gaining and gaining until I'm what I perceive on myself to be \"fat.\"  I'm so scared. I feel like this is the beginning of the end for me in a way. I feel like I'll never have the body I'm content with again. I'm 23 years old, this is about the age where your body's metabolism slows down. I'll just keep gaining, won't I....",

Trapped in anxiety and not seeing clearly. Of course you can stay slim and be fit. The people are trying to be supportive, and unfortunately don't know better. They just mean, you don't look like death anymore.  Congratulations for kicking the drugs, such an achievement. I hope you have support, it seems like you have to fight a lot of fights, and deserve all the help you can get. Best wishes.",

No one should say anything ever. \n\nI'm 39, still fighting with this stupid disorder. When I was 23, I had also gained weight and ended up hiding inside because I was so worried I would hear these comments. I ended up missing my ex-boyfriend's funeral, and I really regret that I let it stop me from going.\n\nIt is an amazing accomplishment to quit drugs!!!! Please give yourself the credit you deserve \ud83d\udc95 yes, I also want to appear unhealthily skinny, so when I don't it feels like I've failed. I haven't failed. Nor have you. We are absolutely winning. And chances are, the ED perception of yourself is dysmorphia. \n\nOh! And - I should add - no changes in my metabolism since I was 20, only slows when I start restricting. The more frequently I eat, the more I'm able to get nutrition on a regular basis, the faster the metabolism goes.",
