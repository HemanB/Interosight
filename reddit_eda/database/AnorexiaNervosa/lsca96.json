When my friends would put their hand on my shoulder or something I would visualize spikes coming out of my back, shoulders, and arms. This was also when I was severely underweight and my bones protruded and feeling my ribs or back felt spiked. The smoothness of the sculpture represented my skin and fat, while the spikes my bones and discomfort. But I always visualized long spikes coming out of me when someone touched me.",
