  "selftext": "I see posts about people struggling with anorexia being treated horribly at ERS, hospitals, wards, like when it comes to recovery or simply just being there for different reasons. They are forced, they are timed, neglected, punished, traumatized. Why is it this way? I am so disgusted. Are they given some kind of contract on how they will be treated? I highly doubt it, it's terrifying and abusive\n\nEdit: I am already disgusted again",

I would compare it to drugs even though they may not be completely the same, it is to explain the similarities of how hard they can be backing out of doing something you repeatedly do. You are making the choice of doing drugs thinking \"oh I can stop whenever I want\", but once you're sucked into it it's so hard to get out, you can't stop. With anorexia nervosa, you just can't seem to stop, even if you want to, it may be because of habit, the fear is still there, you're still obsessed with weight and being in control, it could be many reasons, but it's just so hard it feels near impossible to recover\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

I don\u2019t really blame people for that because before it happened to me I couldn\u2019t understand why someone couldn\u2019t just make themselves eat (of course I never said that to anyone but I thought it). Then when it happened to me I had a lot more insight. But I sometimes wish people would just be kinder even if they don\u2019t or can\u2019t understand.\n\nI get frustrated that some healthcare professionals blame anything you say or do on your eating disorder. I\u2019ve had comments such as \u201cthat\u2019s the anorexia\u201d, \u201cthat\u2019s your eating disorder talking\u201d and even after making a very rational and logical comment about my care to a medical doctor when I was in the hospital was told that what I was saying was \u201ceating disorder pseudoscience\u201d\u2026 But I have also had some lovely healthcare professionals, particularly nurses in medical wards who have helped advocate for me when medical or psychiatric doctors wouldn\u2019t listen to me. \n\nI didn\u2019t have as much luck in the mental health wards as a teenager and young adult before I was diagnosed with an eating disorder though. They clearly didn\u2019t care and I was brushed off all of the times I asked for help even when I specifically asked for help to avoid purging and was told that it\u2019s fine to keep doing it as it\u2019s better than self harming. \n\nI believe that I was treated so poorly there as my BMI was in the obese category and I wasn\u2019t taken seriously. It really took until I started to develop medical problems (then at an overweight BMI) before people started taking it seriously. Now it is taken so seriously that I have been forced into medical hospitals 3 times and I don\u2019t have a choice or any autonomy. \n\nI do think a lot of people think it\u2019s a choice and I don\u2019t think they understand how much it would be nice to just live a normal life without these thoughts taking over and that if we could just change easily, most of us would (especially when the honeymoon period is over and it really starts interfering with your life more and more).",

Mentally I was devastated and their words made me feel like I was just a puppet to be controlled. Not a person with feelings, but a bruised toy that just needed to be stuffed with absorbent cotton, or something like that lol \n\n(note: we did have some very strict rules) \n\nComing out of there, of course, my rituals and coping mechanisms from before (I went into the spiral of anorexia simply because it was the only thing I could control in my life) came out again.

So again, I was trying to talk but no one was listening all the way and I felt ridiculed, to the point of almost feeling childish myself and asking myself too many questions.

They literally just wanted me to eat, and once I did they were happy and told me \u201cit wasn\u2019t that hard, right? food is fuel.\u201d I still think of it as a traumatic experience that led me to nothing but refusing help in later years.

I would compare it to drugs even though they may not be completely the same, it is to explain the similarities of how hard they can be backing out of doing something you repeatedly do. You are making the choice of doing drugs thinking \"oh I can stop whenever I want\", but once you're sucked into it it's so hard to get out, you can't stop. With anorexia nervosa, you just can't seem to stop, even if you want to, it may be because of habit, the fear is still there, you're still obsessed with weight and being in control, it could be many reasons, but it's just so hard it feels near impossible to recover\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",
