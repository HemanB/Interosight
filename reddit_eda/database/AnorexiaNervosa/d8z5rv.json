Anyone else get this thought? \n\nIt\u2019s one of those days where my body image isn\u2019t so bad and I can see that I am actually thin. And then I see on social media a girl I used to be friends with who betrayed me and hurt me and she\u2019s sharing her latest success, and my brain just goes \u201cat least I\u2019m thinner than her\u201d. And I felt better. As if my restricting and obsession with size and calories and my weight and clothing size is worth more than her career success ?? It\u2019s so stupid. \n\nIt\u2019s the same as when I have one of these good body image days and sit in a room thinking, \u201cat least I\u2019m the thinnest in the room\u201d. I may not be the most educated yet, or the top of whatever hierarchy, or the most popular, but I\u2019m the thinnest. Like anyone cares. But I care.",

Like, i have this one friend who is so pretty and thin and smart and kind and just generally better than me in every respect. and i can't help but resent her sometimes and it's really bad and i don't like it but kdfjsh'gsdfklghsdkl",
