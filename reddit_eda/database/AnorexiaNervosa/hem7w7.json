  "selftext": "Really wondering if I am completely on my own in this, in this illness not having the courage to step on a scale makes me feel quite alone and in a weird way also ashamed and cowardice. Last time I stepped on a scale was 10+ years ago (which is also roughly the duration of ED) and have been afraid of them since. On the other hand, there is also a strong curiosity about my actual weight but the fear of what this number will do to my brain freaks me out. Anyone recognises him/herself in this? Hope I am not alone.",

I already deal with BDD and anytime I know my weight I begin to quantify my \u201cugliness\u201d. I start to set goals, count calories, cry over breaking a fast/calorie limit. And no matter how much I lose I still feel ugly. \n\nIm by no means fully recovered but I\u2019ve found peace in not knowing my weight. I sometimes limit how many times I eat, but I don\u2019t count calories. I sometimes cry when I feel full, but it\u2019s no where near the stress of binging because I ate 1cal over my budget. \n\nI don\u2019t think being afraid of the scale means you haven\u2019t recovered either! To me it isn\u2019t so much a fear, but the STRENGTH to walk away from a possible trigger. \n\n\nWhen you see fire you are not a coward for not touching it.
