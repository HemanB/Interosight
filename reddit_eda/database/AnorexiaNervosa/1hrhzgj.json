After you've received the diagnosis, it'll stick. Both the DSM-V and the ICD-10/11 have different subcategories based on your weight and/or recovery status.\n\nedit: why do I get downvoted whenever I point out you don't have to be underweight to get diagnosed with AN depending on which classification system the person diagnosing you uses? like,, it's really not difficult to look up. if you wanna ask something, you can ask, but why downvote factual information?",

Which, given the harm that is often done during that process, I agree should not be done unless strictly medically necessary. \n\nI honestly wonder what the treatment success rate for typical vs atypical anorexia looks like as loss of control during forced weight restoration frequently leads to relapse immediately after regaining some control. Though maybe that's hard to measure since a lot of clinics measure success rate purely by weight. \n\nI don't have atypical AN but I also had a very hands off psychiatric team by the time my weight got to my lowest, so I was never forced into hospital. I do credit that with being able to pull myself out of it somewhat (currently semi recovered) whereas forced weight restoration and complete loss of control would've probably led to an endless cycle of relapses.\n\nAll that being said I was never emaciated by AN standards and at some point there really is no other option. Which only makes it all the more important to catch EDs early, by not believing dumb shit like \"fat people can't...\".",

      "body": "It's a fair question and it's not in my head.\n\nDetermination of fatness comes from BMI. Straight up scale weight relative to height.\n\nDetermination of \"not eat enough\" is my logged caloric intake relative to my BMR. I had one hell of a deficit.\n\nI didn't know a damn thing about weight management until about 6 months ago... and I'm in my mid 40s.\n\nHow'd I get that fat? I used to have a physically active job (airline baggage handler) and I ate like shit. I lost a bunch of weight, and in the process, f'd up my metabolism. I traded that job in for a desk job and stopped exercising. I just figured that with a desk job, I don't have that kind of time to exercise like I did when I was working, so why bother.\n\nI blimped out *real* fast after I quit that job. The thing is, when you create caloric deficits like that, and then eat again, who knows what your body is going to do with those calories.\n\nI lived like that for pretty much all of my adult life, thinking I didn't eat that much and wondering why I was fat. But it was also my normal. I accepted it and didn't think that much about it. I got used to putting walls and telling docs to fuck off when they wanted me to lose weight. When a doc tells you to lose weight, it's code for \"eat less\". Yeah that just wasn't going to happen, but none of them ever asked me how much I was eating in the first place.\n\nI started working with an RD this summer for reasons. My RD put me on a \"diet\" that required me to *increase* my caloric intake by a bunch. The weight has been falling off at a steady clip. Can I explain how all of this stuff works? No, I can't, and I don't need to. But I do need to come to terms with this, because it's even more confusing to me than it is to you.\n\nSo why am I here? Because my head is fucked up. Objectively, my body needs the calories my RD put me on. If I don't eat them, I sleep like shit and my energy levels are zapped. And hell I need them to lose weight. But my brain fights me on that, it's used to me getting a lot less calories. It thinks if I'm adding all of these \"extra\" calories to my diet, I'm gonna gain even more weight. I don't really enjoy food anymore. I won't eat more X cals in a sitting, even if it's well within my calorie budget for the day. I can get \"full\" on half that. Getting the right amount of food is a constant struggle between my head and my body. I only had half my cals before 10pm. I'm not eating all of that tonight, and I'll probably pay for it tomorrow.\n\nI hope that answers your question, it's the best answer I can give you.\n\nEdit: I forgot what sub I'm in, I had to strip the numbers out.",

After a childhood of obesity I developed anorexic habits that lead to me being dangerously underweight. While recovering, I fell into a binge cycle and became overweight for years. Which I then battled with further anorexic habits for the next few years. I've spent 20 years swinging between years of anorexia and years of overeating. \n\n\nI'm currently severely restricting and have been for 5 months. I'm still overweight but I've lost a lot because as you say it doesn't happen overnight. I would never call myself anorexic because I'm not underweight and have none of the physical symptoms.

I had one hell of a deficit.\n\nI didn't know a damn thing about weight management until about 6 months ago... and I'm in my mid 40s.\n\nHow'd I get that fat? I used to have a physically active job (airline baggage handler) and I ate like shit. I lost a bunch of weight, and in the process, f'd up my metabolism. I traded that job in for a desk job and stopped exercising. I just figured that with a desk job, I don't have that kind of time to exercise like I did when I was working, so why bother.\n\nI blimped out *real* fast after I quit that job. The thing is, when you create caloric deficits like that, and then eat again, who knows what your body is going to do with those calories.\n\nI lived like that for pretty much all of my adult life, thinking I didn't eat that much and wondering why I was fat. But it was also my normal. I accepted it and didn't think that much about it. I got used to putting walls and telling docs to fuck off when they wanted me to lose weight. When a doc tells you to lose weight, it's code for \"eat less\". Yeah that just wasn't going to happen, but none of them ever asked me how much I was eating in the first place.\n\nI started working with an RD this summer for reasons. My RD put me on a \"diet\" that required me to *increase* my caloric intake by a bunch. The weight has been falling off at a steady clip. Can I explain how all of this stuff works? No, I can't, and I don't need to. But I do need to come to terms with this, because it's even more confusing to me than it is to you.\n\nSo why am I here? Because my head is fucked up. Objectively, my body needs the calories my RD put me on. If I don't eat them, I sleep like shit and my energy levels are zapped. And hell I need them to lose weight. But my brain fights me on that, it's used to me getting a lot less calories. It thinks if I'm adding all of these \"extra\" calories to my diet, I'm gonna gain even more weight. I don't really enjoy food anymore. I won't eat more X cals in a sitting, even if it's well within my calorie budget for the day. I can get \"full\" on half that. Getting the right amount of food is a constant struggle between my head and my body. I only had half my cals before 10pm. I'm not eating all of that tonight, and I'll probably pay for it tomorrow.\n\nI hope that answers your question, it's the best answer I can give you.\n\nEdit: I forgot what sub I'm in, I had to strip the numbers out.",

That\u2019s difficult for other users to engage with, as their medical experiences vary a lot outside the realm of appearances. \n\nThere is actually even a subreddit rule about frequently asked questions for this very reason, because it\u2019s just not helpful for a skeptical person (who has clearly already made up their mind) to hop into the threads questioning everyone\u2019s diagnosis. \n\nYou seem very young, so people are probably  trying to give you the benefit of the doubt & assuming you just don\u2019t understand how rude you\u2019re being. Hence downvotes instead of reports.\n\nEdit: Also, it does NOT help that at the same time you\u2019re commenting this stuff, you\u2019re on the weight loss advice sub telling people to calorie restrict.

At my worst, I had untreated sleep apnea, which you get because you get excess fat in your throat and it blocks your airways.\n\nI started busting my ass in the gym. I lost very little weight, but after about 2 years, my sleep apnea went away -- doc said I no longer needed the CPAP. *Awesome.* I went back to him a few months later and asked how the hell I was able to get rid of the apnea and not continue to lose weight. He had no idea.\n\ni even went to a weight loss clinic that was suggested to me by my doc. Those people were even worse... they wanted me to restrict even further. We're talking \"My 600 lb life\" levels of intake. Except I'm tall and I weightlift.\n\nSo when you say no one notices, you are right. *No one notices.*",
