  "selftext": "Hello -  I hope being a parent of someone with Anorexia Nervosa and my question does not violate the intent of this group.  If that is the case please delete my post.\n\nMy 16 y/o daughter was just diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa.  She is super type A personality, so can be ultra driven when seeking a goal.  \n\nWhat things did your parent(s) say or do that was helpful, and what things should a parent never say or do?  \n\nI was pretty clueless about things leading up to this point, and have been known to speak with a foot in my mouth.  I feel like this is too serious to make a mistake.  Thank you in advance!\n\nEdit:  Thank you for all the thoughtful and informative replies.  Today marks my 5th day of trying to read everyone.  I will try to take everything you say into account.  I already read somethings that I might have said innocently before that I will avoid now.  \n\nI can\u2019t begin to describe how appreciative I am\nfor each one of your comments.   Thank you!",

Encouraging eating is one thing and can be helpful, but punishing your child for not eating or refusing to let her leave the table until she's finished can cause way more harm than good. I'd also encourage you to look at Ro Mitchell on YouTube. She's recovering from anorexia and the comments her parents give in the videos are incredibly helpful and supportive without being too overbearing.",

      "body": "My parents trained me to have anorexia, like I have been obsessed with not gaining weight for as long as I can remember, like years before I learned what calories were in 5th grade health class. That being said, I only have \u201cdon\u2019ts\u201d to share.\n\nDon\u2019t force her to eat. After I was diagnosed at 15, my parents would sit and watch me eat and not let me get up until I cleaned my plate. All that did was lead to me throwing it up, and it made me feel more panicked.\n\nDon\u2019t ever comment about anything at all in terms of nutrition facts. Never do it. When I was 22 I bought myself instant breakfast when I was trying to stop losing weight because my brain decided that beverages didn\u2019t count. My dad walked by and went \u201coh my god, do you have any idea how much sugar is in that?!\u201d It\u2019s been almost 2 years and I haven\u2019t touched it since. The idea of it makes me cry. There are a million examples of this, but it always gets under your skin and you remember it forever. A passing comment for you about food content can easily become an obsessive fear for your child with this illness. \n\nDon\u2019t comment on her body at all. \u201cYou look so much healthier!\u201d means \u201cYou\u2019re weight gain is super obvious. You look fat and disgusting. You need to stop.\u201d But also, \u201cYou\u2019re too thin!\u201d means \u201cThank fuck, it\u2019s working. I can\u2019t stop now.\u201d Like this is a mental illness and brains will do literally anything to make a comment about weight feed into the disorder. My parents never did this, they said things like \u201coh good you\u2019ve lost weight. Don\u2019t gain it back.\u201d To be clear, they\u2019d say it when I was underweight. But that one is more obviously bad, so I used examples that people in town have told me instead.\n\nDon\u2019t comment on anyone else\u2019s bodies, not even your own. My dad is fatphobic and would mock random people on the street, and like now I just think everyone thinks those things but like only about me. My mom would grab at her stomach in the mirror and tell me how much she hated it and how disgusting she felt, even when I was like 6. There wasn\u2019t anything wrong with her stomach, at least not to me. If her healthy stomach was disgusting, what did that mean about mine?? I had bad body dysmorphia, and I thought my stomach was much larger than hers. When I was 12 my dad came to me and instructed me to manipulate my mom into running on the treadmill because if she didn\u2019t start losing weight now she\u2019d just keep gaining it. She\u2019d had a baby 3-4 months prior to this convo. He at least tried to pretend to care about her health, so even if we pretend I believed him, telling me he wants me to help her because he loves her told me that nobody loves you if you\u2019re even a little overweight. It\u2019s a mental disorder, your brain makes weird shit up. If you talk about weight, your brain will find a way to make it motivate you to restrict. \n\nDon\u2019t accuse her of throwing up if she\u2019s not. It\u2019s just hurtful and offensive. Then you think oh if they thought I was throwing up it\u2019s because I\u2019m eating too much and should be throwing up, so then you feel like you have to. \n\nDon\u2019t lie to her about her body. People around town like to lie about my body. They\u2019ll comment on it and I\u2019ll say I have anorexia and am Xlbs underweight, and comments about my body make it harder to make healthy choices. Then they\u2019ll try to lie. Obviously telling me I look healthy and just fine when I can see most of my bones is a bad idea. You might want to help her feel better about her appearance, but definitely never lie. If you have body dysmorphia you almost have to believe the people around you, and when they\u2019re lying it can seriously mess with your concept of reality.\n\nDon\u2019t make her feel guilty. My sister used to buy me high-calorie things and give me a deadline I had to eat it by. I felt guilty that she spent money on me and I knew I\u2019d disappoint her if I didn\u2019t eat it, but it just led to me shamefully eating it as fast as I could while I cried. At the time I thought it was nice because it was the only time anyone had ever cared enough to want me to try to do better. I wouldn\u2019t actually wish that on anyone else, though. \n\nDon\u2019t tell anyone. I know you might want to talk to your own parents, but please don\u2019t. When mine did that it made it super uncomfortable to talk to my grandma and aunt who I\u2019d been close with, and it\u2019s taken me nigh on a decade to try to get past that. People treat you different, even when they mean well. You can tell if someone told them. Feeling like everyone knew just made me feel extremely ashamed and exposed. It also felt like my parents betrayed me. \n\n\nSorry for the long comment. I tried to explain why I chose each of the points I made because like they don\u2019t make a ton of sense without the background of what the disorder hears and tells you. I can\u2019t say it\u2019s all universal, but I know at least some of it is. You can also hear about it on YouTube, just search something like what anorexics want their parents to know. I think I\u2019ve seen a few videos listed under that premise",

It gave me a chance to vent and get my feelings out in a supported environment, and gave my parents a chance to ask questions without running the risk of triggering me. We were able to get relatively on the same page re my meal plans/treatment and from that point on they had more insight into my disorder and what I was going through. \n\nPsychoeducation is so important, and you\u2019re already doing your part by starting to reach out and ask for resources/support. I\u2019d recommend checking out neda.org or other known ED support resources for information into her diagnosis.\n\nAdditionally, there are support groups online for parents of individuals with eating disorders- being a part of a community of others going through what you are might offer some comfort or insight into what you\u2019re going to be experiencing as a primary supporter of someone with an ED diagnosis. (https://www.feast-ed.org is a great resource for parents and families, albeit with a terrible name lol)\n\nIt may be a rough road ahead but your daughter is fortunate to have a parent who is willing to learn and grow with her.",

We also used to play board games like scrabble together, which I usually won. Animals helped. My dog was one of the reasons I kept going in recovery, to make sure I was around long enough to see him grow. I'd strongly recommend watching Tabitha Farrar on YouTube.

Also whenever my mom told me or other people how I had \u2018really bad restrictive anorexia\u2019 it would trigger me so much because I felt like I wasn\u2019t as sick as she thought and therefore not sick enough to recover. Also try not to force her to eat particular foods/ a certain way, or always say she\u2019s not recovered enough when she\u2019s trying. It\u2019s a process and it won\u2019t happen right away but if her efforts never seem to be enough it\u2019s feel like there\u2019s no point in trying.\n\nThings that helped: letting me have foods that I like, you can\u2019t only eat the foods that your comfortable with but eating itself can be really stressful so it\u2019s nice if the food isn\u2019t always something new/scary. Also being open to listen and not judging the things she\u2019s struggling with because they probably won\u2019t always make sense, or it will seem like a ridiculous thing to be worried about but the ED makes it very real. I do t know what your home situation is but is more than one parent/guardian is involved in recovery it\u2019s best to have a united approach so it\u2019s less uncertain, which can lead to feeling like you need to control things (eg. Ed behaviors).\n\nI wish my parents would have done this because sometimes the advice you get from real people is way better that what doctors will tell you from their textbooks. Also always remember that she loves you even if she yells at you because so speaking from experience she might get mad at you for \u2018forcing\u2019 her to recover but she does love you.

When I reached 13-14 years I was a LITTLE fat. Maybe chubby. Still wearing L size pants so not being extremely obese. My parents went insane about how I not should eat another bread, which exercises should I do to lose weight while they were also fatty. We never made sport together we only sat at home eating deep fried meals. \nSo here we are, 3 years later I fell in love with a dude. He was attracted to me too but once he said he can\u2019t be with me because I don\u2019t look good tho I have a beautiful face and a great personality. That\u2019s when it clicked. Months later when I lost 10-15 kgs mother said you are too skinny, you\u2019re a skeleton, no one will ever like you etc. For some reason I went furious and said: nothing is good enough for you! When I was fat you said I\u2019m too fat. Now I\u2019m skinny you can only say I\u2019m too skinny. I can never be good enough for you so I give up, you should decide what tf you want from me\u201d and went out. \nNever talked about this but then she just gave me some space and peace. That was everything she could do to me.\nShe also said \u201cI have a strong mind\u201d and \u201cI do everything I set my mind to\u201d \nYes because I\u2019m sick, it\u2019s a real mental illness, I do NOT want to disgusted by my own body!\nTalk to her, if she wants, and if she not, and she isn\u2019t in danger, just tell her you love her.",

Definitely don\u2019t talk about dieting/not eating something because it\u2019s \u201cbad\u201d etc. Just supporting her, searching for resources that could help her, scheduling appointments, and being there for her to talk about anything will probably be extremely helpful! Also there will be a point in recovery where she will probably be insatiably hungry (called extreme hunger), when that time comes it may be helpful to reassure her that this is normal and she needs to eat all that she can!

          "body": "My parents trained me to have anorexia, like I have been obsessed with not gaining weight for as long as I can remember, like years before I learned what calories were in 5th grade health class. That being said, I only have \u201cdon\u2019ts\u201d to share.\n\nDon\u2019t force her to eat. After I was diagnosed at 15, my parents would sit and watch me eat and not let me get up until I cleaned my plate. All that did was lead to me throwing it up, and it made me feel more panicked.\n\nDon\u2019t ever comment about anything at all in terms of nutrition facts. Never do it. When I was 22 I bought myself instant breakfast when I was trying to stop losing weight because my brain decided that beverages didn\u2019t count. My dad walked by and went \u201coh my god, do you have any idea how much sugar is in that?!\u201d It\u2019s been almost 2 years and I haven\u2019t touched it since. The idea of it makes me cry. There are a million examples of this, but it always gets under your skin and you remember it forever. A passing comment for you about food content can easily become an obsessive fear for your child with this illness. \n\nDon\u2019t comment on her body at all. \u201cYou look so much healthier!\u201d means \u201cYou\u2019re weight gain is super obvious. You look fat and disgusting. You need to stop.\u201d But also, \u201cYou\u2019re too thin!\u201d means \u201cThank fuck, it\u2019s working. I can\u2019t stop now.\u201d Like this is a mental illness and brains will do literally anything to make a comment about weight feed into the disorder. My parents never did this, they said things like \u201coh good you\u2019ve lost weight. Don\u2019t gain it back.\u201d To be clear, they\u2019d say it when I was underweight. But that one is more obviously bad, so I used examples that people in town have told me instead.\n\nDon\u2019t comment on anyone else\u2019s bodies, not even your own. My dad is fatphobic and would mock random people on the street, and like now I just think everyone thinks those things but like only about me. My mom would grab at her stomach in the mirror and tell me how much she hated it and how disgusting she felt, even when I was like 6. There wasn\u2019t anything wrong with her stomach, at least not to me. If her healthy stomach was disgusting, what did that mean about mine?? I had bad body dysmorphia, and I thought my stomach was much larger than hers. When I was 12 my dad came to me and instructed me to manipulate my mom into running on the treadmill because if she didn\u2019t start losing weight now she\u2019d just keep gaining it. She\u2019d had a baby 3-4 months prior to this convo. He at least tried to pretend to care about her health, so even if we pretend I believed him, telling me he wants me to help her because he loves her told me that nobody loves you if you\u2019re even a little overweight. It\u2019s a mental disorder, your brain makes weird shit up. If you talk about weight, your brain will find a way to make it motivate you to restrict. \n\nDon\u2019t accuse her of throwing up if she\u2019s not. It\u2019s just hurtful and offensive. Then you think oh if they thought I was throwing up it\u2019s because I\u2019m eating too much and should be throwing up, so then you feel like you have to. \n\nDon\u2019t lie to her about her body. People around town like to lie about my body. They\u2019ll comment on it and I\u2019ll say I have anorexia and am Xlbs underweight, and comments about my body make it harder to make healthy choices. Then they\u2019ll try to lie. Obviously telling me I look healthy and just fine when I can see most of my bones is a bad idea. You might want to help her feel better about her appearance, but definitely never lie. If you have body dysmorphia you almost have to believe the people around you, and when they\u2019re lying it can seriously mess with your concept of reality.\n\nDon\u2019t make her feel guilty. My sister used to buy me high-calorie things and give me a deadline I had to eat it by. I felt guilty that she spent money on me and I knew I\u2019d disappoint her if I didn\u2019t eat it, but it just led to me shamefully eating it as fast as I could while I cried. At the time I thought it was nice because it was the only time anyone had ever cared enough to want me to try to do better. I wouldn\u2019t actually wish that on anyone else, though. \n\nDon\u2019t tell anyone. I know you might want to talk to your own parents, but please don\u2019t. When mine did that it made it super uncomfortable to talk to my grandma and aunt who I\u2019d been close with, and it\u2019s taken me nigh on a decade to try to get past that. People treat you different, even when they mean well. You can tell if someone told them. Feeling like everyone knew just made me feel extremely ashamed and exposed. It also felt like my parents betrayed me. \n\n\nSorry for the long comment. I tried to explain why I chose each of the points I made because like they don\u2019t make a ton of sense without the background of what the disorder hears and tells you. I can\u2019t say it\u2019s all universal, but I know at least some of it is. You can also hear about it on YouTube, just search something like what anorexics want their parents to know. I think I\u2019ve seen a few videos listed under that premise",
