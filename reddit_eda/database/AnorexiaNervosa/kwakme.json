  "selftext": "I quit being mentally ill. I quit anxiety and anorexia and insomnia. I quit dragging through my life wishing I was different than who I am. I am beautiful, I am worthy of a meal. I am worthy of a stressfree day and a good nights sleep. I deserve to survive. I deserve to recover. I deserve to heal. and guess what?
