  "selftext": "I\u2019m really tired of being useless enough to not be able to make any accomplishments. Everyone else is smarter than me. Moving in life knowing that I\u2019ll never reach my goals honestly just tells me that I\u2019m walking through a dark forest. I don\u2019t care if my health gets fucked up. \n\nIf I grew up to adulthood, I would be a useless one and probably unemployed due to pathetic nature. I\u2019ll never be successful at anything else than losing weight. I deeply don\u2019t care that my blood pressure is very low now. \n\nJust take me to the fucking grave before my life becomes even worse.",

      "body": "It really does feel like that. My situation is a little different, but it feels like what you\u2019re describing. \n\nI\u2019m most likely twice your age, and when I was growing up, this was the 90s. People were making money, everybody was optimistic, and kids whose parents were really invested in them succeeding in life told us all we should be astronauts when we grow up.\n\nI had natural academic talent. My parents imbued me with a fair amount of arrogance, and so for me, when anybody did something better than I could do it, it felt like I was nothing. Like I should just give up. The only reason I didn\u2019t give up was because of that arrogance, even though that\u2019s not healthy either\u2026 Not at all.",
