  "title": "A Man at a Bar Commented On My Weight",
  "selftext": "Today I went to a bar with my friend Brandon to hang out and drink our sorrows away! Once we got there, we both had a couple beers and we met this guy there named Curtis. Curtis struck up a conversation with us, we got to talking, and he seemed like a really cool guy; super laid-back and just overall very chill. He was an older gentleman, pretty heavy- set, and spoke with a soft, deep voice that made him kinda hard to understand with the background noise from the bar. \n\nAfter the beers, we decided to order some bar food. Brandon got a chicken tender platter, and I got 10 boneless wings, which was **plenty** of food for me. \n\nNow, when I get drunk, I get very very gratuitous, and I like to offer food, snacks, or drinks to pretty much everybody around me, so I offered Curtis one of my boneless wings, to which he politely declined. About a minute later, he turned to me and said, \n\n\u201cNow I know this isn\u2019t any of my business, but how much do you weigh if you don\u2019t mind me asking?\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t mind, so I replied with my weight, to which he says back, \n\n\u201cNow, I\u2019m a big man and I\u2019m not gonna take food from somebody as skinny as you; that would be evil. If you offered me a wing out of a whole-ass bucket I would accept, but you\u2019re on your last two wings and you gotta eat!\u201d\n\nGenuinely, that shit meant a lot for some reason. As a recovering anorexic, some random stranger in a bar caring enough to turn down my offer of free food just felt *good*. To him, what he said was just another sentence, but it really made me feel acknowledged? \n\nAppreciated? \n\nCared about? \n\nI dunno, but I felt pretty damn good.\n\nAfter that, we laughed, talked for a bit more, and then he left the bar, but not before I gave him a handshake and a kind thank you.\n\nCurtis, if you\u2019re on the anorexia subreddit for some fucking reason, thank you. You\u2019re the man.\n\n",
