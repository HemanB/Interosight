  "selftext": "For me, my ED has been relatively traumatic in itself. And even though i\u2019m still suffering and living with it, the flashbacks of worser times is horrible. \n\nI feel like this is not really spoken about. \n\nIf i ever smell anything or listen to any songs i listened to at my worst mental health it causes a whole trauma response. \n\nI started having a panic attack at work the other week because a customer was wearing a perfume my mum sprayed on my hospital bed. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry to anyone else has had traumatic experiences in their eating disorder. I\u2019m sending you love <3",

I had some truly horrible experiences with involuntary treatment, and then when my ED was at its worst, that was traumatizing in a different way.  Anyway, just know you're not alone and I'm wishing you healing and recovery.",

      "body": "Oo this is so real. I know this might not be helpful framing for some people, but I see my ed as having a kind of abusive relationship with myself. Withholding food, not caring if I felt like shit, wearing myself down, etc. treating yourself like that is not only physically detrimental it\u2019s also very emotionally traumatizing. Thanks for mentioning this.",

      "body": "I think calling it an abusive relationship is so apt! Very similar dynamics at play. Also the trauma of becoming isolated\u2026losing friends, jobs, educational opportunities\u2026as well as the trauma of being subjected to involuntary treatment (even though it saves your life, it is physically and emotionally brutal) is 100% a real thing. I had a really good group therapist who got us to explore this aspect of the illness and most of the group members reported having trauma responses like OP to sounds, smells, tastes associated with the treatment they had at their sickest. It\u2019s kind of like \u201cwe\u2019ll save your life, but you get to live with a new disease now! *dumps a ton more anxiety on top of the crazy pile*",

I\u2019m recovered now, I\u2019m not sure to what extent because I thought of relapsing, BUT I had to remind myself over and over that I do not ever want to experience or be in that situation again.",

Mum brought some of these vegetarian sausages home last week, we hadn't had them in the house for years but they were something that I was encouraged to have by my dietitian years ago (like meat alternatives for protein etc). \n\nWhen she cooked them, the smell just send me in a whirl. Everything just came back, it felt like I was standing in the same place I was 10 years ago worrying about these sausages. Sigh. \n\nAny song that was 'big' where I am in 2009-2013 is enough to make me cry. \n\nSuperchick songs like 'Courage' and 'Stand in the Rain' (massive in the ED community - particularly on youtube 'my anorexia story' vids - back in 2009).. the intro music makes my stomach flip.",
