  "title": "Something people don\u2019t understand about anorexia",
  "selftext": "Everyone\u2019s ED is different, but overall I have found laypeople often fail to understand that not everyone with anorexia desires to be healthy. I\u2019d like to say that I do, and to actually mean it. But if we wanted so badly to be healthy, we would \u201cjust eat\u201d as people wisely advise me. A girl in my anxiety disorders seminar once said \u201canorexic people know it\u2019s bad to not eat, so why would they still starve themselves?\u201c \n\nI want to be underweight. I think many of us do. The diagnostic criteria for anorexia literally references weight loss. So telling me \u201cyou can\u2019t afford to lose any more weight because then you\u2019ll be unhealthy\u201d isn\u2019t going to change anything. In my eating-disordered mind, healthy = fat = bad. \n\nRecovery is all about gaining the desire to be healthy, to feel healthy. But in the vices of anorexia, I don\u2019t think any of us are sitting around under any pretenses that what we are doing is conducive to our maximal health. Nobody is like, \u201crestricting/being underweight makes my body function better than it could if it was sufficiently nourished! It helps my mental health so much! 10/10 would recommend feeling like shit every day!\u201d The nature of this illness is that I want to lose weight, to be underweight, and by definition, that is \u201cunhealthy\u201d.\n\nI wish people would stop trying to use the \u201cyou know this isn\u2019t healthy!\u201d argument because honestly that only encourages and applauds my ED. My advice to those people is to stop assuming that the end goal for the eating disordered mind is health, and trying to handle the conversations as such. Take away healthy/unhealthy references and focus on other aspects beyond physical fitness when trying to help someone who is suffering. \n\nPeople assume we all have a survival instinct and a drive to be happy and healthy and to preserve our own lives. That\u2019s why it\u2019s unfathomable to many why someone would deliberately eat less than they should to be healthy, if the food is available. But if that were the case, then mental illnesses wouldn\u2019t exist. \n\nWhat do you guys think? Do you feel similarly? Have people tried to cure you by telling you that you don\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d to lose weight and it\u2019s \u201cnot healthy\u201d to restrict?",

With anorexia, you\u2019re delusional and people wont understand it because they don\u2019t feel our same delusion. Randomly I\u2019ll get a look in the mirror and realize how thin I actually am and get kind of nervous but 99% of the time I will always see fat, feel fat, just fat. All the time. It\u2019s 5:30 am and I\u2019m awake because I had a normal person amount of food my stomach feels swollen and uncomfortable. The worst part is when I get on that scale and see a \u201cgood number\u201d even when it\u2019s painfully low it sparks this feeling of euphoria like no other.",

It wasn't so much about health/calories as it was just about needing to enjoy food. My nutritionist was always telling me that I am not going to love every single thing I eat but I still need to eat. A lot of times when I've fallen into under-eating patterns it's because I don't like the food available to me (or I'm lazy and don't have the drive to feed myself), so I just end up living on fast food or mainly carbs. \n\nI could never exercise. Nope. Part of it is my bad hips (I'm hypermobile so my hips pop in and out) but I always found exercise triggering anyway and just couldn't cope with it for some reason. Laziness? I might be the laziest anorexic person ever LOL.",
