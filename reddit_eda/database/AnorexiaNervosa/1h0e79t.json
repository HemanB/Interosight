  "selftext": "I know there\u2019s been some talk about Arianna Grande possibly being unwell , I just don\u2019t want to go see the film and get triggered if she is very clearly not doing well. I obviously do hope she\u2019s okay , but for my own sake I don\u2019t wanna sit there for nearly 3 hours letting my mind race with ideas of relapse.\n\nHas anyone seen it and felt okay? \n\nUPDATE: I watched it and yea it was triggering , if you\u2019re sensitive to being triggered i wouldnt recommend.

          "body": "thanks for your comment :) I agree , it\u2019s okay to be body positive but not when it\u2019s clear someone can\u2019t take care of themselves. I\u2019ve opted to see it tonight too because everyone has told me I\u2019d love it , and i\u2019m going with my partner in case it gets triggering and I need some distraction afterwards. Good luck , let me know how you find it \ud83e\udd70 xxx",
