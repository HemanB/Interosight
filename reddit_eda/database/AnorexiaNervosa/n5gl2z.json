Single. Day. I hear her talking about food and counting calories on her phone and how little she ate/how much she exercised and it\u2019s SO TRIGGERING for someone who is in recovery.\nSERIOUSLY SHUT UP!!!!! SHUT UP!!!!\n\nIt PAINS ME to see her get thinner and thinner every day while I get bigger, it pains me to see her puny lunch of cucumber and pepper slices.\nI HATE HER.",
