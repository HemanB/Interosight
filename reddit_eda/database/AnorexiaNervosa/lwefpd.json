  "selftext": "The solution to addiction is avoidance. If you're an alcoholic, you avoid alcohol. If you're a drug addict, you avoid drugs. If you're an exercise addict you avoid exercise. Eating disorders are an addiction where you have to face the vice every single day, multiple times a day. It\u2019s like putting an alcoholic in a bar 3 times a day. Offering a drug addict crack 3 times a day. It\u2019s the only one where you don\u2019t get to avoid, you're literally forced to face it constantly. And it fucking blows, but I think I might just hate myself too much to fix it and face the problem head on. Maybe that would sound alarming to other people, but it\u2019s a reality I\u2019ve lived with for so long that it\u2019s almost hard to understand what self-neutrality would look like, nevermind self-love.",
