Long story short, I order eggs florentine, my favourite breakfast and afterwards our gorgeous waitress comes to take our plates. She looks at me and says \u201cwow I can\u2019t believe you ate everything, you\u2019re so small\u201d! I was silent, I couldn\u2019t talk. I\u2019m pretty sure my bf made some nice joke to her. I spent an entire week obsessing over the gorgeous strangers comment and crying over it. \n\nWas she just trying to be friendly for a good too? Did she say it cause she\u2019s clearly more beautiful and was reminding me I\u2019ll never be as beautiful if I eat like that? Was she fat shaming me? Was I not as small as I thought? Was recovery a bad choice? Did I need to lose even more weight? Should I have ate less then my bf? Did she think that I ate that much at every meal? If so, did she think I eat 3 meals a day? Did other people sitting around me notice what a fat food gobbler I was? Etc etc etc!",
