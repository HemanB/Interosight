Why is being called \"skinny\" so important? it's just a word, a pointless comment made by people who'll probably forget about it two seconds later.\nYou're not starving yourself now, you can enjoy your favourite food with friends, without having to worry about how much you gain. You can finally trust your body, you can trust that you can eat until you're not hungry anymore and you won't gain. You don't have to constantly fight hunger pains. You can run, play sports, dance, go out with friends, date, study, work enjoy your favourite foods while still being thin, because that's what you are. Eds warp our perception of what a thin, fit figure looks like.\n\nEnjoy what you can do without worrying about what you look like from the outside. That doesn't define you, being uw doesn't make your life better, it doesn't make you more interesting, attractive or fun. Normal people don't even know what bmi is :)",
