I\u2019m tired of sitting through lectures, I\u2019m tired of thinking about money, my weight, my grades, my intake, my gross pudgy looking body, my inability to be who I want to be. I don\u2019t even want to be better. I wish I was worse , I wish I didn\u2019t relapse?? But I\u2019m glad I did...but I know that\u2019s wrong. But I\u2019m just so tired",

It feels like such a horrid secret and even being able to have this environment makes me feel okayish again. I have to take what I said back, I can\u2019t be happy about my relapse , I know I can\u2019t. \nNo one should feel this way, I hope you all are okay and while I know everyday is a constant internal battle of x y and z, I know you\u2019ve all got this. I know you\u2019re stronger than the things in your head that tell you otherwise. I have so much faith in all of you here. Every step toward recovery is so wonderful and I\u2019m so proud of everyone who\u2019s trying their best even on their worst days. Much love, always <3",
