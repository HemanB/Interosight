  "title": "Do you have distorted body image when looking at old photos of yourself long before your ED?",
  "selftext": "I realized recently that even though I know I was small as a child, when I look back at photos of me as young as four years old, I still internally criticize my body. As a baby I could see my ribs, so I recognize how underweight and tiny I was, but I know my poor body image began at like age four and so even looking back at old photos I find myself thinking that I look chubby and should have lost weight. I know objectively that I was close to underweight my entire childhood as well but even still, almost two decades later, I perceive my body image as distorted as I perceive it today. Just wondering what anyone else\u2019s experiences are.",

Literally as a first grader I had body issues and can still look at pictures of myself as a kid and see how my stomach poked out.  \n\nI remember at Christmas this year my cousin told me that when I was like six I told her I didn\u2019t like the way my stomach looked.  I don\u2019t remember saying it but I do remember trying to suck in 100% of the time",

I recently looked back at my pre-ED photos and realized how distorted my view of myself was, how much that differed from what I actually looked like.\n\nThat being said, it's the photos from when I was really young I still have trouble not criticizing. It hurts my heart for the girl I was then, but it's just the truth. \n\nEven at the peak of my ED two/three years ago, I hated my body and wanted to lose even more weight. Now looking at the photos, I was visibly sick. Even though I was never underweight or particularly thin to begin with, the visible difference between being healthy and starving was palpable.\n\nNow I'm chillin and eating cheez-itz lol but just some food (haha) for thought.",
