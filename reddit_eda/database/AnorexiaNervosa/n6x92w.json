BED is a serious eating disorder and has detrimental effects on your body. Anorexia is a serious eating disorder and has detrimental effects on your body. \n\nHer narrative sounds like a sick joke, and like the girl in the video said, a way for her to place herself in a protected class of people and play the victim.",
