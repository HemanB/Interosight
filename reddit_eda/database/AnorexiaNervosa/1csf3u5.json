  "selftext": "\nHey everyone:)\nI recently made a post where I asked for your Advice about drawing anorexia. ( l'm an artist and l'm currently doing a series about disorders.)\nThank you so, so much for your great advice and input.\nI take it very seriously that you've entrusted me in this way and allowed me a glimpse into your inner world.\nWithout the many responses from you, I would not have been able to draw this picture. I hope this drawing manages to do you justice.",
