  "selftext": "i wish i was a man, just because i wish i had a flat chest. i'm quite flat, but not flat enough, you know? i can see the bottom of my ribs and my clavicle but not all my ribs and that makes me wish i was a man, born with a flat chest.\n\ni also wish i didn't have a menstrual cycle at all. the loss of a period seems like a big \"achievement\" in my head, so i wish i didn't have to worry about it.\n\ni know that men and women both struggle equally, but it's just these stupid little things that makes me wish i wasn't a woman. do any other women here relate? i feel bad for thinking like this because it's such an irrational thing to think.\n\nedit: guys, i know i'm not transgender. i don't wish to be perceived as a man by others. i don't want to be a man, my ED wants me to be a man.

It was my honeymoon phase with ED. But that time is gone and I\u2019m sure I can\u2019t relapse to that point even if I tried. Now it\u2019s new times, new problems. A new number, new body that I\u2019m not really fond with, and a desire that it doesn\u2019t get larger than that.  \n\nI\u2019d like to think it can go away. Or if not, then at least manageable where you\u2019re able to fend off the thoughts. Haha I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong\u2026 For me, anorexia and Orthorexia developed concurrently. In my opinion, Orthorexia was more of the predominant problem than AN itself that led to my diagnosis. It was driven by a focus of trying to eat healthy, be fit, be balanced, and be perfect. Focus on actual weight and body followed after, supported by this rigid regimen obsession. That\u2019s why for me I haven\u2019t come to grips with completely being recovered yet.",

I can\u2019t go on a whole elaborate spiel, but I just sense that it\u2019s easier being a guy than a girl overall. With an ED, I\u2019m just concerned with body image, sensation, and othorexia. There\u2019s not much else I have to consider biologically or aesthetically. \n\nI guess in terms of gender standards, I do feel some shame that I\u2019m not physical fit, in the sense that I can\u2019t protect and engage in a fight. And I suppose there\u2019s the notion I shouldn\u2019t have this in the first place, and be more mentally tough. I think if people got to know me they would call me a \u201clittle bitch\u201d lmao. \n\nBut those issues can be for women too. I\u2019d think it\u2019s especially true given the empowerment era we\u2019re in today. So take that on top of the other challenges and expectations; I\u2019m fine being a male.",

With female however, there are additional things to consider like menstruation and pregnancy. Like I don\u2019t know how to think about the topic of being pregnant with an ED. A lot of bad things can happen if wise choices aren\u2019t made there. Then there\u2019s also the matter of vulnerability and predation, whether in a relationship or not. \n\nOhh that does enlighten me..

[...]\n\ni understand what you mean. weight gain doesn't mean you're recovered. i don't always want to lose more weight, but i'm also terrified to gain weight. it's okay if you're not satisfied with yourself right now, things take time.\n\ni always wondered if the thoughts about weight gain and food ever go away. if they don't, then maybe that's why many \"recovery influences\" on social media go from anorexia to orthorexia; maybe their thoughts don't go away, they just find a new outlet for it. i'm not saying that people don't ever recover, but there's a large amount of people who develop orthorexia after having a different type of ED.",
