Also if your having stomach issues especially if they are from restriction it\u2019s best to eat little and often instead of once a day as that\u2019ll be more likely to upset your stomach and give you an increasingly negative impression on eating",

It really messed with my head and made me unsure of what to do, but when I feel that way now I ask myself what advice I\u2019d give to a friend because deep down I know what I need to do I just don\u2019t want to do it for myself.",
