  "selftext": "This was back in March, but for some reason I didn\u2019t think to post about it here until now. Here\u2019s the story: \n\nI worked at a daycare in the summer of 2023, but left in August due to going back to school. In early 2024 I decided to take a semester off of school, so I went back to that job while I wasent in school. I had had a series of initial appointments at an ed clinic for quite some time, and so I asked for the day of the appointments off (a month in advance)\u2026 and they told me no, and that I had to be at work that day. I told them that I had important appointments that day and would not be at work, and they told me that if I \u201cno showed\u201d to work that day that I would get a \u201cverbal warning\u201d \n\nI knew I couldn\u2019t reschedule these appointments, because it would be months before they had an opening. Therefore I decided that I could take verbal warning or whatever. \n\nOut of curiosity, I called in \u201csick\u201d the night before I was going to be gone, and I received the pictured messages. ",

Op, are you sure this was your only call out or attendance problem in the time you were there? Did you have a lot of issues with this when you worked here prior? Were you requesting lots of other days off too or coming late/leaving early, having drama with the managers, sitting on your phone all shift or struggling to perform the job duties? Did you throw a fit when your time off request was denied? The part in their text about how you declared you were gonna call out before doing so (never a good idea btw) gives me the impression there's another part of this interaction left out. If you did that, you may have made it look like you're calling out in retaliation for the denied request. \n\nImma go against the grain and say I don't think you have grounds to sue if they weren't aware of your ed, you didn't tell them you needed off for a necessary medical appointment right when you made the apt or got hired, and you did not take FMLA or any other form of leave. Some people are giving you some bad legal advice here. Google \"your state name + at will employment\", if your state is at will employment, you likely don't have a case cause that means they can fire for any reason that isn't illegal.",

          "body": "No, it doesn't appear op wanted to disclose that, which is fair but you can't expect the employer the know the seriousness of what you're taking off for if you won't tell them.\n\n I'll also say I'm kind of skeptical op got fired for one call out like this, some employers are catty powertrippers sure but I'm getting the impression there's more to this story than op is giving us. Op, are you sure this was your only call out or attendance problem in the time you were there? Did you have a lot of issues with this when you worked here prior? Were you requesting lots of other days off too or coming late/leaving early, having drama with the managers, sitting on your phone all shift or struggling to perform the job duties? Did you throw a fit when your time off request was denied? The part in their text about how you declared you were gonna call out before doing so (never a good idea btw) gives me the impression there's another part of this interaction left out. If you did that, you may have made it look like you're calling out in retaliation for the denied request. \n\nImma go against the grain and say I don't think you have grounds to sue if they weren't aware of your ed, you didn't tell them you needed off for a necessary medical appointment right when you made the apt or got hired, and you did not take FMLA or any other form of leave. Some people are giving you some bad legal advice here. Google \"your state name + at will employment\", if your state is at will employment, you likely don't have a case cause that means they can fire for any reason that isn't illegal.",

It is perfectly legal for an employer at an at-will state to fire you for calling out repeatedly, especially if they have no prior knowledge of a medical condition that needs accommodating. They can essentially say your attitude doesn't fit the vibes of the team or say you're otherwise underperforming and get away with firing you for that.\n\nOP would have to prove that their employer had prior knowledge of the ED and that it specifically was the reason for their termination. And even then, small businesses under a certain number of employees are actually exempt from things like the ADA due to \"unreasonable burden\".\n\nI really wish the law worked as intended or is written, but when you've actually attempted to go down this road you find out just how many hidden obstacles are actually in your way. \nI wasted a lot of time and money on my case and got my hopes up that I would get justice, but under the way the law is written in my state, what my employer did was legal. \n\nLike I said, OP can choose to fight it if they want, but I want their expectations to be realistic. If they do choose to fight it and win, I will be super happy for them. I will also probably die of shock, especially if they're in an at-will state.

      "body": "OP stated they have evidence of requesting off for medical appointments over a month in advance.\n\nYou are correct that companies do everything in their power to spin what happened in a way that makes it look legal, and getting justice is a slim chance for most in today's circumstances. But I'll be damned if that means we should just sit down and take it even if the odds aren't in our favor.\n\nAt the end of the day, it is illegal, and OP has text messages and other receipts to show they already requested time off for medical reasons and was denied, having given the company more than ample time to make accommodations. Yes, they will try to claim it was simply \"calling out too much\" or \"having a bad attitude\" but at the end of the day, if OP has the proof, there isn't much hearsay that can be taken into account.\n\nI get what you're trying to say, I really do, I just think it's misrepresenting what actually happens and making OP think this is actually legal rather than the company trying to pull a very morally fucked loophole just isn't accurate in my opinion. It's NOT legal, this doesn't count as an at-will termination. It's just important to be aware of the fact that the company may try to spin it that way to avoid responsibility- Not that what they're doing is ACTUALLY okay, because it's not. It's very much illegal and OP is 100% in the right, it's just a question of whether justice is going to be on their side or not.",

          "body": "Yes, but the burden of proof in at-will states is the problem. I was wrongfully terminated and even had others who were wrongfully terminated by the same supervisor. It is perfectly legal for an employer at an at-will state to fire you for calling out repeatedly, especially if they have no prior knowledge of a medical condition that needs accommodating. They can essentially say your attitude doesn't fit the vibes of the team or say you're otherwise underperforming and get away with firing you for that.\n\nOP would have to prove that their employer had prior knowledge of the ED and that it specifically was the reason for their termination. And even then, small businesses under a certain number of employees are actually exempt from things like the ADA due to \"unreasonable burden\".\n\nI really wish the law worked as intended or is written, but when you've actually attempted to go down this road you find out just how many hidden obstacles are actually in your way. \nI wasted a lot of time and money on my case and got my hopes up that I would get justice, but under the way the law is written in my state, what my employer did was legal. \n\nLike I said, OP can choose to fight it if they want, but I want their expectations to be realistic. If they do choose to fight it and win, I will be super happy for them. I will also probably die of shock, especially if they're in an at-will state. I just know at least in the US the legal system is set up to look like it will help out the individual, but in reality that is rarely ever the case.",
