  "selftext": "I asked him how he felt about my body and that was a mistake. Im at my LW and it hurt so much. He has gained weight recently and I don\u2019t see him any differently. Im still very attracted to him and my attraction towards him has never changed. Weight on others has never bothered me. Im having a hard time. Weirdly enough it makes me want to get worse. Im mad he doesn\u2019t find me attractive. It makes me mad I can\u2019t see myself as unwell. I feel like an ugly bag of bones now. I feel like im some ugly girl with an ugly body and I just want to go die in some cave far away where my appearance doesn\u2019t bother anyone and weight doesn\u2019t matter. Where attractiveness doesn\u2019t matter. Where I don\u2019t matter just me alone where my sickness no longer matters, to anyone.",

Most of this happened about 10 years into our relationship, when certain events in her life and family triggered a downward spiral for her.\n\nNo, I didn't find her \"attractive\" at the time. Always loved her for who she was. But the physical attraction wasn't present during this time when, frankly, she looked like near death. Actually in my opinion it would take a very twisted mind to find attraction in that. More than anything I was just worried sick for her. Only wanted her to get better.\n\nEven during those horrible few years she was always beautiful, not ugly. Beautiful<->ugly is a different dimension than (physically/sexually) attractive<->repulsive.

It doesn't mean he cannot appreciate their body anymore. \nIt is great to hear that your partner supports/supported you so much! But bear in mind that a partner has no obligation to find you attractive at all times - they're an individual human being and as such I don't think anyone has to worship anyone's body unconditionally. People - as well as their perception of the world and everyone around them - often change over time. It is completely normal. And similarly, that means that just because you find a certain person attractive at a healthy weight it may be that at an unhealthy one - extremely low or high - the attraction fades. There's nothing wrong with it.",
