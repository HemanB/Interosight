  "selftext": "Friday: sushi buffet with my fianc\u00e9 for the first date night dinner since we started dating, massive fear cause of unknown ingredients. Was the most stressful night of my life but it was great.\n\nSaturday: went out with the parents for breakfast, got myself a black coffee like normal and watched everyone else finish. On a whim ordered a banana cream waffle. Also last minute shared a milkshake with the fiance. 10/10 \n\nSunday: brunch buffet at a restaurant my best friend has been begging me to try for years, so we went and went for whatever I wanted and however much. Panic and 2 cigarette cry sessions got me through 4 plates of some of my favourite childhood breakfast items. 100000/10\n\nSunday /afternoon evening : on a whim went to get a black coffee from a drive through to get out late, not only took down the best dessert donut puffs ever. \n\nThen I stopped on the way home again. Because I saw something, something I hadn\u2019t seen since I was a kid. My stomach was full but I completely on impulse and my brain telling me \u201cgo, do it, you need it.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s right. The shamrock shake is back. And it. Is. Everything. \nTrust me, I type this as I enjoy mine.\n\nGo get one and give it a go while they\u2019re here ;)\n\nYou deserve it.",

      "body": "Edit: just wanna say thank you to everybody and the comments, this is the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done in my life yet also the most important so this subreddit, and lurking in it for years, has really pushed me and continues. I still struggle every waking minute. No longer having MyFitnessPal as my #1 used app on my phone and having to stare at that screen like a robot for hours, planning, has allowed me to disregard the thought of rules around eating and what I eat, is incredibly freeing yet stressful. I panic, I freak out, I get angry and anxious more then I don\u2019t.\n\nBUT\nI feel clear. I feel good. I\u2019ve done more things in 4 days that I have in years only because I had the energy to. All because of fuel. \u201cScary fuel\u201d we all need to see and breathe and walk. I get it. I was it. I lived it and told myself I loved the skeletal body and the feeling of hunger constantly. But I hated it. I hated the cold constantly stabbing every part of my body no matter how many sweaters and heated blankets I had on. I hated pretending like I didn\u2019t like ice cream to avoid uncomfortable situations. I avoided social events with those I loved because they may have involved food. I sunk my finances buying all these \u201cmiracle foods\u201d (gum, konjac noodles, Walden\u2019s farms *ahem go fuck yourself waldens farms peanut butter* etc. the list goes on). And what better was I? What better are you for it? Are you happy? Do you feel good? \n\nAs anorexics, we are the most stubborn motherfuckers around. We don\u2019t do anything we don\u2019t want. Fuck we will even convince ourselves we don\u2019t want what we want, and don\u2019t need what we need. So flip that. Use that mentality to destroy itself. Be stubborn. Shove the fucking fuel in you. If you doubt it, fuck it, pretend like you\u2019re at McDonald\u2019s and someone\u2019s trying to get you a double Quarter pounder with extra everything instead of a bag of apple slices and a black coffee for the first meal in 3 days. Would you do that? Would you be like \u201cok, let\u2019s eat this Big Mac?\u201d FUCK NO YOU WOULDNT AND NEITHER WOULD I, I woulda died in that McDonald\u2019s before even looking at a quarter pounder in the heat of the moment, without planning and all this and that. So do that. Fight. Die on that hill. Be stubborn against that gut feeling to restrict. Cause once you just do, you realize \u201cfuck I\u2019m okay\u201d. I am aren\u2019t I? And you saw all these things I got to enjoy that I told myself for years would make me lose control of everything I had worked for and suffered towards would be gone. I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m great. I am better than I have been in years. I took a proper shit yesterday for the first time in years and IT FELT GREAT!!!!! Why? I gave my body and my brain what it needs to fuel my bony ass for a little bit longer. And that\u2019s a win. \n\nLook, it\u2019s a battle, a slow, shitty battle that no one can relate to unless they\u2019re balls deep in it. I\u2019m still balls deep in it, and most of you are too, whether you wanna admit it or not, we all need to change and quite honestly I know we all do. Do it. Do it. Do it. Fuck it all. Fuck em, fuck em, fuck it!!!!!!!!! We are all gonna die someday, and none of us wanna die like this. No one deserves to die like this. \n\nGood luck, I\u2019m proud of you and I trust that everyone here will give themselves what they need today and for the rest of your life. You are beautiful, you will be beautiful until you die, and no food you eat or aspect of life you love will take that from you. Only continuing to disregard them will. \u2764\ufe0f",

But I realized that if I do nothing, it\u2019s the same as trying to at least listen to all the people I have watched uproot their lives for me, just based on this fixation I had on control over what I put in my mouth and how it effected my body. Because at the end of the day, I\u2019ve wasted so much time being miserable about this disorder and the things it has taken from me that I will never get back. And you know what? Not for a second was I happy in that six years. I missed every birthday. Every holiday. Every little treat or silly moment with anything that made me slightly uncomfortable around everyone I love. Well, if being scared of discomfort and change took all that from me, then I wanna be the most uncomfortable person possible. \n\nAll I\u2019m saying is these made up \u201crules\u201d are just that. It\u2019s not even funny. Once you actually register to your brain, push that you have an apple fritter in your mouth and there isn\u2019t a reason you shouldn\u2019t. Or you wanna go out for dinner cause you\u2019re a human and you like eating dinner when you\u2019re hungry. Or maybe you don\u2019t. But you know you need to no? Like we all aren\u2019t dumb; we all know how the body works. We know every detail of everything involving food and gaining and little tricks and all that shit. Can you imagine how much happier you\u2019d be if you spent that time on anything else? Just feeling normal, like a human, like you did as a young kid, just doing what you want, regrets not even existing.\n\nPlease, just once, from a stranger on the internet, I\u2019m asking you. Just go and get whatever you want. Not what you think you want. Not a cop out or a compromise. What do you want for breakfast? Fuck bigger than that. What do you wanna do with your life? You get to choose. Are you going to be a statistic of a disorder that has taken everything from you, myself and everyone who suffers, or are you going to be a new statistic, or not one at all, and not care about it whatsoever. You get to decide. I got my life back because my own father had to sit, crying at 3am at the kitchen table about losing me,because even after I collapsed last week, I still came home and went right back to the same bullshit that would have had me dead by my 21st birthday in April. And you know what. I knew that. And I think that was what scared me the most. \n\nDo something about it\n\nShove. The. Fritter. In. Your. Fritter. Hole. And. Go. To. Disney. On. Ice.\n\n(What I did yesterday :))",

Never weighed myself for half a year while i was gaining weight. I set my mind to this mindset: \u201ci\u2019m gaining weight because it\u2019s the healthy thing to do for my mind and body. I NEED to gain weight and eat MORE calories, because if I don\u2019t, i cant lead a happy life if i\u2019m dead\u201d. Seems like you already realize this; you wont actually ever BE happy trying to chase an unrealistic goal weight because you ultimately know this isn\u2019t a healthy way to live, so try to use that! Use that as a way to sort of CBT-yourself into being okay with seeing your body change. \n\nAlso, I just let myself have some fat tbh. I started seeing my skinny body as ugly, actually i just always thought i was ugly, so i used that to transition into \u201cwell whatever. Lemme just be a bit fat LOL\u201d. Its a bit awkward and i DEFINITELY felt really ugly at first and wanted to quit. But i stuck it out. I started exercising and soon enough, my body evened out and im BLOWN AWAY by the way i actually look \u201cnormal\u201d now. Many compliments from healthy people motivated me to keep continuing. Its slow and you may even relapse, but it really DOES change.",

I NEED to gain weight and eat MORE calories, because if I don\u2019t, i cant lead a happy life if i\u2019m dead\u201d. Seems like you already realize this; you wont actually ever BE happy trying to chase an unrealistic goal weight because you ultimately know this isn\u2019t a healthy way to live, so try to use that! Use that as a way to sort of CBT-yourself into being okay with seeing your body change. \n\nAlso, I just let myself have some fat tbh. I started seeing my skinny body as ugly, actually i just always thought i was ugly, so i used that to transition into \u201cwell whatever. Lemme just be a bit fat LOL\u201d. Its a bit awkward and i DEFINITELY felt really ugly at first and wanted to quit. But i stuck it out. I started exercising and soon enough, my body evened out and im BLOWN AWAY by the way i actually look \u201cnormal\u201d now. Many compliments from healthy people motivated me to keep continuing. Its slow and you may even relapse, but it really DOES change.",

What i can say though is: it\u2019s really good you understand that the way you are loosing weight is not necessarily the healthy way to do it. Thats a great step. Maybe instead of setting goal weights, you can set visual goals. Thats kinda what i\u2019ve been doing (i am a dude who\u2019s following the bulk-cut gym thing) and im about to approach the \u201ccut\u201d. Instead of seeing the weight go down, i would rather see my body toned. Maybe the weight stays stagnant, but i\u2019m replacing fat with muscle mass (muscle weighs almost twice as much as bodyfat, so its very tricky for us suffering/in recovery!!). Counting calories for weight loss is not at all a bad thing, but has it become obsessive? If it\u2019s controlling your life, i think its safe to say that once you reach your \u201cgoal\u201d you will probably not be happy. It\u2019s a weird disease that makes you constantly compare yourself. My best advice is listen to your body, NOT your mind.",

What i can say though is: it\u2019s really good you understand that the way you are loosing weight is not necessarily the healthy way to do it. Thats a great step. Maybe instead of setting goal weights, you can set visual goals. Thats kinda what i\u2019ve been doing (i am a dude who\u2019s following the bulk-cut gym thing) and im about to approach the \u201ccut\u201d. Instead of seeing the weight go down, i would rather see my body toned. Maybe the weight stays stagnant, but i\u2019m replacing fat with muscle mass (muscle weighs almost twice as much as bodyfat, so its very tricky for us suffering/in recovery!!). Counting calories for weight loss is not at all a bad thing, but has it become obsessive? If it\u2019s controlling your life, i think its safe to say that once you reach your \u201cgoal\u201d you will probably not be happy. It\u2019s a weird disease that makes you constantly compare yourself. My best advice is listen to your body, NOT your mind.",
