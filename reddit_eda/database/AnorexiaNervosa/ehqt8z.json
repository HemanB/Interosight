  "selftext": "I know that when u have AN your concept of proportions and food amounts is distorted but I feel like my friends eat so much food. They are constantly snacking and cooking and are still stick thin. This just makes me feel bad about myself because I know that if I ate that much I would blow up like a balloon. This isn\u2019t really a question just wondering if anyone else feels the same.",

Honestly even people who are \u201cfat\u201d deserve to eat when they want to or feel they need to. Other people should do what\u2019s best for them.

You don't need to eat a snack in a 40 min class, you will survive, I promise. This nation has an obesity epidemic but as a thin disordered person I can't talk about it because it's shaming, but it would absolutely do people good to feel a little hunger and not snack so much",
