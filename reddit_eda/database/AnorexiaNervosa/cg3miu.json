Or borscht. Or katletkeh (kinda like a burger/giant meatball), or fish under blanket (wild ass delicious fish salad with shit loads of mayo and it's purple because beets, usually layered like a fucked up lasagna). \n\nHaladetz is broth (usually chicken) that's jellofied with chunks of (usually) chicken, seasoning, egg, garlic, misc things depending on the family. But the point is, it's meat jello. It's actually delicious but VERY weird.\n\nEdit - punctuation",
