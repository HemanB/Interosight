  "selftext": "Well it's finally happened. I was taken to the hospital because I was short of breath, dizzy, blurry vision, loss of balance. They did labs and the doctor said \"I don't know what's going on I'm going to get you to a smarter doctor and admit you upstairs because I saw those labs and said 'boom admission'\". He said my glucose is low and my blood is dangerously acidic. He said \"It's like your body is starving but you're not\" I can't tell him that I am. I haven't eaten since 5pm Friday, and intended not eating until this upcoming Friday. I know, terrible, but I'm an addict. I can't bring myself to eat. They brought me apple juice? Dumped it in the linens bin. Brought me peanut butter? Stuffed it in a glove and threw the glove away. I am fat so the last thing they suspect is starvation. I know I need to eat and I would tell anyone else to eat but I can't bring myself to do it. ",

Let the staff there stabilise you, at least for now, please. Speak to the nurse or doctor you trust the most. You're gorgeous and you don't deserve this pain.",
