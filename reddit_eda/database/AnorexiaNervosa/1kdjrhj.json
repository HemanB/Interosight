I also had terrible body image, so I think he relied on that. But I didn\u2019t bc, didn\u2019t bother myself weighing, didn\u2019t count calories, didn\u2019t have ANY fear foods.\n\nThe Dr. sent me to treatment based on my weight (which was very low but stable \u2014 I was maintaining), and my first time in treatment, the ED thoughts ramped up, and I started engaging in a lot more of the stereotypical behaviors.

Professionals refusing to work with someone who isn\u2019t willing to recover/go to a higher level of care/sign a contract is unethical and causes more harm. Threatening people into recovery doesn\u2019t work. \n\nNo one wants to admit it, but oftentimes the ED is serving a function and, as a coping strategy or protective thing, it WORKS. There are downsides, yes, but forcing someone to give up ED behaviours that may be keeping them safe in other ways is cruel. Virtually everyone has harmful and negative coping mechanisms, whether that is alcohol/substances, relationship issues, overeating, isolation, overworking, self harm, whatever.

The diagnosis criteria is incredible invalidating for the majority of people with genuine eds and there are way too many factors playing into an individuals life that lead them to not falling into that very specific criteria. The majority of people, for example, with anorexia, fall into the \"atypical\" category specifically because of their bmi even though most doctors acknowledge that bmi is fucking arbitrary and health issues as a result from eds happen at ALL weights/bmi categories. \nI understand why these criteria were made, but eds are much too prevalent to invalidate a person who definitely has issues when these disorders often feed off of not feeling sick enough. It's a hell of a lot easier to prevent things from getting worse and validate each other for our struggles as they are than it is to keep seeing people suffer and give each other imposter's syndrome.",

Ednos is probably wayyy more common amongst the ed community but no one would ever know that because people think they either have mia or Ana only.\n\n2. I keep seeing people who binge without purging claim they are bulimic. That's just wrong.\n\n3. Some people don't have eating disorders, they just wanna lose weight quick. Skipping breakfast and reducing caloric intake does NOT make you disordered.\n\n4. I've seen too many overweight/obese people claim that they are anorexic, and that literally makes me laugh every single time. A literal criterion for Ana diagnosis is to be underweight, which these people are not. They think starving for a day makes them anorexic, and that pisses me tf off.\n\n5. Anyone who claims they average over 100 000 steps a day is lying and they're rigging the system. Unless they literally eat as many calories as they burn off, there is no chance they are able to consistently hit 100k steps.\n\n6. Liars are the worst thing to happen to the ed community. All people are trying to do nowadays is one up everyone so they appear more disordered or sick, and it's so harmful. Some of these lies are actually getting out of hand, because tell me why I keep seeing people claim they lost 5kgs in 3 days? people claim they walked 120k steps in a day? people claim they hit bmi 8? people claim they have fasted for over 96 hours without any caloric intake? Lmfao, I saw some claim they dry fasted for a month\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f it's embarrasing and harmful, and all it does is make people try and obtain some crazy standard of illness which is literally not humanly possible.\n\n7. If you make you're entire personality and lifestyle centre around recovery, then you are not truly recovered.\n\n8. People have no idea what body dysmorphia is anymore and they just fake it for attention. People keep posting body checks of their toothpick arms and call themselves fat. People post themselves wrapping their hand around their thigh and asking people if they look like a hippo. I've seen countless girl post body checks of themselves while inpatient and asking if they look like a beluga whale, knowing damn well they don't. It's super harmful and just attention seeking. How do I know this? Because I genuinely have body dysmorphia and even thinking about posting a single picture of myself for the whole internet to scrutinize makes my skin crawl and causes me nausea. \n\n9. Some folks on edtwt are insufferable. They make tweets saying \"I just saw someone with bmi 50\"\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f pls dpmo. They act as if overweight people or people with BED aren't really disordered and they do t take them seriously enough. It's so strange seeing people act surprised at bmi 60 when we have seen people with bmi 7. Coming from an anorexic, if I were to ever post on twt as someone with BED, id probably have suicidal tendencies because of the way people treat people with BED. WE ARE ALL DISORDERED\n\nI think that's all for now. I know this is super long, but I've seen too many thing that js make my blood boil yet I don't see anyone talk about it. I know ive generalized alot of things, so feel free to correct me or share your own opinions on the things I've said.",

For me, it took my organs actually starting to fail for it to finally click for me that this might actually, in fact, be severe anorexia, not just occasionally \"weird with food.\" I had a... bad medical event, alone, but survived just fine without intervention by pure dumb luck. But in the time after that, I was still constantly convinced I was dying, imminently, at all times, every single time my fucked-up body did anything even remotely fucked-up.\n\nWhich was (and still is) pretty often. So now that I've been scared off by almost dying alone in the bathroom from this goddamn illness, I've been forced to acknowledge it and realize how bad I've become. Because of the constant denial of my eating disorder, both from myself and the world, it only burrowed deeper and deeper into my perception of normal. I got worse and worse for years and years without even realizing. I genuinely thought I was perfectly healthy and functional, all things considered.\n\nIt's weird seeing the past with so much unpleasant clarity... recovering enough to make my brain work again probably helps. Starting a mood stabilizer that actually works on me has probably been a factor too. But I can't just \"recover\" as if it's a virus or something that will leave permanently. I can't unwire the thought patterns. I already feel like I was exaggerating or being dramatic back then, or that I measured wrong, or I wasn't actually in danger, etc etc etc. If I don't replace it with another coping mechanism soon, I'm gonna instinctively go right back to trying to control my life through my body. Which is the cycle of the disorder controlling me, ironically. \n\nMy perception  of myself and my past is distorted, which is part of the eating disorder, and I know that, but my mind still takes it all in before I can catch it. The absolute lack of other witnesses means all I have as a record is my own memory and some photos. It's so hard to know what's real. It's so hard to get help when your disorder is extremely private and intentionally hidden.\n\nThis has gotten longer than I meant for it to be. I'm not trying to write a whole personal narrative, lol. All this just to say: I'm relieved it's not just me, and I'm so sorry you've had to go through this shit alone. Wishing you well",

Choosing to remain sick isn\u2019t a bad or wrong choice, even if that choice is a direct result of the ED itself. \n\nOf course I want recovery for everyone (except maybe myself lol) and that would be the ideal scenario but some ppl aren\u2019t capable of it at the moment, aren\u2019t ready, or don\u2019t want to and *that\u2019s fine*. Professionals refusing to work with someone who isn\u2019t willing to recover/go to a higher level of care/sign a contract is unethical and causes more harm. Threatening people into recovery doesn\u2019t work. \n\nNo one wants to admit it, but oftentimes the ED is serving a function and, as a coping strategy or protective thing, it WORKS. There are downsides, yes, but forcing someone to give up ED behaviours that may be keeping them safe in other ways is cruel. Virtually everyone has harmful and negative coping mechanisms, whether that is alcohol/substances, relationship issues, overeating, isolation, overworking, self harm, whatever. No one coerces them into giving those things up or tells them they\u2019re just delusional and incapable of making decisions\u2026 until it\u2019s a restrictive ED.",

The diagnosis criteria is incredible invalidating for the majority of people with genuine eds and there are way too many factors playing into an individuals life that lead them to not falling into that very specific criteria. The majority of people, for example, with anorexia, fall into the \"atypical\" category specifically because of their bmi even though most doctors acknowledge that bmi is fucking arbitrary and health issues as a result from eds happen at ALL weights/bmi categories. \nI understand why these criteria were made, but eds are much too prevalent to invalidate a person who definitely has issues when these disorders often feed off of not feeling sick enough. It's a hell of a lot easier to prevent things from getting worse and validate each other for our struggles as they are than it is to keep seeing people suffer and give each other imposter's syndrome.",

I think it requires discipline to be a certain kind of anorexic. someone who like, leans ortho. but eating in a redundant, extreme deficit was very easy, just ride out the inertia. I ate a lot of oatmeal and chewed a lot of gum, drank a lot of monster. Eat (insert number) of quest bars a day, rinse/repeat, requires so much less discipline than eating like a normal human being. Much, much easier than trying to eat enough, but not too much, get the right macros, etc. etc. and eating different shit all the time, instead of the same shit over and over.\n\nMy flammable take is: \n\nThere is such a thing at being \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d at an eating disorder. I, personally, was ok at orthorexia, good at anorexia, then bad, then very very good, then, briefly, bad again, then absolutely godly at bulimia, could win some sort of award or something. Guinness book. Of course it\u2019s not *a good thing* to be good at an eating disorder. It\u2019s fucked. But I think, like other people in this thread have said, some people (not all, and I wasn\u2019t one of them) sort of do choose to peruse anorexia specifically, and a lack of success can be disuasive. I think there is such a thing as like, acute adolescent anorexia (or other restrictive ed) that only lasts around a year, and it is p different from chronic or persistent anorexia. (This also speaks to what you said abt the little voice, I think the former can recover without it, but for the latter it\u2019s calcified as a part of who you are as a person, it just gets louder or quieter) \n\nAlso BED prob, atp, has a higher mortality rate from complications than AN, it\u2019s just way, way underdiagnosed, as binge eating and compulsive overeating is more culturally normalized than starving oneself.",

The majority of people, for example, with anorexia, fall into the \"atypical\" category specifically because of their bmi even though most doctors acknowledge that bmi is fucking arbitrary and health issues as a result from eds happen at ALL weights/bmi categories. \nI understand why these criteria were made, but eds are much too prevalent to invalidate a person who definitely has issues when these disorders often feed off of not feeling sick enough.

I ate a lot of oatmeal and chewed a lot of gum, drank a lot of monster. Eat (insert number) of quest bars a day, rinse/repeat, requires so much less discipline than eating like a normal human being. Much, much easier than trying to eat enough, but not too much, get the right macros, etc. etc. and eating different shit all the time, instead of the same shit over and over.\n\nMy flammable take is: \n\nThere is such a thing at being \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d at an eating disorder. I, personally, was ok at orthorexia, good at anorexia, then bad, then very very good, then, briefly, bad again, then absolutely godly at bulimia, could win some sort of award or something. Guinness book. Of course it\u2019s not *a good thing* to be good at an eating disorder. It\u2019s fucked. But I think, like other people in this thread have said, some people (not all, and I wasn\u2019t one of them) sort of do choose to peruse anorexia specifically, and a lack of success can be disuasive. I think there is such a thing as like, acute adolescent anorexia (or other restrictive ed) that only lasts around a year, and it is p different from chronic or persistent anorexia. (This also speaks to what you said abt the little voice, I think the former can recover without it, but for the latter it\u2019s calcified as a part of who you are as a person, it just gets louder or quieter) \n\nAlso BED prob, atp, has a higher mortality rate from complications than AN, it\u2019s just way, way underdiagnosed, as binge eating and compulsive overeating is more culturally normalized than starving oneself.",

I definitely think the other one would be better, but I don\u2019t actually want to do any of them. I just know it will be so much work and lists/schedules that have to do with eating.

But I don\u2019t know how to tell my parents that I don\u2019t want to pursue any of their treatments. I\u2019m scared they will get mad at me and force me. Also I have taken blood tests and heart monitor tests, which have been completely fine, my weigh is just a little low.

There are downsides, yes, but forcing someone to give up ED behaviours that may be keeping them safe in other ways is cruel. Virtually everyone has harmful and negative coping mechanisms, whether that is alcohol/substances, relationship issues, overeating, isolation, overworking, self harm, whatever.

I doubt anything you say would convince your parents or team to just say \u201cok cool you can not do treatment, have a nice life\u201d. You\u2019re young, and chances are you haven\u2019t had a long, enduring, entrenched illness so your chances of recovering and being able to live a full, happy, free life are better now. I advise you to really take this chance to give treatment your all and get this behind you. \n\nThat being said, it\u2019s true that although, as a minor, they CAN make you gain weight and normalize your eating habits, only you can make the decision to commit to recovery and do the psychological work needed to truly get better. I can\u2019t just tell you to do that, your team can\u2019t make you, and it isn\u2019t wrong to not want to recover. I\u2019d argue that not wanting to recover is pretty normal, especially in the earlier years of illness. So, you\u2019re kind of at a crossroads here. You\u2019re probably going to have to do treatment of some kind whether you want to or not, but you can choose to get as much as you can out of that and really give it your best shot, or you can half-ass things and get through it without really giving recovery a chance. \n\nI\u2019m sorry, I probably should have clarified in my original two comments that my stance on this is more so for adults. I don\u2019t think forced treatment works, period, and I am not a fan of FBT\u2026 but I DO feel that family and the healthcare system have a responsibility to minors to try and help them get well even if they do not feel ready to.",

The diagnosis criteria is incredible invalidating for the majority of people with genuine eds and there are way too many factors playing into an individuals life that lead them to not falling into that very specific criteria. The majority of people, for example, with anorexia, fall into the \"atypical\" category specifically because of their bmi even though most doctors acknowledge that bmi is fucking arbitrary and health issues as a result from eds happen at ALL weights/bmi categories. \nI understand why these criteria were made, but eds are much too prevalent to invalidate a person who definitely has issues when these disorders often feed off of not feeling sick enough. It's a hell of a lot easier to prevent things from getting worse and validate each other for our struggles as they are than it is to keep seeing people suffer and give each other imposter's syndrome.",
