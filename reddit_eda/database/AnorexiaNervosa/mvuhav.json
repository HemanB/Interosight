  "selftext": "Ive been dreading to eat my fear food for a long while now, ever since I started trying to recover.. and i always found a way around it. \nToday I wasn\u2019t planning on eating it but the food item I was planning to eat wasn\u2019t able to succeed, so I had no choice, so I just did it.\n\nI feel like I can do anything now, it\u2019s okay, I didn\u2019t loose control for doing that, I ate what my body needed and I feel fine. I want to start tomorrow happier because I know I can do it, so to anyone out there struggling with fear foods and so on, if you try it you will achieve it, and don\u2019t give up \u2661",

Recently been doing quite well so my fianc\u00e9 and I purchase my biggest fear food, I was surprisingly okay. We bought it again about a month later and I had a panic attack after eating it. I have to admit I was also quite shakey and sweaty while purchasing it. Reflecting about this, I\u2019ve figured out what I did wrong. The first time I purchased my fear food, it came in a tiny individual snack size package. The second time I bought it, it came in a larger package (party size?). I guess even after all this time I still need to take baby steps. None of this easy!",
