      "body": "Hey, I just want to say I know this sucks. I know you\u2019re pissed. You\u2019re probably also scared. And the eating disordered part of your brain (\u201cED\u201d) is freaking terrified\u2013but it\u2019s coming out as anger because that\u2019s an easier emotion to feel than the terror, especially when you\u2019re in a situation like being inpatient.\n\nAND, I want to echo a little of what others have said, while also holding space for the valid emotions you\u2019re experiencing. This is a mental illness, and one that requires weight monitoring, especially in an inpatient setting. \n\nIf you\u2019re getting inpatient care, it means you need that care. No EDU is admitting patients who don\u2019t need the level care, because insurance wouldn\u2019t cover it. Most outpatient providers can\u2019t ethically work with someone who is medically unsafe, and again, that\u2019s likely why you\u2019re inpatient right now. \n\nAs much as it sucks, it IS also just part of how treatment works. Especially when going through nutritional rehabilitation and/or weight restoration. It\u2019s extremely common for blind weights to be the norm, and I\u2019m not sure any ED-specific facility would let an adolescent see it, even if they allow adults the choice (some do\u2013but definitely not all\u2013and some that do only really show you a range/trend). I don\u2019t know how old you are, OP, but if you\u2019re under 18 (or even under 21, with close family involvement), that can play a factor. But even if you\u2019re an adult, this can be distressing\u2026and in some places may be policy.\n\nAgain, it sucks, and as much as your brain is fighting against it (because that\u2019s what the disordered brain does), it\u2019s also for your long term benefit. And the cruel part of this illness is that a malnourished brain isn\u2019t capable of accurately perceiving the fact that the body it\u2019s attached to is, in fact, in danger\u2026not until we are nutritionally stable can we even begin to recognize the very real danger, and it\u2019s hard, because the body has to do a lot of recovery much sooner than the mind can follow. \n\nHowever, the only way for the mind to be able to truly follow and heal is to keep pushing through the physical suckiness and trusting the process (or radically accepting it, if you\u2019re not the one making treatment decisions) so your mind has a chance.",

So, I've never interacted with a treatment team in this way (I did POP, we had blind weigh-ins, and I put the scale away at home), but I find that manner of speech upsetting and a bit degrading. \n\nOne had thoughts of their own which may have to do with weight or food. Just because the idea may not be the pinnacle of what shiny-recovery looks like, doesn't make it invalid. \n\nFor those the dietitians and nutritionists who go on about how everyone is different and there is no \"ideal\" apart from being nourished, they sure seem to give a one-size-fits-all attitude sometimes. \n\nThey talk about how ED's are mental-illnesses but later don't apply that notion when making changes to something affecting symptoms of the ED. That may not make too much sense... \n\nBasically, I know/understand/applaud that their job is to make sure your body is nourished/stable, but the way they go about it can take a net-negative toll mentally. Again, personally, I felt like my dietician couldn't give a crap about my feelings, unless I was somewhat sullen after meals and called-out about it. \n\nI've had the most luck and progress-made with therapists who specialize in eating-disorders. Sorry this is rambley; it just baffles me how many of these professionals choose to remain clueless.",
