  "selftext": "Recently, I went to the movies with some friends. We got a huge bucket of popcorn to share, and I ate less than both of my friends did, I hardly had any of the popcorn and then when we went out for dinner a few hours after the movie and I wanted to order a salad wrap, one of them said \u2018good choice, you ate like half the popcorn earlier,\u2019 and they both laughed at me. I didn\u2019t end up eating dinner. Then they proceeded to comment on how I wasn\u2019t eating, and said \u2018bro why are you starving yourself??\u2019 I don\u2019t even know what to do anymore. I can\u2019t please anyone. \n\nI feel like every time I eat in front of people they make comments about it, despite the fact that all my friends know about my experience with anorexia. The comments just keep coming. Now I can\u2019t eat anywhere except my house, because I\u2019m terrified of what people will say.",

      "body": "they are not good friends, or even good people for that matter! to comment on things like that with other people is so rude and harmful, and it is completely unacceptable since they know about your ed. \n\nit can be really awkward to speak up against people, especially those who are \u2018friends\u2019 but if what they\u2019re saying is negatively affecting you then that is probably the best thing to do- if you set boundaries and they still don\u2019t respect them, try to distance yourself from hanging out with them in general. it can cause some unnecessary issues just to completely stop being friendly with them, but if hanging out with them is damaging then try to focus on yourself and not hang around them as much. it sounds way easier than it is, but it will be so helpful in the long run! \n\nremember you are loved, i hope things get better for you!! :))",
