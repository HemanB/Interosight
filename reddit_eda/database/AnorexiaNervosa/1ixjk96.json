  "selftext": "Having this disorder feels like having an awful, controlling partner that makes you feel seen in a way no one else can. I\u2019m sad. I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m angry. I need to be hungry, yet I am so sick of that fucking feeling. A part of me wants to waste away into nothing. It makes me insane to admit but another part of me wants to eat everything and anything in sight. I\u2019d eat lucky charms and Nutella and seven million calories of whatever the fuck I want, and I wouldn\u2019t care at all. I can feel my brain becoming foggy and passive, but it\u2019s like there\u2019s some ravenous animal inside of me that will go ham on whatever\u2019s in front of it as soon as it gets the chance: Ritz bits, granola\u2014those cheesecake bites in the dining hall at my uni. It feels like not eating is the only way to sedate \u2018the beast.\u2019 It also feels like it\u2019s only making it worse. I\u2019m stuck between a rock and a hard place, and I\u2019m so scared to see what\u2019s going to happen. Eating is so human. I don\u2019t want to be human I think. Does anyone relate to this? ",

      "body": "I\u2019m currently sitting at a diner eating breakfast before work because I knew it was the only way I  would eat. I\u2019m in recovery, but the past few days I\u2019ve also had that feeling of hungry-numbness that almost feels good. I know I have to keep eating to get better. \n\nI would recommend looking into a program called Renfrew they\u2019re awesome. Just set up a call you don\u2019t have to commit. You can always ask for help from a loved one to help you set up appointments with care providers who can support you right now if that is feeling too hard. \n\nI\u2019d also recommend going and getting the cereal and your preferred milk product. I often use cereal to help me want to eat in the mornings. When your feeling that foggy and numb it can be really hard to make decisions (which can reduce feelings of overwhelm) - gifting yourself something quick that you know you\u2019ll like is a great first step. \n\nDon\u2019t give up!!!! <3",
