Life is much more than our physical forms, but without them, there is no life.\n\nTaking care of yourself will allow you to experience life, and all the wonders it has in store. If your body is broken, it makes it that much more difficult to appreciate the beautiful moments. You could be in the most beautiful place on earth, and if you hate yourself, you will not see it. You'll miss it, and 15 years later be begging to go back/do something again. Take this courage and jump, leave this nonsense in the dust, you deserve it!",

You don\u2019t need to hear this, though. You need a solid support system which it seems like you can access. I don\u2019t know you but I love you, and I\u2019m rooting for you.",
