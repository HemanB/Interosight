It is necessary to face up to the realities of our existence in order to move forward. But I\u2019m not gonna lie, this scene hurt. I felt as disheartened as she did. \u201cJust be strong and face facts and your life will be amazing\u201d feels dismissive, even within the context of deeper therapy.\n\nOf course, this is fiction, and we don\u2019t see all of the deeper therapy. But the scene in the rain room (idk what else to call it) resonated with me in a more positive way. I felt it made the point he\u2019s trying to get across here into a visceral experience (facing the rain to find joy in it), which feels freeing, whereas platitudes can often make one feel trapped.\n\nClearly, I had mixed feelings about the film. I\u2019m also rambling. So uh thanks for coming to my TED talk lol.\n\nETA: the first slide was part of the movie that I really loved. \u201cFuck off\u201d is a useful strategy. I was only really referring to the second slide in this ramble.",
