  "selftext": "i suffered from anorexia as a teenager and am now relapsing. I had gained some weight over the past years (overweight BMI) and just wanted to get back to a healthy weight so started a diet about a year ago. anyway fast forward to now, i am relapsing into very disordered behavior (starving, over exercising, laxative abuse..) and I opened up to my boyfriend about my past and current struggles.. he just said \u201eyeah well u can still lose some more weight without it being unhealthy\u201c (I am currently on the low side of a \u201enormal\u201c bmi, bordering on underweight.) it just made me feel so awful that he did not take me serious at all and I feel super discouraged from getting help now because I feel like I\u2019m not sick enough to be taken serious",

I understand that most people don\u2019t understand eating disorders but in no way should he be saying that you need to lose weight when he knows you\u2019re losing it in a dangerous way. You need to think of yourself and your own mental health. My boyfriend now is amazing with me. He doesn\u2019t pressure me to eat but gives me little nudges and helped me see that I have a problem and need to get help. You need someone, even if it\u2019s yourself and or your friends and family or a therapist, that\u2019s going to help you see your worth and help you through it. Not drag you back.",

Comments to simply \u201c leave him\u201d are misguided and unhelpful. Just continue communicating and also have other supports to reach out to. I absolutely cannot expect people who aren\u2019t me to understand my triggers and my brain if I don\u2019t let it be known, but most people are very understanding and want to be helpful, just need to learn how :)",
