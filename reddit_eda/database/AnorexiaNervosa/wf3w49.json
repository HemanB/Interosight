  "selftext": "My parents didn\u2019t even know I was tracking to begin with so it\u2019s not like I can tell them how big of a step this is for me, so here I am attempting to get validation from strangers on the internet.\n\nIt genuinely felt so freeing though. I ordered one scoop of speculoos ice cream but they gave me like a massive cone\u2026 which usually would make me freak out because it would be over a certain number but it didn\u2019t and I ate it all :)",
