  "selftext": "Ana male here. Maybe this is because I'm part of the small percentage of males in the whole ana scene, but I get so pissed off whenever I see the little \"delicate little butterfly\" bs. Im not even talking about pros, I mean the actual retraction of anorexia anywhere that's always showing a delicate, cute, insecure precious little girl aching for perfection. All that on tones of light pink and with a Lana del something song playing in the background. I wish we would get over with the romantization thing and start showing the gross part of this all. No I do not feel like a pretty little flower for having ana,it's necessarily the other way around. and I bet most people agree with me. We should start treating and showing off ana the way it is; hell. No flowers, butterflies or delicate poems. It's gross. It's fucking disgusting and I don't think ppl see that enough. When will this start being treated like the sickness it is?",

I think people will always stay romanticizing it to some degree though, and those people tend to oversaturate the community (unfortunately). There's a reason why ignorant people call this a women's disease.\n\nJust up to more people to be able to open up and not be shameful to show the gross sides of it. Because clearly it's not all sunshine-stanley cup-lana del-ricecake. We need to de-saturate the community and show the truth more often. \n\n(Edit: and I'm not saying it's our fault that things are this way, just trying to say more people should make an effort to break the stereotypes.)",
