But even though I don\u2019t see myself as underweight, I know that I am because I know what my BMI is.\n\nMost professionals that I speak to seem surprised at my level of insight because I don\u2019t insist that I\u2019m healthy and don\u2019t need to gain weight. I know cognitively that I need to gain, I just don\u2019t SEE it. Do you guys have similar experiences, or do you genuinely believe that you\u2019re healthy when your BMI is underweight?",
