And after that i even ate chips!\n\nAfter that i ate dinner but now I have so much pain in my stomach... i was trying to eat al of it because i hate food waste. But i couldn't. I even ate 2 snacks\nBlue berry's and a few raisins! \n\nI was so scared to eat chips. But in the end there was nothing to be worried about!\n\nSharing this so maybe you can try eating something you're scared of so we can do it together!\u2764",
