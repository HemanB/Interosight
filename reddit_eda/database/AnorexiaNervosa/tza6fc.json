Whatever babysteps you need to take is perfectly valid. Some people eating donuts is a step forward.  For others it's a set back. And others means they have a shitty support system that ignores their emotional needs.  ANA isn't about food control, that's just the symptom. It's about having control when you don't feel like you have it in other parts of your life. Aka, bullshit like this.\n\nIf they wanted to support you, they would acknowledge you first and make a reasonable selection of your \"safe\" foods with an option of a few foods you find challenging with absolutely no pressure to finish the challenge food. \n\nI hope you get a better support system cuz that sucks",
