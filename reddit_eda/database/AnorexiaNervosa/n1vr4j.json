I\u2019ve been told I look dramatically healthier in the summer because I get a tan, literally no other difference lmao. \n\n\nEd recovery comes with so many physical benefits. Less exhausted which often translates to higher energy or more \u201cpep in your step\u201d, less stress which means a happier mood, I make more eye contact and interact more with people when I\u2019m not restricting, less shakey from overconsumption of caffeine, healthier hair/skin/nails, etc, and people notice those things more than they notice weight many times.\n\n\nSo so proud of you for choosing recovery. Join us over in r/AnorexiaRecovery if you\u2019re not already there. Super supportive community! Sending you lots of love and support \u2764\ufe0f",

Comments like this are not meant to harm, but instead are meant to break the ice so to speak.\n\nYou're aware that you look different, and so are the people you work with. This person was aware of that & wanted to make it a positive moment, a \"welcome back\" in a way.\n\n& like others have said before, healthy can mean a lot of things. Brighter eyes, shiny hair, clear vibrant skin, energy, a smile, etc. It could literally be that you styled your hair differently & they noticed.\n\nEither way, keep up the great work of recovery! I got my first \"you look so healthy, that must not be a problem for you anymore\" when I was about 6 months into my first honest recovery attempt...it also came from my ex.\n\nDust off the bullshit & keep living your life!",
