I'd consider these women close friends, I've known them for 6 years and while I've shared much about my life, I've never expressed anything about my eating disorder until now. \n\nThey noticed my weight loss and asked how. And I decided to be honest and say I've been stressed and purposefully starving myself to feel some semblance of control over my stress.\n\nTheir response: \"God, I wish I had that!\"\n\nI now know not to mention these struggles to people.

I wasn\u2019t even mad.. Because I just never heard any one of my friends confront me like that and validate my ED & tell me that I was too skinny. And I think that I liked hearing those words and felt good about it. Ha.\nAnyway, maybe they just didn\u2019t know wut to say. Seems like their reaction was to act jealous. \nI\u2019m sry u had to go thru that. That wasn\u2019t cool or even right! They need to grow up! \nI\u2019m sorry, hang in there!!",
