  "selftext": "So... since the last time I posted, so much has happened. My parents were in a horrible car wreck, my dad was okay. My mom... she was DOA, but they were able to revive her. He heart stopped multiple times, she has horrible crush injuries to her chest, she needed ten lifesaving surgeries. And after a month in the icu, she came home and I became her primary care giver, nurse, if you will. \n\nPoint being I'm utterly traumatized. When I first went to visit my parents in June, I was XXX lbs, I am now XX lbs. \n\nI came back to florida, bc it was obvious that I was killing myself trying to take care of my mom- working myself to the bone, apparently.\n\nI saw my old therapist yesterday, she was my therapist in my treatment center but recently went into private practice.\n\nEveryone, neighbors, friends, random acquaintances, all see me and ask me if I'm okay. If I've eaten. Should I really be taking my dog on 3 mile walks with my weight like this? \n\nLike... how is it any of your business? No, my mom died multiple times and I then spent months cleaning her wounds, bathing her,  checking her pulse-ox, her heart monitor, watching her cough up blood... SO NO IM NOT OKAY. \n\nMy therapist yesterday put stipulations on us continuing to work with eachothera mainly because two nights ago I ended up in the hospital because I fainted and am severely underweight for my height and I now have a concussion. \n\nHer stipulations are EDA meetings, and scheduling a time everyday to let myself feel- to embrace the flashbacks and the pain and guilt I feel over not being strong enough for my mom to be able to stay. \n\nAnd that's fine... but it's not. Because even though everyone I see tells me they're worried about me, when I look in the mirror I just see fat, I don't see this skin and bones thing everyone's talking about. \n\nIm terrified of gaining weight, but I know I need to do it, but... the thought makes me cry.",

      "body": "I can\u2019t believe this happened to you. This is honestly so heartbreaking to read. I love my parents so much and I cannot imagine seeing them in such a defenseless state. You probably don\u2019t want blatant sympathy, because in reality, none of us can fully relate. I get it. You might find no motivation to get better, or even want to, but your mom needs you and imagine your dad if he found how much you were struggling. The last thing they\u2019d want is their daughter in the hospital, or worse... Sometimes sacrifices are hard to make but they are absolutely necessary, even if you end up struggling on the way. People who check  up on you probably don\u2019t understand how to talk to people with an eating disorder and are in fact making a situation worse. I just try and put myself in their shoes for a change, but it can be super annoying. Don\u2019t let it discourage you. If I had let their words get to me, I wouldn\u2019t recovered. You are so important right now to your family and friends. They need you much more than you think. Life is too short, you only get one, why not live it out to its maximum capacity and see what\u2019s in store for you. After all, things can only get better(if you let them!!) trust me, this isn\u2019t a one way road. Good things will happen to you, you just have to give it time and tlc. \n\nIf a stranger on reddit giving you advice is unhelpful, than look at it as advice from an anorexic since 12, fully recovered, whose overcome grief with my siblings death and yet was able to find purpose in life. It\u2019s possible. Please know that. No matter how hard and how long your bad days/months/years are, it will get better. It will. It will. It will.",

You were caring for your loved-one- on no energy/nothing in you to give!! I really think that YOU need to be taken care of.\n\nI think this kind of situation is a situation where some form of inpatient treatment would help. At least a few weeks to a month. I\u2019m no doctor, obviously, so who actually knows.\n\nIn the end it should be about you. Would it really be that bad to gain a bit of weight (even if you end up losing it) so that you can feel better-maybe get some sleep- have some more intensive therapy?\n\nLike I said before though, I\u2019m the champion of quitting treatment. I just think that YOU need some TLC after helping to take care of your beautiful mum/after all that\u2019s happened.",
