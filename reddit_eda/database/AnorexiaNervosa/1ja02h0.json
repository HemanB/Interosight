  "selftext": "I miss being anorexic. I miss seeing my rips show in the mirror. My eating disorder got so bad that I went to the hospital but I relapsed with bulimia. Plus the big reason I had my eating disorder is because I want to get rid of my chest. I have chest dysphoria.  I should be happy because good things are in my life right now. I have a supportive girlfriend, I got a new job that involves dogs and I haven't self harmed in a while. Yet I can't help but have problems with my body still.  ",

      "body": "I think this is the important distinction. There's recovery of body, and recovery of mind. We can clinically go through 'recovery' which is caloric needs, healthy exercise, balanced meals multiple times a day, and achieve a body that looks to the naked eye healthy.\n\nThat does not mean our MIND is healthy. That does not mean the Anorexia is recovered in the mind. The disease starts in the mind, the body follows the mind's patterned behaviour. But if the mind is still diseased, then the body is merely a disjointed meatsack existing independently from the disease.\n\nIt's where I'm at, now. I've put on weight... Not a lot, but enough to push me out of the \"doctors are keeping an eye on me\" BMI category. I've got muscle tone from exercising. I'm eating three meals a day. I'm hydrating. My \\*body\\*, as in my fat cells and muscles and organs, are recovering from lifelong malnutrition......... But I still have the anorectic brain. And that brain is still crying at seeing fat in places I don't believe it should exist.\n\nThis is normal. This is real. And this is part of the experience.",

I\u2019m trying to think on a meta level and see this phase as part of the healing process, knowing it won\u2019t last forever\u2014as long as I choose every day to go against the anorexia. Acceptance is key. Stay of social media and diet culture and try to surround yourself with people without disorderd eating behaviors. Try to focus on the goal and don't let yourself distract from these little traps like \"oh I would definitely feel better if I just eat a bit more healthy or lose a bit weight\". It's like taking drugs: You get some short time relief but in the long term, it's getting your mental state worse.\n\nAlso if those thoughts come up, immediately think about all the negative things which comes with an emaciated body and the reason why you choose recovery in the first place.",

But I have to push through with recovery, so I have the energy to work and get money to one day have top surgery, and keep pursuing starting T... all of that came to a complete halt when I was deep in the disorder since I was barely able to do anything, and even if I'm more uncomfortable in my body right now, im doing it for the complete freedom and happiness of my future self.
