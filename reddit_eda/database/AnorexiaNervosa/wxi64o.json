But as others have mentioned, calories aren't black and white. Take corn for example. You eat it, you can count it as calories, but if you don't really chew ut especially, it pretty much comes out whole, due to the fiber in it. So honestly just try to eat healthy, lots of fiber, and you'll be fine. (My personal opinion, also, in full understanding of why do humans have to have to eat, i'd rather photosynthesize tbh)...",
