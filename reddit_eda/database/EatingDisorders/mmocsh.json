  "selftext": "My therapist made me aware of this eating disorder since I show a lot of the traits. It\u2019s basically an obsession with healthy eating and the idea that a food must be \u201cpure\u201d and healthy in order for me to be able to eat it. I get so scared about going out to eat because none of the options are going to be healthy. It makes me want to avoid social events. If I eat any kind of junk food i spiral, thinking that I\u2019m going to have a heart attack and die because I\u2019m so unhealthy, etc. (I am very young, heart disease doesn\u2019t run in my family, and I am normal weight if not a little under). And then the next day I feel the need to restrict and only eat the cleanest foods possible. \nI know logically that a heart attack won\u2019t happen, but because this ED often goes hand in hand with OCD I can\u2019t get my brain to believe differently. I never hear of anybody else with orthorexia and just wanted to ask.",

I only just found out that orthorexia was a thing, and that this is what my brother had, not anorexia. I understand that there seem to be way less resources surrounding orthorexia, so it may seem like there\u2019s not many people who have it versus other EDs. If you want I could ask him for any information regarding how he healed and recovered. I know he read a lot of books to help him abandon his obsessive mindset.\nSince I haven\u2019t had orthorexia myself I can\u2019t offer you any resources on my end but I just want you to know other people do struggle with it and hoped sharing my brothers story of recovery might let you know there is hope for healing.

      "body": "I feel like when i started \"recovering\" from anorexia my orthorexia started developing, but it's all so confusing because I was also recently diagnosed with OCD so I'm not sure if it's orthorexia or an obsession around my health. I feel like these things are always fighting with each other. I'm hyper focused on my stomach. Like I know I'm skinny. Kind of like a stick. I'm very small, but when I get bad I'll panic about how my stomach is bigger or all of a sudden feel like I have to start restricting due to a fear of becoming fat. It's such a stupid fear and it's completely irrational but it's more like I'm scared that all of a sudden I'll be fat and it will be my fault for not paying attention. So this fuels ruminations about food/ compulsions to go to the gym. My brain will literally start cataloguing what i can eat that won't make me gain weight but also get me optimal nutrition. It's a losing battle. I have specific foods I avoid like sugar, gluten, grains, ingredients i don't recognize, non whole-foods, beer, etc etc. But then I also try to eat as much fat and protein as possible because I'm trying to give my body everything it possibly needs to be as healthy as possible. I also get weirdly fixated on moving my body and going to the gym. I get really upset if I can't go to the gym or hike. In the past I have gone to the gym sick and injured in order to carry out my compulsions so that I could give myself permission to eat. I also have obsessions surrounding money & my bank account and used to have existential ocd really bad. Also have lots of health related obsessions and skin picking issues. Sometimes it gets so bad that i just want to sleep through it so i don't have to deal with the ruminations/compulsions but other days I'm chill and feel like I didn't even struggle with these things. It's so confusing sometimes. I usually feel like I'm faking all of it because it literally doesn't make sense sometimes. I hope that helps. lol.",

      "body": "Hi! I went trough this in 2018. It started as \u00abwanting to eat a little healthier\u00bb but became very obsessive, and i started viewing certain foods as \u00abbad\u00bb, and decided i would never ever have them again, Because they contained something i refused to put in my body. The thought of ever eating them again almost disgusted me in a way that i cant explain. This caused me to isolate myself Because i felt like it was better to avoid any situation where i might have to eat anything that wasnt healthy enough. Long story short, i was practically Forced into recovery by my mom, and she would make me eat foods that were waaay out of my comfortzone, and she would often confront me about Why i wasnt eating certain foods in a very aggressive way. Im doing much better now, and i treat myself with foods that i used to think of as \u00abbad\u00bb if i want to Because I know that eating something i am craving wont do any harm to my body as long as i eat nutritious foods most of the time. The truth is that no foods are good or bad, there are just some foods that have more nutrients, while other have less, but even if they are not that nutritious, you deserve to treat youself with the foods you love, Because it wont  do harm, and you only live once, so you should enjoy it and not restrict. \nI know this is hard to understand when you are battling orthorexia, but its the truth. I did not want to accept this in 2018 when i was 14, but I have learned that everything is okay in moderation\ud83e\udd70 wish you all the best",
