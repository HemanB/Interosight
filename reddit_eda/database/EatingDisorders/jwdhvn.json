  "selftext": "So my eating disorder has started to return and I am managing it with therapy and my supportive partner. \n\nHowever, I struggle with coping with the compliments I get from people in my family and friends about my weight loss. This happens everytime my ED returns and I have never found a way to manage it and just makes me get worse as it re-enforces that worst part of my mind/thinking.\n\nDoes anyone else get this or have any advice?",
