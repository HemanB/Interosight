  "title": "Told my boyfriend about my eating disorder but his response (work out more!) just made it worse",
  "selftext": "I (F30) have been seeing my boyfriend (M23) for a few months now. I had a bad eating disorder in my early 20s but since then I\u2019ve been doing really well other than the odd bad dayor so. I\u2019ve always been able to snap myself back out of it quickly. No man I\u2019ve dated since has ever triggered anything in me until this guy..\nWhen I first started seeing my boyfriend I noticed he followed a lot of very skinny insta models.. like VERY skinny. Some of the pictures he had liked were extremely shocking to me (skeletal women with visible rib cages) and it felt like a punch in the stomach and from there it\u2019s just completely reignited my insecurities with my body and made me question how he could be attracted to me when I am so much bigger than these girls. \nSince then I\u2019ve been restricting food again and exercising a lot. It got obsessive and even though I\u2019ve been losing weight I\u2019ve just felt worse and worse about myself and still not good enough. My boyfriend does compliment me a lot, but other than my boobs he\u2019s not ever made a compliment specifically about my body, just generic \u2018you look hot/sexy\u2019. The last guy I was seeing\u2019s jaw would literally drop every time he saw me naked and he would tell me repeatedly that I have the most perfect body he\u2019s ever seen, so in comparison to him, plus the instagram pictures, I just know I don\u2019t have his ideal body.\n\nAnyway things started getting bad recently and I decided to let him in on how I was feeling. His response was \u2018if you want to be skinny then just go to the gym more\u2019.. I told him how much I\u2019d been working out and he was like \u2018well not rigorously enough\u2019 and he was discussing like meal plans and stuff too. It just made me feel 10000x worse about myself, like he was agreeing with my ED. Not once did he reassure me and say I was already skinny. Tbh that\u2019s all I really needed. For him to say I am skinny and he\u2019s super attracted to me and I would have been fine. \n\nI know he was coming from a clueless place, just trying to be supportive and clearly hadn\u2019t got a clue about EDs so I encouraged him to research it but he got a bit annoyed with me when I mentioned it. He reluctantly agreed but I\u2019m not sure he actually will. \n\nIn every other way he\u2019s the perfect boyfriend and I love him so much but I just feel so much worse after telling him and I wish I just didn\u2019t say anything. How can I make myself feel better and not focus on his encouragement to workout more? ",

Intentions are rarely malicious but words and actions hurt either way. Parents who hit their children do it \"for the child's good\" and they genuinely believe that. Still, we understand that it's absolutely awful and incredibly harmful.\n\n\n\nYour boyfriend's behaviour is harmful to you and he doesn't seem to be receptive to the idea of changing it. I've been in a similar boat with family and ex-friends and let me tell you, it is BAD to be surrounded by people who encourage and support your eating disorder.\n\n\n\n\nIf you tell someone \"I haven't eaten in three days and the day before that I had a salad so you know I need to go run 14 km today even though it's raining because it will burn XXX calories haha.\" and they tell you \"Yassss you should do it!! That's so stonks!!\" Get out of there.",

      "body": "someone like that is so disgusting to me lol. I don't date men who have severely unrealistic preferences for women's bodies, which is often a symptom of internet/porn/instagram brainrot. I actually hate thinking that those people can get any girlfriends at all. Anorexia has one of the highest mortality rates of any psychiatric disorder. Do not let this man help kill you oh my god. \n\nHaving a boyfriend helped me recover (this was years ago) because he ate all my meals with me and reassured me over and over that I was still beautiful and he still loved me even when i was gaining recovery weight \ud83d\ude4f. And he encouraged me not to hurt myself exercising because I would exercise until I was in so so much pain. Having pure love during this process is so so valuable and can be so helpful in those dark moments. So honestly your bf making your illness worse is so infuriating. \n\nmaybe he doesn't understand that he's hurting you but that doesn't mean he isn't. it also doesn't have to be an additional burden on you to try and \"educate\" him on the impact of your mental illness if he heard you the first time and failed to read the room. \n\nIf he really was the prefect boyfriend he would care about your obvious distress around this topic and not give you more tips on how to hurt yourself more effectively lol. The perfect boyfriend listens when you say that his actions are hurting you. \n\nAnyway. I would say it is really important with all the information you have to think a lot about what is best for you. If you think he is able to listen to you and change the way he offers support to not make your mental illness worse (and maybe make it better) then maybe he is the perfect boyfriend and you should keep him in your life. If you look at him and you already know he can't support you like that then you're lying to yourself lol. What are you going to do the next time you have a problem he doesn't understand, you could get screwed again! Romantic partners should not make your life worse!!! That is not what they are for!!!",

      "body": "I understand you care about him, but you need to care about yourself too, and this guy does not seem like a willing participant in that.  \nSome people do not know how to approach people with EDs... my boyfriend didn't handle it well at first but that was about him learning not to pressure me to eat/shame me for not eating... your boyfriend is encouraging you to enter the downward spiral. Even without knowing how to approach an ED, when you're sharing vulnerability about your body and all that, his response was to encourage it by telling you that you aren't working out rigorously enough?  \nThen he got annoyed with you when you suggested resources to help him understand... you should feel safe sharing these things with your boyfriend, and even if he doesn't know how to respond, he demonstrated impatience and dismissiveness and reluctance in trying to figure out how to support you. Doesn't sound like he showed compassion or patience for what you were feeling.\n\nYOU are worth it. Dealing with a guy spending his time scrolling through instagram is not worth it and telling you you're not working out rigorously enough? Also not worth it.  \nDon't focus on comparing yourself to all those instagram girls or feeling like you're not enough. You are enough for a man who will appreciate you and be there for you. Focus on returning to healing and self-love, since it seems he's not very interested in being a part of that you know? Commenting on your boobs and saying you're hot doesn't constitute as being there for your well-being.\n\nI know it's hard but he sounds like a vacuum for your self-confidence. He can have other qualities but this is an important issue and he's encouraging an unhealthy mindset. You are important. Please take care of yourself. This is about your health, and really doesn't seem like he's going to be a contributor to that.\n\nIf he actually tries to change and start encouraging you to be healthy and love yourself, that's one thing. If not, quite simply, you really should get out. Sorry for what you're going through. I believe in your strength",

And EDs are very difficult to explain to most ppl esp when you appear to be ok.   Overall I can promise you men are much more attracted to women that look like they have enough fat on them to get their periods at the minimum.  I had an earring disorder at 14 at 21 I was on a mood stabiliser that kept my weight low.  When I went off it I gained some weight and although of course I was sadly upset with it I noticed that after I gained some weight there was a lot more male attention.\nAlso while I had no control over my eating at the time I couldn\u2019t tell but I look back at when my weight was low and I look like I\u2019m dying.  At age 25 I actually fully developed.",
