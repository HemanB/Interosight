  "selftext": "I have been in recovery and I have gained a lot of weight as a result. I have previously had anorexia which then turned into binging. Since January I haven\u2019t binged as much but I hit my lowest point in life as I lost all control of food and body. My weight is now higher than before my ED and I cannot emotionally cope with it. I\u2019m going crazy because I feel like I can\u2019t  enjoy myself or have any treats or holidays or meals out or nights out because I cannot afford to put on weight more. I have no safety net. What do I do? I cannot accept it as I\u2019ll end up putting more. I\u2019m so scared and worst of all I feel so helpless. What do I do?",

I got to the point of wanting to loose weight because of what I did to myself but I\u2019m scared that by restricting I\u2019ll start binging again. I just feel lost and helpless. I want to hide from everyone. My old clothes also don\u2019t fit and I thought of throwing them away but I just felt embarrassed as it reminded me of the weight gain and I felt ashamed. \nThank you for your help, it\u2019s good to know I\u2019m not alone.",

One year I lived in a town where it was really hard to even find a dietician, and I ended up getting one I had appointments with over FaceTime. It wasn\u2019t ideal but still definitely necessary. Is something like that an option for you?",
