I know people with eating disorders are competitive but does she really think I have one or is she just being jealous(English lesson: jealous means scared of people taking your place, not wanting something others want) about stuff? She is so controlling bc she thinks I have one please answer",

Cameron thinks that Jordan must have been throwing up as well.\n\nJordon leaves the bathroom Cameron realized how skinny Jordan is. Jordan is naturally like that but Cameron thinks Jordan has a disorder because of fairly normal things.

She does think you have one but it\u2019s not exactly her fault either and she may not even be jealous. It\u2019s just projection and hyper-observation of food. Everyone has eating habits that can be signs of a disorder if goes too far but with anorexics/bulimics/etc it can be hard to see where the line is. I would try to find out what you do that makes her think that, then move from there.",
