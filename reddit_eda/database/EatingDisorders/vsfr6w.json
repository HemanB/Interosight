  "selftext": "Hey All,\n\nI\u2019m looking for some help. I\u2019m having a spot of backsliding into disordered eating habits and feelings. I have been having a hard time seeing myself as attractive or worth being around because of my perceived fatness. I am dating someone who I\u2019ve spoken to a bit about my triggers, including skipping meals. \n\nRecently, we were out watching fireworks during dinner time. He had packed some snacks for us to share, but I had thought we would eat something more substantial later on.  When he didn\u2019t bring it up, I just went to bed when he did but I have been feeling sort of mentally tortured since then.  I don\u2019t want to put my disorder on him as his responsibility- I realize it is mine and I need to advocate for myself. I am just having a really hard time doing that right now bc I don\u2019t think I deserve to eat.  Any advice and support would be fantastic, don\u2019t brain is on a rollercoaster. I don\u2019t know how to get myself out of this cycle. \n\nBooks",

      "body": "I haven\u2019t got this figured out myself, but been thinking about it a lot after staying with my Mum for a few nights who is the same way (as lame as it makes me sound to compare my mum to your dating life lol). \n\nA few thoughts:\n\n1. Remember that, in the non-disordered world, there\u2019s a language to talking about food that just means different things in the ED world. For example, if someone with an ED, regardless of what type of ED, says something like \u2018I haven\u2019t eaten all day\u2019, they mean that in a literal sense. But for non-disordered people, a statement like that can mean anything from \u2018my breakfast was really rushed\u2019 to simply \u2018I\u2019m hungry\u2019. After lunch, I asked my mum what we were going to have for dinner, and she replied that she was probably done eating for the day, which felt majorly triggering. But later I saw her snacking a bunch, and remembered that something like that in the non-disordered world can just mean \u2018I\u2019m not gonna make a big thing out of dinner, just go with the flow\u2019.\n\n2. Take some time to yourself and make sure you and your appetite are sorted out first. Eating as a shared social experience is really important, and the last thing we want is to let our EDs push us away from the people we care about - but this stuff is important, and you can\u2019t risk your health out of politeness or keeping up appearances. Make sure you\u2019ve had what you need before a date so that you don\u2019t spend the whole date waiting to see what the food situation\u2019s gonna be like. Maybe have a meal or snack waiting at home for after the date that you KNOW you\u2019re going to eat, so there\u2019s less build-up of tension over where your next meal is coming from. \n\n3. Similarly, stand up for yourself & make sure you communicate properly about getting food. Don\u2019t be shy about asking what the food plan is before a date. Ignore any gendered pressures (I.e. stupid myths that men should be eating more than women), and if you\u2019re hungry, get yourself a snack. When we\u2019re hyper aware of food, it feels like everyone will be staring at us if we say \u2018hold on I\u2019m just gonna stop at this store and buy a snack real quick\u2019, but no one will actually care. It\u2019s actually the opposite of \u2018putting your disorder on him\u2019, because a non-disordered person wouldn\u2019t think twice about it. \n\n4. Just bear in mind different eating habits at all times. Because I\u2019ve obviously known my mum my whole life, I know that she\u2019s more of a snacking person, whereas I\u2019ve always been more of a meals > snacks person. So it can feel triggering at first to see her stop eating and put the leftovers away while I\u2019m polishing my plate off, but I just have to keep reminding myself that we\u2019re just different, and her habits aren\u2019t what I\u2019m \u2018supposed\u2019 to be imitating. \n\n5. Sometimes in social situations things get a bit muddled, and you can come away eating more than expected, e.g. you ate before the date, but then the other person wanted to eat on the date, so you did that, too. Just remember that this means nothing in the grand scheme of things. It can of course be triggering, but it\u2019s not going to have an impact on your health or your weight or your recovery. And trust me, it\u2019s MUCH better to have this outcome than the opposite (I.e. you didn\u2019t eat before the date because you thought you\u2019d be eating on the date, but end up eating nothing), because that can encourage binging once you get home, especially due to the build up of social tension & finally being alone. So, always err on the side of caution!",

      "body": "My boyfriend sounds a lot like the person you\u2019re dating. He doesn\u2019t eat until dinner most days, and then he\u2019ll have lots of snacks before going to bed. Last summer, when my ED was really bad, this triggered me to no end. \n\nThe other commenter hit on a lot of great points, so I\u2019ll try not to echo those too much. \n\nI\u2019m always mindful in reminding myself that his dietary needs are different than mine. Maybe he can make it through the day without food, but I can\u2019t. I require 3 meals a day plus a few snacks to make it through. And there is *nothing wrong with that.*\n\nDefinitely don\u2019t feel bad asking questions about plans for meals, like the other commenter said. If you\u2019re hanging out all day, you deserve to know when you\u2019ll be eating. And if your partner isn\u2019t wanting to sit down for a meal, you could always pack a meal or snacks for yourself. \n\nAlso, more generally, I\u2019ve had to let go of paying attention what the people around me eat. If I\u2019m out to dinner with friends or family, I don\u2019t pay attention to their plates or even what they order. I focus on myself and what I\u2019m going to eat. \n\nSometimes having this mindset is really helpful in drowning out the eating behaviors of others.",

      "body": "Honestly, it took a lot of therapy to get me to that point. \n\nBasically, I practiced letting my \u201ceating disorder voice\u201d go in one ear and out the other and not giving it more than a second or two of thought. \n\nSo if I was out to eat with a friend, and they ordered a salad while I ordered a burger, the inner monologue would look something like this:\n\nED: Your friend is getting a salad. You should get one too and maybe you\u2019ll be as skinny as her. \n\nMe: Nope. Not paying attention to her meal. Plus, I\u2019m craving a burger right now. Ordering a salad would *not* be honoring what my body needs right now. \n\nIt\u2019s much easier said than done, and it definitely didn\u2019t happen overnight. It\u2019s something I had to practice a LOT.",

          "body": "My boyfriend sounds a lot like the person you\u2019re dating. He doesn\u2019t eat until dinner most days, and then he\u2019ll have lots of snacks before going to bed. Last summer, when my ED was really bad, this triggered me to no end. \n\nThe other commenter hit on a lot of great points, so I\u2019ll try not to echo those too much. \n\nI\u2019m always mindful in reminding myself that his dietary needs are different than mine. Maybe he can make it through the day without food, but I can\u2019t. I require 3 meals a day plus a few snacks to make it through. And there is *nothing wrong with that.*\n\nDefinitely don\u2019t feel bad asking questions about plans for meals, like the other commenter said. If you\u2019re hanging out all day, you deserve to know when you\u2019ll be eating. And if your partner isn\u2019t wanting to sit down for a meal, you could always pack a meal or snacks for yourself. \n\nAlso, more generally, I\u2019ve had to let go of paying attention what the people around me eat. If I\u2019m out to dinner with friends or family, I don\u2019t pay attention to their plates or even what they order. I focus on myself and what I\u2019m going to eat. \n\nSometimes having this mindset is really helpful in drowning out the eating behaviors of others.",
