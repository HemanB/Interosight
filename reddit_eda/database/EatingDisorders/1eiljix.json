Bulimia was taking a savagely detrimental toll on my physical health, I was genuinely afraid I would die in my sleep, it took all of my physical strength from the dehydration and chronic electrolyte depletion. The non-ED goals I wanted to accomplish became more important and I began to shift. What saved me the most was investing in my teeth and getting veneers, I made an inner vow to myself that if I am putting that much money into my teeth, I\u2019m not going to fuck them up again. The veneers gave me a lot of confidence & made me feel like I had a second chance to treat my body better. I haven\u2019t purged since January but am still restricting",
