  "selftext": "so my last binge/purge was december 31st. as cliche as it sounds, i made it a new year\u2019s resolution to stop. and i have. while it may not be full fledged recovery (intuitive eating and all that jazz, i still eat pretty safe foods) im proud.\ntoday was my first time going out to eat w my family. and while i may have modified from what i usually get in efforts to feel more safe, i stopped when i was full and didn\u2019t really have the urge to purge afterwards. i feel like this is a really big win and i just wanted to share with someone. thanks for reading this far :)",
