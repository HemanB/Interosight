  "selftext": "Hi! So I\u2019m about to schedule a couple long-overdue doctor\u2019s appointments as I\u2019ve only been to the GP once since Covid. I accidentally saw my weight and freaked. Weighing is a big trigger for me. \n\nSince then, I\u2019ve had others tell me I can have them not tell me the weight or even flat out refuse. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d refuse them, but I\u2019d kindly ask them not to show or tell me. I know I\u2019m at the heaviest weight I\u2019ve been in a long time and don\u2019t need the reminder. I know that I\u2019ll restrict and over-exercise and be miserable for weeks if I see that number. \n\nWhat have been your experiences when you\u2019ve told them not to show you or refused weigh in?",

To us it's not even worth the fight, and it's really not a big deal to like 95% of us if you decline or ask to not know. I would imagine if your weight has to do a lot with your plan of care the most pushback you'd generally get would be someone asking you if you could step on the scale without looking at the number anyway. You do have rights though, don't forget that!",

Hell.. 10% or so of the nurses I know have active ED's and would punch you in the face if you suggested it to them. Just repeat \"No, thanks\" and don't step on the scale.
