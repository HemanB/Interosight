  "selftext": "Been to numerous doctors, all well aware of my intentional weight loss and \u201chabits\u201d per say. Not under weight (so close yet so far away) I\u2019ve asked for help and the most I get is \u201chave you eaten in the last couple of days?\u201d Answer is always a yes and it\u2019s left at that. \n\nWth do you need to do to get some actual help before it\u2019s too late? Literally underweight and almost dead?\n\nI feel like this is my own way of suicide without actually doing anything but there\u2019s nothing I can to do stop it and no one will help. \n\nFamily and friends just say \u201ceat more\u201d always easier said than done. And then that brings back to the lying about eating when you don't have to.",

      "body": "I specifically did a search for my area and eating disorders. I found a clinic that treats them, but as others mentioned, there are also psychologists, counselors etc that specialize. Regular PCPs only receive a little training in nutrition and the extent of many of their eating disorder knowledge amounts to that they should give you a referral and how to interact with you about your weight and eating habits (and let's face it some are not even good at that).  Find someone in your area who specializes and go to them. Ask your PCP for a referral if you need one (If you have an HMO you likely need one). I am sure they would gladly refer you. Hugest hugs and I am proud of you!",
