  "title": "What to do if my anorexic girlfriend found out her weight?",
  "selftext": "My girlfriend has anorexia and was hospitalized. she has been out of the hospital for over two years but did not finish recovery and is still struggling with severe ED brain and is underweight. she hasn\u2019t known her weight in over a year and a half. \n\ntonight we went to the ER for an unrelated reason, and they weighed her. I made sure that she didn\u2019t see it but she said it was ok if i looked. I did look but i told her i did not want to be asked about it and would not answer any questions. she thought it would be ok but her mind kept wondering and she grilled me with roundabout questions until she could tell by my face that she\u2019d guessed it. \n\nIt was slightly higher than either of us had expected. but she still looks very skinny and she\u2019s having symptoms of being under weight. and her weight is still categorized as under weight but i can tell that she\u2019s very anxious now and wants to restrict even harder. \n\ni completely regret looking and wish i wouldn\u2019t have. or that i would\u2019ve been more insistent about not telling her. but the damage is done. what do i do? how do i help her and make sure she still eats so her symptoms and fatigue don\u2019t get worse? what do i tell her to help?",
