  "selftext": "I\u2019m at a really low point with anorexia, and I feel like nothing is real anymore. A week and a bit ago, my psychiatrist told me that if I continued on, he\u2019d have to section me. I see him again yesterday, and he tells me that he predicts I\u2019ll be dead by next year if I carry on. He discovered an arrhythmia - and mentioned to me that my kidneys, bone marrow and heart are all showing signs of damage. My DEXA scan (from months ago), revealed that I have the bones of someone who is 50 years older than me and I am finding it harder and harder to sense when I am hypoglycaemic. The people around me are scared for me but honestly, I couldn\u2019t care less. I work full time within the NHS (ironically, in a psychiatric hospital), and I can\u2019t see myself changing. I mean that wholeheartedly. I\u2019m exhausted, though. I feel like this is going to kill me and I\u2019m kind of okay with it. I never, ever thought I\u2019d be in a position like this, where I have damaged and neglected myself so much - and where I am too scared to do the right thing. I barely have the energy to walk sometimes, and yet, I refuse to change. What do I do? I can\u2019t do this anymore. ",
