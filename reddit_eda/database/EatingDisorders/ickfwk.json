  "title": "Request: motivation to eat throughout the day when I'm alone is near non existent",
  "selftext": " \n\nI've been struggling with a small list of physical issues which are making it very hard to gain weight on top of a long recovery from anorexia. My boyfriend and I both recently went back to work so our schedules have been rather offset and something has been creeping to my attention. The motivation or even memory to eat throughout the day when I'm alone is near non existent.\n\nI guess I'm wondering if anyone else well into recovery has noticed this too. It doesn't always seem like a conscious decision to not eat, but it's almost as if I can't bring myself to want to eat (even if I'm hungry) until there's somebody else eating as well.\n\nAlone out here or nah? Starting to feel like I'm not making any progress...",
