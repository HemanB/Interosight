  "selftext": "Twice! For the first time in nearly a year, I ate twice in one day! My health isn't really improving and I'm still a stick, but I was able to eat two different meals today, both of them including meat! I'm autistic so it's hard for me to eat certain meats because of mouth feel and sensory issues, but I ate turkey sausage and egg sammich and dinner in the same day! I know it's not much, but it's better than nothing and I'd say I'm proud of myself :)",
