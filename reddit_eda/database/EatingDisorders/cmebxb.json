  "selftext": "While running today (one of my terribly forced habits) I thought about the fact that I feel awful and I am clearly not eating enough. I know I have a problem. I finally decided I had to do something. I called my mother, and absolutely balled my eyes out while trying to explain that I need help. She was reluctant to believe me at first but in the end decided to arrange a doctors appointment. \n\nI regret it so much. I feel worse and can\u2019t stop crying. I feel like I\u2019ve ruined everything I\u2019ve done for so long. I\u2019m just going to get fat again. I\u2019m going to hate myself. I already do.\n\nIs it entirely normal to regret telling and regret trying to recover? I really wish I hadn\u2019t said anything and my head keeps telling me I\u2019m fine. I don\u2019t know what to do now",

Now I feel like every time I mention anything food-related or exercise-related, they're judging me, but I know they're just worried about me. Admitting you have a problem is a huge first step that takes courage, especially when admitting it to someone else, and I'm proud of you!! Like another poster said though, tried to find someone who specializes in eating disorders. My husband is a general medicine doctor and he barely knows anything about eating disorders.

It\u2019s a fight, and it\u2019s hard when you first step out to take control over the thing that\u2019s been controlling you. I know- I had an ED for 6 years.. I went to a programme that helped me understand the roots of my behaviours, my thoughts and feelings.  But what helped the most was learning that there are people out there who do understand and I didn\u2019t have be alone. The same is for you too. You don\u2019t have to be alone. And you can and you will beat this! I\u2019m 2 years recovered now- you will get there! Find good counsel and get people behind you that believe in you! Also, you are stronger than you think!!",

I recently been relapsing and it\u2019s been very hard deciding if I am going to continue down this rabbit hole or if I will slap my ED in the face. It\u2019s been telling me how prettier and happier and better my life was when I was skinny but i know it\u2019s lying. My life had no purpose other than being thin and controlling food. Easier said than done of course as I can easily ignore my rational brain but I\u2019m trying my best.",
