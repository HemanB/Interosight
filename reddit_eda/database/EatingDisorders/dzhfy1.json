  "selftext": "My BF is really underweight, he doesn\u2019t choose to be he just forgets to eat all the time and really wants to gain weight. I\u2019m \u201ctrying\u201d to recover atm and it\u2019s really hard because he barely eats and when he eats it\u2019s always unhealthy (soup, grilled cheese, fastfood). Just seeing him barely eating makes me wonder if I really need food and makes me jealous of how easy it is for him. I don\u2019t want to upset him but I don\u2019t know what to do.",

      "body": "I know this is not the point of your post, but I think one thing you need to break yourself of is classifying some foods as \u201cgood\u201d and some foods as \u201cbad.\u201d Everything we eat provides the body with nourishment, and honestly when you get down to it breaks down into the same chemical compounds. Food should be neutral as long as you\u2019re eating a mindful amount of it. If you classify foods as \u201cbad\u201d or \u201cjunk\u201d you end up restricting them, which makes them forbidden fruit, which makes you crave them so much more than if you just gave yourself permission to eat it mindfully every so often.",
