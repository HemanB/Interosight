  "selftext": "Man, I've been baking and cooking sooooo much now and not eating any of it. It feels so good but also very sad. I don't know when's the next time I'm going to just lose control but I'm feeling so powerful and in control these days but I cannot stop thinking about food, it is on my mind all day every day. I look up recipe videos all the time on youtube and I used to watch soooooo many mukbang videos in the past but now I try to stay away from those as I feel it makes my cravings even more intense. It's so weird because those videos used to actually help me but now it's the total opposite for some reason. Baking & cooking now helps me in a way, I just love seeing the food and feeling it and smelling it. I just love being with it even if I'm not eating it. I'm just scared of losing control again. I'm so tired of this, honestly, I don't know how much more of this shit I can take. I'm going crazy most of the time but right now I'm in control but I know it won't last.",

Furring my ed and especially in recovery i have been so obsessed with making food, even if it wasn\u2019t for me. I also loved going to the supermarkets and looking at all those products or buying them and never eating them or only eating them rarely.",
