I never take my mask off at school and I haven\u2019t been able to enjoy desserts in so long. But last week I ate dessert twice, I ate snacks that I used to restrict, and today I ate a dessert that I didn\u2019t make!!",

Sometimes on good days, i read a bad day to try again. It's hard, and your effort is going to pay off. It's so worth it. You in the future is going to be so grateful & even more proud",
