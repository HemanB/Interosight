  "selftext": " How does everyone not feel guilty after eating?? Like I will see my friends eat and they won't even stop and think about they just eat like it's nothing but when it's me I stare at my food for awhile, before someone looks at me I start eating a little but my mind keeps on saying \"you getting fatter stop eating\" Then I just drink water after and go weigh myself every day.\n\n  Like today my dad called me down for dinner, we had cheeseburgers and I only had half of one meanwhile everyone was just eating I was staring at my food awhile my mind said \"Don't eat it ur going to get fatter,don't do it\" but i eventually eat a little bit then I throw it away feeling scared that I gained more weight. How do you guys not feel guilty???",

      "body": "Are you in therapy? What\u2019s helped me in general is ACT (acceptance commitment therapy) which in very short, you\u2019re not changing you\u2019re thoughts but accepting them and kinda going from there and learning to manage through them if that makes sense. So for example, in those moments accept that you\u2019re having those thoughts then think to yourself what is it that you truly value? What really matters to you? Do you value living a healthy life? If so, by allowing those fears of gaining weight to stop you from eating would be pulling you away from that value. When those thoughts or fears occur and you allow them to dictate your actions such as I just mentioned, how much control are you truly in? None right? So think about what matters to you and try to make value-based decisions and you\u2019ll start to feel more in control and less stress. Also keep in mind, when you\u2019re not in control, you increase your stress, when you increase your stress, more issues arise from that (in this context, health issues..etc). \n\nThis isn\u2019t the easiest to do, it\u2019s taken me a couple years for it to be consistent but now I feel so much freer and more control in my life (less stress).",
