  "selftext": "Hi! I\u2019m very new to this sort of thing. I have a girlfriend for almost 6 months, we r juniors in hs. We r super close and she is the love of my life. A few days ago she told me she has an eating disorder and that she has been going to treatment and that she is doing better. It\u2019s very hard to talk about and it is crushing me inside. Everytime I think about it I get so sad. Does anyone have advice for how to help, what to not do, ways to be strong for her?",

      "body": "Just being there for her really helps. I had an ex when I was really really bad and when he would witness my super messed up patterns he would say \u201cI don\u2019t condone what you\u2019re doing but you will not go through it alone\u201d and that would surprisingly help. It was a way to call me out on my bad behaviors but in a really supportive way. \nSometimes when I was deep in the ED I didn\u2019t even realize some of my actions were weird. But if I was lectured to about it I just would have shut down. He didn\u2019t try to change me, but calling me out while supporting me did wonders for my road to recovery.\n\nAnd if she ever wants to talk, listen. Tell her shes beautiful whenever you think it but also know eating disorders go so much deeper than looks. \n\nVery sweet of you to come on here asking for advice. If you need any more on the topic let me know! And at the end of the day know that a good support system helps a lot but not totally. If she slips again please do not take it personally. It is not because of you she developed this. All you can do now is support her the best you can.",

      "body": "I\u2019ll second what everyone else is saying- you even thinking to reach out to others and try to be helpful however you can is a wonderful thing & a great place to start. I\u2019ve had different EDs off and on for 7 years, so I\u2019ll try and cover what would & would not have helped me in her position. I can\u2019t speak for her & what her motivations are of course, but I\u2019ll do what I can. \n\nIn no order:\n\n1. Obviously, do not critique her body in any way, but *understand* that when you give positive encouragement such as calling her beautiful, it may not resonate with her. For me, the disorder convinced me the only way I would be pretty is if I did XY&Z. Don\u2019t stop saying these encouragements, but try not to be angered if she disagrees. \n\n2.  Be mindful when eating out or in front of others with her. At my worst, I ate barely 100 calories a day, meaning essentially no meal out or get together involved any eating for me. This caused huge arguments with my family when I refused to go out to eat or to gatherings where I\u2019d be expected to eat. Try to understand if she doesn\u2019t want to go somewhere for this reason, & what\u2019s more, if it does come up, defend her if someone brings it up. \u201cHey (gfs name) why aren\u2019t you eating the chicken? It\u2019s great!\u201d Rather than put her in this position, perhaps step in before she responds & cover about her having eaten earlier or having an upset stomach or something. I know I would have appreciated the cover. \n\n3. Understand that when it comes down to it, change for the better regarding her disorder will ultimately only come from her and her own decisions. Obviously your support will also do wonders, but (for me anyway) I had to make a very hard & very conscious decision to choose to get better, & to want to get better. It sounds as though she may have done this if she\u2019s getting treatment, but recognize it is a constant personal internal battle. \n\nOn that note, \n\n4. Recognize that it will not ever fully go away. From my experience, EDs are a forever thing. That is, the thinking associated with them & the obsessive thoughts never *fully* go away. Yes, they can get worlds upon worlds better, but relapses are common and the internal battle is nearly daily. It can be draining. Some days are better than others. In my case, I had anorexia first, then ended up with binge eating disorder, then back again. It can take a lot out of am SO to go through all of this, should it occur, so be prepared for the mental strain on yourself as well. For the record, I\u2019m not trying to sound depressing, I just want you to be aware that no matter what you do or how hard you try, you can\u2019t take out the part of her brain causing all of this. \n\n5. Use tact when addressing disordered behaviors. This can go a few different ways depending on the person. For me, my parents tended to call out any disordered behaviors I had, and it got old. They were only trying to help, but being yelled at every time we went out for barely eating really hurt. I know you wouldn\u2019t yell at her, that\u2019s just an example. Point being, be very careful about any addressing you do of her disordered behaviors. If possible, let HER do the bringing up of the discussion. She\u2019ll talk when she\u2019s ready. Most likely, part of her knows her behaviors are disordered, and most likely, the disorder prevents her from changing them. \n\nThat\u2019s all I can think of for now, if I think of more I\u2019ll edit them in. Feel free to message me with specific questions or just reply to this. Best of luck to you & her.\n\nSide note- depending on how clearly she has the disorder, school/social activities may be hard for her. At your age, kids can be really cruel. As her bf, do what you can to watch for any bullying she may go through, but don\u2019t cause too much of a public scene when calling anyone out. The last thing I would want is an entire classroom hearing my bf yelling about my ED.",

The most important thing is to just be there. Be present. Be patient. Try not to put too much pressure on yourself to say or do \u201cthe right thing\u201d in the moment or offer solutions. She may not always want to talk about what is on her mind, but when she does, make sure to open your heart and ears to listen. Know that she\u2019s there for you too. The NEDA website has great info on how to support loved ones dealing with ED. You don\u2019t have to implement all of these things, just try to take in the gist of it. It sounds like you really do love her, and while I\u2019m so happy for both of you, I\u2019m sorry that you both have to carry this on your shoulders. It\u2019s a lot but you\u2019re doing great and you have a wonderful attitude about it. All the best to both of you \ud83d\udc97",

If I am not feeling up to it, he doesn\u2019t press the subject. He also is very good at talking with me about my feelings. \n\nWhen we first started dating (8yrs ago), he wanted to fix the problem for me. This caused a great deal of frustration for both of us. He realized that he was unable to solve the issue, leaving him to feel defeated. When he realized he needed to hold my hand as we walked through it together, so much changed for us!\n\nI can imagine that it is challenging to love/support someone with an eating disorder and (often times) other mental health diagnoses. Great job coming here and asking for advice!

Now that I\u2019m recovered, I can finally see the hell I put my friends and family through. \n\nI will still lose weight if I\u2019m stressed. Not because of ED stuff but because when I\u2019m super busy I will forget to eat. When my friends and family used to question my weight loss, it was this sick mixed feeling of anger and it\u2019s none of their business mixed with being sort of happy they noticed. I used to get really defensive. \n\nNow when I get stressed and lose weight and they say something, I totally get it. I just think about the hell I put them through and how im lucky they care. But when you\u2019re talking to someone deep in the ED, it\u2019s a hard topic to navigate. \n\nIt\u2019s interesting because my boyfriend now (who is also the love of my life and the \u201cone\u201d) used to suffer from alcoholism and has been sober for almost 10 years. It\u2019s really interesting how the thinking pattern of a drug or alcohol addict and someone with an eating disorder are really similar in my experience.\n\nSorry just kind of went on a rant there lol.",

I had an ex when I was really really bad and when he would witness my super messed up patterns he would say \u201cI don\u2019t condone what you\u2019re doing but you will not go through it alone\u201d and that would surprisingly help. It was a way to call me out on my bad behaviors but in a really supportive way. \nSometimes when I was deep in the ED I didn\u2019t even realize some of my actions were weird. But if I was lectured to about it I just would have shut down. He didn\u2019t try to change me, but calling me out while supporting me did wonders for my road to recovery.\n\nAnd if she ever wants to talk, listen. Tell her shes beautiful whenever you think it but also know eating disorders go so much deeper than looks. \n\nVery sweet of you to come on here asking for advice. If you need any more on the topic let me know! And at the end of the day know that a good support system helps a lot but not totally. If she slips again please do not take it personally. It is not because of you she developed this. All you can do now is support her the best you can.",

It is a silent nudge, if you will. When he is not around, I tend to just listen to my own body, which has been unreliable! \n\nHe also will gently encourage me, by asking \u201cwhat\u2019s for breakfast/lunch/dinner\u201d which reminds me it is time to eat. If I am not feeling up to it, he doesn\u2019t press the subject. He also is very good at talking with me about my feelings. \n\nWhen we first started dating (8yrs ago), he wanted to fix the problem for me. This caused a great deal of frustration for both of us. He realized that he was unable to solve the issue, leaving him to feel defeated. When he realized he needed to hold my hand as we walked through it together, so much changed for us!\n\nI can imagine that it is challenging to love/support someone with an eating disorder and (often times) other mental health diagnoses. Great job coming here and asking for advice! That shows your compassion and speaks volumes to who you are! \n\nI know, from my boyfriend\u2019s perspective, doing research about eating disorders was also very helpful. Good luck, OP, and feel free to come back and ask for support anytime!",

Kati Morton is an incredible youtuber with many educational videos on eating disorders i encourage you to watch. some( not conclusive list!!) signs and symptoms/ eating disorder behaviors include:\nnot eating/eating very little\nskipping meals\npicking at food\ncutting food into small pieces\nspitting food into napkin\nchewing and spitting\ngoing to the bathroom/taking showers directly after eating\nrussell\u2019s sign (callous on knuckles caused by inducing vomiting)\nlaxative abuse\nexcessive exercise \nexercise at odd times of the day (common one is doing sit ups in the middle of the night, or walking laps during lunch\nhiding  food\nlarge amounts of food going missing\nbody checking (looking at body in the mirror/ feeling parts of your body(such as putting fingers around wrist, feeling collarbones))\nfatigue \nREMEMBER: WEIGHT IS NOT AN INDICATION OF THE SEVERITY OF AN EATING DISORDER\n\nit seems like you are both still young as juniors in high school (please be careful abt putting your age online!!\ud83d\udc99) if you think it is necessary PLEASE tell a TRUSTED adult about the situation. because she is in treatment, it sounds to me like her family is aware so if you notice eating disorder behaviors increasing, telling her parents could really help her out, but please be careful with this and make sure the family is involved in her treatment, if they are abusive it can make situations worse.\n\nmost importantly, be present. listen. as i said you aren\u2019t her therapist but be her friend. let her know she has a support system that loves and cares about her. you are doing an incredible job by taking these steps and asking questions. praying for your girlfriend and for your relationship. i hope for the best for both of you.",
