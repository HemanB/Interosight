You are a whole human being who happens to have a medical issue, and that is not a reason for anyone to not be with you, nor is it a reason for you to leave someone because you worry he can't deal.",

However, I feel my discomfort is an insignificant price for the love that I can give to her. I would do almost anything to see her become a little bit better and I do not expect anything in return. I think such is also how your SO thinks. If you would break up because of your ED, you are giving a victory to that terrible illness. Savor and enjoy every positive feelings you have from your relationship, because that will make both of you happy.",

He has been with me for close to ten years of this (and at varying degrees of severity) and I feel bad literally every time I have a meltdown but at the end of the day, I have to recognize he loves me for me, and I love him for who he is when he has meltdowns. It\u2019s not always easy or fun, but we hold each other up and that\u2019s what makes our friendship beautiful. When I do meltdown and then inevitably apologize for it, he reminds me he\u2019s loved me for a long time and when I do freak out on him, he knows he is trusted and loved back. This is all a really long way of saying that no, don\u2019t break up with him. Understand that yes, relapses will be hard on both of you, but eventually there will be fewer and it will make your relationship stronger. Trial by fire.",
