  "title": "Request: How to deal with peoples positive comments about my unhealthy weight loss ?",
  "selftext": " \n\nRecently had a relapse in  my eating disorder. Very heavily restricting has led to a significant  weight loss. I wasn\u2019t overweight but higher end of a healthy weight to  start and I am rather muscular, so I guess now outwardly I appear \u201cfit.\u201d  I want to recover and I am actively trying to but I do not know how to  respond when people make comments like \u201comg what did you do to lose  weight\u201d \u201cyou look so good what are your tricks\u201d or ask for my  diet/routines. I have struggled with this off and on for years but never  received so many comments on my body, and I really just need a good way  to respond to these comments of praise for destroying my body. I am  tired of society glorifying thinness and associating skinny with healthy  . I am very sick and want to get better. Any good responses to these  type of comments?",

Some might pry and try and ask what is wrong or want to offer suggestions and depending on your relationship with them you can say you would rather not talk about it, it is private, or you can get more specific. People don\u2019t need to know what is happening in your life if you don\u2019t want them to but I think this is the easiest way to communicate that they need to shut up about it. \n\nOf course there is also the chance they will make some stupid remark like \u201cI wish I had that\u201d at which point feel free to just disagree or make a snarky comment about how great all the other side effects of this disease are. Most people aren\u2019t stupid enough to wish an illness on themselves though unless they already have a pretty messed up relationship with weight loss. \n\nIf you aren\u2019t comfortable sharing any info you could just allude to the fact that \u201csome people\u201d wouldn\u2019t want to hear that because they are dying of cancer or suffering a severe mental issue and you can\u2019t usually tell who. You could make it a more general discussion about society and whatnot depending on how open minded the commenter is. They might think you are just trying to make them feel bad though, but most people would would realize this probably applies to you or someone you care about and back off. People can be really dumb though so brace yourself for whatever kind of screwed up response they might have to your totally reasonable request to not discuss it.",

Like not eating all day and drinking one single beer for dinner babe! It's the latest fitness trend! I'm really sorry you're experiencing that. I even had a close friend who is generally pretty conscious about that stuff say I was \\*\\*the fittest she'd ever seen me\\*\\* But I know I was exhausted and strung out. I had one client tell me I looked ten years younger...I was 27 hahaha. And was not overweight either before restricting again, but like you at the top of healthy. But i'm 5'2 so alas, there's also that.\n\nThe best advice I can give you is to have a really clear relationship with yourself and about what you are experiencing internally. It sounds like you do and you know this isn't how you want to feel. I wish I had better answers on how exactly to respond, but maybe try simply saying \"I've actually been sick and it isn't healthy for me! I'm working on getting healthier.\" That way they have to reckon on their OWN with the fact that they are conflating skinniness with health and you dont have to share anything further.",

I was at a healthy weight when I started losing and now my BMI teeters around 19 to 18.5. I have fallen below 18.5 which is where the underweight mark is. It's hard to hear encouragement when you know what you're doing is not good for you. Maybe just respond with saying your weight loss wasnt wholly intentional and that you are actually trying hard to not lose anymore. You dont have to go into detail if they ask, just say its personal. Good luck. Once your weight stabilizes the comments will stop, so keep fighting the good fight!",
