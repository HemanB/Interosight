  "title": "Request: How much can Body Dysmorphia actually affect you?",
  "selftext": "I'm sure a lot of people here can relate to \"just not seeing\" what other people are talking about with regards to their weight/body. But I REALLY can't. \n\nI'm 23, and I've been bulimic since I was 16, but have slowly curbed it in favour of more restrictive eating when my dentist noticed my teeth enamel was damaged. I used to restrict, binge and purge, but now I don't binge or purge regularly anymore. I've been at home for the past two months, and during that time have been restricting my intake.\n\nMy mom has mentioned my weight a few times, whether she's hugging me and commenting on my bones, or saying that she just thinks I look gaunt in the face. I'm not with my boyfriend, but he's expressed similar concerns over photos and videos I've sent him.\n\nBut I just do NOT see it, and I don't understand how any amount of body dysmorphia could be deluding me this much? I know the concept, but is it possible to physically be unable to see your body for what it is? I just feel like a fraud. My mom or BF will say something to me about my weight loss, but I just feel annoyed and dismissive, and keep looking at photos of other women/celebrities who are obviously thinner than me. I don't think I look remotely like someone who is \"too skinny\", so I feel the need to restrict even harder to live up to their concerns. \n\nWhat is the psychology behind BD? How much can it truly affect you?",

      "body": "I remember using the bathroom in my new dentists' office for the first time and being so genuinely shocked- they had a mirror that showed my reflection in an unusual angle, and I couldn't believe it was me. This was after six months of progressive weight loss, and everyone around me would say how small I was, while I was convinced I was just as big/no different than before. After struggling with an ED/BD for years, it was the first time I could actually *see* what people were talking about. \n\nBD is one of the factors that can drive eating disorders, though they're usually a lot more complicated than just wanting to lose weight. Comparing yourself to other people will always, always be unhelpful- ESPECIALLY celebrities/influencers, who have the benefits of personal trainers/Photoshop/dietitians, etc. \n\nAs far as not feeling like you're skinny enough to merit concern, it's important to realize that every body is different, and that a person's healthy weight can't always be measured by how you look. You don't need to have every bone visible before someone decides that you're at the point where you need help or actually have a problem. it's something that is affecting your life now, in a very real way, and you deserve all the support and care available.",

      "body": "I lost A LOT of weight when my ED was at its worst. Everyone commented on it and I didn\u2019t understand what they were talking about, I couldn\u2019t see any difference. Yes, the scale told me I had lost a significant amount of weight but when I looked in the mirror I saw no changes at all. Now that I\u2019ve gained the weight back, and then some, I can see the difference clear as day when I look back at pictures. How thin my upper arms and thighs were, the shallowness in my face, hip and collarbones protruding. But truly, when I looked like that I didn\u2019t see it AT ALL, not even when I tried and thought \u2018see through the ED and see how you actually look\u2019. But I just effin couldn\u2019t.\n\nI think perhaps it\u2019s something our dysmorphic minds do. The ED wants you to keep on loosing weight so it won\u2019t ever say \u2018yes, you are now thin and we can stop this thing we\u2019re doing\u2019. But when, like me, you gain the weight back and look at a picture of how you used to look the ED is like \u2018loooook at how thin we are!! We need to look like that again\u2019. It does whatever it can to convince you to be unhealthy. And that\u2019s why it is never our friend.",

      "body": "I don't know what the psychology behind it is. Maybe it has something to do with a fixed mental image that we have of ourselves that doesn't change or catch up to what our actual physical appearance is, at least that is what it has felt like to me while in the throes of an ED.\n\nHowever, this is one sort of ammunition I have in my arsenal when I feel horrible about the weight I've gained in recovery: I remind myself that in the past, no matter how much weight I lost, I always felt just as bad if not worse about my body. Losing weight is not the answer to \"fix\" dysmorphic thoughts. It has never gotten me anywhere.\n\nAnother thing I've noticed is that I am kind of afraid to accept my body. I think I may have developed an even more negative way of thinking about my body as a defense. I feared that through accepting my body, I would allow myself to slip - become lazy and gain a lot of weight. However, none of this really explains why my body image was so bad in the first place, or what causes the dysmorphia initially. When I think about the time when m ED was developing, I was very deeply unhappy with my life, and it could be that my body became a convenient scapegoat. \n\nI imagine the psychology behind body dysmorphia (or, more broadly, negative body image) would be different for everyone, based on your experiences, culture, maybe even genetic predisposition. Also important to note that Body Dysmorphic Disorder is its own disorder, not everyone with AN, BN, or other EDs automatically has BDD, but they likely experience dysmorphia.",

I look in the mirror this afternoon and I look completely different than I did in the morning. When I see pictures of myself, I don\u2019t recognize myself. It\u2019s scary! It freaks me out that people can see me completely differently than I see myself. Sometimes it freaks me out so bad that I don\u2019t leave my house (not that I leave my house these days anyway haha)\n\nAll this to say, you are not a fraud!!! Body dysmorphic disorder is a real thing.\n\nEdit: I also want to add that suffering from an ED doesn\u2019t mean you have to have BDD, and vice versa",

Those days are rough. I imagine that therapy would help and my old nutritionist has recommended a few specialists in my area, I will likely look them up once my work starts back up and I have benefits again.\n\nI remember that when I was fully engrossed in the restriction I had my arm perched on the window ledge of a car on a sunny day and I could see my reflection in the mirror, the slight indentation of the softness of the bottom of my arm against the ledge looked like droopy bingo wings that day and I obsessed about it.",

I'm just trying to not mind the BD and focus on exercise and building lean muscle than losing weight and losing fat. I've been gradually getting leaner for the past six months (after some exercise and diet that turned into a r/b/p cycle that lasted for two years) but in my mind when I look in the mirror I see the same body I had three years ago.
