  "selftext": "I think the guy I'm dating has an eating disorder - looking for advice\n\nI've been dating this guy and started noticing concerning patterns around food:\n\n- He has never once suggested going out for dinner or coffee dates\n- We only meet for walks in parks or at his place\n- When we rarely eat out, he has very small portions\n- I noticed him checking calories on ice cream\n- He always says he's \"already eaten\"\n- Interestingly, he cooks a lot for others\n- He said his parents are really fat different times \n- He doesn\u2019t drink alcohol, eat anything sweet or coffee / he consider himself really healthy \n\nWhat makes this complicated:\n- We never had a typical dating/honeymoon phase because there were no normal food-related dating experiences\n- He's very sexually dominant and watches himself in mirrors during sex\n- He asks lots of questions about me but shares very little about himself\n- The relationship feels like it's stuck in this weird limbo\n\nI'm not sure what to do. I feel like I see this pattern clearly now and it's affecting how I feel about the relationship. Should I bring it up? Has anyone dealt with a similar situation? Any advice appreciated",

      "body": "As someone who has struggled with an eating disorder in the past, this description really hits home for me. You can definitely ask him about it, but when you\u2019re deep in it, you can become really defensive or the disorder can start to internalize voiced concerns as compliments in a weird way. Sometimes, an eating disorder convinces you that your behaviors are fine, or even what you truly want. I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this. I would suggest starting with small steps to bring it up to him gently, as it can be a sensitive topic.",

The sexual dominance and watching himself in the mirror is also a bit of a red flag. Be careful and listen to your gut. He may not say much now because he's hiding a potential dark side, not just an eating disorder.",
