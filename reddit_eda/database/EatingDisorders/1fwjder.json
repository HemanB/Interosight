So hard but have to tell yourself that the voice telling you that you\u2019re somehow wrong for eating is NOT REAL!  \n\nBut it IS hard.  It sounds real asf.  But other ppl who recovered on here say after a while it gets quieter over time (just like it got louder over time).",

I honestly don't have any great advice, but I try to say to myself that it is perfectly okay to eat. It is perfectly okay to have cravings.\n\nSo don't worry, because we can work towards feeling better together.  Stay strong!! :)",

I try to get over the guilt by thinking i\u2019m nourishing a home (my body) that will someday house my child (when i\u2019m pregnant). i can\u2019t bring a child into a home that is malnourished and in constant stress. Food is what my body needs to function and provide stability and a safe place someday .. i hope that helps somehow if maybe you\u2019re considering this :)",
