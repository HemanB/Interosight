  "title": "Request: How to draw the line between low self esteem and an ED?",
  "selftext": "TW: mentions of self harm\n\nI feel like I should preface all of this by saying that I\u2019ve never seemed professional help, for anything. Ironically (?), I\u2019m too anxious to go to a doctor or therapist. I also have a hard time talking to people I\u2019m close with.\n\nBasically my issue is that I\u2019m not sure if I just have really low self esteem and use food as a way to cope sometimes, or if I\u2019m actually developing/already have an ED. \n\nI really hate my body the majority of the time. I suck in, I pull on my fat, etc. I\u2019ve stopped going clothes shopping in stores because ever since puberty its been a miserable and genuinely triggering experience. I would stand in the fitting room and punch myself in the stomach until I had to sit down or pass out. \n\nI eat large amounts of food in private, when bored or need to be distracted, and am ashamed of what I do eat. I never purge or starve myself, but I feel guilty sometimes. I\u2019m vegan (for ethical reasons, not dieting), and really only exercise when I\u2019m feeling optimistic, but that quickly goes again as soon as I feel low.\n\nUp until recently (last 6months?) I really didn\u2019t think I had any sort of ED or was even at risk but now I\u2019m not sure. I took the NEDA screening test and it said I was potentially at risk, but I\u2019m still hoping for a more personal insight.\n\nI don\u2019t want to take advantage of this sub, so please don\u2019t give this time of day if it\u2019s not relevant. Ofc, not everything\u2019s here, but these are the main issues.",

      "body": "Eating disorders can be challenging to diagnose. Obviously there's the major ones that most everyone know by name, but then there's OSFED and ARFID and all sorts of subtypes beneath that. \n\nThe main question becomes, do thoughts about body, shape, weight, size, food, eating, calories, excercise, etc. interupt any major area of your life such as relationships, work, ability to sufficiently care for yourself, and so on. Have you ever skipped on an event (you would've liked to go to) because of your relationshop with your body or food? Has it ever impacted work or school? What about your relationships or desire for romance? Again, just questions to ponder. \n\nTo me, you seem to have some disordered eating and poor relationship with self at the absolute minimum. Obligitory, you should talk to a doctor, psychologist, therapist, or something similar if you can. You deserve care, empathy, and understanding.",

      "body": "I can relate to the feelings and behaviours you described, during my teenage years. I\u2019m in my mid-late 20s now and have been in treatment for a couple years (sort of..it\u2019s been quite the push and pull with recovery, addiction and my mental health in general), but although I feel I\u2019m in an entirely different reality to when I was in my teens, I get fleeting yet regular moments of being the self-hating, low self-esteemed teenage girl who was not coping with her changing body and life in general.\n\nNow I have adult experiences and perceptions and history/advice from mental health experts, so NOW I have things I love about myself and things I hate. When the hatred silences any positive views of myself, that\u2019s when my ed behaviours and thoughts start to really take a turn for the worse and I relapse. And that says so much about why I developed this issue in the first place - I was feeling negative about myself more than I could ever feel anything positive. My ed is most definitely a coping mechanism for my depression, which encompasses my low self-esteem, bad body image, trauma, and just overall negative perceptions about life. When I\u2019m feeling good and doing more, I don\u2019t have as much brain space for those ed thoughts telling me what I can and can\u2019t do.\n\nThe trick is to work on yourself and your life that in no way relates to your body, then you start feeling more confident in yourself in other, less vain ways (for lack of a better term). Food as a coping mechanism begins to not work as well as it once did, and it starts being a little easier to land upon better coping mechanisms instead.\n\nGetting shit done (whether it\u2019s just getting through a shift at my shitty job or writing a journal entry or practicing a hobby during the day, getting coffee with one person, watching a movie with a person I like), while eating a reasonable amount at a scheduled eating time or when I notice I\u2019m feeling or thinking about food (easier said than done, but it\u2019s possible as I\u2019ve done it before and it gives me hope! Structure is the key), also socialising when you can and really trying to enjoy those moments of mutual interactions as an achievement and/or distraction from being too internally isolated with yourself and those mean thoughts (even if you think it\u2019s not what you feel like doing, it can feel so rewarding afterwards! I have to remind myself all the time)....basically, when I\u2019m doing things in my day or working towards a non-body related goal (like applying to get a new and better job, becoming better at drawing, practicing something you may not have tried like meditating for 10-20mins every morning) then I feel internally better about myself. Not always amazing but definitely better - and so using food to cope doesn\u2019t feel as appealing as moving towards something that also makes me feel good but has a healthy and long term benefit as well. This has helped me stop mid-binge because I realised it was doing absolutely nothing for my mind or mood, which I never thought I\u2019d be able to do in the past.\n\nUltimately, I think your disordered eating is a combination of not feeling okay within yourself (which I\u2019m sure you know). And I\u2019m so so sorry you\u2019re struggling. It\u2019s such a silent struggle to others but so deafening and lonely for us. But the low-self esteem IS a symptom of the ed and the ed IS a symptom of your low-self esteem. From my experience, I am only able to break the cycle of those two debilitating issues by finding rewards, satisfaction, friends, distraction, interest and so much more from other endeavours that help me feel more whole, confident and content long term and way less shattered and desperate inside.\n\nApologies for the wall of rant! I just really felt a connection to your words and I feel I\u2019ve learnt so much since feeling the way you have described, even if I still struggle some days (haaa like today!)\n\nAll the best and please reach out to me if you need it <3 :)",

      "body": "Like others have said, Ed's are extremely difficult to pin point, and a lot of that surrounds the gatekeeping of diagnoses, especially on social media platforms that make us question if what we experience is \"real\" or if we are just over reacting  \n\nBecause of that, I am now of the school of thought that ANYONE experiencing any type of disordered habits needs to to talk to someone ASAP. You may have an ED, or you may have something else that is manifesting itself through disordered eating habits. \n\nRegardless, If you have the slightest suspicion that something isnt right...go talk to someone immediately.",
