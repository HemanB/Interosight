  "title": "Request: I ruined my relationship with food and I regret it",
  "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nFor context, it all started just before quarantine. I (F16) started restricting what I eat and I learned about calorie counting. Stupid me started eating very low calorie, even though it's not as low as some people go. I was extremely obsessed with food. When I went to sleep I thought about what I would eat in the morning, I would even try to count the calories for the next day in my head. In school I was always tired, hungry and cold and I couldn't stop thinking about food. I would spend way too much time at the grocery store comparing labels to get the most low calorie option. I would weight every gram of food I ate. And of course during the quarantine I had alot of free time and I would exercise for 2h per day, sometimes even more. All that went on for about 3 months, I lost some weight and ended up losing my period. I started binging uncontrollably and got my period back. I would find myself in the kitchen, binging on sweets. I started buying large amounts of sweets, for example a bag of cookies, a chocolate bar and a bag of candy and I would eat all of it at once. I would always think to myself \"this is my last binge, I'm getting back on track tomorrow\". But every day I would just wake up and have an extreme need to binge. I binged every day, stopped working out and gained more weight than I had lost. During summer I kind of got back on track, started working out again and tried to eat healthier .\n\nBut now I just don't know what to do. It feels like I can't just eat normally. I don't restrict and I don't binge as much as I did before, but it happens sometimes. I overeat almost every day and even the smallest restriction triggers me. I'm addicted to sweets and I need to have some everyday. I am of course worried for my looks because like any teenager I am abit insecure with my body but I am even more worried about my health. I can't imagine all the damage I did to my health with the restrict/binge cycle and with the large amount of sweets I eat every day. I wish I could go back in time and stop myself from restricting what I eat. I wish I could eat like normal people do, in normal portions.\n\nI've only talked about this with one friend but not in too much detail. I don't know if I had or have an eating disorder because sometimes it seems like it wasn't serious enough to be considered as one. Please help me if you know how to rebuild my relationship with food and stop always overeating. Does anyone relate to this situation?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:  Please notify [u/picklednood1e](https://www.reddit.com/u/picklednood1e) when you respond, so they can see the replies ",

      "body": "What I will say could possibly be reassuring? The same thing happened to me. I was extremely restrictive, I gained some weight and started doing better, and then I relapsed into restricting. After that relapse, I got extreme hunger for the first time, and I could not tolerate an ounce of restriction. I couldn't even handle waiting an extra minute for a meal. I over ate almost every day and some days, I ate basically non stop. Obviously, I gained some weight. \n\nFortunately, I stopped weighing myself, and because I was so hungry, I couldn't consider doing something about the weight gain because it would be impossible with the insanely strong impulse I had to eat and inability to not eat. I was generally unhappy with my body at that time, though, and I was unhappy that I couldn't seem to control myself. I thought I was a mess.\n\nThe good news is, that didn't last forever. Little by little, I noticed myself becoming more and more \"normal\" around food. Every once in a while, I would notice that I did something that I never used to be able to do, and it was suddenly possible (like forgetting about food, waiting for a meal, not working out, eating out with no anxiety... Stuff like that) . That came about because I kept eating every day (I felt like I had no choice on that haha) and I started challenging my fears about eating certain foods and doing a certain amount of exercise. \n\nIt seems like, for lots of people, this phase lasts several months. For me, it lasted years, but I believe that that was because for the first few years, I continued to exercise a lot and restrict certain foods and try to limit my intake too much (even though I would never succeed at this because my extreme hunger was so powerful). \n\nNow, I feel really normal around food. It is such a small part of my day now, and it used to be the #1 thing that I would think about. I lost the extra weight I had gained without trying.\n\nThis year has been so awful. I'm sorry that it affected you in this way. Compulsive restriction is often triggered by a life event (for me, it started when I changed schools). I wish the best for you <3\n\nTLDR; Being well-fed for a long time and finally letting go of food fears and restrictions and compulsive exercise got me to be a much more normal eater and caused me to lose weight I had gained during a period of extreme hunger.",

      "body": "I completely relate and have found that scheduled meals really help. At first I wasn\u2019t hungry for breakfast ever because I would binge so hard the day before usually late in the day. But I would eat a \u201cnormal\u201d sized breakfast around 8-9am, have lunch at 12-1 and a dinner between 5-6pm. Over a week of doing this helped restore my hunger cues but did not curb my craving for food. I think because I had restricted for so long, my body entered starvation mode so was food-seeking constantly. To help with this, I would either allow myself a snack, go for a walk, chew some gum, drink a delicious tea or hot chocolate, but overall try to move on until the next meal. Not every day is perfect. I still have days that I crave a binge but I do it must less frequently now. I use the app \u201cDays Since\u201d and it motivates me to see how many days it has been since my last big binge. It\u2019s been weeks and I am much happier. Also remember that there are multiple forms of \u201cpurging\u201d. I don\u2019t make myself sick because I can\u2019t stand the feeling of it and physically I don\u2019t think I\u2019m able to but over exercising is another form of purging. Make sure you are drinking plenty of water and sleeping at least 8 hours. Make sure you are managing stress. Those things alone will help a good amount. If you haven\u2019t tried therapy maybe consider that. It\u2019s not for everyone. So far I\u2019ve found journaling for me helps more than therapy but everyone is different. \n\nSome resources you can look into are the free eating disorder [guides and info](https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/Resources/Looking-After-Yourself/Disordered-Eating) here. Carolyn Costin\u2019s 8 keys recovery workbook helped me gain more insight into why I eat the way I do. My piece of advice to you is this: do NOT start following diets. This is not the time to go keto or try intermittent fasting or go vegan. Just stick with what you were eating and how you were eating before you first noticed these behaviours. Do NOT engage in dangerous activities. Smoking or over consumption of energy drinks to curb your appetite literally kills you in the long run. It is not a badge of honour to abuse your body. You are more than your ED. You are a person, whole and worthy of love. It is ok to fail but you can always try again. Take care of yourself \ud83d\udc95",

Maybe try to make up a meal plan for eating 100-200kcal above your BMR, something like oats, oatmeal and other high fibre food? Should keep you full. To distract yourself from binging, go for a walk or watch a movie, don't buy big portions of sweets (it's hard I know, been there many times.. ) , instead buy a small twinx chocolate bar or something alternative?",

      "body": "This is kind of similar to my current situation.\nI started losing weight in January by fasting. I stopped when quarantine started. Those 3ish months where great and I did not have an eating disorder. I didn't count calories but ate very little (unknowingly) because I would fast 23 hours a day. Still I felt great, I had lost around 6kg. From March to August I had gained 8kg (which is more than I initially lost). I was at my heaviest and had developed a very bad relationship with food. I ate way too much and still didn't think there was any problem. I thought I would lose the weight once I started school again, boy was I wrong. I might have even gained a little. My country is now in quarantine for the second time. It all started November 7th. I told myself I was fat and had to lose the weight asap. What really motivated me was the fact that I had gained so much in the previous quarantine so if I kept going I would gain even more. So I started calorie counting. I'm not comfortable with sharing how many calories I consume daily but basically I feel tired and my heart beats very fast. I don't think I have a fully developed eating disorder so I came to this sub to prevent that, I think it's too late. I can't imagine myself going back to eating normally. I really hope I can get out of this as soon as possible, before it's too late. Good luck to all of you \u2661",

At first I wasn\u2019t hungry for breakfast ever because I would binge so hard the day before usually late in the day.

Over a week of doing this helped restore my hunger cues but did not curb my craving for food. I think because I had restricted for so long, my body entered starvation mode so was food-seeking constantly. To help with this, I would either allow myself a snack, go for a walk, chew some gum, drink a delicious tea or hot chocolate, but overall try to move on until the next meal. Not every day is perfect. I still have days that I crave a binge but I do it must less frequently now. I use the app \u201cDays Since\u201d and it motivates me to see how many days it has been since my last big binge. It\u2019s been weeks and I am much happier. Also remember that there are multiple forms of \u201cpurging\u201d. I don\u2019t make myself sick because I can\u2019t stand the feeling of it and physically I don\u2019t think I\u2019m able to but over exercising is another form of purging. Make sure you are drinking plenty of water and sleeping at least 8 hours. Make sure you are managing stress. Those things alone will help a good amount.

This is not the time to go keto or try intermittent fasting or go vegan. Just stick with what you were eating and how you were eating before you first noticed these behaviours. Do NOT engage in dangerous activities. Smoking or over consumption of energy drinks to curb your appetite literally kills you in the long run. It is not a badge of honour to abuse your body. You are more than your ED. You are a person, whole and worthy of love. It is ok to fail but you can always try again. Take care of yourself \ud83d\udc95",

It is such a small part of my day now, and it used to be the #1 thing that I would think about. I lost the extra weight I had gained without trying.\n\nThis year has been so awful. I'm sorry that it affected you in this way. Compulsive restriction is often triggered by a life event (for me, it started when I changed schools). I wish the best for you <3\n\nTLDR; Being well-fed for a long time and finally letting go of food fears and restrictions and compulsive exercise got me to be a much more normal eater and caused me to lose weight I had gained during a period of extreme hunger.",

What I understood from your experience is that I should be patient because technically this is recovery and well it takes some time. I'm gonna try to not weight myself even though it is abit hard to resist the temptation.

Like I said, I over eat every day and yeah it's technically not always a binge but I'm definitely in a big calorie surplus and I am not skinny so this is not a surplus that I need to be healthy. I think I need to do something to recognize my hunger cues and stop eating when I'm full.",

          "body": "What I will say could possibly be reassuring? The same thing happened to me. I was extremely restrictive, I gained some weight and started doing better, and then I relapsed into restricting. After that relapse, I got extreme hunger for the first time, and I could not tolerate an ounce of restriction. I couldn't even handle waiting an extra minute for a meal. I over ate almost every day and some days, I ate basically non stop. Obviously, I gained some weight. \n\nFortunately, I stopped weighing myself, and because I was so hungry, I couldn't consider doing something about the weight gain because it would be impossible with the insanely strong impulse I had to eat and inability to not eat. I was generally unhappy with my body at that time, though, and I was unhappy that I couldn't seem to control myself. I thought I was a mess.\n\nThe good news is, that didn't last forever. Little by little, I noticed myself becoming more and more \"normal\" around food. Every once in a while, I would notice that I did something that I never used to be able to do, and it was suddenly possible (like forgetting about food, waiting for a meal, not working out, eating out with no anxiety... Stuff like that) .
