  "selftext": "So this is something I'm planning on bringing up in therapy during my next session but that isn't for a while so I was hoping that someone here could give me advice in the meanwhile. \n\nMoving back home with my parents and younger sister during lockdown has in some ways been really helpful - university (which I've now graduated from) was definitely the driver of a lot of my neuroses and mental illnesses. I'm slowly getter better and having a better relationship with food and exercise. \n\nHowever, my parents are quite severely overweight and have really bad eating habits. While this hasn't really been an issue during lockdown, my thinking has been 'once lockdown's over and I can move out, I will have complete control over what food is around me'. However, my parents are really strongly against me moving out especially because I have a job lined up (which I don't want to take) which is super close to our house. In the current climate, I don't know if I'll be able to find another job further away or be able to tell them the true reason why I want to leave the house so much, as I understand it's super insulting. \n\nNow I'm faced with the possibility of living with my parents for the next two years and I hate to admit it but it's getting me really worried. It's both the fact that I don't want to become an overeater like them and end up gaining loads of weight again (chubby kid). But there's only so much control I can have with myself around foods that they stock. I don't want to have to place rules and restrictions around the types of food I can eat in the house as I know that will lead me down a very slippery slope. \n\nI have tried to make the house eat a little healthier but their eating habits and wilful ignorance around nutrition and exercise makes me so bummed out and worried I will end up gaining loads of weight or super restricting myself. \n\nMore of a rant than I expected, but any advice greatly appreciated! xx",

My family loooooves snacks and it\u2019s really hard not to grab for the nutty bars when thats what pantry is full of. The fact that you\u2019re aware of your patterns will probably help you keep them in control. Doing some of your own grocery shopping might help and maybe you can find some healthier alternatives to the foods you gravitate towards the most. Best of luck!",
