  "title": "Request: Not hungry enough ti eat after cooking",
  "selftext": "Does anyone else have this problem where you start cooking with an empty stomach, really excited for the meal, and when it is finally done, you are suddenly so tired and not hungry anymore?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst time here...(lil extra weight thanks to home office. I am happy that i get to try out more cooking/baking, but i am also a bit stressed about how it affects my eating habits) I enjoy cooking, moreso when i get to cook for more than just myself. I like trying out new things, i like cutting all the veggies, marinade the meat/fish if i have some, season while everything is boiling etc...... But when i finally stand in front of the finished meal on my plate, i am suddenly not hungry anymore? I am just suddenly soo tired, and i dont know why. It smells delicious, and i know it will taste good, but i am just not up to eating anymore. \n\nIs there a trick/should i force myself to eat?",

      "body": "This happens to everyone, ED or not. You smell the food intensely as you cook, and you kind of get sick of it when it is time to eat. (There are articles online about it.) My suggestion would be to take breaks away for just a few short moments when cooking to clear the senses with different air. Also put something on the plate that you didn\u2019t cook that time and maybe you\u2019ll eat it since it smells differently.",

      "body": "Never usually reply.\nI've been in recovery for around 5/6 months now.\nAt first, couldn't eat more than 2 to 3 bites - and that too with the will to recover. I wanted to live my life.\nJust slowly, eat a small thing extra at each meal time and snack time. Add something small. Keep adding till it becomes better, and you start feeling hungry around the same time everyday.\nSlowly, but surely you will realise that you want to eat, and that's about when I hit extreme hunger.\nI still eat a lot, and remember to eat in regular intervals (something that helped me was to make it a rule to eat atleast every 2-2.5hrs). This will regulate your hunger signals mentally, and help digestion physically. Recovery is a mixed process, trust yourself and choose to live your life.\nAll the best!",
