  "selftext": "Hey reddit, first post!\n\nI\u2019ve been bulimic since I was 15. I\u2019m now 22 and have just gone 10 weeks without throwing up. I am not feeling the urge to binge or purge anymore and I\u2019m so proud of myself! I know recovery isn\u2019t always linear but I\u2019m feeling really good about this. \n\nNo one in my life knows about my bulimia so it\u2019s hard not being held accountable but also not being able to have anyone be proud of me, but I\u2019m so proud of myself. I\u2019ve eaten all my trigger foods and been out to restaurants and not felt the urge! \n\nI hope I can support anyone here to do the same.",

I have been hardcore bulimic for 3 years now (3+ b/p per day) and have recently made the decision to try and stop. \n\nI have started structured eating (3 meals 3 snacks) and am eating 2000+ calories but i am SO HUNGRY. I manage to put up with it most of the day but i cave in the evenings and so far havent had a b/p free day :( \n\nIm worried ive stretched out my stomach so even a decent amount of food doesnt touch the sides. Im not underweight either so i dont think its 'extreme hunger' like in anorexia recovery. I dont know what to do im losing my mind with this constant hollow feeling.\n\nAny advice?",
