  "selftext": "I\u2019m currently in recovery, and although it\u2019s much better than when I was at my most restrictive, my mind is always focused on food. It\u2019s at the forefront of my mind all day every day, and I\u2019m so tired of waking up thinking about food and going to bed with the same thoughts and stresses on my mind. How long did it take you to recover from these obsessive compulsory thoughts? \nI\u2019ve been in recovery for around four months at this point, and although I\u2019m still not weight restored, I would\u2019ve expected this to have lessened. It consumes my mind most of the day... :(",

I still have thoughts once in a while but my brain has learned to redirect them right away so they are no longer troublesome. It\u2019s a long haul game but it\u2019s worth it.",

Also just thinking about things I\u2019ve always wanted to try doing and giving them a go. I started surfing over the last year and challenging myself with a different activity has really helped the ED voice calm down. My dietician doesn\u2019t love all the physical activity but it\u2019s so important to me because I find the whole experience therapeutic. Plus seeing myself progress in something other than restricting intake and weight loss makes me motivated to keep listening  to my body & eating enough to help fuel time in the water. Think about activities you\u2019ve always wanted to do or things you used to love! Really try to do them. I know with the pandemic some things aren\u2019t possible right now but find something that is & do it regularly. It takes time to find something that you love that\u2019s more important than ED but it\u2019s so worth it.",

What causes are near to your heart (activism) ? Dig deep ... How do you want to impact this world. What are the talents that you can offer the world. \n\nFood wise it's hard to tell because we've been conditioned since we were born by diet culture directly and indirectly. One fun mindset is rebellion. Rebellion against a billion dollar industry that profits of our insecurities. Who are they to tell us portion sizes ? How to eat and how much ? We are ALL so different and our bodies are miracle machines that cannot be reproduced. It is so wonderful that it keeps us alive every second of everyday sending us signals and symptoms to indicate it's state.\n\nShow grace and mercy to your body. Your body is your home. \ud83d\udc97",

The thoughts have definitely decreased since I was at my lowest mentally (4/5 months ago). But when I think about it in comparison with people who don\u2019t have an ED it\u2019s pretty demoralising. What I find helps me is perspective. I compare where I am now from where I was. I am so much better to then. Each day I will incrementally get better and by the end of this year it will be even more noticeable and continue in the years to come if I remain in full active recovery. If I slip and go for \u2018one last time\u2019 it will make it harder and longer to get to where I want to be. As \u2018normal\u2019 as possible and symptom free from my ED. \n\nIt does get better but it takes patience and continued commitment. Don\u2019t give up. You\u2019ll get there.",

I\u2019ve gained weight, but gradually my obsession over food went away once I was a few months in maintaining my restored weight. Not only that, but I don\u2019t receive that many cravings anymore either. I heard that we end up obsessing over food in periods of starvation because the body lowers metabolism and plays with our hormones to put us back in homeostasis (or set point weight in this case). The body is smart and funny like that...\n\nI\u2019d say it\u2019s probably the idea of allowing yourself to eat whatever you want, whenever you want. When I allowed myself to eat cookies, for example, I definitely feasted on them at first. As time went on, I was able to eat just 1 or 2 cookies (3 at most if I\u2019m feeling like a real cookie) and feel satisfied.",
