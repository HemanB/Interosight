  "title": "Request: advice on helping a friend avoid refeeding syndorme?",
  "selftext": "So my friend has an ed, they have been eating and sleeping very poorly recently, to the extent where they had a seizure recently at work, which they say their seizures tend to act up when they dont do those things.\n\n its a combo of an ed and also not having any money. anyway i just found out they havent eaten in some days (after a period of very poor/inconsistent eating). i convinced them to get something and they are going to eat now, but i am worried about things like refeeding syndrome which i have heard about. ive been trying to look it up but idk what is the best resource. i think maybe they should be being monitored, esp cause they live alone, like in a hospital or sth but they live in america and i dont think thats going to happen, they are already broke.\n\nim gonna try encourage them to eat but idk what the warning signs of refeeding are. also they mentioned in the past how they had these bad eating habits where they would basically fast for a few days but eat on the next day but they had more weight on them then, and just idk what to do. they have been losing weight rapidly and have lost a lot of weight over recent months. they are now at around at a low body weight and i think 168cm?\n\n anyway if u have any tips/resources on what to avoid, what to watch out for, so i can educate myself and them that would be really helpful, thank you!!",

There are options available for people with no income, and sometimes the hospital will even agree to write part of it off. One of my friends was panicking about his $17k surgery for a ruptured appendix (no insurance), so I suggested he reach out to the SW department. When it was all said and done, he was only responsible for $4k which is still a lot but it's way more manageable than $17k.",
