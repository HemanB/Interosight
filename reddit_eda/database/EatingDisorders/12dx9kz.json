  "selftext": "So I went to my new therapist today and she asked me if I struggled with an earring disorder. I don\u2019t really like to say i have an eating disorder (yes I know it\u2019s part of denial, I don\u2019t care.) so I just said it was disordered eating. She asked me to elaborate so I told her about my obsessive calorie counting and constant binge starve cycle. And she was like \u201cim not a fan of calorie counting\u201d so I was trying to tell her that it helps me control my binges. I admitted that sometimes it is bad, but it keeps me accountable and helps me prevent binges when I\u2019m not over restricting. But the thing is after I told her about it she said \u201cy\u2019know it\u2019s a very small percentage of people who have a successful eating disorder. Success being survival.\u201d LIKE GIRL. People act like people with eds haven\u2019t heard, seen, or even EXPERIENCED all the fucked up stories. I wouldn\u2019t be this way if I really had the ability to make that choice. I can\u2019t stand people who try to scare us out of having our eds.",

The one thing that she said to me that was truly eye-opening was this:\n\n\"In the x number of years I've been seeing clients with eating disorders, of any and all kinds, no one ages out of an eating disorder. No one wakes up one day and it's just \\*gone\\* because they got too old for it.\"\n\nThis shook me more than anything I've heard from any treatment provider, be it my GP, the various medical specialists I've seen for complications of my ED, my out-patient program, or any of my previous counsellors. She wasn't telling me I'm going to die, rather that I wasn't going to \"live\" unless I make the changes. No one can do recovery for me except me.",

Do you want them to talk about potential coping strategies (may come off as unwanted/unasked for advice, from someone who may or may not have been through this themselves, unless you express that\u2019s what you want). I think if you can express what you want in terms of what you WANT to hear vs what you do NOT want to hear, it might help you have better agency and control of your own recovery.",
