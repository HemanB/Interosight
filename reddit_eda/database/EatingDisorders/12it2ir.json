  "selftext": "Hi everyone. \n\nI\u2019m in my first half of college and recovered/in recovery from my eating disorder struggles for all of high school and part of middle school. \n\nWhen i was deep in my anorexia and bulimia, I didn\u2019t care what I did to my body, because I didn\u2019t believe i would live long enough to ever see the consequences. Now that I\u2019m in my 20\u2019s, I feel much different about that sentiment, and am left with reminders of what I went through. \n\nNobody ever warned me about the stretch marks I would get when I returned to a healthy weight. Maybe it\u2019s better they didn\u2019t, but it feels like a constant reminder of how I\u2019ve harmed my body whenever I see them in the mirror. On top of this, I have painful dental problems as a result of my bulimia and have nearly lost multiple teeth. My eating disorder was never worth my health or losing my teeth. \n\nIt feels like my body is trying to remind me what could happen if I relapse. Although i try not to think of it as a punishment. \n\nIf you are struggling with your recovery, I want you to know it is worth it. My only regret is not getting help sooner. Please take care of yourselves, if you believe now you may not live to see the consequences, you could be wrong just like me. You are worth your recovery, friends.",
