I\u2019ve got back into a cycle of tracking my calories which is equally helpful and destructive for me and when I hit a certain number today I burst into tears and felt awful. Is anyone else like this and how did you over come it?",

For instance if I haven\u2019t had enough protein I\u2019ll have a scoop of powder powder and if that\u2019s not enough add something light like popcorn especially late at night. But I also struggle with an eating disorder if I\u2019m short 100 calories, it\u2019s really easy to consume with just a scoop of peanut butter but I still have that fear because of the fat content.

If it worked like that, it'd be THE go to fix for an eating disorder.\n\nThis is the same train of thought as:\n\"Just don't be depressed. If you're depressed just do things that make you happy\".\n\nCounting calories is never a good idea. It's not helpful for an ED. If anything, it does the opposite.\n\nI've seen your promote your articles to some people. That's fine but check in first as it's a rule regardless of whether it's posted in a comment or a request.\n\n> We will not post links to personal blogs, product/service advertisements, and most non-academic projects.
