  "title": "\"Popular Girls\" that have disordered eating in movies",
  "selftext": "I find it odd when movies, usually with teen characters, have \"stereotypical popular girl\" characters that have disordered eating. It's especially weird to me when they portray it in a humerous way, or the realities of ed's aren't shown, just the \"im super skinny because i eat almost nothing\" part, not the side effects and internal struggles of ed's. I think it can also be harmful to some of the viewers, especially younger girls (but obviously not limited to just young girls). I think the fact that ed's are portrayed this way in some movies just goes to show how misunderstood ed's still are.",

A show i love but is def becoming dated within our new found PC culture. But theres this episode where kramer says hes dating a hefty girl, and the running joke is shes always hungry and hes struggling to feed her enough food. They finally show her on the screen and I was FLOORED at the woman they chose to play the \"hefty\" one. She was a size 6-8. She was skinny! She wasnt a rail like the rest of the girlfriends on the show but she was not fat, not curvey, no where near hefty. Quite an average body that i would never comment too skinny, too fat, shes just average.\n\nMy point is...these were the messages we were being fed all the time! I go back and watch old stuff and ive seen it a few times where they cast a size 6 and call them fat. Its absurd.",
