  "title": "Request: My daughter won\u2019t cut out her triggers. How can I encourage her to do so?",
  "selftext": "My (legal adult) daughter was diagnosed with anorexia four years ago. The severity of the illness and her weight have varied over the years, but it got especially problematic after the pandemic hit. She\u2019s back in recovery, and actively weight-restoring, but it\u2019s a slow progress. It doesn\u2019t help that her room is filled with posters with model-thin women all over them. \n\nI really think her decor is hurting her self-esteem. Just last week, I went in her room and caught her eyeing a picture of her favourite singer, kneading her stomach. She seemed upset  that I caught her body checking, but then she just brushed it off as nothing with \u201cI just think the lead singer is pretty.\u201d I feel stuck because every time I\u2019ve suggested taking down some of the posters, I\u2019m met with intense opposition. She cries, she screams; it\u2019s almost like she becomes a toddler that I feel compelled to comfort. I don\u2019t want to hurt my daughter\u2019s feelings, but I also don\u2019t want her to hurt her own feelings by constantly looking at bodies she can never have. \n\nAm I overreacting? How should I proceed?",

You can\u2019t take anything down without her permission, it creates resentment and will probably amplify her stubbornness. The best thing you can do is talk to her about it calmly. If you feel like it makes her too emotional maybe you could type it out and send it to her. It\u2019s important to support her and make it clear it\u2019s coming from a place of love.

That still doesn\u2019t take away from the fact I still wish I looked like that, as I never did it to be pretty. I try to look at people I find pretty at healthy weights. \n\nI am not sure what you can do except for talk to her. I really want to emphasize again, don\u2019t do anything she didn\u2019t agree to.

Some of the comments are suggesting taking down the posters anyway-the intent is good, but I worry because the loss of autonomy often pushes people deeper into eating disorder tendencies as it is partially a way to gain perceived control over your life.\nI really only can think that therapy for her, but also therapy for both of you together might be good if you can afford it. The both of you together so you can be on a healthy page about how to best communicate. Does her recovery include either of those?",

Is she pursuing a career with some really awesome female role models (that isn't focused around body image but accomplishments). \n\nI would suggest sitting her down and talking to her nonconfrontationally but matter of factly. Tell her you love her and you only want to help her, and you notice that the posters she looks at regularly could be more harmful than helpful. Suggest other things she likes. I love traveling, my parents commissioned someone to get the world map painted on my bedroom wall and I got to fill it in. Where I'm living now, I have some personal artworks hung up (they're horrible and no one else will ever see them, but I like them and it's a fun creative outlet) and my partner has some posters signed by his favorite youtubers hung up. Theres also a couple Canvas pictures of family etc. Strung around. Tapestries are also fun you can find some really cool ones on Amazon. See if she's willing to redecorate her room to reflect her future goals/interests that don't involve body image.",

Like don't try to tell her why her thinking is wrong or why she is actually pretty. And follow the therapist's advice. I just think it's a strange tactic to freak out and change her life as more punishment instead of just asking why she feels the way she feels. And as someone who literally faints at the sight of her triggers I would be furious if one of my parents were  pushing me like this to remove them from my life. Skinny people don't disappear. Triggers don't disappear. So help her work through them instead of avoid them.\n\nEdit: missed the blaring *legal adult* part. What are you doing dude? She's an adult. You can't do anything about her space",
