I just can't eat much. It makes me so frustrated I want to cry sometimes. Its like I've lost my desire for food. Has this happened to anyone else? Is this my eating disorder or could this be my depression?",

I would guess it's that after giving your body a reason to not want to eat food, it's hard for our body to switch gears, even if our brain has.  You should look into drinking Ensure meal replacement drinks! It's helped me a lot",

      "body": "Hey, I feel you, I\u2019m in a similar boat. Part of the issue is probably your appetite shrinking and your body not being used to food. \nMaybe try to make scheduled times to eat meals, get into a routine so that you eventually start feeling hungry when those certain times roll around. \nI know it\u2019s hard to force yourself to eat, especially if you get nauseas or anything. But it\u2019s important to make sure you at least eat a little bit of something at your planned times so that you will eventually be able to eat more. Even if it\u2019s not much, anything helps. \nSomeone else suggested meal replacement smoothies, which is a good idea! Other foods like apple sauce are pretty light on the tummy. \nLastly, be gentle with yourself. You\u2019ve been through a lot and recovery is not easy. You deserve to be happy! \nGood luck, I believe in you!",

You're re-teaching your body and brain how to eat- that's a huge amount of learning to do! \n\nTry to eat something little every three hours or so, and try to not go longer than 5 hours without eating anything. Hunger can actually make nausea/eating worse/harder sometimes. \n\nEnsures are great if you are concerned about getting all your nutrients. You can blend them up with bananas or even ice cream to mix it up a bit!",

Even if it\u2019s high calorie wraps with some chicken and lettuce inside. Even animal crackers with apple sauce! I went through a phase where I ate that a lot. Carrots with ranch dip (so good omg!). \n\nThe less you feed your body the worse it gets. I think you have to train yourself to want to eat again after so many years of food being the enemy. \n\nIf you have a good support system bring them to the grocery store with you and get them to show you foods they like to eat. There is so many things I would avoid when I was restricting so it\u2019s like you don\u2019t even know what to eat anymore.\n\nAnd if you are comfortable with going out to eat get your support system to help you choose your food. It may sound dumb but going out to eat the first few times for me was seriously traumatic and so stressful. A few times I went to some nice restaurants and just got chicken nuggets \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I had a very toxic ex at the time and he would get so mad at me for not being able to decide what I wanted. Make sure you are surrounded by supportive people, it\u2019s huge for recovery. \n\nAlso go to a nice coffee place like Starbucks or Tim hortons (Canadian here). And get a super fun drink that you wouldn\u2019t usually get. Now that you have been able to let go of the obsession with the scale and have a healthier view of your body it\u2019s time to experiment!! Ask the barista to make you their favourite drink!! The first time I went to Starbucks in my recovery was such a milestone to me. It\u2019s truly the little things. \n\nIf you ever need to chat feel free to message me.
