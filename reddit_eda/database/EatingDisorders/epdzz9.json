  "selftext": "The past three weeks have been full of anxiety and my life being controlled by food and restriction. I\u2019m underweight for the first time since I had surgery when I was 18 almost two years ago, and I\u2019m happy and sad. \nBut today was my second follow up scan that gave me the good news that I am still cancer free for almost two years now. The cancer I had was rare in kids, but I was lucky I didn\u2019t need chemotherapy and only radiation treatment. So today I celebrated that in my life, and I had a frappuccino, cheeseburger, and piece of cheesecake because I saw it and said I wanted it. Weird combination and I feel like poop but I ate it all and I didn\u2019t care for one special day in my life and I feel good for right now at least. Today was an okay day.",
