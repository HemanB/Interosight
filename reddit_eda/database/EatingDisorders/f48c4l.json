  "selftext": "I\u2019ve being treated for anorexia since September and was making good progress for a while but snapped back into it over the last week and stopped eating entirely. My therapist found out that I\u2019ve only really consumed calories from the almond milk that goes in my coffee which isn\u2019t very much. She asked me to go to the emergency room or an urgent care and get an IV to refeed, which I didn\u2019t really know was a thing or what that really entails. She offered to call ahead of time and give direction so I didn\u2019t have to, but that almost sounds worse than just doing it myself. \n\nThat being said, I told her I would consider both options, but I have a couple of concerns.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m wasting the nurses and doctors time by going in for a problem that I\u2019m creating for myself and feel like I would be treated accordingly by the staff. \n\nI also don\u2019t know what this kind of process looks like if I do go through with it. \n\nHas anyone done this before and what were their experiences?",

The feeling that you have about it \u201cnot being that bad\u201d or that your \u201cwasting their time\u201d is also a common feeling that patients have.  That is your ED talking you out of getting help.  Have them call ahead because the docs will take it more seriously (they don\u2019t understand ED). Then put one foot in front of the other and do it.  Do it for you, your family and all the people who care about you. You are too important to let ED win.",

      "body": "Never been through it and I'm not a doctor but from the best of my understanding (which is admittedly limited) the IV refeed may be beneficial in preventing problems when reintroducing food. By malnourishing your body when not eating, you change the way your body handles food and nutrients. By starting with IV nutrients, then adding food back slowly, you slowly reintroduce your metabolism to processing food/nutrients. \nI am not positive but I think it can be life threatening to reintroduce food without IV refeeding. Nobody at the hospital will think less of you because you're seeking help in a safe, medically controlled environment.",

They lose weight because they are in starvation mode/caloric restriction. Also all healthy food contain carbs, they really have it backwards.\nWhen I tried it a while ago; I was constantly thirsty; peeing, extremely hot, bad breath and so on. Basically symptoms of ketoacidosis. I thought I was gonna die. I hadn't eaten glucose in days. Everything came back to normal when I ate starch, fruits and veggie.",
