      "body": "I think of it being akin to an addiction. Former Alcoholics who become sober are able to live incredibly happy and fulfilling lives, but either consistently or sporadically go to AA. They know it can be an issue, so they take the steps to ensure sobriety. There will be great days and bad days, but If you consistently put in the work the new habits and thoughts will take on, and life will be normal. It will get better with time. Soon you\u2019ll realize there\u2019s more time between slip ups, the thoughts when eating get less loud and less often. It doesn\u2019t mean the thoughts don\u2019t pop up every now and then, or there might be a slip up, but you\u2019re more equipped to deal with them to continue living a happy recovered life. \n\nI\u2019ve had an ED since I was 10, and went to inpatient treatment. I have had slip ups, and occasional thoughts, but considered myself recovered because I am leading a happy and healthy life. It\u2019s not a black and white thing, I have my moments but i implement the things that make me feel better and focus on how I\u2019m doing better and the desire to be better.",
