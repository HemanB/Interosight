  "selftext": "For the sake of my health my RD has suggested that I need to give up my vegan diet. I have ARFID and currently my main safe foods that I consume on an everyday basis is and only are white rice and pinto beans.\nI am lacking nutrients and refuse to take any type of pills/medication/oral supplement etc. due to my extreme fear of medication.\nI have discussed this with my RD before and she suggested that the first step in doing so is to try to consume dairy milk. I haven't had milk since I was a baby (literally) and I've gone by all these years avoiding it and any other types of beverages labeled as \"milk\".\nMy ARFID has turned me into a vegan and I see all animal products as dirty and unethical. The thought of consuming milk makes me uneasy because I am not a baby cow which is why I shouldn't drink cows milk. I also have this recurring thought and visual image about the fact that the milk is coming from cow udders and that makes me queasy. I can't see myself drinking anything other than water which is what I've been doing for the past five years.\nAny tips? Tricks? Advice?",

I have some friends who were vegan and have been forced to start consuming animal products again for health reasons and it\u2019s been really tough for them to do, I can only imagine ARFID and your fear of medications make it so much more complicated. I would say maybe talk it out with a therapist or someone who\u2019s an expert (but not another type of doctor cause they can sometimes be dismissive of mental health constraints in my experience). \n\nAs far as \u201ctricks\u201d go, I\u2019m thinking maybe try very small doses, or have someone making your meals for you (assuming that\u2019s a possibility) and including diary like cheese in them without you knowing? Like maybe they could do it at random times and at a certain time you realize your body got used to it and can try integrate them in your diet?\n\nOr maybe (if you can of course) try only purchasing ethically, like from farmers or local shops instead of supermarkets? It could maybe help knowing that at least the source is good and the animal exploitation is not there in the same way as it is with intensive farming!",

      "body": "Are you me? I did the exact same thing. I was a vegan for three years, and I got myself down to white rice, quick cooking oatmeal, pinto beans or chickpeas, and broccoli. Actually, I began avoiding chickpeas since they would upset my stomach too much.\n\nI have always had a fear of eating something that would not come back out. A lot of foods do this. Fruit, dairy, spicy foods, garlic, onions. Things that seem like they get inside you, and never leave, and make you feel miserable the entire time. Things that I would love to eat, but wouldn't dare because of the miserable consequences.\n\n\"I want that banana, but I can't because I will double in size afterwards.\"  \n\"I want that garlic, but I can't because I'll be bent over in pain afterwards.\"  \n\"I want that butternut squash, but I can't because I'll be able to feel it stuck inside me and it may never come out.\"\n\nThat's how I whittled my diet down to bland, miserable foods that I hated. *I did it in order to feel better, but I never did feel better.*\n\nVeganism appeals to both of us because it allowed an excuse for our restrictive food disorder. Most foods eaten at public gatherings or during social eating events have either meat or dairy, so it allowed us to politely decline with a legitimate reason that most people would accept or at least tolerate. We could avoid a charged subject (rich foods, overeating, stomach-upsetting/bloat foods, or social eating itself), without the guilt trips.\n\n\"Oh, no thank you. I'm actually a vegan,\" and the conversation would quickly end there.\n\nIt turns out that vegan Omega 3 is not absorbed by the body whatsoever. It takes years to become entirely depleted, but when you do there will be consequences. B12 may or may not absorb into your body, depending on your genetics and the source of the vitamin. You also don't receive any iron from your foods unless you combine them in a special way each time. Despite what Bernard, McDougall, YouTubers, Instagrammers, and others will lead you to believe, there are many vitamins and minerals that you simply cannot get on a vegan diet, and the vegan equivalents are inferior or are not reliably absorbed.\n\nDuring my second year as a vegan, I fainted at work. I was rushed to a hospital, where I was treated for malnourishment and dehydration. I refused to believe it could be because of my diet. It took another year before I left veganism for good. My hair was falling out, my nails were brittle, I had brain fog, I was constantly preoccupied with food, and I had pushed myself away from a lot of people that I loved in the process.\n\nVeganism itself is classified as an eating disorder, because of its restrictive nature. There are some people and organizations that may tell you otherwise, but statistically almost no one survives veganism after the fourth year. There's a reason for it.\n\nI wish you the best of health.",

I had to get to a place where I knew I was doing it for the right reasons (environmental and ethical reasons) rather than just because of my ED. I'm still not recovered completely and have a pretty rigid diet. However, I know it is possible to be healthy and vegan, as that is something I have been able to maintain in the past, albeit temporarily. You definitely don't need dairy milk to have a healthy diet, BUT (and this is a big one) if you are not taking supplements, you NEED to get B12 and iron from somewhere - and the only other place to get that reliably is from animal products. I think you are going to have to decide on a lesser of two evils - supplements or animal products. \n\nI'm not sure if this helps but there are forms of b12 that aren't medication-like, such as gummies and also liquid drops (so you can dissolve it in water).",

I also started making a list of all the safe foods I can handle including snacks. If pinto beans and rice are safe for you, you can ask why they're safe and then try to find other foods which make you feel safe for similar reasons. (For example, if it's texture, maybe oatmeal with vegan protein powder and blueberries)\n\n3. Listen to music or something while eating to help make it more enjoyable especially if not eating your #1 safe food. I reserve special podcast or music that I can only listen to while eating to help increase the likelihood of following through. You could maybe talk to a friend or support person.\n\n4. Pack lunches and have some sort of game plan for the week. If I want to be successful and eat foods which are healthful and working toward my recovery goals, I have to plan for it.\n\n5.

      "body": "For making GM plants, the DNA or gene of interest is taken from the plant that has the required gene and inserted into the genome of the plant we want the final product to be. The method of inserting those genes varies and in some cases MIGHT  include use of bacteria and virus but now we have lot of up coming technologies including CRISPR-Cas. Also, lot of gm crops can actually solve hunger issues and bad crop issues but unfortunately there is so much hatred and misinformation available everywhere plus many people try to exploit and it ends up giving the science bad name.  It is very difficult to take genes from another organism and just insert it or make new organisms . Plus there are very strict rules and licenses for production and even experimentation for GMO. Till they don\u2019t pass the evaluation that they are not allowed to be brought to the market and one can not just go ahead with any GMO making experiment there are lot of strict procedures, protocols and running around done plus if the facility where they are trying to do an experiment or go for productions doesn\u2019t meet even just one criteria it will be not allowed to be carried out. Yes we are still understanding certain things but that doesn\u2019t mean we aren\u2019t careful especially when most of the scientists are aware about zoonosis and that\u2019s the last thing anyone of us would want. Covid-19 , Ebola etc falls into the category of zoonosis. Ironically most of the zoonosis has happened due to how humans have come in contact with nature by themselves. That\u2019s why it irks me when people who are not specialists try to go deep in to unknown territories of forest without any guidance and disobey rules plus don\u2019t follow basic hygiene. It also annoys me when people out of curiosity go to the zones marked by government just for people belonging to a certain tribe that have no contact with outside world because the chances of us passing diseases to them they are not exposed to or vice versa becomes higher.",
