  "selftext": " \n\nI\u2019ve recovered physically  from anorexia, at least for the almost most part. I\u2019m about 5 months  into a new job, and I have a great boss who is a few years older than  me, who rarely eats during the work day, 8am-6pm. We\u2019re in an office of 4  people. She likes to say that everyone knows she doesn\u2019t eat, whereas  I\u2019ve been eating ok for a while now in recovery. \n\nI\u2019m really struggling with my own body image, and constantly try and  compare my size with everyone I see daily, and I think she\u2019s skinner  than me. I\u2019m very competitive and she\u2019s able to not eat and function  well, whereas when I didn\u2019t eat I felt horrible and my hair was thinning  a lot.\n\nHow do I ignore her daily comments on not being hungry and her not  eating, since I know it\u2019s triggering me? Is she ok and struggling like  me, or maybe she\u2019s healthy and I\u2019m imagining  it? I can\u2019t say anything,  she\u2019s my boss!\n\nI\u2019ve started restricting at lunch and not eating any snacks during  the day since I don\u2019t want to be seen eating food. Even when I feel  nauseous and I end up drinking a lot of water to avoid eating. I\u2019m  stressing over eating breakfast and dinner now too. I feel the need to  slim down just in case. I\u2019m supposed to be skinner than everyone else  els in real life.\n\nI\u2019d really appreciate advice and tips, I\u2019ve actually been enjoying  eating, lightly restricting though, but almost at my target weight so no  one knows by looking at me about my past struggles. It\u2019ll be hard to  fully restrict again, but I\u2019m trying so hard to convince myself that I  should and finalize that decision. I just get so much panic and guilt  when I eat and enjoy the food! Please. I\u2019ll so conflicted and angry at  myself.",

      "body": "It\u2019s easy to be triggered by others and just brushing it off is so so difficult. You can always pull your boss aside and mention to her that you are sensitive towards this subject and would rather not have it discussed around you. I know it can be a little embarrassing or awkward to talk about but it\u2019s for your well being. I mentioned this to colleagues who were losing weight and told them I supported them but couldn\u2019t be around when they spoke about diets and specific numbers. They understood.  If your boss can\u2019t respect your wishes I would actually suggest possibly finding a new job. It might sound a little extreme but it\u2019s so easy to slip back in to old habits and you shouldn\u2019t have to be in a toxic environment every day. You deserve better. Otherwise, if you aren\u2019t already in therapy I encourage you to get some so you can work through your triggers. It doesn\u2019t get easier but it becomes more manageable with time. You can do it! :)",

As long as I removed myself from the toxic space, I was able to correct my path and go back to recovery. I saved myself!!\"",

      "body": "Ok here\u2019s my two sense from a few povs\n\nFirstly I am so sorry your dealing with hearing this shit it would make me wanna put my head through a wall. \n\nAs far as your boss not eating that unhealthy and will catch up to her in one way or another trust me on that (you can\u2019t always see he affects off anorexia as they are internal and fuck up your system from the inside. I speak from experience as anorexia and bad eating habits really really fucked me royally). Also with this I would say she\u2019s either lying to you or is so insecure and having her own body dysmorphia issues that she may just be out of control. \n\nNot eating is not exactly going to keep you smaller, it will starve your body and when you do eat that will turn into fat and store in you, so your better off just snacking healthy and the drinking copious amounts of water is rly good but don\u2019t over-drink or you will throw off your electrolyte balance and then you will have next health issues. Also as you age and the more you stress your system and not feed it nutrition you may risk heart attacks and other shit like that (it happened to my exis anorexic mother she had athletic anorexia it was rly messed up) she almost collapsed at the dinner table, scary shit. \n\nLastly if you are stressed about your bod just start doing an activity that you like that is active and mix in healthy eating (I mean homemade and not snacking on crap bec your absolutely right that will only make you gain weight or feel empty if it\u2019s not actually properly feeding your body). I would just start researching  nutrition and learning about it bec it will help you feel good bec you will b filing  your body properly. \n\nAlso I if you feel like your loosing your mind when you have not eaten for a long time it\u2019s bec you are depriving your brain of nutrition and you may start to feel like your hearing shit as your brain will probably be responding slow. \n\nSo don\u2019t torture your self, get educated, not eating is not a sustainable way to live and will catch up trust me it always wins and you got this!! \n\nAnd if you would like some help, I just know from how I eat and it\u2019s not to bad and it took me a while to get there but I did it \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42",
