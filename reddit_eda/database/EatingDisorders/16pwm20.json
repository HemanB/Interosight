I don\u2019t want to care so much anymore, I don\u2019t want to think about every morsel of food that enters my mouth anymore or every bit of food that doesn\u2019t.\nJust let me be normal no more diets because every second of my time and energy goes into worrying about it. Please tell me how to just not care.",

      "body": "It sounds like you\u2019re inching towards recovery. \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc This was what the beginning of recovery looked like for me. Just being so absolutely exhausted from the ED thoughts running through my mind non-stop that I reached a point where I would do almost anything to get them to stop. The question I was really caught up on was, \u201cHow do I CHOOSE to get better from something I\u2019m not CHOOSING to do (in my case - restrict)?\u201d\n\nYour question is similar\u2026 How do you just not care? You NEED to care, but about different things. You have to care more than you have ever cared about anything. You need to care about your physical health and believe that your behaviors are harmful (HINT: they are\u2026 no matter what your body size!) You need to care about your loved ones and the affect this is/will have on them if you continue to spiral deeper into the ED - which you will. EDs don\u2019t maintain, they get better or they get worse. If you aren\u2019t actively working towards getting better, then the ED is growing stronger. You have to care so much about your own mental health/peace of mind/happiness/future that you don\u2019t give a fuck what anyone else thinks or says about your physical body. Notice I didn\u2019t say you have to love your body - you don\u2019t. You just have to love the rest of you so much that you begin to believe your body is the least important thing about you. When I began to see that the eating disorder was destroying all the things that make me who I am, all the things that I value and add to society, I began to shift what I cared about most. \n\nI big part of recovery, for me, has been accepting the ED as a part of me and as a part of my story. It was hard to get rid of something that I kept trying to convince myself wasn\u2019t real. I was scared of the judgement of others if I gained weight. I had to believe that the people in my life who truly love and support me would rather see me gain an insane amount of weight and be happy than see me skinny and miserable. \n\nRecovery isn\u2019t just about not caring if you\u2019re fat or skinny. It is about caring so much about other things (besides you body) - your health/life, your future, your happiness, those who love you, those who need the fully nourished version of you who has something worthwhile to offer - that you choose to get better, regardless of how you feel about your body.",

I\u2019ve been working hard on myself for years to arrive at the point I\u2019m at now and I believe that recovery helped rewire my brain when it comes to food. I try to eat foods I know I like and that will satiate me for a good couple of hours. Re: hunger and satiety scale, I used to always be either almost fainting from hunger or overbearingly full but now my hunger cues work much better and I know automatically when i need to eat. All this comes with time and effort. You can do it!",
