  "selftext": "hi, so ill guess ill start off by saying that i hate my body and have always been insecure about my weight. i am 5 foot and xx kg. (normal bmi range) and a few weeks ago i decided to start throwing up some of my meals. i live with my parents, so i unfortunately cant starve myself completey. sometimes ill get hungry and really want to eat some junk food, and im just like, 'fuck it'. later i regret it a lot and just feel like shit, so i throw it up. when i havent thrown up in a few days i start to feel guilty and hate myself. i already knew what bulimia was before, but i found out a bit more about it and it seems like what i do, just a lot more drastic. so do you guys think i might become bulimic? or am i just being overdramatic",

It's difficult to imagine just how fucked up and confusing ED brain can be before you get there, but if you keep going that's where you'll end up. I always thought \"oh it's fine because I'll just stop when I get where I want to be? And then I'll feel happy because I'll have achieved something?\" etc. but that's not how it works. The binges get bigger and bigger and happen more and more frequently, the time between them gradually fills with thoughts about food/body image/weight/self hatred, your head only gets more confused. Before you know it your brain is literally playing tricks on you (\"I need to throw this up so I can recover!\" \\* eye roll at my own brain stupidity \\* ). I've spent the past 7 years trying to recover, and I *still* can't stop thinking about ED behaviours, food, weight etc in almost every situation. I get by now, but I'd give anything to be able to go back and not end up here.  \n\n\nAsk yourself honestly, what do you think you will gain by engaging in those behaviours? Can you really imagine them leading to a point where you feel happy? Is it making you happy now? Do you really think that being thinner will equal happiness? It's a downwards spiral, but that's easier to see when you look back and you're trying your damnedest to just function like a normal person and see your friends and family and enjoy life again. You're not being overdramatic. Speak to your parents, or a school counsellor, or anyone who you feel comfortable talking too.",

I always thought \"oh it's fine because I'll just stop when I get where I want to be? And then I'll feel happy because I'll have achieved something?\" etc. but that's not how it works. The binges get bigger and bigger and happen more and more frequently, the time between them gradually fills with thoughts about food/body image/weight/self hatred, your head only gets more confused. Before you know it your brain is literally playing tricks on you (\"I need to throw this up so I can recover!\" \\* eye roll at my own brain stupidity \\* ). I've spent the past 7 years trying to recover, and I *still* can't stop thinking about ED behaviours, food, weight etc in almost every situation. I get by now, but I'd give anything to be able to go back and not end up here.  \n\n\nAsk yourself honestly, what do you think you will gain by engaging in those behaviours? Can you really imagine them leading to a point where you feel happy? Is it making you happy now? Do you really think that being thinner will equal happiness? It's a downwards spiral, but that's easier to see when you look back and you're trying your damnedest to just function like a normal person and see your friends and family and enjoy life again. You're not being overdramatic. Speak to your parents, or a school counsellor, or anyone who you feel comfortable talking too.",
