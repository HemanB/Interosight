  "selftext": "My boyfriend recently got back into fitness and is taking it very seriously. This means restricting what he\u2019s eating, how much he\u2019s eating, measuring everything he eats, going to the gym almost daily for hours\u2026 every time it comes up in conversation, I want to have a meltdown. Even him just telling me he\u2019s going to the gym makes me want to cry. It\u2019s become the source of a lot of our fights and he says I\u2019m becoming controlling. I\u2019m not trying to be, but hearing or seeing anything related to his physique makes me feel a million different emotions at once. How do I stop making this about me? How do I stop seeing what he\u2019s doing and comparing myself? Feeling guilty and hating myself and taking it out on him. He asked me why I didn\u2019t care when he was unhealthy and eating poorly, he doesn\u2019t understand that I don\u2019t consider what he\u2019s doing now to be healthy\u2026 I just want to live a life without the extremes. \ud83e\udd72",

      "body": "Well, first of all, have you tried explaining your feelings to him in a calm, rational manner (losing your shit when you see him pack his bag for the gym doesn't count) and asking that he tone down the fitness/calorie talk around you until are in a place with your recovery where these topics aren't triggering? If you have, and he's STILL doing it, there might be some bigger issues around him respecting your boundaries and you may want to re-evaluate whether this is your person.\r  \n\r  \nIf you haven't, I would have the conversation with him and see how he reacts. Here are some tips that I think might help:\r\n\n1. Don't try to have the conversation \"in the heat of the moment,\" such as when he is packing his gym bag or taking out the kitchen scale to portion out his food. He won't be receptive to anything you have to say in this situation - to him, it will just look like you're \"losing your shit over nothing, again\" and that you're \"crazy.\" \r\n2. Keep in mind that, just like you, he is human and does not always have the emotional bandwidth to be receptive/empathetic to what you are about to say. I would start by making him aware that you need to have a conversation, but letting HIM pick when and where he is ready to talk: \"hey, I have a couple of things that I really need to talk to you about, but I don't want to do this until you feel like you are in a space where you can give me like 30 minutes to talk about it. This isn't anything bad or alarming, there's just a few things about me that I wanted to open up and share with you - let me know when you are ready for me to do so.\" \r\n3. When you are having the conversation, make sure that your language is \"me-focused\" and not \"him-focused.\" For example, don't say: \"when **you** take out the kitchen scale to measure your food **you** make me feel like **you** think I'm fat and **you** would be more attracted to me if I lost weight.\" This kind of language is likely to make anyone feel accused and defensive. He will probably just come back with \"well, I didn't **intend** to make you feel that way - sounds like this is your own issue.\" Instead, try saying: \"hey, I know that this will sound irrational, and please know that I'm aware that this is completely **my** own issue, but **I** just need you to know that when **I** see you take out the kitchen scale to measure your food **I** get this little ED voice inside **my** head telling **me** that **I** need to eat less and it reminds **me** of a time when **I** was really struggling with **my** ED.\" He can't really argue with how you feel.\r\n4. To the extent that you're comfortable, try to explain the nuances of your eating disorder. He might just not be aware. He can't be empathetic or know how to help you unless you can get a little vulnerable and let him in on what you're going through. Try saying something like: \"You know that little ED voice I hear when I see the kitchen scale? When I was ill, this little voice always told me that I need to eat fewer calories/burn more calories than everyone else. It lead me to do some really unhealthy things with my diet and exercise. I am so much happier now that I am in recovery and no longer doing these behaviors, but when I start hearing that little voice again it makes me scared that I am relapsing into my ED.\"\r\n5. Let's be honest, having a partner that you can't talk to about your hobbies/interests can feel really shitty - let him know that ED recovery is a journey, and that you won't be in this place forever: \"Please know that one of my main goals in recovery is to be able to talk about workouts and calories with you without feeling triggered - and I know that I'll get there eventually - but I'm just not there yet.\" \r\n6. Finally, do it in a kind and empathetic way, but set a clear boundary in terms of how you want to proceed in this relationship: \"You have been working so hard to make positive changes for your health, and I want you to know that the rational part of my brain is so happy for you/proud of you. Unfortunately, the ED part of my brain is not ready to hear about it yet. I have to ask that you please stop talking about the gym/calories/etc. around me until I am a bit further along in my recovery and can hear these things without feeling triggered.\"\r\n\nThere - you just approached the conversation in a calm, collected, empathetic, and vulnerable way. You were respectful. You kept it about yourself. You communicated your needs. Unless this person is a complete monster, he can't really NOT be receptive to anything you've just said. (And, again, if he responds badly or his behavior doesn't change, please re-evaluate whether you want to be in this relationship.) \r  \nWould love an update on how it goes - you've got this and good luck!",

Honestly, I really hate that they're called \"eating\" disorders because that makes it sound like the eating is the problem, when really it's a mental health issue. OP is unable to empathize with her boyfriend (or anyone) when it comes to diet/exercise because part of the disorder is a compulsive need to outdiet and outexercise everyone else. It' actually quite isolating for the person going through it and damaging to their relationships.\n\nI'm by no means saying that it's easy to be in a romantic relationship with someone  who struggles with mental health, but if OP's boyfriend can't make allowances for her illness (and let's be honest, not mentioning your diet is kind of a small allowance), they simply might not be a good match.",
