  "selftext": "I love my fat friends more than I love life itself, but we have recently been discussing the fact that EDs focusing around weight are inherently fatphobic. And I see where they're coming from! I know most about anorexia and at its core, one of the diagnostic criteria is fear of gaining weight. Being afraid of becoming fat. Fatphobia.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd I really, really don't know what to do at this point? I love the fat people in my life, I don't feel disgusted when I look at fat people like that guy on the fucking front page this morning, I'm a fervent supporter of healthy and any size, and. I'm still fatphobic. I still hate my body. And I feel like I don't even hate my body for it's shape/weight, I hate it for the things that have been done to it, but at the end of the day it still comes down to weight.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel sick at the thought of being a bigot and hating a group of people, but I don't know how to stop it. Something's wired wrong in my head.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHas anyone else had experience with grappling with this type of fatphobia/internalized fatphobia? Some advice would really be appreciated, I can't really find any articles online about this.",

If you are not ridiculing, voting against amd supporting anti fat thoughts and policies then you\u2019re not being fatphobic. \n\nI think of it kind of like how I have a fear of being pregnant. I would kill myself before I willingly had a baby. But I\u2019m not discriminating against others or holding them to my standard of death-before-baby. \n\nLearning to love our bodies or be neutral about them or healing our eating disorder is a lifelong and very involved struggle- I don\u2019t think you should add more to yourself by saying you\u2019re a bigot on top of mentally ill- it isn\u2019t true and will only contribute to you hating yourself more.",

I don\u2019t consider her fat phobic. She, like you, finds no issue with other peoples bodies and celebrates all shapes. \nI\u2019ve expressed to her that when she complains about her body, or says she\u2019s \u201cfat\u201d or gaining weight that it can be triggering for me. How am I going to feel about my body if she thinks she is fat? And also how could she find me attractive if she finds her body so repulsive.\nBut at the same time- that\u2019s her disordered brain and mine. Is it fair for me to feel the way I do? Yes. And is my wife being malicious when her ED presents like that? No. \n\nInternalized fat phobia may be part of the issue but to be honest everyone I know has some internalized fat phobia. It\u2019s so present in our culture that it takes work to alleviate. However I don\u2019t think fat phobia is the core issue at hand. You have disordered eating and body image. Maybe your friends are mental health issue deniers or mental disorder phobics? Maybe they are being a bit close minded by not fully understanding or trying to understand what you\u2019re going through. Maybe they are still wallowing in their own pain of internalized fat phobia that telling others they are bigots make them feel better.\n\nPlease don\u2019t hate yourself because as you say, you already hate your body. We struggle everyday to wake up in our brains and deal with our conditions. \n\nI\u2019m kind of mad at your friends for intimating you\u2019re a bigot. Please go easy on yourself. The first step is self love my friend. You have to forgive yourself.",

      "body": "The only thing problematic about fatphobia is that it's a scare term to make non-overweight people feel bad for not embracing an unhealthy lifestyle. It perpetuates the myth that people can be healthy at every size. \n\nThe theory that weight-focused EDs stem from fatphobia oversimplifies eating disorders to the point that they are a character flaw rather than a mental illness. If you have an ED, your fear of gaining weight is something deeper than \"fatphobia.\" The reason you fear gaining weight may not have to do with how you see fat people at all. (The HAES movement also denies the seriousness of BED, but that's a different comment for a different time).\n\nOutside of EDs, a desire to be a healthy weight is more a sign of good sense than fatphobia. We have decades of well-backed research that has found, time and time again, that obesity increases the risk of early mortality, as well as of several other diseases (diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, cancer). The same is true for people who are severely underweight, so let me reiterate that the scientific consensus is that a *medically healthy* weight (which is never overweight or obese, regardless of what the HAES bots tell you) is optimal for a healthy life.\n\nTL;DR, \"Internalized fatphobia\" is just a different way to spell \"desirous of a longer, healthier life.\" There's no need to rid yourself of it, it's a lovely self-preservation tool.\n\nThat said, I have loads of fat friends and fat coworkers who I love dearly (pretty inevitable in North America). However, I have realized that I can love them without encouraging them to kill themselves slowly with food. And while I believe that it's pointless to police someone else's behavior, I try to conduct myself in a way that helps break HAES myths. I talk openly about the fact that I have lost and kept off a significant amount of weight through diet and exercise (all without falling back into unhealthy restriction!). I talk about my workout schedule and what activities I want to try. While neither of these are regular points of conversation, I pepper them in from time to time to see if something sticks.",

Being slim affords me certain privileges and helps me to feel a bit safer in an unjust world. We see how people in bigger bodies are treated in sitcoms, in media, in online comments sections. While I condemn that kind of hatred and bigotry, it's part of our current reality and so the ED can convince me that weight gain compromises my safety. \n\nI did gain weight in recovery and that was hard. I had to decide that no matter how the outside world treated me, I could find safety within my own being. \n\nI hope this helps a little bit! As others have pointed out, EDs are mental illnesses.
