I did it few times but I was mostly walking a lot and only eating 1200 calories maybe alittle more walking 10,000 to 20,000 steps  a day I would lose weight but I never got below 125lbs and I still felt fat , but people notice I was losing weight and telling me I look good, it kept me going . Then I slack off and I gain it all back and more , I\u2019m at my heaviest , I rarely get compliments , I don\u2019t feel good in my skin , I don\u2019t dress up so I don\u2019t blame them.. but it\u2019s crazy how people don\u2019t compliment  you when you gain alittle weight even if you slightly happy . At my skinniest I was smiling and for short times I was happy but I was also struggling mentally and obsessed with not gaining weight .",
