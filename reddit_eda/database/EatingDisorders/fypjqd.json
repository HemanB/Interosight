  "selftext": "My wife just told me she\u2019s bulimic since high school (she\u2019s in her late 20s now). She has told no one about it but me. After we talked (the talk ended badly), I immediately went online to look for advices on how to support my partner. I found out I was doing everything wrong when I didn\u2019t know about it.\n\n- I tell her whenever I think she\u2019s pretty on a certain day (I end with the compliment with \u2018today\u2019)\n- I comment on her eating habits (cutting carbs, not eating enough)\n- I contradict her (strongly) whenever she tells me she feels bloated or fat\n- I get her to eat at unhealthy restaurants with me a lot and I talk to her about food a lot\n- I tell her whenever she has gotten thinner\n- I am not good at diverting topics in our conversations, I usually dwell on the topic (which is a problem if the topic is about body image or eating habits)\n- When she says she is fat, I tell her that I am fatter\n- the list goes on\n\nThings even got bad when she opened up about it cause being me, I quickly asked her if she has a plan to do something about it (which was wrong and I didnt mean it, I was just trying to be forward thinking, but it was wrong)\n\n*** I have an anxiety disorder. So I really am panicking. It is 6 am now and I havent slept yet since yesterday when she told me about it. I feel really bad since I may have made her condition worse through the years we were together just because of how I naturally am. I am an honest guy and I find it difficult to not be honest with my wife when I am asked with questions such as \u2018have I gotten thinner?\u2019 \u2018Do you think I put on some weight?\u2019. Judging from the advices on what I should do to support her, I need to change how I normally converse with her and how I am normally interacting with her, and I am very worried if I can do this properly.\n\nPlease help me out. I really want to support her. Right now, she regrets opening it up to me. I really dont know what to do first. I am scared of screwing things up. I feel pressured that I might say the wrong things again. Im afraid of actually feeling anxious everytime I talk to her.",

The fact that you're here asking for advice is a testament that you care about her, and that's the most important thing.\n\nYou asked what to do first, I would ask her how you can best support her! Don't be worried about saying \"the wrong things\". You *will* say the wrong things sometimes, but your partner is open to talking about it now, and you'll learn how to better support her in time. You can't expect to be an expert right away.\n\nSome extra advice:\nWhen she's asking you if she's gained weight or looks thinner, this is known as \"body-checking\". Don't get involved in it. You could say something like, \"I'm not going to over-analyze your body. I think you're beautiful, full stop.\" Being honest is cool, but she's engaging in unhealthy behaviors and you don't have to. She's basically using you as an extra mirror for self-sabotage and if you can eliminate that possibility, it's gonna be a good thing.\n\nAs far as restaurants go, she may feel more comfortable in having the final say for where you go. I'm recovered from an ED but still feel more in control if I get to choose where and what to eat. She could be the same way. \n\nFor compliments go, really steer away from any comments on body image. This goes for her body, but yours too. Calling yourself fat helps no one. If she's calling herself fat, change the topic to her personality. Something like, \"I don't see you that way. I see a smart, fashionable, lovable woman and I refuse to see you any other way.\" \n\nLastly, you were NOT wrong to ask if she's going to do anything about it, but she may be alarmed because her telling you was already a huge step. Maybe you could gently encourage her to start thinking about if treatment could be a good thing for her, and expressing that you'd like to see her recover. Obviously, treatment is going to be essential at some point but she may not be ready to admit it, even to herself.",

I opened up to people throughout the years, went to different therapists, and it wasn't until I found an eating disorder clinic that changed my life. Your wife knows she has a problem, but she doesn't yet understand the complexities of social messaging that perpetuates it. \n\nAs a spouse, you are starting off right. You are trying to learn and though the adjustment will be rocky, you won't be the cause for her disorder. You also won't be the cure. This is all on her. You best role will come from learning as much as you can so you can be there for her in the most understandable way possible. You will say the wrong things, but that can't be helped. Just do your best.\n\n My husband was in your shoes and even came to the clinic a couple of times to get some advice and insight. Here are some tips: 1) EDs are saturated with shame...just like addictions. Being vulnerable and seeking professional help is a sign of strength, not weakness. Reluctance to get professional help is usually tied to the idea that we can fix ourselves if we just ate right AND look a certain way.  2) EDs are rarely about food, but something different. Therapy helps unpack that and provides awareness and tools to utilize other mechanisms for coping other than bulimia. 3) Categorizing foods into good and bad exacerbate EDs. 4) Commenting on any bodies is destructive...period, but most people don't know. 5) Not all therapists are created equal. A person with an eating disorder REALLY needs someone who specializes in this. I've had really traumatic experiences with therapists because they have no clue. 6) Numbers...weight, calories, steps, carbs, BMI...dangerous...feeds into the ED. 7) NEDA.org is a GREAT resource. If you want to PM me I'm happy to chat more. Check out Brene Brown's videos on vulnerability and shame. She's a gem.",

Communicate with her that you are afraid of exacerbating her illness due to misunderstandings and you want to come up with a plan so you can support her, understand her, and avoid making eachother uncomfortable. Dont say you want her to be \"healthy\" healthy means fat to some ppl with Ed's. Just say you want to help her feel better and you know how hard it must be for her. You want to see her live a long time and help her reach her goals but are worried about her damaging herself / her organs. She needs more help emotionally than with habits. Le pen rning to love herself is the most important thing.",
