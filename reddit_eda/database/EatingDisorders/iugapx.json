  "title": "Request: dating someone with an eating disorder",
  "selftext": "First off I'm really sorry if I sound ignorant. I'm truly just trying to learn and educate myself. I (29m) recently got in a relationship with a woman(27f), and she opened up, and told me about her struggles with eating disorders. She'll typically go long periods without eating anything. And I've never dated someone with an eating disorder before. I cook/bake a lot and I love making food for other people. Making food for others is how I express gratitude, appreciation, and love. I really like her and don't want to scare her off or make her think I'm not being supportive. Since we've been together ive dialed back a lot on the food talk because I get anxious that what I say might upset her.\nSo how do I navigate talking about food and making food without triggering and/or causing a relapse? How do I be the right kind of supportive? How do I be there for her if she does relapse? Where can I go to learn more?",

      "body": "Use a code word\n \nYou use it when you feel rejected by her declining your food and she uses it when you say/do triggering things\n\nYou cant walk on eggshells, you cant keep that up long term and its potentially no good for her. Not saying anything bad about your gf but ED makes us super secretive. Its shameful. Even ppl who rarely lie, will lie their ass off to cover up ED symptoms. I often five small tidbits of info in order to cover up bigger problems im having. I could be wrong, your gf might be the exception to the rule.\n\nI'm glad she's got someone who cares enough to try and learn",

Get her advice   She knows better than anyone what she needs. \nMy advice for you is NEVER discuss weight - yours, hers, someone else\u2019s. You want to keep well away from that, even if it seems innocent. Don\u2019t discuss diets. Do make food as normal as possible for her with your own behaviour. Do include her in the cooking of meals and ask her if she\u2019s comfortable with the ingredients before using them. Don\u2019t focus on food, find other ways to express yourself!",

I would offer it and not think second about it , you should still cook for her , or enough for her too, i think once she's more comfortable around you it'll be easier",

      "body": "Excellent advice! I also second \"do make food as normal as possible for her with your own behaviour\". When struggling with an ED, I've found it so helpful in recovery when people will include me in cooking meals together/still invite me for dinners when they're aware of the struggles. It helps you to practice your recovery and face the struggle, and reclaim the pleasures that your ED often wants to deny you. Me and my partner have a code word eg - the bully, for when I feel uncomfortable with certain ingredients or meals \"hmm the bully isn't a fan of that one\". Also helps to seperate the ED.",
