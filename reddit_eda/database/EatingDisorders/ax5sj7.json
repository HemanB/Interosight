  "selftext": " \n\nI\u2019ve had a restrictive eating disorder for many years. I\u2019ve noticed that when I start eating, I literally cannot stop. No matter what it is, when no one is watching, I can continuously stuff down an absurd amount of anything from popcorn, to cereal, to carrots, or grapes. I know it\u2019s because I\u2019m restricting during the day, but I restrict because I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll overeat because I can\u2019t stop! Any advice on how to break this cycle?",

      "body": "I'd suggest you to first set your mind in the direction of recovery. Once you've managed to do that, let me give you a heads up- you'll be eating a lot. Since you've had a long past of restriction, your body has been deprived of calories and nutrients for a long, long time. So 'overeating'would be very normal (if not necessary) in your recovery. \n\nYou'll be hungry almost all the time. Every single hour. Just be prepared. And understand that this is normal. Since our natural human instinct is to survive, it's going to want to eat as much as possible to make up for the restrictive past. Trust your body and its needs. You're going to be okay, you won't be overeating forever. \n\nOnce your body is gonna start trusting you again, the overeating will stop because your body will know there's no threat (of starvation). Get well soon \ud83d\udc9a",

      "body": "I have this same problem. I'm about a year and a half into my best attempt at recovery, and it's definitely getting better as my natural hunger cues are starting to come back. For the first year or so, I would eat to the point of feeling incredibly stuffed if I ate at all, and it was so hard because I wanted to try to eat to get better. Just give yourself grace, this will pass and things will even out. Working with a nutritionist helped some, but most of all time and consciously reminding myself that it's okay to eat, if I get hungry again later I can eat again (I think part of my tendency to overeat came from feeling like this was my one chance to eat until who knows when, even when trying to recover because what if the next day was a bad day and I wouldn't be able to stop myself from restricting?) and going slow while eating. Now, when I know I'm getting full, I take one last sip of water and take the best most delicious bite possible to be my final bite for that meal. Best of luck to you! ",

      "body": "Google \"extreme hunger\" during recovery. I had it, lots of other people have it during recovery. It's horrible, but it is not binging. You are responding to physical hunger. Your leptin feedback system is broken from the restriction and the only way to straighten it out sadly is to add body fat. Just understand it's all temporary and part of the process. You will feel 1000 times better in the long run if you put genuine effort into overcoming the urge to restrict and refeeding yourself. Even a lot of the body fat overshoot goes away on its own with time. I've found the less I restrict, the less hungry I am. Ending the restriction is the key to recovery.",

Then take a 30 min break after your meal to allow yourself to decide if you are still hungry or not. Maybe have a routine or a structured schedule so that you eat main meals rather than random snacks too. Hope it help, good luck x",
