  "selftext": " \n\nhi, so i'm 13 f and i think i'm getting to the point of an ED. i don't have a gag reflex so I can't puke. trust me i've tried to force myself. i eat a lot of snacks and stuff in between meals. I'm not really overweight but I have stretch marks and weigh a decently healthy weight, I'm 5\"7. i hate the way I look and have multiple breakdowns over my stomach fat. when I try to starve myself I cave and the will pig out of junk food and just food in general. then I feel worse. I'll have swings of confidence and self-hatred and my self-hatred usually ending with SH or pigging out. what should I do to stop or is this even an eating disorder? i really don't know and don't want to ask my parents because my mom is the reason I try to puke/starve.",

I am really sorry you\u2019ve gotten to this point so young, and I feel you about the mom issue (it\u2019s how I got my first ED around 15-16).\n\nFirst of all, professional help is the best way to get completely away from this. Is there an adult in your life who you can trust who can help you find someone to talk to?\n\nSecondly, a couple things to dispel: stretch marks happen to most everyone and will happen as you grow, which you are naturally doing now. They aren\u2019t an indication of fat or excessive weight gain. I have stretch marks on my thighs because I have a juicy butt I love very much. Stretch marks are determined by genetics and are as much a part of a woman\u2019s beautiful body as anything else. Some people call them \u201ctiger stripes\u201d which I like a lot. Although I didn\u2019t always think this way, I think they are beautiful and I know a lot of people agree with me.\n\nFood exists primarily to fuel you. Try to change the language you use around eating, and why you eat. You eat because your body is growing and you are doing amazing things in the world today and you need energy to do those things. Our bodies are basically electrified meat bags that move and think and that\u2019s incredible! You are incredible! And while food is needed as fuel, it is OK to ENJOY eating, and to take pleasure in fuel/food that both tastes good and nourishes and powers your amazing body. There is no reason to be ashamed of eating to fuel your body, and there is no reason not to enjoy a basic process that we must do.",

      "body": "this sounds like a binge and restrict cycle, the best thing to do to stop binges (pigging out) is to not restrict yourself. it\u2019s hard sometimes but eating enough food will keep you from uncontrollable eating and will be better for you in the long term. if you want to lose weight in a healthy way you should talk to a dietician and figure out a healthy plan. you should do research on weight loss and if you\u2019d rather do it without the advice of a dietician, look into a healthy calorie deficit! there are calculators online to find a plan that\u2019s healthy, safe, and effective. patience is key",
