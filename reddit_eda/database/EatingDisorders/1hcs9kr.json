  "selftext": "It\u2019s exhausting how something so basic and natural for most people has become an obsession for me. I plan every meal, weigh all my food, and count calories daily. But it\u2019s more than healthy control\u2014food consumes my thoughts.\n\nI spend my days anxious about the next meal, even when I\u2019m not really hungry. When I go over my daily calories, I feel overwhelming guilt and avoid eating more at all costs, even if I\u2019m still starving. On the other hand, if I have calories left, even when I\u2019m full, I feel the need to eat just to \u201cstick to the plan.\u201d\n\nSeeing people around me eating freely, only when they\u2019re truly hungry, is frustrating. I can\u2019t do that because I never feel genuinely satisfied. It feels like I\u2019m stuck in an endless cycle of guilt, anxiety, and control.\n\nDoes anyone else feel like this? How do you manage such a complicated relationship with food?\n",

Once I entered this cycle, I started to lose my mind. Today, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve developed body dysmorphia \u2014 it\u2019s like all food is just numbers to me, and I feel like I need to restrict as much as possible to achieve the body I desire.\n\nThank you so much for your words and tips. I feel like I\u2019m falling deeper and deeper into this world. I isolate myself, and I spend hours watching videos of people eating (10,000 calories in a day challenges are my favorite). It\u2019s such a relief to see someone who has been through this and managed to overcome it. Your comment gave me hope. Thank you for sharing.",
