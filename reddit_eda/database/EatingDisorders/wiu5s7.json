Then I starting eating dinner \u201cwith\u201d my partner by sharing pics of our plates then eating at the same time, then I\u2019d watch food documentaries. It\u2019s hard to demonize eating when watching something celebrating food.",

Your brain is trying to make you eat.  It has a lot to do with the frontal cortex and amount of decreased grey matter, also affecting your lepton, gherlin.   I have been in anorexia treatment and this is very common within that community,  it\u2019s also a habit you need to break, thinking about food all day.",
