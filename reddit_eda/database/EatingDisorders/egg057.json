Like, every time I get further in my recovery, I\u2019m tempted to sabotage myself just so that I can start over again.\n\nRecently I\u2019ve been having a really good week, where I\u2019ve had (apart from 1 bad day) close to no ED urges. But now I feel like a fake, like I\u2019ve been doing it all for attention, and that I don\u2019t need to recover. I guess, how can I let myself let go of the ED?",

      "body": "I struggle a lot with feeling like I'm \"not sick enough\" to recover.  What helps me is thinking about how once I've recovered, the \"level of sickness\" I had isn't going to matter nearly as much as it does now.  It feels important in this moment because I still have ED thoughts that make me compare myself to others and get really competitive, but once I'm out of the \"ED world\" so to speak, I'm not going to care about that stuff anymore.  I'm going to be focusing on my friendships and dating and career and all of those other real-life things--and so are you!  So even though you feel like a fake right now, once you're healthier you'll be looking back grateful that you did recover, not judging yourself for how quickly you did it or anything else.  Also, the sooner you reach recovery the better, so the fact that you've been doing well is AWESOME.  Seriously.  The future you're fighting for will be so much better than staying stuck in the ED.",

I want to let you know that there is talk out there to suggest regaining weight fairly quickly (aside from someone getting the uncommon, yet still possible Refeeding Syndrome) holds the best possibility for long term, sustained recovery. If periods have stopped (and likely even if they have not) regaining weight promptly, and thus periods if lost, likely helps osteopenia and osteporosis. Since our brains need fat and glucose to function properly, brain recovery seems to kick in once really weight restored, which is not just okay per charts, but which is *right for the individual,* is achieved. Sometimes it seems that full brain recovery can take up to a year, so generally the sooner you can be properly weight restored for *your body* the better. \ud83d\ude09\n\nAlso, we need to continue to gain roughly a couple of pounds per year into our early to mid-twenties once we've finished our major growing and are at the correct weight for *you.*  This weight is partly organs finishing development. In other words, let's just say a person is 19 yo and at a weight that provides good, medically verified physical and mental health is \"xxx,\" a person will likely need to continue gaining a couple pounds for a few to several more years simply to complete development of vital organs and this likely includes completeling bone development- can't remember that part off of the top of my head, but I think that bones are also involved there.\n\nI personally like Tabitha Farrar's podcasts, but they may or may not be something you'd like or not  based on your age. To me, she is positive and makes lots of sense. *Decoding Anorexia* by Carrie Arnold, a person recovered from AN, is a book I love too.\n\n\nOf course, always seek proper guidance from a medical professional. I am mostly recovered from a couple ED's and am posting only  from my own research and viewpoints.\n\nYou can do this! You do deserve it. \u263a",
