  "selftext": " \n\nNothing. At least in my program, which is a reputable school in the USA. We had a few scattered mentions of refeeding syndrome electrolyte imbalances and which medications can and can\u2019t be used for people who struggle with bulimia. I kept track of every time the topic came up, and it was sparse.\n\nI\u2019d like to change that.\n\nIn a perfect world, what would you want medical trainees to know about eating disorders? Where has the medical community failed you? How can we be better providers? Any personal input is very much appreciated.",

I think sensitivity training on how not to invalidate and trigger people with eds would be a good start.  Nobody has a clue in that regard and I\u2019ve had plenty of awful experiences with doctors myself where their callousness and insensitivity only made my Ed worse. I also think binge eating disorder needs to be something we cover and learn to recognise in patients. There are so many obesity related illnesses killing people in the western world these days. If doctors could learn to recognise and treat the percentage of that group who have BED/other eating disorders then they could help prevent some of these people dying from the severe consequences of their eating disorder. A final point would be to not automatically assume that weight loss in an overweight person is a good thing. I\u2019ve been praised and told I looked the healthiest I\u2019d ever been by my family doctor in the peak of my bulimia. As I started off obese my rapid 60lb weight loss was not questioned and the sane must happen to a lot of other ed sufferers. I think those things would be a good start at least in getting med students and future doctors to have a better understanding of eds and ability to manage patients with them. ",

Eating disorders haven't even been mentioned in class. Last semester an instructor posted an optional video to watch on EDs that looks like it was made in late 80s/early 90s, this was in a list of some 50+ optional videos so guaranteed nobody watched it (not that they would have found it useful). Basically we're told if you suspect an ED refer them to a psychiatrist.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHell, psychiatrists who don't specialize in EDs aren't much help either. When I was inpatient in a general psych unit last November after a suicide attempt I restricted, was already underweight and lost more weight, they didn't notice or care when I told them about the behaviors I was using and the weight loss. The psychiatrist asked me why my regular psychiatrist (who specializes in EDs) would prescribe me xx med, because \"I never prescribe those for patients with eating disorders because it causes weight gain\" freaked me the fuck out and I refused to take my meds, which just led to side effects and pushing back my discharge. When I told him how his words affected me he brushed off my concerns, \"Well obviously it doesn't apply to you because you didn't gain weight.\" k.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf a patient comes to you and tells you about their eating disorder, or they may be concerned, or they're using symptoms/behaviors, understand it takes A LOT to admit that. We overcome so much shame and guilt. The instinct is to hide/deny the eating disorder as long as possible. When someone reaches out like that, it is a VERY delicate, precious moment that can make or break their attitude and willingness to recover. By the time I reached out and admitted my relapse, I was so far gone, my grades were suffering, I was withdrawing, I was suicidal. The waiting list for ED treatment is soooo long, residential or outpatient. If someone is waiting on getting into treatment, check on them frequently. Weekly isn't too often when their symptom use is high, is affecting their life, and their health. Most people with EDs are ambivalent about recovery. Having to fight insurance and jump through so many hoops to get help when you're already malnourished, depressed, and stuck in the cycle can kill that motivation to recover.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpeaking of health, an ED destroys your life in so many ways that can't be measured by vital signs, weight, and lab values. It destroys relationships, careers, and your will to live.  \n\n\nAfter I called the treatment center it was a week for my intake. After my intake with an MD it was another 5 days for me to see a therapist, the next available psychiatrist was 4 weeks out, the next RD available was 6 weeks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA week after my intake assessment I attempted suicide.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the back of the ambulance I wondered where it all went wrong. I thought I did everything right. I reached out for help. I told them I was struggling. But the limited resources out there almost failed me completely. \n\nAnd I am one of the lucky ones.

This may be an unpopular opinion on this sub-reddit, but I think that eating disorders and other mental health conditions were fairly covered in my medical school curriculum compared to other common conditions seen in primary care like hypertension, otitis media, and osteomyelitis. The reality is that medical school often devotes one lecture an important topic (or less). Most learning if self-directed or done at a later stages in one's career like residency. It's impossible to know everything, but the important thing is to be open-minded, a good listener, and willing to learn. I struggled with an eating disorder for ~15 years and have had both good and bad experiences with healthcare professionals. Most of the time, bad experiences were because my provider was dismissive or not empathetic to how much I was suffering--not because of a lapse in clinical knowledge.\n",

When I was inpatient in a general psych unit last November after a suicide attempt I restricted, was already underweight and lost more weight, they didn't notice or care when I told them about the behaviors I was using and the weight loss. The psychiatrist asked me why my regular psychiatrist (who specializes in EDs) would prescribe me xx med, because \"I never prescribe those for patients with eating disorders because it causes weight gain\" freaked me the fuck out and I refused to take my meds, which just led to side effects and pushing back my discharge.

We overcome so much shame and guilt. The instinct is to hide/deny the eating disorder as long as possible. When someone reaches out like that, it is a VERY delicate, precious moment that can make or break their attitude and willingness to recover. By the time I reached out and admitted my relapse, I was so far gone, my grades were suffering, I was withdrawing, I was suicidal. The waiting list for ED treatment is soooo long, residential or outpatient. If someone is waiting on getting into treatment, check on them frequently. Weekly isn't too often when their symptom use is high, is affecting their life, and their health. Most people with EDs are ambivalent about recovery. Having to fight insurance and jump through so many hoops to get help when you're already malnourished, depressed, and stuck in the cycle can kill that motivation to recover.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpeaking of health, an ED destroys your life in so many ways that can't be measured by vital signs, weight, and lab values. It destroys relationships, careers, and your will to live.  \n\n\nAfter I called the treatment center it was a week for my intake. After my intake with an MD it was another 5 days for me to see a therapist, the next available psychiatrist was 4 weeks out, the next RD available was 6 weeks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA week after my intake assessment I attempted suicide.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the back of the ambulance I wondered where it all went wrong. I thought I did everything right. I reached out for help. I told them I was struggling. But the limited resources out there almost failed me completely. \n\nAnd I am one of the lucky ones.
