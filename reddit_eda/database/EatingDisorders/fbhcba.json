  "selftext": "so i got back from treatment in January and my parents have been horribly overwhelming. im 21 years old and they are treating me like im in high school trying to control my life and EVERYTHING I do. I\u2019m back in school and they constantly get mad at me for staying out too late and want me to come home every weekend. i\u2019ve noticed that the only times i have disordered thoughts or do disordered behaviors is when they are doing this. everytime i\u2019m around them i feel sick and can\u2019t eat nor do i even want to eat. i\u2019m struggling with how i can tell them this in a respectful way. I\u2019m fighting so hard for recovery and they are so supportive but at the same time they have no idea that they are making my ed behaviors worse rather than better....",

I don\u2019t understand what triggered this in the first place and therefore I don\u2019t know if it will happen again. What did we do wrong?  perhaps we weren\u2019t there for you ? did we miss the signs ? We almost lost you and now if we hold on so tight maybe  you won\u2019t fall again. Are we holding too tight ? Are we smuggling you . We don\u2019t know what to do.",

      "body": "i\u2019ve experienced something similar with your situation too. Since my siblings moved out when i was younger, i used to do all these disordered behaviors when i was with my controlling mother too. Constantly told my therapist about it and we had a few sessions with therapist and the family that this is how i felt and how its affecting me but my mother never listened, she couldnt change at all despite how much it affected me. Aaaand she didnt believe a word my therapist said. I can tell she was in denial and scared but she wouldn\u2019t tone it down? or calm the controlling? Idk :(( anyway, i then decided it was just really time to move out bc it was no help for my well-being at all. Moved in with my boyfriend (w/ lots of complications from my mother) when i was 19 and now im 21 and still have these thoughts and disordered behaviors but waaaaaay lesser and a lil more healthier than before.\n\nBut this isnt to say that you should move out too, just sharing that this is how i got through mine :) bc my mother was incapable of change is all. I do hope that soon your parents understand how their actions are affecting your mental health! You can start by telling your therapist!! If you already have and its not helping, you can tell your parents calmly about it. I hope it helps.",

      "body": "Omg I can totally relate in a similar way, but it\u2019s not about my parents, but my aunt and grandma who are constantly preoccupied in constantly checking in on me what time I\u2019ll be home and it makes me stressed. This is partially the reason why I moved out, as hard as living in a student apartment was that is 30 minutes from home, at the same time, it\u2019s also allows me to focus on myself and well-being especially on nights when I get out late from work and want to hit the gym after work and actually have time to prepare my meals and focus on my school work. No one said moving out would be easy, especially graduate school but it\u2019s necessary when you have family members always on your case, no offense, I respect them dearly but I\u2019m doing the best I can in trying to become a better person. Hope this helps, the struggle is real, we\u2019re in this together. I even had thoughts about moving back in with my family, but they took as it was a sudden move and I only did it to rebel against them. My boyfriend broke up with me after 9 months because it was emotionally stressful, aside from the fact that we had too many differences, now the question remains should I move back or how do I tell my family to respect my privacy and not to worry? This is just physically draining.",
