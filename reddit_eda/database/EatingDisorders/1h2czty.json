  "selftext": "I've been using this app to track what I\u2019ve been eating for the past 4-5 months now. I've been in recovery for a couple of months now, after recognizing that I was struggling with an ED again. I thought that I would keep tracking for health purposes (recently diagnosed prediabetic, which contributed to the ED). \n\nToday, my internet was super wack & my phone was not working. The app that I was using has just not been working for the past 24 ish hours. I decided to take it as a sign from God to stop tracking that shit lol\n\nI am freeeeeeeee (still got some work to do, duh, lol but we\u2019re on our way \u00a8\u032e\n\nEdit: It feels so weird. Just like tracking food was a habit that I had to instill, stopping is like a habit that I have to break, and I have to consciously stop myself from trying to do calculations in my head or thinking about nutritional content. Recovery is not a one-and-done!",

I honestly do notice when I don't count calories, I do eat more, not a whole bunch, but more. I know the feeling you are having knowing that for once the calories are not taking over your diet and helping you recover",
