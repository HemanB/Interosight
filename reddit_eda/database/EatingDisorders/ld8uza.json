  "selftext": "Hello! I'm 19(F) and have always been tall and underweight, as a kid I used to get force fed by my parents and I even got beaten if I don't eat (Which severely traumatised me) the doctors never figured out why I didn't want to eat, I just didn't feel hungry. I got over that in my teen years but lately (For almost a year now), I've been avoiding eating or just breadcrumbing myself (letting myself eat a piece of chocolate or something sweet), sometimes it's because I don't feel hunger and sometimes because I just don't want to eat and I don't know why. After I eat I usually feel sick to my stomach and the amount of food i've been eating has reduced severely. Eating makes me anxious and even depressed (but i usually struggle with depression and anxiety too) and sometimes I feel like i'm restricting myself with thoughts like \"You can eat if you finish this school work, but not before that\". I don't know what's wrong with me.",

I would definitely seek out the help of an eating disorder trained therapist who will be able to properly diagnose you and recommend a course of treatment.",

But it may be worth seeking out a professional therapist or dietitian who can help you process all you\u2019ve been through and start to change your thoughts and behaviors around eating. I\u2019m so sorry this happened to you :(",

I\u2019m extremely sorry your parents did that to you. That\u2019s horrible. I recommend seeking therapy for this to determine what the root cause of this is. Best of luck \ud83d\udc9c",

      "body": "Im assuming the physical/emotional abuse was not limited to your eating habits?\n\nIt is incredibly difficult to get an eating disorder under control, without addressing the trauma that has led to you feeling like your life is so out of control, that you NEEDED this in order to have SOMETHING to control, that you actually could control. Especially now that your parents aren\u2019t there to force you. That\u2019s hard to untangle from when, in a way, it gives you a sense of security to know that you can actually choose to minimally eat (comparatively).",

      "body": "It hurts my heart that your parents forced treated you so horribly. It's never okay when their issues are forced on you, and I'm so proud of you for speaking up.\n\nI was anorexic and bulimic, suicidal, and depressed because I was taught my best would never be good enough, and the only thing that couldn't be taken away and from me and gave me an identity was bulimia.\n\nPlease, please, please talk to someone. You're not meant to go through this alone, and it's nearly impossible to unlearn what you've so wrongly been taught if you don't have someone to show you a healthier way. If you don't know of anyone safe to talk to, let me recommend calling the loving, non-judgmental people at 855-382-5433 who have helped me when I didn't know where to turn.\n\nIn the meantime, here's something I'd like to share with you that helped me get started healing. I wrote it from the other side of the EDs. I share it often on this platform because it's what I know like I know like I know is the start to healing.\n\n\"You. Reading this right now.\n\nYes...YOU!\n\nI\u2019m going to tell you something, and I need you to pay close attention.\n\nI need you to tune out every distraction, and I need you to be here with me right now.\n\nAre you ready?\n\nThis is huge.\n\nThis is life-changing.\n\nThis might also be terrifying for you, but you need to hear it.\n\nIT\u2019S NOT YOUR FAULT.\n\nI don\u2019t care what it is you\u2019re blaming yourself for. Whether it\u2019s for your best never being good enough or your life not turning out the way you wanted it to, it doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nIT\u2019S NOT YOUR FAULT.\n\nYou\u2019ve made mistakes you based solely on the information you had to go on at the time,\n\nIT\u2019S NOT YOUR FAULT.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never been taught the truth of who you are or how to unapologetically show up in life, how can you blame yourself for not knowing?\n\nOr maybe you\u2019re blaming yourself for knowing better, but you\u2019ve never been taught the skills to actually do better.\n\nMaybe you\u2019ve tried a few (hundred) self-help books, courses, seminars, but nothing ever sticks.\n\nIT\u2019S NOT YOUR FAULT.\n\nWe live in a very selfish, hurried, distracted, society that\u2019s set up for surviving rather than thriving. Segregation over community. Judgment instead of understanding. Conclusions without conversations.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never had anyone speak life into you, to pay attention to you and acknowledge you for just you being you, it\u2019s really hard to believe you\u2019re worthy of anything good happening to you. It becomes a struggle to want to try.\n\nI\u2019ll say it again...\n\nIT\u2019S NOT YOUR FAULT.\n\nThere are no longer boundaries, and morals are faded shades of grey. We\u2019ve all become masterful dancers as we try to avoid stepping on anyone\u2019s feeling all in the name of \u201clove.\u201d\n\nSo IT\u2019S NOT YOUR FAULT you don\u2019t know how to use your own voice, to confidently offer your wisdom, or to just get through a day without hearing the voices of your past reminding you of all your flaws and shortcomings.\n\nIT\u2019S NOT YOUR FAULT you didn\u2019t even know you HAVE a voice. And IT\u2019S NOT YOUR FAULT you didn\u2019t know you have a CHOICE.\n\nSo the first thing I want you to do for me right now is say something out loud. I don\u2019t care where you are, who you\u2019re with, or how stupid you might feel.\n\nI\u2019ll give you another three seconds to quit fighting with me and yourself about doing it. Ready?\n\nOne.\n\nTwo...\n\nThree!\n\n\u201cIT\u2019S NOT MY FAULT, AND I FORGIVE MYSELF FOR NOT KNOWING WHAT I DIDN\u2019T KNOW!\u201d\n\nOkay, now I want you to actually say it out loud.\n\nDO IT.\n\nGO!\n\n\u201cIT\u2019S NOT MY FAULT, AND I FORGIVE MYSELF FOR NOT KNOWING WHAT I DIDN\u2019T KNOW!\u201d\n\nAnd then I\u2019d start journaling. I\u2019d get all the lies, blame, hurt, and gunk out of my head and onto paper\u2026and I\u2019d burn it! Then I\u2019d \u201clather, rinse, repeat.\u201d I\u2019d do this as many times as I needed to in order to get all the emotions and anger out so I could make space for truth and my real self to show up, unpack, and take up residence. I\u2019d stick with it until I started to believe, then almost believed, then believed a little more, then believed enough to try it out, then believed enough to trust that I have a purpose and I was created for such a time as this.\n\nYou know how why I\u2019d give my younger self this advice? Because it\u2019s what I did to now be free from depression, bulimia, and the \"lie-dentity.\"\n\nRabbi Daniel Lapin says, \u201cThe opposite of depression is not happiness. The opposite of depression is purpose.\u201d\n\nFind your voice. Speak your truth with love and respect. Renew your mind. Refresh your perspective. Restore your true identity. Walk in your purpose (which will become more and more clear the more you embrace your true self.\"\n\nI'm so proud of you, and I know your heart is so amazingly beautiful and loving or you wouldn't be in so much pain.\n\nYou're not meant to fit into this crazy world.\n\nYou're meant to BLEND OUT!",
