  "title": "Request: How to get over bingeing, have a healthy relationship w food, etc, while still being healthy??",
  "selftext": "I\u2019m just wondering if anyone has done this and maybe gone from overweight to healthy weight while also conquering bingeing/chronic dieting/restricting. it\u2019s my biggest problem and idek where to start solving it. I\u2019m not into those methods that are like \u201cyeah just eat however much you want of whatever you want\u201d. Like yeah i\u2019m sure that works great but if I do that for any extended period of time I bet my life that I will end up extremely obese. And no matter how you put it, being overweight is not healthy, and to go from overweight to a healthy weight, you obviously have to eat less, aka diet. So basically I\u2019m asking how to overcome BED and everything associated with it while still maintaining body goals and a healthy weight/losing weight??? Any insight is much appreciated",

      "body": "I think the common thought (and probably the right one) is to not focus on weight loss during this stage of your recovery. And I agree, because I'm doing the same thing and it is a constant struggle.\n\nThat being said, this is what worked for me (for about a month before relapsing since the new year): eating *really* healthy meals and working out. That helped disrupt the b/p cycle because I didn't feel as much guilt after eating. Working out helped because burning all that energy made my body desperate enough for energy that I was GOING to eat. It's easy to starve yourself of nutrients if you then just lay in bed all day; it's harder if you're maintaining a somewhat active lifestyle.\n\nMy meals were usually a meat, a cooked vegetable, and some sort of huge salad with cheese, craisins, whatever crispy toppings i like, and a homemade dressing (so i could control the amount of salt, fat, and sugar). I tried to minimize saturated fats and sugar, but not shy away from them if needed (like, i don't need butter on broccoli, but I didn't want to hold myself back from adding a bit of honey, cheese, or EVOO to something if i know I'll really enjoy it). As my workout intensity increased I noticed I was getting lots of headaches and tried integrating more carbs, which definitely helped; for me that meant a plain, baked sweet potato or sometimes brown rice. I snacked on fruits and had greek yogurt with granola, dark chocolate, and craisins for when i was caving something sweet. Or a cup of hot chocolate. Or cookies and milk if I felt like living dangerously  :) \n\nFor exercise I literally just jogged in place in my apartment. Sometimes while watching TV. Sometimes listening to the Hamilton soundtrack. Sometimes fast, sometimes just walking. Not necessarily hitting a number of steps, but trying to beat my lowest number over the previous seven days. AND I didn't weigh myself. Weight loss was based on how my clothes fit and comparing my overall fitness (i.e. only being able to jog for like 20 seconds vs 10 minutes)\n\nFor me, this was the healthiest I'd been since the pandemic causing ALL my ED behaviors to flair up in the worst way, and I'm trying to fall back into it. I liked being able to enjoy food and enjoy my body without fighting the urge to punish it every time I ate something. \n\nGood luck with all the things!",

But when I exercise I feel much less anxious and in control and even excited to keep making my body stronger.\n\nOf course this doesn\u2019t fix everything, you can still over eat, be unsatisfied with your weight/ look... but for me I feel much less scared about feeling that way for long because I know how satisfied I feel once I start working my body",

      "body": "Yes it is possible and I\u2019ve done it. If someone told be I couldn\u2019t recover from BED and successfully lose weight from my painful obesity, I would just choose to never recover. It\u2019s definitely possible but I do agree the effort needs to be in feeding your emotional needs. Weight comes off if you burn more energy than you ingest, regardless of whether you obsess over it or not. But instead of focusing on this fact and weight, make a conscious effort to become more in tune with your body and practice healthy/feel good habits and get a routine down. This lays the foundation for a healthier lifestyle and after you have spent less time thinking about weight you may have already seen yourself improve in other areas which builds confidence, and it may only require minor tweaks in your habits to reach future goals. So yes, you can have it all but it\u2019s a matter of prioritizing your mental health enough right now to set numbers aside and build habits and hobbies instead. Progress will come with patience and care. Also I want to add that eating nutritious meals routinely helped disrupt b/p cycles as another poster has mentioned. Getting what you needs daily helps emotionally and physically.",

      "body": "I'm in this spot as well after trying to recover last year. I tried the whole eat whatever your body needs thing and it was a shit show. I had extreme hunger that lasted until I went from very underweight to slight overweight and it was traumatizing and caused really bad relapses with subsequent huge binges and eventually constant b/p. I regret not seeking treatment when I was underweight because eating a lot of calories caused refeeding syndrome and it was a truly painful experience on my body and psyche.\nThe only time I consistently did well with both recovery of some sort and weight loss is when I did a paleo style diet. I ate meat, eggs, lots of veggies and seeds and even made desserts sometimes. I did limit my calories and exercised quite a bit but I actually ate more calories than I would have ever felt comfortable with in the past while trying to lose and the binges almost stopped completely and I lost a lot of weight in like a month.\n\nI think paleo worked for me because I have a lot of dietary sensitivities and really never crave grains anyway. I ate til I was stuffed everyday with rooty vegetables, protein, fruit and seeds and I just felt content all the time. It was also the best way to eliminate processed foods which I find both addictive and too stimulating for me personally and I will overeat them and purge, so it really helped with that. The bloating was not pleasant in the first two weeks because I wasn't used to eat so much volume, but it settled and I saw massive changes in my body. I was happy, I only relapsed because I'm still dealing with water retention and purging makes it go away, but before this relapse doing things this way was the longest I was ever ed behaviour free.",

After recovering for a while, you begin to develop and hear your hunger cues again. \nAnd yes it completely stems from diet culture and our societal obsession w being thin and small and generally \u201caccepted.\u201d It\u2019s hard to justify eating that way, but just know it IS VALID. Eat for yourself and your body. If anyone gives you shit for it, try to ignore them. They probably just don\u2019t understand. \n\nMany times my parents have commented on the amount I eat. I try to brush it off because I know that if I want that second spoonful of pb, I should have it. It\u2019s not going to kill me. If I *dont* have it, I\u2019ll keep thinking about it ... thinking about it... and will eventually binge. \n\nAnd don\u2019t apologize. You weren\u2019t rambling at all!! :)",
