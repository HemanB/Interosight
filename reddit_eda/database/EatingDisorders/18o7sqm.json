  "selftext": "I think about food allllll the time. Every single time I eat I think about calories and how much fat is going to come on my body. I hate my body so much and wish I was thinner constantly but I compulsively eat and then feel like shit. The only time I feel proud of myself is when I barely eat and keep in under 1000 calories in a day. I love food but I hate eating if that makes any sense. I'm so tired of it and I just really wish I had these other girls bodies so I wouldn't have to worry so much about what I eat. It's so tiring...",
