Sometimes I'd just be fixated on self-destructing (the aim wasn't to look \"beautiful\" etc, but to make myself as unwell as possible), but then that was driven by the same self-hate that fuelled my body image issues, so things got pretty confusing pretty quick. For a while I was convinced I didn't have any body-image issues anymore, but then as soon as I started gaining weight and my body started growing I freaked the heck out, so there was still obviously still something going on with that side of things.  \n\n\nI think it's a lot more common than people think though. Society's common understanding of eating disorders is that they're solely the result of body dysmorphia/body image issues. I think that's a bit of an issue in the medical profession too, and as a result people without body image issues can struggle to get a proper diagnosis and appropriate support, and the support available is almost entirely tailored to body-image issues. I remember going to a support group which had set topics for each day, mostly centred around \"feeling fat\" and body image. Almost everyone spoke about things like self-harm, self-destruction and dissociation from their body, but the person running the group had no idea how to deal with that side of things so just changed the topic back to body image etc. It was really disheartening.",

And the times I thought I was fat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, my eating was always questionable, but it took a nosedive when living with my abusive ex for two years.\n\nThat relationship stressed me out so much, and I always put off eating to get \"more important\" things done first.\n\nIt didn't help that I had so many people, including my ex, tell me how \"beautiful\" my malnourished body was, so it became so hard to realize that my lifestyle had caught up to me, and I was disgustingly malnourished.\n\nI finally dumped him and it's been exactly one year since my lowest weight.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt times I find myself not eating in lieu of \"more important\" things, I'm also at my highest (though still healthy) weight and that brings anxiety about  no longer having \"that\" body that was always praised. That anxiety makes it easy to become fatigued, and the scale not really changing makes me think it's okay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne thing that helps me stay on track is gardening.\n\nGardening is alllll about control. You pick the plants, you need to be out there watering them on a schedule, you're feeding the bugs, you're trimming the spent blooms, you're battling spiders, harvesting seeds, re-spreading those seeds...it's a whole ass mission.\n\nMy current \"most important\" thing is saving the Monarch butterfly population through gardening, as they've dropped 90% since the 90's. The only plant their caterpillars eat is Milkweed, so I've spent a lot of my time focusing on those numbers.\n\nAt the end of a long day of gardening, I'm hungry AF.\n\nAnd I can't ignore that hunger because the future of the Monarch butterflies is partially in my hands, so if I don't eat, they don't eat.",

          "body": "Personally it was a bit of both for me, and I kind of switched between the two. Sometimes I'd just be fixated on self-destructing (the aim wasn't to look \"beautiful\" etc, but to make myself as unwell as possible), but then that was driven by the same self-hate that fuelled my body image issues, so things got pretty confusing pretty quick. For a while I was convinced I didn't have any body-image issues anymore, but then as soon as I started gaining weight and my body started growing I freaked the heck out, so there was still obviously still something going on with that side of things.  \n\n\nI think it's a lot more common than people think though. Society's common understanding of eating disorders is that they're solely the result of body dysmorphia/body image issues. I think that's a bit of an issue in the medical profession too, and as a result people without body image issues can struggle to get a proper diagnosis and appropriate support, and the support available is almost entirely tailored to body-image issues. I remember going to a support group which had set topics for each day, mostly centred around \"feeling fat\" and body image. Almost everyone spoke about things like self-harm, self-destruction and dissociation from their body, but the person running the group had no idea how to deal with that side of things so just changed the topic back to body image etc. It was really disheartening.",
