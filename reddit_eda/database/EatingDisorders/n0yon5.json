  "title": "Request: I have atypical anorexia, but wish I was sicker. Now I understand the cruel competitiveness of EDs.",
  "selftext": "After years of restrictive eating, into laxative abuse, diet fads, pills, fasting, purging while restricting, and bingeing without purging (never felt full, always just felt empty \u2014 it was depression emptiness and I didn\u2019t know then), I got diagnosed with atypical anorexia yesterday. \n\nFor a moment, it made sense. I finally had a name to the awfulness that I consistently felt about my body and weight, after long last, over 15 years later. I had eating and body image issues for the longest time, except I felt it was normal seeing as I was a fat person. My stomach constantly grew in size (in my perspective). As a 23 year old, I haven\u2019t been in a healthy weight range nor underweight (per BMI) for maybe 15 of those years. I still am not, today. \n\nIt was last year, in the midst of deep depression and watching way too much youtube in bed, that i started to realise how my meals in a day were much less than normal. I would see What I Eat In A Day videos and realise that a person\u2019s one single meal out of three would still amount to more than everything that I\u2019d let myself eat in an entire day. And even then, I still felt the need to starve myself even more. \n\nBut very quickly after the words \u2018atypical anorexia\u2019 came out, did the competitiveness start. I started thinking \u2014 what a failure, i couldn\u2019t even lose enough weight to have \u2018actual\u2019 anorexia. My ECG results showed sinus tachycardia and borderline right axis deviation, which was otherwise considered normal, and I was frustrated that I hadn\u2019t ruined myself enough to have low blood pressure, bradycardia, risk of heart failure (i struggle with suicide too, and it seemed inviting) \u2014 was I not starving myself enough? Even when I knew that my higher blood pressure and tachycardia is possibly the result of being on the riskiest dose of Effexor XR (at 350mg, where it increases blood pressure), I felt so disappointed that I couldn\u2019t even get sick enough. \n\nI\u2019d lost 21% of my body weight within a year, but yet have still been well above the healthy BMI range. 21% is significant, I guess, but I\u2019m also still in an 82% surplus of my ideal weight (less than half of my highest weight), and still want to lose more. \n\nI feel like such a disturbed person for feeling like I need to be doing worse, despite anorexia being one of the illnesses with the highest morbidity and mortality rate. The competitiveness is ridiculous. And even after saying all this, and being told by my ED psychiatrist that I should remind myself to eat more, I can\u2019t help but feel even more determined to eat even less, because I\u2019m so mad that I\u2019m not doing worse than I already am. \n\nBut I have a dietician and a physiotherapist to see now. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s supposed to work. What if the dietician wants me to eat more meals, and that makes me gain weight again? What would a physiotherapist do in this case? I have such trouble exercising after building a really bad relationship with it years back, only made worse by depression and absolute lethargy (walking for a few minutes already makes my back and legs and core feel painfully sore). I don\u2019t know what to expect from seeing a dietician and physiotherapist in this case. \n\nI\u2019m just so confused, and discouraged, and the competitive ED voice is just so annoyingly loud right now.",

I never got thin enough for anyone to even notice I had an ED. \n\nIt\u2019s a weird feeling to want to be recognized and validated as someone who is able to suppress biological needs enough to face damages. \n\nI don\u2019t know how to help you get rid of that feeling, but I can say you\u2019re not alone one bit. An ED is feeling like you aren\u2019t skinny enough, and it is quite evident that you experience that just like anyone else with an ED. You hit every mark for having anorexia, and I honestly feel like \u201catypical\u201d anorexia should be called \u201canorexia.\u201d It\u2019s all the same behaviors, same experiences, and same treatment. Fuck the labels. \n\nI wish you the best and really hope it gets better from here.",

Even if you\u2019re NG tubed. No matter how unwell your illness makes you, it well never feel like you\u2019ve proven you\u2019re ill enough. It\u2019s easy to give into the illness and let yourself become more ill because it\u2019s what you think you\u2019re supposed to do but at the end of the day the weight loss isn\u2019t going to make you happier or make you feel more worth it. No matter the weight you\u2019re at, you deserve to be happy and healthy. You deserve to be in control of your life, not your eating disorder. I hope you find the help you need and that you can have a full recovery because you are worth it. Good luck!",

      "body": "I relate to this a lot. I suffered from bulimia for 10ish years and all the time I wished I had been typically anorexic. I found that I idolised it because there was a lot of shame in my ED. I found myself jealous of those who had anorexia which just made me feel even more ashamed and caused many spirals in recovery. \n\nI never dropped severely underweight and felt like people didn\u2019t really understand the true extent of my ED so sometimes I think I wanted to be iller just so people would understand/appreciate how ill I was. I do believe because I wasn\u2019t underweight my family especially didn\u2019t seem to understand I needed help and therefore were generally unhelpful and did triggering things during recovery. \n\nBut that was something I had to work hard on and address in recovery. Being compassionate towards myself and recognising my illness was still valid and I still deserved help was a big step. It takes a long time, and I found being nice to myself so hard, but try take it day by day and give yourself rest when you need it (recovery is so exhausting mentally).",

      "body": "Atypical anorexia is still anorexia. Anorexia is still the same disease at a normal or high BMI, or without obvious physical consequences like hair loss or syncope (but there are always consequences even if you don't see them).\n\nAs for getting upset at your ED psych, I still get upset when my husband reminds me to feed myself, but I accept that my disorder makes me react that way and I don't tell myself that the feelings are wrong (but I still do what I need to do to stay in recovery despite the feelings).\n\nFeeling like you want to get worse instead of better is part of this. It's all of it, really. I don't have advice for that part, but you are valid.",

      "body": "**(OP here)**\nThank you all lovely, lovely people. For the encouragement, words of strength, and for sharing your own stories that help to remind me that I\u2019m not alone in this. \n\nI guess I\u2019m struggling with 3 different illnesses (treatment resistant depression, this eating disorder, and also post-sexual violence trauma + the resulting sex-as-self-harm hypersexual behaviour which has been incredibly distressing) at the same time, all kind of interconnected in a bad way, so everything is just all so confusing and overwhelming to me at the moment. It\u2019s like all 3 illnesses are pushing me to destroy myself completely. \n\nUnfortunately this means also being under the care of various specialisations / clinics. My ED psychiatrist asked me to consider moving my psychiatric and psychological care (for trauma and depression) here to the ED-specialised hospital (so they can take care of the ED too), but I\u2019m not sure if I should because I\u2019m currently under mood & trauma-specialised care. It\u2019s 4 different clinics at the moment \u2014 \n\n- 1 mood-specialised psychologist for depression / general health\n- 1 mood-specialised psychiatrist for depression / general health, \n- 1 crisis centre EMDR therapist for sexual trauma (as my main therapist isn\u2019t EMDR trained), and \n- 3 ED-specialised clinicians (psychiatrist, dietitian, physiotherapist). \n\nIt\u2019s rather messy so I understand ED psychiatrist\u2019s concerns. If anyone else also has experience trying to work out the structure of their mental healthcare team amid treatment for co-morbid disorders, appreciate if you could share some insight on how you chose who to keep seeing? This feels like a big mess right now and quite discouraging \ud83d\ude14\n\nTIA.",

I\u2019ve been hospitalized, I\u2019ve struggled for years, but I\u2019ve never been at a low BMI, to the point where I\u2019ve seriously lost friendships because I went back to (and slightly above) my normal (obese) BMI in recovery. The endless \u201cdon\u2019t you think you\u2019ve recovered now\u201d \u201cyou need to stop gaining weight\u201d \u201cyou have binge eating disorder now\u201d \u201cit\u2019s not healthy to eat this much at your weight\u201d \u201cyes it would be normal to gain weight if you had actual anorexia but you don\u2019t, you can\u2019t just call your crash diet anorexia\u201d... it\u2019s enough to make a person desperate.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason sufferers of \u201catypical\u201d (what bs) anorexia are more medically compromised by the time they seek care, and it\u2019s because of fatphobia and prejudice. Thankfully among professionals, the belief that you can\u2019t have a restrictive eating disorder at any given BMI is falling away, but the cultural shift is taking longer and that poisons us as survivors.\n\nIf your new dietician is good, which I hope they are, they will work with you to overcome your disorder and try to give you a way to eat that will let you live your life. I can\u2019t tell you that you\u2019ll be thin, because you probably won\u2019t. I will never be. But you can be happy and recovered. You can eat without worry; you can exercise in healthy and well-adapted ways that make you feel good and strong, not beaten up. You can live a healthy and fulfilling life without food and your weight controlling your every thought. It\u2019s possible and I believe in you!\n\nSomething that helped me is the homeodynamic recovery method from edinstitute.org. It helped me understand the science behind what was going on inside me and why eating disorders are the same - and equally deadly - no matter your BMI. \n\nTake care of yourself and stay strong",
