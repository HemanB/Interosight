  "title": "Request: I don\u2019t look \u201csick\u201d so no one will take me seriously. How do I stop feeling like an imposter? How/where do I get help?",
  "selftext": "I recently saw a post on social media describing what it was like (for that person) to have ARFID. Their description sounded similar to my life so I went on Google and did some research on that as well as selective eating disorder. It sounds fucked up but when I learned about selective eating disorder I felt relieved and happy because I have always just been ashamed of my very severely \u201cpicky\u201d eating habits. I finally felt heard and hopeful that maybe I can eventually become a normal eater.\n\nI told my doctor hey I think I have this, so can you refer me to somewhere that will officially diagnose me and then help me with the treatment plan? And she looked at me like I was insane. To her credit, she simply asked why I thought I had it and then said she would have her assistant find somewhere for me... but she still gave me a look like why are you making this up, you\u2019ve never said anything about this before and your weight and everything is normal.\n\nFast forward a few weeks and the assistant sends me the numbers to a couple general therapy places. Even though I don\u2019t want that, I gave them a call and they said they didn\u2019t have openings for months into next year. Fine. I get back to her and ask if I can do an outpatient program somewhere because I don\u2019t think therapy will help as much as having someone qualified with eating disorders making a plan and working with me. No response for several weeks now.\n\n(INFO: yes I could do research and find somewhere on my own but it is such a hassle to find places your insurance will accept. I thought it would be easier for the doctors office to do it since they probably have a list of places like that just in case any patient needs to go, and they already have my insurance information so they could just shoot me a list of places they recommended that take my insurance. Apparently that\u2019s a no go though)\n\nSo what should I do? I felt so good when I first found out that I\u2019m not just crazy and weird, it\u2019s an actual condition, but I am at a loss here because no one seems to be taking me seriously.",

Make her do her part as your doctor. If she really cares about bettering patients like we expect from doctors then bringing to light all the ways she has let you down should help. If you were underweight she would have already sent you a list of places and probably even checked up to see that you had contacted them and were being treated. This is unacceptable.",

      "body": "I\u2019m a nurse with an ED, from my personal experience working with docs and as a patient, here\u2019s a take: the best you are gonna get from a doctor who isn\u2019t in mental health is addressing any medical issues related to the ED if you have them and referral for therapy. And even many docs don\u2019t clear that bar.\n\nThey see their job as addressing medical issues, and if you aren\u2019t underweight by the BMI, have no conditions caused by restricting or purging, they just don\u2019t see how they can help other than giving a referral or giving tips to find a therapist/dietitian. Many are also not very knowledgeable about EDs, so they stick to diagnostic criteria which are medical and not psychological, unfortunately. To them EDs are a medical issue AND a psychological issue and if there is nothing to do medically they need to refer you to someone who can help with the psych aspects. \n\nYour doc wasn\u2019t very sensitive, but most MDs don\u2019t have connections to or knowledge of ED treatment centers and specialists. The fact that they referred you to someone at all is better than most. You do have to do to your own research, but attending a group therapy meeting/support group in your area can help you get suggestions for specialists.",

One thing I only recently found out was an option is that if you call your health insurance carrier and tell them what kind of treatment you\u2019re looking for, they can give you a list of facilities or mental health professionals to call that will take your insurance. I\u2019d been spending hours calling offices and asking them about whether they take my insurance, and I was able to cut that down to about 20 minutes by calling my insurance carrier.\n\nI\u2019m wishing you the best!
