  "title": "Request: Can eating disorders be considered as trauma?",
  "selftext": "I was on the net the other day and I found a few comments talking about how once people recover from their eating disorder, they categorise it as trauma. I\u2019ve never felt like the same person after recovering from my ED and I believe forever I\u2019ll carry the weight that believes that I\u2019ll never be able to live a worthwhile life anymore unless I\u2019m participating in it. (I\u2019m fine now).  Can any experience with mental illness then be considered as trauma? Would you only categorise it as something that is an experience that is lived through?",

      "body": "Unfortunately, yes. It can be very traumatic for some people to experience body issues or eating disorders specially if it has  happen for long periods of time. It causes insecurities, thoughts that NEVER go away, fear of shopping, body dysmorphia, etc etc. I can\u2019t say for others, but for me I can\u2019t eat anything without thinking of the future effects that the food will have on my body. I can shut off the thoughts for short periods of times, but it comes back every time something can seem unhealthy or \u201cfattening\u201d to me. No matter what it is. But I\u2019ve suffered body image issues since like age 5 so I can\u2019t speak for people who\u2019ve had this for short periods of time.",

      "body": "Mine will remain a traumatic experience. Although I have almost entirely recovered, the years in treatment centers spent starving and alone will haunt me. The staff watching me use the restroom and having to keep the door open when I shower. Having to spend months on end in bed because I wasn\u2019t allowed to walk. Not being able to go outside for over a month (multiple times) and longing for fresh air. Having tubes shoved down my throat. Losing all my friends and the trust of my family. Being afraid of walking in to hospitals because what if they hospitalize me?\n\nI\u2019ve been hospital free for 2 years and those years in the centers alone are enough to make a person traumatized. This doesn\u2019t include the ED behaviour and so much more.\n\nI did end up getting a subtle tattoo to commemorate my battle and I never would\u2019ve met my best-friend without it so I suppose there is some good that comes with it. I grew from the experience and became who I am today. \n\nIs it a trauma? Absolutely",

Last year, it was Holy Week that everything got so bad that I decided to go to treatment. This year, I\u2019ve been doing pretty well, but Holy Week was extraordinarily difficult and some behaviours have crept back in, I think, in part due to having flashbacks about how terribly I was doing last year. I was having emotional flashbacks all last week and I\u2019m having a lapse right now. \n\nLast week felt like other instances that have triggered me into an emotional flashback, except this time, the subject matter is my ED itself and not other traumas I\u2019ve survived.",

Even though I no longer take part in the harmful things I went through with Bulimia, I still think about calories in excess, how my body looks, shopping and eating out is still extremely difficult, and I am still insanely picky/critical when it comes to what I eat (e.g., if I eat something \"bad\" I will obsess over it for some time.) I definitely think going through an ED can be considered traumatic, especially with the insane mental damage/harm you undergo.",

I'm now technically about 10 years past when it was last \"active\", but it scarred me deeply, and still affects my daily life. I have anxiety attacks if I go to the grocery store, I still don't cook at all (my dear husband does these things), even just thinking about feeding myself on a daily basis to maintain basic nutrition still feels exhausting. And the state of my psyche ever since then has been a very damaged and changed one. I am a severe depressive, and have a few auto-immune conditions and suffer from chronic fatigue. \n\nIt's pretty rough right now, and I even just resigned from my very good paying job in my career field, to take a part-time job and finally - for the first time in my life - actually do what it takes to get well. It's time. But yes, I very much feel like a trauma survivor as a result of my ED. I have never considered this perspective before, but I think you're on to something.",

From stealing to regularly throwing into a plastic back, constant lying, isolation, insomnia, constsc fear of being broke because you spent all your money on food (Mia)... There are too many things. The worst is the constant existential dread you feel because you spent so so so much time and money on your addiction. I don't know who I was before all of this, it's like Ive been stuck in a timeless space ever since I got sick. Nothing ever happens here. I don't recognize myself anymore.",

Partially because remembering how having an ED changed my perception and made me hurt myself and others has robbed my of an implicit trust in myself that other people seem to have.",

Often our disordered behaviors are aggressive and violent (like, the entire nature of bulimia), and then many of us have major symptoms and long term damage as a result of malnourishment. So just the physical part alone is enough to be traumatizing.",
