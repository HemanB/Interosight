  "title": "Request: so bloated my skin hurts",
  "selftext": " \n\nWhen I first start eating more again I get bloated everywhere, so much so that my stomach sticks out in a way that makes me look like my best friend did at 4 months pregnant. I could deal with the appearance change, it\u2019s easy enough to hide with loose clothes, but it\u2019s really painful. My skin hurts to the touch like a bruise, and not just over my stomach but over my entire body. Like my whole body is one giant bruise. Does anyone else have any experience with this?",

I don\u2019t condone pills for EVERYTHING, but I have a pill for this that helps me! \n\nI have been pretty in control for the past few years but still get  dark times where I restrict, and coming back to normal eating habits physically hurts. My little secret is that I take Midol for it! I often have several of the issues Midol helps during these times-cramping/muscle aches, headaches, bloating, lack of energy. It\u2019s like an ibuprofen+caffeine+anti-bloat-GENIUS! Midol is my miracle drug I use it all monthlong, it may be marketed as period relief but it does so much more!

      "body": "THIS!!!!! This is not talked about enough!!!!! During my refeeding stage I felt like my body was trying to jump out of my skin. I felt so tight and I was bloated to the point of my fingers not being able to close without struggle. Some things that really helped me deal was staying TF away from tight clothes and finding comfort in sweat pants or looser fitting jeans (which thank god loose clothes is trendy). To cope with the negative mentality and mindset I journaled and really focused on my body- it\u2019s needs, it\u2019s signaling, etc. and I\u2019d take some walks or talk with my support system. Lastly to cope with physical pain I used \u201cPhazyme\u201d, \u201cTums\u201d, and \u201cGas-ex\u201d. Good luck!!!",

However, for a small minority of people it can cause diarrhoea for the first few doses.\n\nIt may also help with your (possible) anxiety -But regardless I would absolutely consult a physician before you rely on any recommendations from here.\n\nBest of luck friend",

      "body": "Hey friend. Very proud you\u2019ve come this far! When I started eating again I ended up getting pancreatitis from the influx of food and fats. My stomach pain was unbearable all the time and still can be. I get bloated still but not as bad. I would try and take align in the morning and see if it helps. I guess it\u2019s one of the best probiotics for gut issues that eating disorders can cause (I\u2019m not a doc though). Maybe keep a food diary and track what makes it worse. Veggies can set me off very badly so I need to be careful when I eat them. \n\nTry getting a carb fat and protein in with each meal/ snack to help with digestion (I know this can be hard to do especially with a history of eating disorders).\n\nHow long have you been eating more? You are probably retaining a lot of water and your body is hanging onto your sodium for dear life (creating more water retention). Are your feet or legs swollen? Keep up the water intake and keep up your salt intake as well. Eventually your body will flush everything out when it realizes you aren\u2019t restricting/ throwing up etc.\n\nYou could also try adding an electrolyte drink to your day. Some Gatorade can be full of sugar but I usually drink something called EAAs that you can get at most supplement stores. It is usually calorie free but just contains a lot of the essential amino acids we deplete out of our system during the day or when not eating the best.\n\nAs for the pain everywhere, ive had a few med professionals and non professionals chime in on this as I\u2019ve dealt with this too. Eating disorders cause mass chaos in your body and it\u2019s hard for the body to maintain homeostasis, be happy, and not be in a constant state of worry basically. It\u2019s always stressed about when it\u2019ll get food, how much, if we will throw it up etc. when we start in recovery it can cause a mass inflammation through your body as it\u2019s trying to regain some \u201ccomposure\u201d and that homeostasis. I am a nurse so I do have some med background but I\u2019m not an eating disorder expert at all. This makes sense to me as I was usually sore and tired during the peak of my ED but when I first started my recovery it got quite bad. Your body needs a lot of time to heal, our bodies our amazing but I think ED\u2019s cause them to go into a constantly stressed state. \n\nSorry that was very long lol. I hope something I said helped. Again, huge huge congrats on coming so far \u2764\ufe0f",
