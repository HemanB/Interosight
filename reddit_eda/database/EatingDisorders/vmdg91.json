  "selftext": "I\u2019m at a normal and \u201chealthy weight\u201d for my age and height, my E.D (anorexia) started when I was slightly overweight. I\u2019m in a partial hospital and there telling me I need to weight restore, I know the doctors know best but I just don\u2019t understand, why? It\u2019s hard for me to fully commit if I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m doing it. honestly any advice would be appreciated! (Btw it\u2019s not body dysmorphia I\u2019ve a got a normal bmi and stuff).

They are the experts and should be able to explain their reasoning to you.\nYou may find that set point theory is helpful in understanding this as well. Basically, your body has a \u201cset point\u201d of weight that it will settle into when you are consistently nourishing yourself adequately. The set point is often a range of like 5-10 pounds. The idea is, your weight will self regulate. Your ED was restrictive, so you can expect your set point to be higher than your current weight. Additionally, restriction is thought to drive the set point up higher. Ultimately, dismantling your fatphobia and self hatred is the most important thing to self acceptance, but even within those beliefs, recognize that denying yourself nourishment will make your natural body size bigger so it goes against the eating disorder goals anyway.",

It's more like \"settling-point\" theory. The body will \"settle\" at a weight once it's there for a few years, regardless of if that weight is healthy for the individual. \n\nUnfortunately, many people in the ED recovery space don't consider settling points and look at set points instead. A lot of treatment centres have begun to normalize binge eating in the name of weight restoration for patients. \n\nIf you can, find a treatment program that focuses on developing a healthy relationship with food rather than weight restoration. You shouldn't have to accept a weight that isn't healthy for you. If you must stay in treatment, then play along while you're there and begin working with a different team (if you can) as soon as you get out.

I have no idea if my personal neutral falls in the BMI scale and I don\u2019t care. It\u2019s the weight I am when I\u2019m feeding and fueling my body in the way it needs. \n\nDon\u2019t focus on the scale!

Now, I truly feel happier and healthier than ever and I wish I had made this shift earlier in my life. I can\u2019t believe I valued my weight over my happiness, my weight over my motivation, my weight over my intelligence, my weight over my energy, my weight over everything!

I probably should\u2019ve prefaced better thatI\u2019m not arguing that the classification is the issue, by bmi terms we know what they mean but in terms of actual health there\u2019s nothing \u201chealthy\u201d about a weight that involves starving. Plenty of research supports the idea of a less objective measure of weight health and that subjective or metabolic measures could indicate someone\u2019s underweight in terms of health[(Golubnitschaja et. al, 2021 is just one example I\u2019d love to find more if I weren\u2019t annoying haha)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8368050/). Idk I just think clearly if you\u2019re a bmi of X but it took doing damage to your body to get/maintain it then clearly that\u2019s underweight for you. Like regardless of bmi if you are starving you\u2019re probably in some form of energy deficit",
