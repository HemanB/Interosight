  "selftext": "So my wife 38f is struggling with binge eating and has done so for as long as she remembers.\n\nFor 10 years now I have stood by her side trying to help and support her many diets and plans but since lockdown i have been home all day with her, watching her binge (she trys to hide it).\n\nShe is massively over eating and her weight is ballooning, she will prepare her dinner for example and eat quiches, toast and crisps whilst her huge plate of food is cooking.. 3x a day with no excerise.\n\n I'm scared as a pre diabetic her readings are getting worse, she's always tired, lacks excercise and motivation.\n\nI can't say anything to her else she crys and won't talk to me for days, she has depression and being treated with setraline.\n\nPlease help me how can I support her I'm losing my strength to do so, her binging is killing her slowly her health is nose diving, I'm struggling with watching her abuse herself  and the food is costing a lot of money.\n\nI can't leave her, I love her, we have 2 young kids and a home together she is amazing but the binge .. We and I need help.\n\nThanks.",

      "body": "A lot of people struggling with binge eating also struggle with restrictive eating. From what it sounds like, she has a history of dieting. She could start by seeing an eating disorder dietitian and an eating disorder therapist virtually, I want to emphasize the specialty as some providers who do not specifically work with eating disorders may worsen the problem. \n\nFood restriction creates food interest which can turn to food obsession. She can be binging to numb out from emotions as well, but if we address the restrictive dieting piece the binging tends to improve. She should eat every 2-3 hours, including carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Psychologically, when we know we are able to be fed as often we need to be, and get to include all foods, they start to feel less alluring over time. If you knew you could have cake every day for the next month without shame or guilt, cake on day 30 would just be cake, whereas on day 1 it is more of a commodity that we are not supposed to be enjoying or have to feel guilty about, which is not helpful. Guilt and shame are really big emotions that can make someone struggling with binging actually binge more.",

If its yes then therapy can be very helpful to get behind the feelings causing her to binge. You could take over the cooking and eat meals together, buy her a nice diary to journal feelings (extra bonus if it comes with stickers), try and get fit together by taking dance classes or a martial arts.",

      "body": "Binge eating is known to come out when a person is seeking comfort and control - in a quarantine/lockdown, everyone is additionally stressed, panicked and paranoid, often times making their coping mechanisms (although unhealthy) worse. Binge eating is also scientifically part of a vicious cycle known as the binge-restrict cycle. A person's brain is wired as if we are all still cavemen; food, shelter, survival. When someone begins restricting their intake in order to lose weight, our brains don't necessarily recognize this as \"a move to be healthy\" and instead sees it as a lack of food (one of the keys to remaining alive) and then when it comes in contact with the availability of food (especially under extremely stressful circumstances) it binges, thinking it needs to store the extra calories (also known to your brain as energy) for later use just in case it doesn't have access to food.\n\nUltimately, your wife probably needs to undergo therapy - alot of eating disorders, especially those that are binge related, stem from traumas that she may or may not be conscious of. Right now she probably feels ashamed, uncomfortable, out of control and so terrified of not only losing herself but also you. One thing I want you to try and remember is that when these binges are happening, your wife feels completely out of control. A few things that have helped others in my past include: grounding exercises when she feels like she's about to binge (this can be anything from taking deep breaths and trying to be more mindful of her surroundings to talking to someone about how she's feeling at the moment), keeping a journal of her feelings and emotions and trying to find triggers, to simply going for a walk or trying to do something nice for herself (bubble bath? painting her nails? watching her favorite shows or playing her favorite board games?). Her health is absolutely a priority, but her mental health needs to be taken into consideration as well :) After a binge, try to encourage her to drink plenty of water (it helps flush a person's system and get rid of excess chemicals), and try some light exercises (walking, yoga, stretching) to keep her endocrine system moving. \n\nFinally, take care of yourself too! Her eating disorder can take a toll on you more than you could ever realize; watch your feelings and thoughts and take some self care time for you as well. Reaching out is always the best option in times like these and I wish you both the best!",

I had a lot of control issues due to other abuse going on in my life. Once I learned my self worth was not tied to my image and simultaneously started being more social and had more hobbies in my life, I started to regain control. And I learned to enjoy food as a source of fuel for other fun activities.

Like, now I think about food when I'm hungry, or sometimes I'll feel a little bit snacky, but it's no big deal. I don't restrict and I don't binge. I really can't recommend it enough. Also, I'm a therapist now and recommend this book to clients all the time. My own therapist recommended it to everyone when I was in ED treatment when I was a teenager. I didn't read it at the time, and I really wish I had.",

I'm now 5 months on keto and I've lost almost 20kgs so far, I finally feel like I have control around food and although it's still hard and I'm still struggling I can't imagine going back to binge eating ever again. \nIn terms of her, I think she needs to come to a decision herself to stop.

If she hasn't already, you should have an honest talk with her about it, and make her understand her condition.\n\nHowever, if she is willing to overcome her ED, you being at home with her is a great opportunity. She needs your support, mentally, emotionally and for practical problems. \n\nFirst, every food she could eat in a \"binge episode\" must disappear from the house. I'm talking about snacks, but also bread, ice cream, cheese, frozen foods like pizza. Make it so that every food in you house has to be cooked to be eaten. In this way, it will take more time to start eating and she will have enough time to realize what she is about to do and to stop.\nThis does not mean that you have to stop eating some food, this is not a weight loss diet, just that if you want an ice cream you will have to go to a shop.\n\nSecond, you could help her dominate her impulse on eating. Every time she feels like eating something she need to distract herself. She could make a phone call, chat with you, go out for a walk, dance with you in your livingroom... any activity is allowed, as long as it is not something passive, like watching TV.\n\nLast, but most important, she should start having therapy sessions. Overcoming an ED is like overcoming any other illness, she needs qualified help. \n\nGood luck to both of you, and forgive my (many) mistakes with english",

It sounds like she has a lot of shame around eating and her behavior.  If she could have stopped by now she would have.  \n\nCurious Supportive Questions: \n\n* \"I see you're hurting - How can I best support you?\"\n* \"I love you and want to support you, what would be helpful to you?\"\n* \"I was thinking of going on a walk with the kids, would you like to join us?\"\n\nAs the above commenter mentioned it is important she takes ownership of her own health and healing.  If online therapy isn't an option there are excellent books/podcasts/youtube videos on letting go of binging behaviors.  The resources are out there if she wants them.\n\nDeveloping skills to manage mood/anxiety and slowing down prior to binging (even if it's a brief pause) is crucial.  She has been in this cycle for a long time and will need to take it day by day (and at times moment by moment).\n\nIn agreement with the other replies, this work is for her to do.  She needs to want it and commit to it.  She's lucky to have you in her corner but ultimately she's the one in the ring.  \n\nBe kind to yourself during this process, it's hard to see a loved one hurt themselves.",
