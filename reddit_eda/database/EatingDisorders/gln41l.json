      "body": "I have been there, trust me!! It\u2019s so hard when you are trying to lose weight for whatever reason... especially because there is such an unhealthy and unrelenting diet culture in our society. \n\nBut PLEASE try to remember that starving yourself IS NOT healthy and will not bring you the validation you are looking for. I know it is hard, but try to think about the food you eat as fuel for your body and soul. Your body needs fuel from greens, lean proteins, veggies, carbs and fats! But your SOUL needs fuel from late night cookies with friends, a slice of cake from celebrations and lots of pizza! You are depriving yourself of so much more than just calories when you don\u2019t eat. \n\nI also definitely recommend talking to a therapist if you feel that you can\u2019t deal with this alone (which most people can\u2019t!!) Therapy is one of the greatest tools we have and I am a HUGE advocate for it. \n\nYou got this... you are SO beautiful",

      "body": "An abusive voice in your head is exactly what an eating disorder is. I liked to think of it that there were my thoughts then there were my eating disorder thoughts that were like an annoying roommate (but an abusive parent works too). \n\nIt\u2019s good you already recognize your ED thoughts. This took me a while into recovery. My advice is when the thoughts come, think of of them like that. Don\u2019t try to push them out (because the more you try to push them out in my experience the more they came back) but recognize that\u2019s the abusive roommate or boyfriend talking to you. \n\nListen to yourself. The side of you that wants to be healthy and treat your body right. From your question it\u2019s obvious you have that voice in you too. We are only given one body. Treat it right. I know easier said than done, but I think I can speak for everyone on this thread when I say we believe in you \u2764\ufe0f you deserve food \u2764\ufe0f",
