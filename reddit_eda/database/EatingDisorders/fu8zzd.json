  "selftext": "I\u2019m trying to figure out why my relationship to food is so complicated. I think the most uncommon ED, Orthorexia, describes my eating habits the best, but within this I go through bingeing episodes, sometimes purging too, and then other times I\u2019m very controlled and averse to food, more similar to anorexia. I\u2019m trying to make sense of it all - anyone else heard of something similar?",

It's also the part that makes them hell to recover from. If you can manage to talk to a therapist, or even your physician about it, I highly recommend it. But the fact that you recognize that you don't belong to just one type of the disorder is a step in the right direction!",

If you go to get diagnosed, and your BMI is below a standard number for individuals with anorexia, it is likely you would be diagnosed with AN, even if you have symptoms of orthorexia or bulimia.",
