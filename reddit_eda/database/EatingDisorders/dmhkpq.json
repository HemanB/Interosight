  "selftext": "Hi everyone, I\u2019ll make it short: I often feel like I\u2019m faking my eating disorder and this thought is making me feel like an horrible person. I also have BPD and other issues, I talked to my therapist about this matter but she always reassure me saying that my problems are real. But there are some periods in which I\u2019m not obsessed with food, I do not restrict nor I care about the calories or everything else I\u2019d think/do normally. I always alternate periods of obsession and IDGAF. What does that mean? Omg I feel absolutely terrible when I\u2019m able to eat like a normal person and then thinking \u201cI actually have an ED\u201d because it feels so...fake? So I don\u2019t know, anyone else feels like this? It would be so encouraging knowing that I\u2019m not alone.",

I wonder sometimes why my brain is so intent on hurting me. \nBut I also am always wondering 'am I doing this for attention? Am I just pretending?'\n\n....and that all sounds absolutely insane.
