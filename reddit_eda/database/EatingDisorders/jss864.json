  "selftext": "Hi mods, i hope this question is ok for the group:\n\nhi lovely people! so i'm in partial remission from anorexia b/p and but am still relatively underweight. i'm at the stage where i'm not really actively trying to lose weight and am hoping to gain some muscle and just weight in general. my main anxiety however is weight gain around my torso, is this a normal thing? will it eventually even out after i reach a certain weight? any advice would be much appreciated \ud83d\udc97",

It really helped for me to not overthink things and not look too far into the future outcome. That just made me more anxious and less inclined to truly work on improvement. I will say that yes it is normal for weight gain around your torso, but it is necessary for your body to want to protect your organs since they are most important. Chances are throughout time your body will redistribute the weight more evenly, you just have to trust the process. Just don\u2019t worry about it too much and trust your body, it will do what\u2019s best for you \ud83d\udc95",

For me I was very worried at first about gaining weight and definitely did around my stomach and lower abdomen, but it definitely distributed over time so if you are worried definitely don\u2019t, I know that\u2019s easy to say, but after being recovered I feel so much better. and I wish you well \ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97",
