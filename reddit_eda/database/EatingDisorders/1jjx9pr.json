  "title": "My dad has developed an eating disorder. It's triggering me, and I'm worried about my child. What do I do?",
  "selftext": "TW for rapid weight loss, dieting, and really everything else\n\nSo I should probably start with some backstory. Growing up, my dad was always morbidly obese to the point of having mobility and health issues. In 2016, he got gastric bypass surgery, and lost 3/4 of his bodyweight. Now, he's hovering around a normal-to-underweight BMI, and has been for the past 4 years or so. Great. But, he's constantly talking about food, calories, exercise, etc. I've also struggled with eating disorders growing up, and I'm recognizing some of the same patterns that I've had. Conversations always come back to how he \"just can't get under [goal weight]\" or how he's going on a new diet (usually a fully liquid diet) because he's afraid of \"his clothes feeling tight\" again. He'll comment on other people's bodies and fatshame them. Me and my brother, especially. We've kind of put up with it for years, because with him having such a rapid weight loss, our childhoods revolved around weight and food talk. \n\nBut it's gotten astronomically worse since I had my son 6 months ago. He'll cry when he's hungry (obviously. He's a baby.) or show excitement when I offer him a bottle, and my dad will say things like \"you better break him of that. Food is fuel he doesn't need to be so excited about it.\" Or he'll tell me not to feed him fruit purees because he'll get addicted to the sugar. Or he'll talk about how we need to make sure he spends most of his time active and outside so he doesn't get fat. He'll even comment on how he's glad I have a \"skinny baby.\" (MASSIVE EYE ROLL.) Every time I visit him or he visits me, mine and my baby's bodies are the topic of conversation, and I'm getting, honestly, pissed off about it. I've tried talking to him about it, and his mindset is just that anything is better than being fat. Even a heavily unhealthy relationship with diet and exercise. I know that my kid doesn't understand what he's saying now, but what happens when he does? I don't want him to develop an unhealthy relationship with food like, before he even has a chance, you know?  I don't know what to do. I know that when I'm relapsing, someone telling me I need help just makes me worse. I love my dad and I don't want to just cut him off, but this has got to stop. For both me and my child. ",

I've found it helpful in thinking about how to feed my children in a way that will hopefully encourage them to have a healthy relationship with food.",

Keep feeding your baby all the right foods and nutrients, restricting food from literal birth will only make him want it more. Otherwise your baby could be at risk. also, talk to your dad about how your not comfortable with these type of conversations right now. establish boundaries before its too late",
