  "selftext": "I've gained a lot of weight recently due to \"recovering\" as I'll call it. To be completely honest, I don't forsee this lasting very long. I only started this because I got so freaking sick of him complaining and saying that I couldn't hold conversations very well and only ever wanted to talk about food. Maybe I did it out of a \"this will show him\" kind of thing, because theres no way he wants to date someone overweight (or average weight, whatever, same thing). He has this friend who is really physically ill. Her doctors don't know what she has but she can barely eat anything at all and it shows... he recently sent me a whole bunch of photos from him in high school and once I saw her in one my heart sank to my stomach. I'm not sure why my brain tells me that he wants to be with her BECAUSE she's so deathly thin and now.. well, I'm just average. I don't want to do this to myself anymore. My ED brain wants me to look \"worse\" than she does.\n\npls give me advice. i just need a freaking hug.",

      "body": "Sending the most heartfelt hug your way \u2665\ufe0f I can imagine it would be really hard trying to pursue recovery when your partner is critical of people who weigh more, whether he\u2019s outright saying it or that is what you are perceiving from him. Have you tried talking to him about your concerns about how being able to pursue health and happiness feels really hard when you feel like he views any weight gain as negative? If you can\u2019t have that conversation (combined with his hypercritical-ness), then I\u2019d really recommend asking yourself if this is the right relationship for you and your wellbeing. There are sooo many other people out there who would genuinely care about your wellbeing and want you to pursue recovery to heal (and literally save your life), despite what weight changes as a result of doing that hard work. Choosing to not address it and staying in the relationship is absolutely throwing gas on a fire when it comes to recovery. You deserve someone who will like you because of who you are, not just because your weight is super low.",
