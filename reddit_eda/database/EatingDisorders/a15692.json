  "selftext": "She's 15 and she just asked for a fitbit for her birthday. She's been skipping every single breakfast and almost never eats her lunch that I give her, and when she eats dinner, she only takes about 1/2 or 1/4 of what the rest of the family takes. The thing is, when everyone is in their rooms at night, I can hear her sneak into the kitchen and get food. I guess, Im confused and worried... Also, she's been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, the last thing we need is for her to have an eating disorder as well. ",

Help her develop a healthy relationship with food.\n\n Edit: I keep seeing people immediately say take her to doctors and therapists. For someone with an eating disorder acknowledging that you know and making her go over it with other people as well can be mentally very traumatic and humiliating. I really suggest speaking with her as her mother first before doing that immeadiately. With things like this having her trust is so important. That she feels safe talking to you is so important. Do not violate that trust. Talk to her as her parent first then seek professional help but do it with her. Involve her in her healing process make her want to get better for herself. ",

Around this age me and a lot of my friends were not hungry at the usual times and were hungry at different times, just like teens tend to have changing sleeping schedules. I was staying up later and eating later. Then I wasn't hungry for breakfast and the cycle continued.\n\nOther things to think about are depression and anxiety can take a toll on feelings of hunger. My anxiety used to make my tummy hurt so much I didn't know if I was hungry or not. Then, with anxiety I've also experienced feeling like everyone would judge what I ate or how I chewed or literally anything I did which can make it hard to eat in front of people but not necessarily an eating disorder (although the same feelings can be a warning sign). And many mental health medications (and other medication) can also affect hunger - either drastically reducing or increasing or shifting when the hunger cues come.\n\nThen there's also the possibility of a fad diet that are so popular these days, including fasting during certain times of the day, only eating certain foods, etc. This, in my opinion, is disordered eating but not inherently an eating disorder. These \"diets\" are increasingly targeted at younger and younger people. Once again, these diets can be a warning sign but I also know people who did them for a while in middle or high school and never again. \n\nI'm saying all of this just to say there's no need to panic (yet). Many of these things you could bring up or might be best to be spoken about with a professional. For example, if it's the internal clock that's off maybe try to have a meal ready for the times when she's hungry. If it's medication, finding a new one or some other way to help regulate appetite. If it's a fad diet, really showing how they don't work and are unhealthy emphasizing intuitive eating. I hope after you read through these responses you'll find a way to talk to her and help both of y'all. \n\nRegardless of what is going on with your daughter, she's very lucky to have someone like you who cares and pays attention. I just want to say that even if you don't have answers and don't know what to do, you care and that's honestly a lot. ",

      "body": "You may have seen my comments in reply to another commenter on here. \n\nEating disorders are not so much about food as they are about control. Being a teenager, and a girl, and having anxiety and depression essentially means you have no outlet \u2014 your life is regulated by your parents, by school, and by the media/boys/other girls telling you what you should look like. It\u2019s scary and sad and intimidating. Sometimes these things manifest themselves into eating disorders, as food is really the only thing we can control at that age. \n\nIt sounds like she has definitely developed disordered eating. Skipping meals, reduced portion sizes, and eating in secret all point to that, on top of her already struggling with mental illness. \n\nI was your daughter and this is exactly how my EDs developed, around the same age as her as well. That was over 10 years ago and I\u2019m still struggling with it. It is no joke. The most important thing is to not comment on her weight \u2014 saying she looks too skinny gives us this kind of sick satisfaction and saying the opposite would only cause her to restrict more if that is in fact what she\u2019s doing. If she\u2019s not already in therapy, I\u2019d advise you to schedule that immediately with someone that specializes in adolescences who have eating disorders and anxiety/depression. Raise these concerns to them so they can address them in session with her. \n\nI\u2019m also not sure how the two of y\u2019all\u2019s relationship works so I\u2019m not sure about how confronting her on this would work. If anything, she would learn to hide it better from you because know she knows you know, if that makes sense. But I\u2019m not really sure how to broach this since my ed was caused and pretty much encouraged (long, complicated story) by my family. At the same time, I was incredibly hurt my parents never noticed I had developed an actual eating disorder and this made me feel worthless, so expressing your concern is also important. In fact, my ED just flared up again and only my uncle, whom I spend almost no time around, noticed and commented on it. But, in order to talk to your daughter you\u2019re going to have to do so the right way so that it\u2019s not misconstrued or ignored is vital, and I think it would be best for you to consult a professional on this to figure out the best way.

Jump on this while you can\u2014she might be pissed but you need to do it.\n\nEDIT: one more thing \u2014\u00a0take her to a dentist if you can!! Bulimia is not the only ED that ruins teeth. I've had to get ten (? approx) fillings in the past two-three years presumably because of bad nutrition earlier in my life, and that shit is expensive. Got some prescription toothpaste that is helping a lot, but the sooner you get on this the better, before you end up dropping 2000$ on tooth repair.",

Also if you\u2019re not drinking enough water. My teeth used to hurt all the time \u2014 especially my molars when I would bite on anything or drink something too hot or cold. The bleeding part could be from anemia. You should see a therapist and a dentist, but I know that recovering from an ED is a very big step and hugely difficult (and totally worth it) so when you\u2019re in the early stages it might be good to find a multivitamin with iron and your B vitamins.",

I was in recovery for a long time and I started out a lot like OP\u2019s daughter. But now my ed has been triggered again and I just, it feels so much harder than last time. \n\nI have some vitamins which I keep meaning to take because a lot of my levels have been low last time I got a blood test so thank you for the reminder. \n\nI also wanted to ask, did you ever experience a really stiff neck? My head just feels like it weighs too much for my body all of the sudden? Is that a thing? ",

Recovery is just doing sucky things that feel unnatural and hard and then feeling bad about them and then doing more of them and then one day they start feeling less bad. I\u2019m still working on it too and it\u2019s really hard.\n\nYeah about the stiff neck \u2014 I would get a lot of body aches. I think a lot of it is just being undernourished and tired and a bit out of it. Get plenty of sleep and water and FOOD and it\u2019ll probably feel better. Maybe see if you can switch pillows?
