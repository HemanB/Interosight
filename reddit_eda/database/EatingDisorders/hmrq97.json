  "selftext": " \n\ni\u2019m 20f and i have been  binging, purging, and restricting for a few months. i\u2019m terrified of  gaining back the weight i\u2019ve lost after being overweight for several  years, but sometimes i cannot control how much i eat, and the next day  i\u2019m so full i have to throw up. i also have a lot of medical issues that  have led to me gaining weight and being in a lot of physical pain, and  it\u2019s easy to look to food for comfort. my mom and therapist have both  suggested inpatient treatment because i have panic attacks thinking of  food sometimes. i do not want to go to inpatient treatment. i haven\u2019t  been since i was a minor and i\u2019m scared of being in a unit with adults,  and i don\u2019t want to be away from my life. i really don\u2019t know how to  help myself, because i don\u2019t want the help i\u2019m being offered. i know  that i\u2019m not doing well but i think my desire to continue losing weight  is too strong.",

I used to work for a clinic where the patients would spend the day at the clinic and then go home in the evenings to be with family and sleep in their own bed. I don't know the severity of your ED but maybe outpatient treatment could be part of your care plan!\n\nI have done inpatient treatment before and it was definitely scary but it was the best thing I've ever done for myself. It really jumpstarted my recovery.",
