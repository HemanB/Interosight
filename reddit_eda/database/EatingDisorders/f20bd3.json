  "selftext": "This is my first time posting so I might not be good with format. \n\n\nI've had problems with eating throughout my teens, I'm 20 now and It's gotten worse. \nEarlier I used to consume and \"purge\"(?) but now I just keep eating and eating.\n\nIt's 3 am right now and I've just eaten so much that my stomach hurts and feels like it's going to explode and I just keep eating. The physical pain is making me sick but I can't throw up so I'm just laying here. \n\nI don't know what to do and would really appreciate help or advice.\nI can't go to therapy because my family doesn't think mental health is a thing and online therapy only intimidates me so I end up dropping it.",

But by not going for help I fell deeper and deeper into misery and illness.  \n\nGood thing is you are an adult and you have a legal right to privacy.  Your family only gets to know what you decide to tell them. \n\nYou can start off by going in to your doctor's for a check up.  In that meeting you can tell the doctor all about your medical and privacy concerns. Doc will be able to explain and help you find the right resources.\n\nI am so happy that you reached out for help. You don't have to live alone with this anymore.  Positive vibes to you.",

      "body": "Free resources post: \n\nPlease start by exploring your options for professional help. Professional help is usually the ideal, but not always feasible due to financial reasons. However if online therapy is an option, I'd invite you to consider, is it possible for you to try something even if it feels intimidating? Have you ever done something intimidating before and felt accomplished afterwards? \n\nThere are a few good free resources you can use alongside therapy that can help you kick the behavior for good. \n\nOne of your free options to augment your support and accountability in any case is SMART Recovery, an international non-profit that offers evidence-based peer support education on the self-management of addictive behaviors including binge eating. I am a volunteer facilitator (never a paid position) for SMART and would love to \"see\" you on my Wednesday night online meeting from 7-9PM CST with msandoval at www.smartrecovery.org. If my style doesn't click there are over 40 other online meetings each week. It's about finding a good fit for you.\n\nCheck out The FREE Unofficial SMART Recovery Handbook for Disordered Eating, a grassroots project we are working on to make SMART more accessible for people with eating disorders: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vPk9JbgWrGCL4LbjAmVbVW-g2fD5DFBP_P-8ov2F4sY/edit?usp=sharing\n\nYouTube motivation, meditation, and education on ED recovery: https://youtu.be/2iwOKjwCt4A\n\nI'd love to see you on our private, recovery-focused Facebook group at www.facebook.com/groups/rec0veryistheway where we post guided meditations, books, and articles about the process of recovery. \n\nOther free options include 12-step and Recovery Dharma although I do not know as much about those communities as I do SMART. Take care and I hope you find the support you need. Recovery is possible.",

      "body": "You are on the right path showing awareness and honesty!\n\nI don't know if you would feel too uncomfortable but there's free support groups. Some are 12 step based (like AA). And some have a different structure or no structure.\n\nThe main 12 step food/exercise/purging related groups are Over Eater's Anonymous and Eating Disorder's Anonymous. There are mental health/broad subject groups like Duel Recovery Anonymous. I wouldn't be surprised if there are more options if you're in or a close to a city. There's N.A.M.I. which is a mental health support group that has a level of structure but it's not a 12 step group. \n\nAsking a doctor, online search, and asking the local health department, may give you some info on all that.\n\nAnother thing too, sometimes due to scheduling or location, people make due with a group that may not be the specialized on thier looking for support in BUT 12 steps are 12 steps regardless. Mental issues and addiction are the same at the core regardless. So if you can only get to something like a.a. (the most popular), it can do you some good. You will even find people who attend that have other issues (like binge eating)  that you can talk to. These groups are to help us go deep behind the addictions to heal from underneath. So, even though over eaters anonymous may have stories and words in the book about alcohol for example, they both go over what drives people underneath. \n\nMy main group is n.a. but because it's not available to me often, I attend aa a lot. Also, since I can't get to the eating disorder group yet and there are no groups specifically for things like self harm (cutting, burning, etc) I attend what I can and am able to find people I connect with and the literature still applies to me for the most part. \n\nKeep in mind though, if the group is labeled as a \"closed group\" on the pamphlet or online, you can't bring children or family that aren't in the same boat and you can't attend aa for example if it's a closed group and you have no desire to stop drinking. \n\nAnother thing too, be careful. There are intentional predators who attend these. And then intentional codependency relations can arise. \nA room full of people sharing some very vulnerable stuff... so can imagine how some people use that to read people and take advantage. \n\nIt is worth talking to a doctor at least. And it's a very rare disorder but there's a disorder where a person legit is hungry all the time. Even to the point to eat garbage or rocks... it's faulty signalling in the brain that is incurable. Pray you don't have that! But an addiction is lifelong anyways. So shake hands with yourself and tell yourself you're in this for the long haul! \n\nNutrition wise, from what I've gathered personally, in terms of satiety, eating in a way that supports stable blood sugar helps curb physical blood sugar related extreme hunger. So I don't know if that's something you can look into as well. \nWhen someone eats something that spikes blood sugar, once they crash, hunger occurs soon again and one will even get dizzy if they don't feed themselves soon. \n\nPlease please don't give up!",
