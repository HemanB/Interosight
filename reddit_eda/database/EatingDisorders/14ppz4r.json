  "selftext": "Quick tw. Also I think this is allowed but if it isn't I urge the mods to keep this up as I feel it is important info for people who are out there recovering right now. \n\nJust wanted to say to everyone on here who uses tiktok, please be careful. Unfortunately with the nature of the app itself it can be incredibly easy for you to stumble across something you shouldn't have to see. \n\nI kept getting lives from a girl who I won't name but I'm sure many of you know who I'm talking about. That was the first instance for me. I blocked her account and so far haven't seen anything. \n\nThen i find a video with thousands of likes on my fyp that is a meme of said girl and so many people in the comments are bragging about their disorder, and actively encouraging others to do the same. \n\nIt's just frustrating because it seems the more I act disinterested in this kind of content the more the algorithm wants to shove it in my face. \n\nAm I the only one who's been seeing this kind of content lately? Why is it that there are people out there who just seem to want to make it harder for us?\n\nAgain, please be careful if you use tiktok. Be safe out there and I hope you all are having a good day",
