  "selftext": "My husband is 6 weeks into ED treatment and I am very very proud of him. When he first started eating he had painful gas and was tooting a LOT. It was explained that his digestive system was essentially\u201cwaking up\u201d. Not only is it uncomfortable, it\u2019s also embarrassing. It seemed to level off for a while and has now come back full force. He\u2019s having intense flatulence all night long. Is it normal for it to ebb and flow like that? Is it possible it\u2019s related to his dietician gradually bumping up his intake? If so, will it kind of reset every time they bump up his intake? ",
