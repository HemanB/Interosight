  "selftext": "As stupid as this question may sound, I genuinely cannot stand it when my stomach,  or my hips touches a Seatbelt or my back touching the seat of a car, even when I'm laying down I'm so painfully aware of the fat on my hips & arms, i cant stand to look at them. alot of my weight goes straight to my hips/thighs & my arms. I hate feeling this way, and I've never opened up about it, and I hope I'm not alone on this ",
