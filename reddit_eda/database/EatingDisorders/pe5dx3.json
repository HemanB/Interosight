  "selftext": " \n\nToday, my mom and I went to get dinner, and the calorie count for an item was in big, bold letters. I compared calories to something else, reflexively, and I instantly felt guilty about what I was going to be eating. I couldn\u2019t finish my dinner and got anxious about it.\n\nMy question, is whether anyone else can relate or has any wisdom to share about it.",
