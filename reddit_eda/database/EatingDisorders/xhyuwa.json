  "title": "Is there a way to tell my girlfriend she\u2019s beautiful without triggering her ED?",
  "selftext": "As the title suggests I always want to tell my girlfriend she\u2019s beautiful. I want to raise her self esteem and make her feel good about herself. But I\u2019m aware that talking about looks can be a trigger and it could even be encouraging her bulimia. \n\nShe may think that me calling her beautiful is because of her ED. Like it\u2019s helping her look good. I really don\u2019t want to enable that and she needs to gain some weight. But I feel like if I tell her she looks good she\u2019ll take it as a sign that she doesn\u2019t need to change her habits. I really love her and just want her to be happy and healthy. But I\u2019m scared of complimenting her.\n\nIs there a good way to boost her confidence while still encouraging her to keep eating? Or should I just refrain from saying anything about looks at all?",

I think what \u201cnormal\u201d people feel when they\u2019re complimented is the same feeling I get when my partner looks at me with adoration. You can tell when someone\u2019s eyes are saying \u201cI love you,\u201d it\u2019s like a long, content, gentle smile, \u201cI could stare at you for the rest of my life and everything would be okay\u201d moment.\n\nComplimenting her and having her be receptive to it would probably feel good for you, but maybe it\u2019s not her language per say. There are many other ways to make her feel beautiful and special. As far as avoiding triggers, there\u2019s only so much you can do, so don\u2019t beat yourself up too much if you accidentally say or do the wrong things. Intentions matter too. Your best is enough",

Tell her what you said here you want to encourage her and compliment her but don't want to trigger her so what would be the best way to do that.  Being open and honest can go far.   You could also say nice things about her without talking about her looks. Foe example when she had a great idea or solution to a problem, says sometign funny. you could say you are so creative , amazing, brilliant, funny  ext.  Or say I just love your smile, laugh , when you hug me like that.",
