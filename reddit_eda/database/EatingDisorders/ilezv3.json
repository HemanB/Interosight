  "selftext": "So to put in perspective I\u2019ve been on and off my eating disorder. I have a sister and she\u2019s always been so tiny compared to me and she knows this. It has been a year i was \u201cclean\u201d until today. We were out for lunch and i ordered the smallest size soup. She was telling me and my mom some chunky blonde girl in her sons class reminded her of me, and her son told her it was the chunky girls birthday and she made the comment to him \u201coh so it\u2019s Maddies birthday\u201d (I\u2019m Maddie.) it made me feel sick to my stomach that not only did she call me fat, but made jokes about it with my nephew. I don\u2019t want them to think of me like that. I immediately went to the bathroom to purge the little soup i had.  What would your advice be? Would you have said something back? :/ she makes comments like these all the time but this one was really bad.",

But you need to take responsibility for what you\u2019ve done. In recovery, you hit a ton of road blocks as I\u2019m sure you understand from the long year of not purging. This comment just hit different and you coped with it destructively. Rarely do other people \u201cmake you\u201d relapse. They can trigger you to take action, but that\u2019s on you when you do that. I\u2019m not saying that it was uncalled for, or makes you bad. But you need to own your actions. You already owned up to admitting you did it. Now you need to find the balance where you can get a hurtful comment and not relapse.",

I'd also say that maybe some perspective change can help you as well. Know that you and your sister are completely different people. There is only one you in the whole world and its not your job to be thin. In the end, everyone just wants to be happy in their life and being thin won't guarantee happiness. I wish I had better advice I can give you but I hope you the best in recovering and growing as a person. \ud83d\udc9a",

Tell her that you need to take a break from your relationship because she makes you feel bad about your weight. She might deny it but I think she is probably very aware of what she is doing",
