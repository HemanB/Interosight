  "title": "I'm getting food anxiety around my girlfriend",
  "selftext": "I haven't eaten since breakfast with my girlfriend, plus a snack and ice cream. I've been in anorexia recovery for 10 months, June 20th marking my 1 year full recovery.\n\nI relapsed hard during lockdown in my area, but have been recovering. But recovering alone. So eating around people is new for me, and being the only one eating around people is especially challenging. \n\nShe's insisting I have dinner at her house since I've stopped by for a sleepover. Thing is, she's eating lunch an hour ago while out for her mother. My anxiety is already peeking, I want to hit my head with my hands and start crying at the thought of eating in front of her. I know she won't judge me for eating, I'm in a safe place, but this is too overwhelming to think about. \n\nOn the other hand, it's been 10 months. 10 months of recovery, and it's time I do something challenging. I don't think I can bring myself to it though. I just don't know what to do. Does anyone have any possible advice for this type of challenge? Any help would be appreciated, thank you",

Or do something like watch a movie or play a game for the first time(s) eating together to ease yourself into it? I know the goal is eventually to eat face to face and do nothing but it's ok to take it a little bit slow sometimes. Just remember that she loves you and wants you to be happy and safe, the most enjoyable dinner together for her is going to be the one where you're as happy, relaxed, and comfortable as you can be.",

The pandemic (this may not be entirely true for you, but it could be) increased anxiety levels for a lot of people in a lot of areas, surrounding a lot of things.

All of this is big and new and hard! It\u2019s ok that there\u2019s struggle. Remember that healing and recovery isn\u2019t linear, OP! I would say have a frank conversation with your partner. If they don\u2019t have an understanding of your disorder yet, they need to develop some as your partner. Logistically, I mean, for the relationship to be mutually benefitting. Talk with them and say look, there\u2019s not much rhyme or reason, but some days I can\u2019t eat well. I just can\u2019t do it. Explain how you feel and tell them that you\u2019re not trying to be rude or unkind or to opt out of a date or social engagement. And that on these days you\u2019re happy to just be with them and have quality time together.",

      "body": "Hi! I procrastinated eating until 10 pm. while baking, I told her I'd make mac and cheese for myself, a comfort food we always ate together. (She made me promise to be honest about when i feel hungry, so I felt too guilty to continue the night feeling hungry and not communicating it, especially since we specificallyvalue honesty in our relationship.) She said ok and let me tended to my meal. I had some left over in the pot and offered her to have some without pushing, and she decided to eat with me. I told her to not feel pressured to eat with me, it would make it easier but I need to learn to overcome certain obstacles and not continue to cater to it in order to make my life easier in the mean time. She admitted, though, that she also needs to learn to eat three meals a day and ate with me. It made me happy, though, and easier to overcome guilty and anxious thoughts.\n\nShe finished earlier than me though, but while she continued baking with her back to me, I ate comfortably. I was happy I didn't end up skipping a meal, and she was comforting enough to make me feel like I was in a safe environment, judge free. I was extremely overwhelmed earlier in the day, but later, while feeling tired and talking about a few issues with my girlfriend, I was extremely relaxed and felt safe. \n\nThank you for asking how it went! I'm ok and my girlfriend expressed that she's proud of me. I know this won't be the last time I struggle, but this also won't be the last time I succeed in overcoming anxious thoughts :)",
