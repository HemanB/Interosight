I much would have rather been gaining weight while being able to recall my memories but I decided alcohol was more important than food because it was keeping me from eating as well as dehydrating me every night. So please do not turn to alcohol to help curb your hunger because it is only going to cause you more problems. Yoga and running have helped me but I am currently under a lot of stress but that being said exercise will help keep you healthy and fit as long as you are eating correctly.
