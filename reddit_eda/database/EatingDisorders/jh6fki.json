  "selftext": "I'm tired of telling them, yelling, crying, they always do it again. I don't have enough willpower to stop EDing on my own, lest with an environment like this. \n\nThey say I'm meager while in a healthy BMI, and they're obese. They let me buy anything with their money though I insisted many times to limit me. I asked for a budget deposited on my account so I would have to work on it, but I'm just getting richer while they just give me their credit card anytime, even when I don't ask. They go out of their way to buy me cakes and chips, without me having to lift a finger. They ask me everyday if I have enough to eat for the evening, and cook and insane amount of food as \"leftover\" that they would have to throw in the trash if i was able to contain myself.\n\nI can't find a psych, not only because of covid, but because of my autism, they keep telling me they can't help and redirect me to an org that told me they can't help.\n\nI'm defeated. I've been struggling for 10 years. I'm going to lose it. I had tests done and I have scars inside of me, they know, they don't care.",

      "body": "Unfortunately, it looks like you can\u2019t rely on your family to control your ED for you. They have shown you unequivocally that they do not/will not help. This means that you have to do the hard job of parenting yourself. While they have given you the option of unlimited access to food, it\u2019s up to you to remove yourself from temptation. Ignore the excess food. Don\u2019t accept food pushing. Gently tell your family you\u2019re not eating anymore once you are comfortably full. Walk away if you have to. As long as you *are* eating enough to be healthy you\u2019ll be okay.\n\nBelieve me, I understand that this is not easy; I\u2019m a binger myself. But I\u2019ve been fighting it for a while now and as useless as it might seem to say so, just saying \u201cno\u201d is really the only thing that works. You can\u2019t binge if you don\u2019t put food in your mouth. Eat for health, not as a hobby. Do not let yourself linger next to binge triggers. It sucks, it\u2019s hard as hell, but you\u2019re the only one that can help yourself. Good luck.",

      "body": "That really sucks. I\u2019m sorry they are not respecting your requests or you\n\nI also have autism and I have had no issues getting ED treatment at my local ED treatment center. I don\u2019t understand why they wouldn\u2019t help just because you are autistic? That\u2019s fuck up\n\nI will say tho that my therapist I see through the program is not very knowledgeable or helpful for my autism so I occasionally see my normal therapist when I need help with non-ED stuff\n\nCan you look into treatment options outside of your city? Because a lot of programs are online for the foreseeable future so even if the office is far away you might still be able to join (tho you probably aren\u2019t allowed to go out of state because of telehealth laws)\n\nIt really sounds like treatment is important for you and my main advice is just keep pushing even tho it hurts and it sucks. Keep contacting doctors and keep reminding your parents. You might be able to frustrate them so much by talking about it all the time that they will help you find treatment (idk your parents tho, so take treat with a grain of salt)\n\nEdit: another thought I just had for the meanwhile until you can get treatment is to try to enforce your own limits. Something I often do is if I know I will binge on something, I cover it in ungodly amounts of salt or pepper or whatever so I won\u2019t want to eat it. \n\nOr you might be able to throw food away when they aren\u2019t looking and act like you ate it.\n\n(Don\u2019t do this if you struggle with restricting tho because it can become a slippery slope that just ends in more binges)\n\n\nWhen it comes to money, my best suggestion is when you are going to the store or other food place, carry only what cash you need and leave your card at home. Then you don\u2019t have the option to buy tons of binge foods",

Be mindful when you eat and walk away when you've had enough. Binging is usually emotionally driven. A therapist would help and there are a lot of online resources. Even noticing your emotions when you eat and journaling it out would be helpful. Keep a food and mood journal to see what emotions you are experiencing when you binge versus when you eat until satisfied.",

I got help from a counsellor who specialised in ED as I couldn't afford a psych. Finding the person who fits with your needs can take time. It sounds like you have the funds - try broadening the pool of people of professionals you're looking at. Good luck - you're showing amazing strength in trying to get help!",
