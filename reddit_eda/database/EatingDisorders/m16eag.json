  "title": "Request: Post Request: Dealing With Period Bloat as a Trigger",
  "selftext": "I'm currently recovering from anorexia (with the help of a counselor).  I've noticed that bloating during my periods acts like a trigger that makes me want to start restricting again, and sometimes I'll find myself slipping because of it.  I know that the bloating isn't actual weight gain and it is temporary but when I look in the mirror it causes anxiety. Does anyone have any tips for coping with this, or experienced similar feelings?",

What I do is drink lots and lots of water and reduce my salt intake for the week (bc of water retention) which I find really helps with the bloating. I\u2019m in recovery as well and the past couple months I\u2019ve been doing this and I find myself feeling much less anxious during those weeks",

Although there still is a bit of bloating so i hide my scale and avoid mirrors as much as i can for the duration of my period",
