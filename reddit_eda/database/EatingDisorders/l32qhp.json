  "selftext": "So I\u2019ve struggled for a bit now with anorexia. It\u2019s been going on long enough that I now need to get checked into an ED treatment facility. I didn\u2019t want to go at first because I didn\u2019t think I was bad enough to warrant that yet.\n\nMy boyfriend gave me the ultimatum of get help there or I\u2019ll break up with you. Fair enough. I\u2019m almost done with the process and I\u2019m being admitted Tuesday. I told him I\u2019ll do my best. I want to get better so we can have a future together. He promised he would stay through this first bit of treatment, which will be over the next 10-12 weeks.\n\nNext thing I know a friend of ours is telling me that he\u2019s planning on breaking up with me pretty soon after I admit. Like the first time I get visitations (1-2 weeks after admitting) he\u2019s ending it. I don\u2019t know what to do. He was a big part of my motivation to get better and this is the worst possible time for it to happen. We\u2019ve been together 3 years and it\u2019s all coming crumbling down. He doesn\u2019t believe I\u2019ll get better long term and that I\u2019ll always be a anorexic. I feel very given up on.\n\nI\u2019m more so looking for advice on how to deal with it, not really on how to make him stay. I was scared enough going into treatment, but now I have to do it alone? I\u2019m wondering if there is even a point to getting better now.",

      "body": "I'll share a bit of my own experience: I broke up with my fiance about a month before going into ED treatment for the first time (which was definitely part of it). They had also been my best friend for nearly 14 years and we had been engaged for over a year. \n\nIt was a bad breakup. \n\nHowever, honestly?? It was probably one of the best times we could've ended it. \nIn treatment (especially residential), you (should hopefully) have many people to talk at almost any hour. Not saying you will right away, but having that knowledge alone helps a lot. It took a lot of time for me to talk to the staff about what was going on, but I did get there. \nAnd there are people to keep you accountable, to help you from slipping too far. I shudder to think about how I would've dealt with that breakup outside of treatment. \n\nTreatment was really, really hard. And having that happen beforehand only makes it harder. \nBut I'm still unbelievably thankful that it happened right before.\n\nFor reference, we broke up over 5 years ago. I didn't gain this perspective for a long time. \n\nTake advantage of your resources and be proud of yourself for entering treatment. You'll be better for it.",

      "body": "Hey, \n\nSorry this is happening. It's definitely not an ideal time but I suppose there's no good time for heartbreak. \n\nI think it's incredible that you've decided to go to treatment. It's a huge step and a difficult one, I know. It's tough that much of your motivation has come from your partner but, regardless, it's a positive thing that you're pursuing recovery. \n\nI know it is hard to see now but this will all be for the best. Breakups are SO hard. I remember my last breakup ... It was around the 4yr mark and I was finally commiting to recovery. He had said he wanted me to recover ALL along but I was too scared. Part of me \"couldn't\" recover because I was scared he would leave me when I gained as much weight as I needed to. I thought \"he was attracted to me when he met me at this weight... He can't possibly be attracted to me when I gain 30, 40, 50+ pounds\". This was legit my GREATEST fear at the time. \n\nSo I started recovery. I gained weight. I gained A LOT of weight. It was really hard but I kept going. I was super motivated to change my life and, yes, part of that was related to him and our future together. However, once my weight plateaued a few months later and I was feeling MUCH better (not in terms of body image but in terms of my freedom with food, energy levels, personality, etc.), he decided \"he wasn't in love with me anymore\". You can imagine my anger, shame, disgust. It was so hard - literally my worst nightmare coming true. And it was hard for a long time. \n\nHowever, it's two years later now and I can HONESTLY say it's the best thing that ever happened to me. It made me realize that I had MY OWN motivation to recover. It made me realize he was an ass hole if he didn't want me in his life at my healthiest because I am so much better of a person overall when I'm recovered. It made me realize how selfish he was to do that when he did. Now, I look back and I'm so glad he ended it so I could find someone who loved me for my personality and my true strengths, not because I looked a certain way. I also don't know if my recovery could have lasted because our relationship started when I was much under my healthy bodyweight and I don't know that I could have felt attractive to him at a bigger size. I have since found a partner that loves me so much more than that man could have. My current partner thinks I am beautiful, encourages me to eat, loves my soft belly, grabs my bigger bum/thighs with the cutest boyish grin and, most importantly, loves me for my sense of humour, kindness and values. \n\nI know it may be hard to see now but you will make it through this. You deserve recovery for YOU. If you want to, you'll meet someone who loves you at your healthiest and they will love you for all that you are. If this guy can imagine a life without you in it, and be okay with that, he doesn't deserve any more of your time. Focus on yourself and your recover for now and, I guarantee you, your life will open up to countless opportunities and amazing people/experience. \n\nRooting for you, friend \u2665\ufe0f.",

      "body": "Agree on all the other wise comments here, and wanted to mainly say: this dude would leave for any of the problems that Future You would have. It's not the anorexia...it's him. \nIt's okay - not everyone is equipped to be an adult! But there is someone wonderful for you, who will love and appreciate you as you are, will be, or could be. Things are never perfect in any relationship; your own struggle is this ED, but every human has a struggle.Ed's just happen to be more evident on the outside (not always) - so people judge. But never you mind! You are going to be so much stronger, happier and truly ready to live life if you give treatment a true chance. Try your best - take advantage of every single program and moment.  Believe me - you  have so many reasons  to recover. \nPS: It's always possible that the person isn't totally accurate in your BF's plans - it seems odd that they would know his plans, unless you guys are very  young in age-- in which case, it may be even better to be free of any relationships that could weigh you down. Also: you may feel like ED's make you feel lighter or more free, but you are dragging around a huge ball and chain. If you are willing to trust the process, you're going to be feeling light as a feather - free   and full of hope. Not perfect, but so much better.",

I can\u2019t imagine how hard it must be right now. But just remember that every day is a new potentially sunnier day. I was in ED hell for years before I pulled through, and having my ED feels like a dream of the past. It doesn\u2019t come to mind at all now, for weeks at a time. I forget about that part of my life more often than I could ever imagine. I never thought I would get through, but it\u2019s possible!
