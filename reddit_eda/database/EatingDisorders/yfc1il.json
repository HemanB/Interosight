It also messes with your potassium, magnesium, and other important blood levels that regulate your heart and can also cause it to stop when the levels are too low from purging. There are so many other costs of purging as others have pointed out. Please, please try to hear us. EDs have the highest mortality rate next to opioid addiction, and while we often don\u2019t think it\u2019ll happen to us, we have no way of knowing or doing anything once it\u2019s too late.
