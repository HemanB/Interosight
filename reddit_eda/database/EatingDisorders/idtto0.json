  "title": "Request: Feeling really lost after ED referral was declined. Not sure where to turn or how to get help at this stage?",
  "selftext": " \n\nInitially spoke to counselling service recommenced by my GP but they weren't able to deal with my case. I then went back and was referred to an adult ED service however because I purge around 4/5 times a week rather than everyday so my request was declined.\n\nWhat are my options at this point? my diet during the week is some crackers and apples, at times I break down and eat some pasta or something similar but I panic right after and purge every time, weekends are worse for me as I'm not at work then. I've been doing this for over a year and I'm worried about the damage I've caused to my body. I can't talk to friends or family being a 25 year old guy so any tips or comments of any kind would be great.\n\nThank you.",

I'm convinced that the people who come up with referral criteria have no idea how much people with EDs are suffering.\n\nYour primary provider (GP) has a responsibility to monitor your physical health in the absence of secondary care (ED service), exactly what that means depends on where you are, but I really recommend looking into it. In the UK it means that at a minimum you should be getting regular blood tests (honestly this is the most important one, regular binging and purging completely fucks with potassium and PH balance, and can cause huge blood sugar crashes), blood pressure (sitting and standing), EKG (electrolyte/PH abnormalities can cause dangerous changes to your heart rhythm) and weight (though you have the right to refuse being weighed if it's triggering for you). The GP should also be monitoring the severity of your behaviours and any anxiety/depression to figure out how best to support you.\n\nIn terms of psychological help, can you access a therapist, psychologist or mental health nurse through general psychological services, rather than through specialised ED? Or are there any charitable mental health support services near you where you could get free/cheap counselling? If you're in the UK I can rant for hours about where to access support, but not entirely sure how it works elsewhere!",

In the absence of secondary care your GP is basically your care coordinator, so it's really important to get a good one!  \n\n\nI've not heard of IHAP, do you mean IAPT? If not then do you know what kind of support they usually provide? If it's IAPT you should get access to 6-12 weeks of counselling too (not much I know, but if you argue for that then you're in the system and will usually be allocated a MH care coordinator (nurse/social worker), so it's easier to get extra support afterwards if you still need it. I'd definitely try contacting them again, if they claim your needs are too severe they probably mean that they feel an ED service would be most suitable. If that happens make sure to explain that the ED service declined your referral but you're still struggling, so really feel like you'd benefit from MH support.\n\nAnd no worries! Sorry if I'm bombarding you with a load of information, the systems work differently everywhere and are changing constantly so it's tough to give definite advice, I'm pretty sure they just make it up as they go along a lot of the time haha. If you have an specific questions though then honestly ask away, MH services are a ball ache to navigate so happy to try and help!",

          "body": "Gah I hate how referrals to ED services work, so many people are really struggling and can't access proper treatment. I'm convinced that the people who come up with referral criteria have no idea how much people with EDs are suffering.\n\nYour primary provider (GP) has a responsibility to monitor your physical health in the absence of secondary care (ED service), exactly what that means depends on where you are, but I really recommend looking into it. In the UK it means that at a minimum you should be getting regular blood tests (honestly this is the most important one, regular binging and purging completely fucks with potassium and PH balance, and can cause huge blood sugar crashes), blood pressure (sitting and standing), EKG (electrolyte/PH abnormalities can cause dangerous changes to your heart rhythm) and weight (though you have the right to refuse being weighed if it's triggering for you). The GP should also be monitoring the severity of your behaviours and any anxiety/depression to figure out how best to support you.\n\nIn terms of psychological help, can you access a therapist, psychologist or mental health nurse through general psychological services, rather than through specialised ED? Or are there any charitable mental health support services near you where you could get free/cheap counselling? If you're in the UK I can rant for hours about where to access support, but not entirely sure how it works elsewhere!",

I\u2019ll google around and see what else is available. \n\nYou\u2019ve Given me a lot information I had no clue I even needed, thank you so much.",

          "body": "Yeah some GPs can be a bit rubbish about it. Some are awesome, don't get me wrong, but it's hit and miss, I got into an argument with a GP once because she felt it wasn't her responsibility, luckily I had a MH social worker at the time who bombarded her with letters about treatment guidelines and legal responsibilities haha. So yeah sometimes you kind of need to go in and tell them what they're supposed to be doing. In an ideal situation it would be an ED service or MH service coordinating that side of things, because they'd either have the resources to monitor physical health themselves or they'd be able to nag the GP on your behalf. I'd recommend trying to find a GP with an interest in mental health if you can (lots of surgery websites have a page about their staff and their interests) because I've had the best experiences with them!
