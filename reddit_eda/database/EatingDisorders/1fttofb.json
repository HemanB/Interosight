I\u2019d be happy to share what helped me. Also, there\u2019s a sub that has info about others who have also recovered. I\u2019m happy to share that with you if you\u2019d like.

Some meals i eat are : bacon and eggs for breakfast\nFor lunch either steak with eggs, or beef patties, or chicken nuggests i make myself (coated in ground pork rinds - 0carb) or any type of meat that is on s\u00e1le i just Cook in the instant pot (pressure cooker). Or some variation of these.\nYou can really eat any type of meat you enjoy, but the point is to eat the fat that Comes naturaly with that meat, or and extra butter (or avok\u00e1do if you like them), so that your body can have enough fat as fuel, instead  of carbs. \n\nWe have been lied to about fat making us fat. Its the carbs, the sugars - and yes, even fruit. Its not natural, it has been geneticaly modified too.\n\nThere is no need to be afraid of fat. Plese watch the carnivore success stories on YouTube from women with decades of ED, who thought there was no way out. There is !\n\n The Carnivore di\u00e9t is the way that humans have been eating for centuries, way before the industrial and agrocultural revolucion. It means we eat the most nutrient dense and bio-available foods that there are. Which are all animal products, any seafood, eggs. The main source of energie for a person eating this way will become fat. Carbs are non essential, which means you dont have to eat them to survive.  \n\nOfc, if a person is low income and cannot afford to eat Red meat everyday, its better to eat fruit and vegg than to starve, but if you have the money to eat animal products , dominantly Red meat, eggs, bacon, butter- you will start to thrive. \n\nYou can learn more on these channels: Dr.Ken Berry, Neisha (Berry), Bella the steak and butter gal (ex vegan), Dr.Anthony Chaffee, My zero carb life (Kelly Hogan) and many others....\n\nThere is a way out of the hell that are eating disorders, trust m\u00e9, i have been there.\n\nWe all have been lied to, by the message of \"eat the rainbow\" or eat everything in moderation\". \n\nHuman beings in the wild always Hunt and eat animals....you will not survive on leafs and grass (99% of the plan\u00e9ta in the supermarkets are engineered to be sweeter, bigger and look better - they are not natural).\n\nPls contact me if you want to know more.\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/b1ib3bK44Qk?si=5f443ZofXfpJ3i8c\n\nhttps://youtube.com/@theprimal.podcast?si=f2EdO7m6sp_-W6Oj\n\nhttps://youtu.be/miF0APPc8u8?si=57WJsER_IOeKhLbo\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/mW2YGBiN-QM?si=gTidFynoVyvwMCJJ\n\nhttps://youtu.be/w3hh4Lu_7CE?si=ulEu36llngnAIpva",
