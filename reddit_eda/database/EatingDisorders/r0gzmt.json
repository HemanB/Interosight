  "title": "Request: How do i respond to my girlfriend when she asks how she looks?",
  "selftext": "My girlfriend is currently actively restricting. I have never had experience with somebody i know struggling with this so i'm pretty afraid but she is being open with me about it. I don't really know what to do other than try to support her and show her i love her. And from my reading that seems to be really all i can do (all other suggestions appreciated).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut my main question is how i should respond when she asks \"Do you think I look better?\" Or she will point out a part of her body where her weight loss is most obvious and ask me if i like it. And to be brutally honest, no i think she looks worse and emaciated. It makes me really sad and afraid. However i worry that if i tell her she looks good (dishonest) that it will encourage her to continue down this spiral but if i'm honest and say that i think she looked better when she was healthier that it might make her worse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow should i respond to her asking this?",
