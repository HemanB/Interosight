It started out as the only way I would allow myself to taste chocolate, muffins, etc. while I was starting to recover from very restrictive eating, and then became much more compulsive - like planning my evening around having a chew & spit binge. Since you posted this question to this sub I think you understand that this is not healthy eating behaviour.",

It messes up your teeth and it\u2019s an oral fixation and it\u2019s not healthy. I can\u2019t go though 100\u2019s of dollars in food to just chew and spit out as a waste. At night I obsessively wait to be alone just to do this and all day it\u2019s all I want to do. It\u2019s a horrible horrible god forsaken curse of an addiction. I\u2019m planning on recovery soon. Just eating healthy and actually eating. But it\u2019s crazy so many people don\u2019t know about this eating disorder. Method of madness. That\u2019s why I\u2019m doing this documentary to shed light on it so there can be help on it and we don\u2019t have to hide the fact of suffering from chewing and spitting out food addiction. It\u2019s rough having something no one else really knows about. I\u2019m glad you posted this because man I feel alone and like I\u2019m the only one that does this but i know for a fact it\u2019s real and more common than we thought.",

Whether an eating disorder, or a form of disordered eating or anxiety or something else, this is concerning  I really suggest connecting with a mental health professional about this. Can't stress enough that these behaviours quickly spiral out of control and the sooner someone gets support the better. If you're afraid to seek help about this remember it's your choice whether you want to stop or not and no one can take that away from you. You get to decide what you want to do, it just might help to understand why this is happening and where it's coming from in the first place",
