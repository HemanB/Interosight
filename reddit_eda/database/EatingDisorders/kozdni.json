  "selftext": "On Thursday I was discharged from an ED treatment facility. I had been there since the start of September and it was a struggle to get where I am today.\n\nWith that being said, I wanted to come on here and let everyone who is either lurking, or following this sub that it is possible to recover. Just keep trying your hardest by putting your best foot forward each and every day.\n\nI know how challenging that can be. Heck, as a 22M it was hard enough for me to accept the fact that I had an ED. Still, I knew that if I worked at it I would get back to a healthy and happier place. I am still not quite where I want to be yet, but I do my best to choose recovery every single day.\n\nStill, one thing my journey taught me is how hard battling an ED is. All of you are warriors for combatting your respective ED\u2019s and I want you to remember: you can do it. Be proud of yourself, love yourself, and choose recovery. I wish everyone the best of luck heading into the new year.",

I always comment with the intent of being helpful, but I recognize that what I say will not always be helpful to everyone. In the future, I'll ask questions first.\n\nI am really upset to hear your situation and I do wish there were something I could say that would be helpful. I don't really understand where my perspective was thin privileged, but maybe you would be willing to let me know what I said that came off that way. As far as me saying recovery is simple and easy... I can see where you get that from what I said. I would clarify that I think that recovery is simple, but not easy. Not easy at all. I've been in recovery for 15 years so I certainly know it's not easy. I would argue that for a lot of us (maybe not all. I won't over generalize), it is simple in the sense that we know what we need to do to. Again, not easy by any means. If it were easy, my life would have been so different.\n\nI know very well that eating disorders come in all sizes and I believe that everyone deserves the support they require to recover. Anyone who dismisses people based on their body size and does not treat them the same as anyone else with an ED does not understand how restriction affects the human body and surely assigns moral value to body size, but body size is not a moral thing. I agree with you 100% on that, and I can't understand why others don't agree when that is human biology at work. It isn't some unexplainable mystery. Science has explained it, and yet the advice some people are receiving is totally counterproductive. I'm sorry you have experienced that.\n\nAnyway, I am sorry to have been unhelpful and for not seeking to understand where you were coming from with your comment. I really want you to know that I wish you well and I hope you can find some true support in your circle.",
