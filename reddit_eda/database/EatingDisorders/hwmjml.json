  "title": "Request: How to get through this new weight loss journey without falling back into an eating disorder",
  "selftext": "8 years ago I decided to lose some major weight. I managed to get just outside of my ideal weight but I did it in an unhealthy way, in that I developed a combination of eating disorders. I\u2019d purge whenever I felt immediately after a meal I\u2019d eaten too much. I was highly restrictive on what I are, by obsessively counting calories, and wouldn\u2019t eat if I felt that I had done poorly the day before or would purge if I thought I ate too much. As I over came that, I started to just exercise everything off as I got fitter. I would do whatever it took to burn off the energy I\u2019d just consumed, no matter how ridiculous the challenge was. Once I got down to my ideal weight I became more healthy. I are right and exercised like a normal person. I felt good about me. I still had issues with food and my body, but I fought threw them. Though my teeth and esophagus still had evidence of me hurting me, to the world I looked happy and fit. \n\nFast forward to today, I decided years ago to just let go. I stoped exercising, stopped counting, stopped the healthy lifestyle I accidentally fell into after battling with different EDs. I\u2019m now heavier than I ever was and highly unhappy with myself and my body. I want to be fit again, but I want to be healthy. I don\u2019t want to get into hurting my body again to get something fast. The thing is yesterday I purged. It\u2019s the first time in years but I didn\u2019t hesitate. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll fall back into an ED while I try to get my eating and exercise back to healthy amounts, it\u2019s why I\u2019ve been so hesitant in the past. \n\nAre there things I can to to keep myself in track and losing weight in a healthy manner? I\u2019m afraid to count calories because of my past, but intuitive eating also makes me anxious cause I know I have a larger appetite cause of my current size.",

Someone with experience in this area can help uncover and triggers or reasons for the unhealthy eating habits and give you credible, validated advice to help you with weight management and emotional health. There are free/affordable/online options out there if you do a bit of research.\n\nAs a soon-to-be dietitian, i would highly recommend eating a balanced meal 3x a day, 4-5hrs apart so that you dont end up in a starving/overeating cycle. make half of each meal be from whole fruits/veggies (make it colorful!). Aim for 45-70g carbs per meal. about half of these carbs should be from high-fiber sources (more than 3g fiber per serving). Get into weight-lifting if you can - do this 2-3x per week because lean muscle helps you to burn more calories at rest. Also, this isnt diet-related, but take a look at the clothing you wear. I know for me, I felt worse about my body because I was trying to force myself into clothing that just didn't fit my body type. Focus on how clothing makes you feel and look and if a clothing item isnt working for you, blame the clothes, not your body. throw out the clothing that isn't serving you. Wearing things that fit your type could help a lot with body-related issues.\n\nIf you want more advice feel free to message me \ud83d\ude42",

      "body": "How I lost my recovery weight without falling back into old habits is by weight lifting and eating mostly whole foods. I watched a lot of fitness you tubers and remember seeing a tip to eat about 80% mostly whole foods and 20% whatever. I didn\u2019t follow this religiously but at the time I loved to go out to eat so I would just think to only go out to eat once every five meals. If I had a craving, like French fries, I would just make my own by cutting up a potato and baking it with some salt and some olive oil. \n\nI know I will never be able to count calories. Weight lifting can be scary at first because your appetite goes up but once I started building muscle my metabolism really did get faster! It became hard to keep weight on. And it\u2019s hard for girls to get super muscley. I think lifting also helped my ED brain because seeing my body get stronger and seeing what my body could do really made me appreciate my body and not want to abuse it. Good luck!!!",

Counting calories was never something I did (I was eating far too little, but never quantified it), so it\u2019s not triggering for me. I\u2019m able to count calories and try to eat just below maintenance for gradual weight loss. Frequent weighing was an unhealthy behaviour I had, so I avoid weighing myself. I let my doctor periodically monitor my weight, but I don\u2019t even own a scale. Compulsive excessive cardio was something I did, so now I\u2019ve taken up strength training instead.\n\nI also have the monitoring done by my doctor and my psychologist, and have consulted with a dietician in the past to help me plan meals. I don\u2019t think attempting to lose weight would be safe without it, at least for me. I waited a while until my psychologist thought it would be safe to start.",

I've battled an Ed for the best part of 23 years (started with basic meal skips at 10, then progressed from there to starve the weight off me). I'm 33 now and started to eat more 2 and a half years ago when I met my S/O. Now I've gained the weight I constantly feel paranoid about it. I'm about 8-9 stone now (112-126pounds) at 5' 3 but don't want to fall into the starving myself pattern again despite feeling like a whale sometimes.",

          "body": "awesome that you've liberated your diet in the last 2 years. i hope your SO has been supportive of you towards that end. you are right in the healthy range of body weight for height so you can focus on mantenance at this time. most important thing id say is to continue to choose healthier options of the foods you eat, so you can still eat the same amount but just different food choices, like swapping a normal burger for a veggie burger if you deide to eat out. eating consistently throughout the day is important too, so you dont fall into starvation patterns, which end up doing more harm than good in the longrun. i know its easier said than done. you really have to prioritize it especially since its such an easy pattern to fall into. perhaps your so can help you to establish an eating schedule and grocery shop for healthy food options",

He reminds me every day of how beautiful he thinks I am but thought that maybe instead of focusing on weight loss, do more  work to maybe tone up bettee if it is still bothering me. My biggest diet downfall is my addiction to chocolate and sugary snacks (long running joke between myself and friends that I'm a 'sugar junkie'), but did buy myself some fruit and fewer biscuits when I went grocery shopping the other day, so there is that.\n\nAlso I will try and establish a routine, but have to do it around in irregular sleep/work pattern due to the nature of my job.",
