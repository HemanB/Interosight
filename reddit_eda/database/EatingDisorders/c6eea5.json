  "selftext": "I'm finally going to a therapist specializing in eating disorders starting July, but I constantly doubt myself and go back and forth from \"I have an eating disorder\" to \"I just have low self-esteem and I'm overreacting.\" I know I fall under almost all the characteristics of anorexia, but I'm at a healthy weight and I don't purge so I constantly feel like a fraud. I don't know what to do or how to cope or whatever. I feel like because I'm not doing as bad as other people with eating disorders that I don't truly have an eating disorder and that I don't need help. All advice welcome, thanks!!",

      "body": "Eating disorders (ED) are competitive. Don't compare yourself to other people or their eating disorder (easier said than done of course). I had this issue when I was going through recovery. I felt like I was also overreacting about my situation. When this happened to me, I journaled so I could work through my thoughts. It helped me put everything into perspective. In my head (where my thoughts were very chaotic) I would think it's not that bad, I'm just making a mountain out of a molehill. But when I took a step back, I could see how my ED consumed, controlled, and manipulated my life. If you feel like the ED behaviors are affecting your way of life and your happiness in any way, that is what matters. It doesn't matter how it compares to other people's. Also, ED are a mental illness so being at your healthy weight shouldn't prevent you from seeking help.",

You made an appointment because your behavior worries you, or you have \"low self-esteem\", or for some other reason. Your therapist will evaluate you, and make recommendations. Take them seriously; people in the throes of ED often have cognitive impairment, so don't rely too heavily on your own thinking. If you're not sure about what the therapist is saying, come back here and check with the ED crowd.\n\ntl,dr:\n\nTrust the experts.",

Recovery means something different for everyone and can be many different paths, but I genuinely believe working with a therapist changed my life. After one year of hard work, the cognitive behavioral therapy truly changed my thoughts. From then on, when I thought \u201cI don\u2019t really have a problem compared to other people, I\u2019m just reacting\u201d I had the tools to redirect my thoughts and tell myself, \u201cno, you do, and you deserve better than this\u201d. I still use these tools every day. It took a long time to accept the ED, but eventually it clicked.",

      "body": "Whether you have a mild eating disorder or a severe one ( which in the course of recovery can vary greatly in terms of your day to day behavior) - the issue is that you've recognized there's a problem and have sought professional help. Nothing but good can come of that and you have no need to feel guilt or shame about it, although this is very common as well. As eating disorders are about your mental health as much as the behavior around food that surrounds them, I think you've definitely taken the right steps forward.",

Now that the US wants fatter women, anyone who is 1920's flapper-type is deemed underweight.\n\nSocietal standard aside, fat people can have an unhealthy relationship with food, too. bmi doesn't matter\n\nTruth is, we should encourage more people to get help at an earlier point, not later. It's preventative of worsening of symptoms, too. You also never know fully about yourself like a psychologist does - trust me. I get surprised often by myself through my psychologist's help. It's a whole worldview.",
