  "selftext": "Like always my eating issues get worse in the winter. My parents have noticed that my weight has dropped again. Tonight my dad tried to get me to allow him to make me something for dinner, and the more him, as well as my mom, tried to push food on me the more and more put off I was about eating.\n\nBtw my eating issues are focused around this strong worry that I will overeat and become super overweight and incredibly unhealthy, potentially linked to how horribly I ate in my adolescence, part of it is also wanting to look androgynous too I think. I don't like the idea of having any visible weight. I wouldn't be surprised if, especially the former part is ocd driven. It feels like it could be.",

Even though I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m doing well right now, at least I am a bit more educated on my behaviours & patterns. Anyway - yes to your question /: Whenever someone tells me to eat, especially if they say I look \u201ctoo skinny\u201d, it\u2019s almost as if it\u2019s a trigger and I will fight people until I\u2019m blue in the face that I\u2019m not hungry. Someone forcing me to eat often times feels like a threat to me and I get very hostile & irritated, but I\u2019ve learned to manage this better because I understand it\u2019s only because people care for me.

I did also tell them that I felt like I had it under pretty good control, as when it came to my more active and obvious that were much more all life consuming, things that I would think and obsess about for hours on end, doing and thinking about nothing else whatsoever, I was completely unaware about how many more passive obsessions still effect me. And I don't think eating is the only one. I think music for example is another. While its much better, for one reason or another I can be super uncomfortable listening to certain music. The original form of this obsession was an immense worry that if I listened to anything but japanese music I would lose all interest in the japanese stuff I was interested in like anime, and fashion and all that.\n\nThough yah I got a cookie as well as pizza while I was on my walk today. I ate the cookie while I was out, but I decided to eat the pizza at home. Now that I am at home though I feel strong discomfort about eating it and I wish I didn't spend the 6 bucks on it. :/ I feel horrible about eating it especially knowing how junky pizza is. And especially knowing that I had a cookie already. I think being out and walking as well as listening to music while I do so makes me feel less fat and lazy than when I am at home. So I can be a little more willing to eat.",
