  "title": "Request: Can an ED just \u2018suddenly\u2019 start?",
  "selftext": "I\u2019ve always had a slightly disordered relationship with food, however after a lot of work (done myself, not professionally) I was doing really well and eating fairly \u2018normally\u2019. I\u2019ve got quite severe depression and anxiety and two weeks ago I had a total meltdown. Since then I\u2019ve started restricting, worse than I ever did in the past. (The anxiety of covid19 is probably making things worse too) The behaviour seems to have come out of nowhere and I\u2019m suddenly fighting an obsession with food. Could this just be a temporary thing that\u2019ll pass (for example, when the global anxiety level surrounding covid19 settles), or is it more likely that it\u2019s the start of a much more serious ED than I\u2019ve had before?",

      "body": "Doesnt seem like it really \"suddenly\" started. It was kinda always there and now is triggered and worse than ever because of your situation. I have BED and I find I binge like crazy when depressed or stress. Because of this whole corona thing i had a pretty bingey weekend.\n\nIf you find your eating disorder is triggered by stress, depression and anxiety you should seek to have those things looked after, it seems to be the root of the problem for you. I cant say for certain but maybe once you find your peace in this chaos, it will get better.",

I am 4 years recovered, but still occasionally have \u201cbad\u201d periods (that can last for a few weeks), without launching into a full relapse. Especially when everything is stressful! Listen to your gut/intuition. If I were talking to myself: Don\u2019t panic yet, you might just be going through a short rough patch. But if this *feels* different, reach out to your therapist! At the very least, observe your thoughts/behaviors and make plans to see your therapist in a few weeks if necessary.",

      "body": "Hi, I have an eating disorder (anorexia and binge eating) and being Italian I'm seriously affected by the COVID outbreak. We are in complete lockdown, and I've been binge eating ever since because of the stress. It's never been this bad for me, and the situation is enabling my ed because I stay home all the time and just binge. I gained weight and I feel sick all the time. I had just began to eat quite normally again after a long time, and now I completely lost it. I'm scared that I might retain this behaviour even when the emergency will be over. I'm also scared because too many people are dying in our country and the infection doesn't seem to stop.\nI don't think eds start 'suddenly', but rather they are triggered by stressful situations, traumatic events or other disorders. The actual situation is a great catalyst for abnormal behaviour, and it can worsen a preexisting one.",

      "body": "I agree with the other poster who said that this isn't suddenly starting.  You've had issues with food before, and being under extreme stress triggered a relapse.  It's quite a common thing and for a lot of people, each successive relapse is worse than the last.\n\nSo, what you have to do now is actively try to get better.  Yes, your stress levels may go down after the worst of the virus situation passes, but once you've started using behaviors they don't just go away on their own.  You're in that ED mode again.  So the thing to do now is to make changes regardless of how anxious you are, because while anxiety is what triggered the relapse, the absence of anxiety isn't going to make it completely go away.  I know that right now in this acute anxiety phase it probably feels really hard to do anything recovery-focused, but even starting small would be a good step.  Try to find other coping skills to manage your anxiety.  Identify ways to increase your intake, even if it doesn't make your intake perfect.  The thing to do now is fight as hard as you can to make things even slightly better for yourself, and as you move forward, you can continue taking steps to get back to the better place you'd gotten yourself to before.",

All the sudden I was restricting a lot and had no desire to eat, when that's not my norm at all. I'm going to venture to guess this isn't as sudden as it seems, but yes from experience it can feel very sudden.",
