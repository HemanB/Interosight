Even if they\u2019re not drinking or using, they\u2019re still thinking about it obsessively and struggling with it. - I have relapses -I feel so much guilt because I know I\u2019m hurting my body by not giving it what it needs. I have self love and want to nourish, heal, and strengthen my body. But it\u2019s hard when the Ana is there holding me back. Just like addicts know what they\u2019re doing hurts them and maybe they want to get better but its not that easy.  \n\\-I feel like an outsider with it. Just like addicts say people on the outside don\u2019t understand, I feel like people without ED\u2019s don\u2019t. It\u2019s a whole other world.",

The way I look at it, eating disorders are more similar to behavior addictions rather than addictions to substance, like gambling or shopping addictions. People can get addicted or dependent on the chemicals that are released from purging or starving, but food itself can\u2019t really be addictive because we need it to survive. Another way they are similar is that they are both acts of self-destruction. Eating disorder and addiction are both slow suicide, and when one harms oneself that way... it becomes a part of them forever. Same with self-injury. It has to be managed and cared for to help keep it from gaining control again. We CAN heal, but it will always be part of us. Or at least, that\u2019s how I feel.",

Either saying I should look like her(my sister) or I'll end up looking and acting like her(my cousin). I've never been the skinny child, I'm the fat girl in everything I'm involved in. I've developed an ED, I starve myself, when I eat too much I use laxatives(sorry TMI) and I excessively workout until I'm satisfied. I need that control and that hunger to feel like I please my family.  \nMy mom was having dessert last night and I said no to her offer many many times bc she didn't respect my answer.

I agree that the term \u201cfood addiction\u201d is extremely harmful, but it\u2019s a little different than referring to the ED itself as a form of addiction. \n\nI\u2019m currently researching the neuropsychology of eating disorders (just on an undergrad level, no primary data myself unfortunately) and on many levels it can present with similar behaviors and desires as an addiction. It\u2019s not exactly the same of course, but it may prove helpful in figuring out how to treat the ED if someone feels their ED is an addiction. I feel mine is a coping mechanism because it dulls emotions and gives me a \u201chigh,\u201d similar to how drugs/alcohol/other maladaptive coping skills do. Of course, they ARE bad coping mechanisms, and it may feel insensitive to both ED sufferers and those who suffer from addictions to compare the two\n\nBut your feelings are so so valid because \u201cfood addict\u201d is literally disgusting.

I agree that the term \u201cfood addiction\u201d is extremely harmful, but it\u2019s a little different than referring to the ED itself as a form of addiction. \n\nI\u2019m currently researching the neuropsychology of eating disorders (just on an undergrad level, no primary data myself unfortunately) and on many levels it can present with similar behaviors and desires as an addiction. It\u2019s not exactly the same of course, but it may prove helpful in figuring out how to treat the ED if someone feels their ED is an addiction. I feel mine is a coping mechanism because it dulls emotions and gives me a \u201chigh,\u201d similar to how drugs/alcohol/other maladaptive coping skills do. Of course, they ARE bad coping mechanisms, and it may feel insensitive to both ED sufferers and those who suffer from addictions to compare the two\n\nBut your feelings are so so valid because \u201cfood addict\u201d is literally disgusting. Everyone needs food. There isn\u2019t a single living thing that doesn\u2019t require food. It\u2019s a dumb term, I agree",
