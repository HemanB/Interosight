My parents are great but they are immigrants and can\u2019t really wrap their head around the depth of ED\u2019s. At this point my eating habits have become more of an annoyance to my family rather than viewed as a disorder so to even entertain the idea of being too sick to fast would be out of the question (my 80 something year old grandpa still fasts).",

      "body": "Hi, just chiming in to say, you don\u2019t sound cringey but I completely understand why you might feel that way because it often happens to me. I forget that I appreciate when others are vulnerable, and I find that I often worry others will find my vulnerability and honesty as invasive or unwelcome. By and large that is not the case. It is certainly not the case here. I think sharing your experience is incredibly courageous and acknowledging that it\u2019s complicated and challenging shows that. \n\nOne of the difficult things about mental illness is that it isn\u2019t extremely obvious to others how it affects you. But many physical illnesses are the same way: for example, you might not know someone is diabetic just by looking at them. You would have to see lab work or invasive testing to know. \n\nBut science is beginning to show us that mental illness absolutely does affect our physical bodies, for example, by changing the way our brains process information. The science is new and changing, and it\u2019s long overdue, but hopefully it will change the way we treat mental as opposed to physical health.\n\nWith eating disorders and other compulsions, one of the biggest struggles for many of us is feeling like we aren\u2019t \u201creally\u201d sick and that it\u2019s just a matter of willpower. Denying that your suffering is bad is common to just about every person I know who struggles with eating disorders. In other words, the fact that you\u2019re terrified of food matters less to you than that your body doesn\u2019t look sick. I\u2019m here to tell you that if it is making you hurt some or most of the time, it\u2019s bad enough. It\u2019s okay to say you feel bad and you want to feel better. Nobody says, \u201cwell, it\u2019s only stage 1 cancer. Stop being so dramatic.\u201d Please don\u2019t say that to yourself. \n\nEating disorders have a lot in common with addiction, and it\u2019s only been recently (the last few decades) that we have acknowledged that addiction isn\u2019t just a matter of \u201cstop doing that thing!\u201d Behavioral compulsions are learned behaviors, but that doesn\u2019t mean we have active control over them after a certain point. There are lots of things we learn to do: for example, you learned to wear clothes in public, and it would probably be extremely difficult if you needed to stop doing that tomorrow. I hope that makes sense. \n\nThank you for sharing your story. I hope both of you find peace and healing, but most of all, I hope each of you are able to be merciful to yourselves, because I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s the most important goal.",

My older sister was ecstatic because to her it meant Im getting help, but my mom was a little confused. Her response was \"but you eat though, no?\" My younger step sister asked why I hadn't been fasting all ramadan and i told her my doctors didn't want me to bc of my mental health and that was enough for her. There's definitely ups and downs, and I don't share with them much about this aside from the bare minimum - told them I won't be fasting, told them I've reached out to get treatment (to explain why I'm not fasting) but thats about it!\n\nI'm honestly lucky that most of my family acknowledges mental health, but thats mostly due to the fact that 2 or 3 immediate family members have had EDs and most of us have mental health issues lol so there's not much to hide here.

I forget that I appreciate when others are vulnerable, and I find that I often worry others will find my vulnerability and honesty as invasive or unwelcome. By and large that is not the case. It is certainly not the case here. I think sharing your experience is incredibly courageous and acknowledging that it\u2019s complicated and challenging shows that. \n\nOne of the difficult things about mental illness is that it isn\u2019t extremely obvious to others how it affects you. But many physical illnesses are the same way: for example, you might not know someone is diabetic just by looking at them. You would have to see lab work or invasive testing to know. \n\nBut science is beginning to show us that mental illness absolutely does affect our physical bodies, for example, by changing the way our brains process information. The science is new and changing, and it\u2019s long overdue, but hopefully it will change the way we treat mental as opposed to physical health.\n\nWith eating disorders and other compulsions, one of the biggest struggles for many of us is feeling like we aren\u2019t \u201creally\u201d sick and that it\u2019s just a matter of willpower. Denying that your suffering is bad is common to just about every person I know who struggles with eating disorders. In other words, the fact that you\u2019re terrified of food matters less to you than that your body doesn\u2019t look sick. I\u2019m here to tell you that if it is making you hurt some or most of the time, it\u2019s bad enough. It\u2019s okay to say you feel bad and you want to feel better. Nobody says, \u201cwell, it\u2019s only stage 1 cancer. Stop being so dramatic.\u201d Please don\u2019t say that to yourself. \n\nEating disorders have a lot in common with addiction, and it\u2019s only been recently (the last few decades) that we have acknowledged that addiction isn\u2019t just a matter of \u201cstop doing that thing!\u201d Behavioral compulsions are learned behaviors, but that doesn\u2019t mean we have active control over them after a certain point. There are lots of things we learn to do: for example, you learned to wear clothes in public, and it would probably be extremely difficult if you needed to stop doing that tomorrow. I hope that makes sense. \n\nThank you for sharing your story. I hope both of you find peace and healing, but most of all, I hope each of you are able to be merciful to yourselves, because I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s the most important goal.",
