  "selftext": "For the past few months,I\u2019ve been dieting to lose my weight because I almost reach the obesity level based on my BMI.I\u2019ve been skipping meals,counting calories,eating once a day sometimes but despite all of that I only still lose like 5kg for 2 months and I wasn\u2019t still quite satisfied and unhappy.One day,I eat normal as I\u2019m hanging out with my family,then the next day I feel extremely hungry like I could eat anything in one sitting and I\u2019m so afraid that I will gain a lot of weights.Is this normal? Will I lose my weight gain? Been researching about extreme hunger as my recovery process but I am so afraid and I am still overweight.",

Get a referral to get treat at a clinic that specializes in eating disorders.

And there are many people who are fat and eat balanced and healthy with proper exercise, which is why the medical community is phasing out the BMI. \n\nEating shouldnt be about weight loss and weight gain. It sounds like you have an unhealthy relationship with food. Not eating for some days and then binging on other days messes up your metabolism. The best thing to do is to try eating regularly and stop thinking about weight but focus on your health. \nYour body needs food to live. And your metabolism needs to receive fuel regularly. Without it, your metabolism gets mixed signals and your weight fluctuates as in, stores food as fat because it is afraid to go in starvation mode agaib.but again,weight shouldnt be the focus because you have an eating disorder",
