When I went to residential for my eating disorder, I met a few amazing men, they inspired me just as much as the women in there. I am still close with one of them and watching his recovery during residential was so awesome. He felt the same way that you are feeling, he invalidated his disorder for so long because of his gender. He has his struggles here and there, but he doesn\u2019t regret getting help for a second. \n\nAsk for help OP, there are SO many people out there waiting with open arms",

I remember getting taught about anorexia in school, but it was always taught as a female disorder.\n\nWhich is nonsense because there's a hell of a lot of guys with eating disorders out there. Just there's less of a support system for them to be open about it, so there's less publicity. So male rating disorders aren't talked about, and men suffer as a result.\n\nSo I completely empathise with the feeling of isolation. Speaking up on reddit is a brave first step though! \n\nHave you told anyone or sought out help elsewhere? A friend or family member, or failing that an eating disorder charity, or therapy? Therapy helped me massively, especially as I was too anxious to tell anyone about my eating disorder at the time.\n\nGood luck and take care!",
