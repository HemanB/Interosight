  "selftext": "I see so many Instagram accounts of people who follow intense lifting programs and are super \u201cfit,\u201d claiming that they have overcome their eating disorders through lifting, etc. These people seem to still be obsessed with food and exercise and although being (physically) super fit, I question whether fitness has just allowed them a new (socially condoned) way of continuing their disordered thoughts and behavior? I was wondering if people had thoughts on this.",

I no longer follow crazy meal plans or work out for hours in the gym. I finally found freedom, and it was by letting go of control.",

When I first started recovery my immediate reaction was to do keto. I never gave a shit about macros prior to this. Even in my worst phase of anorexia, the only thing that mattered were calories. Now I start eating 2000 calories a day and suddenly I have to restrict carbs \"because reasons and stuff\". It gave me something to control and obsess over while eating a healthy amount of calories.  Also did intermittent fasting \"because reasons\" lol it's amazing how the mind works.",

      "body": "I think there are certain fitness cultures that cultivate, tolerate, and disguise EDs very well and naturally people that have an unhealthy relationship with their bodies often gravitate towards these sports, whether it be bodybuilding, dance, figure skating, long-distance running or otherwise.  \n\n\nOn the flipside, there are some sports that lend themselves much more to body positivity and or welcome a wider range of body types. Yoga and triathlon come to mind as being a couple. I think in these contexts tracking your personal progress or achievement on social media is more about performance and fueling rather than examining the aesthetics of a specific body part or obsessing over macro-nutrients.  \n\n\nI think that the divide between recreation and competitive also plays a role in hiding ED's. Competitive strains of any sport help to justify extreme eating behaviors and regimes much more than recreational ones.",

      "body": "Coming from just my personal experience, fitness really helped change my relationship with food. When I started crossfitting and lifting, I wanted to get stronger because my body felt so much better, and I began to see food as the fuel and energy my body needed in order to kick ass and feel great. In the beginning I counted calories and macros, but then I stopped caring about meeting certain numbers and my weight and more about how my body was feeling and the energy I had. I learned to eat intuitively for fuel, and although I worked out 5-6 days a week, it wasn't obsessive for me. It was just something I genuinely enjoyed and made me feel good. If I missed a day or had to take a week off it's fine, I don't need to get restrictive. My muscle memory will pick it back up when my body is ready again. I got excited about eating enough and fueling my body and being healthy. Mind you I do stick too a mainly clean diet and avoid certain foods due to intolerances and allergies and how some make me feel foggy and tired, and generally try to stay away from some foods I used to binge on, but I'm not highly restrictive and will indulge myself some treats at a party and not feel bad and ashamed about it. The disease is still there trying to drag me down always, it's mostly am emotional battle for me and every once in a while depression and anxiety will make me want to use ED behaviors to cope, but with fitness it makes it easier for me to not revert to them because I realize I want to be strong and feel healthy, and exercise helps with endorphins. Being healthy makes me feel happy.",
