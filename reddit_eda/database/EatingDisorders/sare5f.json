  "title": "request: anyone else feel the atypical diagnosis of anorexia is a bit invalidating?",
  "selftext": " \n\nmaybe it's just me but. most mental illnesses don't require a physical symptom to diagnose? it makes you feel like you can't even justify recovery and I'm not sick enough to deserve it. atypical is such an unnecessary word and adds fuel to the fire for me.\n\ni had a psychiatrist tell me last week that my problems weren't that concerning because my bmi is normal, despite the large number of concerning things i was telling her about. i was left feeling completely invalidated and just not enough. even if its to do with treatment you don't have to be underweight to suffer physically and be at severe risk with malnutrition? idk. its a hard one. it's hard to try and convince myself to recover from a problem when I'm being told it's not a problem:(",

The psychological component should be taken seriously as well as the behavioral and physical effects. It concerns me that your psychiatrist does not seem educated when it comes to EDs. You absolutely deserve treatment, specialized care and recovery.",

I just like to stick to \u201cED\u201d or \u201cmy eating disorder\u201d .. you don\u2019t need a doctor to validate what you and they know is unhealthy behavior. Focus your attention on what you can manage about your eating disorder and probable recovery rather than a label for it if that\u2019s possible for you. Part of ED behavior and what lies within, beneath, throughout an eating disorder is the possible feeling that you may never have felt validated in childhood, as a teen, at however old you were when it began through the now. Validate yourself and step out of the \u201cdiagnosis\u201d box.",

I found that when I was at my highest weight I was struggling so much more than I was at my lowest. People can only really understand this when they've gone through it, but just remember that being labelled 'atypical' does not mean that you are struggling any less or don't deserve the same treatment as those with so-called \"typical\" EDs.
