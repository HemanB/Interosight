  "selftext": "I am in a health class that I am required to take and this class involves calorie counting and discussion around weight and nutrition. Im am diagnosed with anorexia nervosa and am in the process of recovering. I am still not really in a good place with food and exercise but its a work in progress. Do I bring this up with my instructor as I dont want my ED to worsen? And if so what do i say? Do i wait to bring this up until the nutrition unit or tell him now? Its also uncomfortable as I just met him and hes not a female so i dont know if he will understand or just think im being dramatic. I also am nervous that he will ask for a dr note. I could ask my therapist to write one but i dont want her to think its stupid because although i have a eating disorder i have told her before that i dont want to recover (which is true) i have made progress in recovery but its not something im actively perusing but i also dont want to get worse and end up back in the hospital which is a very real possibility if i begin counting calories. i hope this all makes sense ",
