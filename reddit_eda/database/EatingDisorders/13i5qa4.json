  "selftext": "Just some context, I have battled with eating disorders for the past decade. \n\nDuring a meeting with my academic supervisor, I disclosed some mental health struggles since experiencing financial difficulties to pay for my course. She asked offhandedly if I had lost weight. I was a bit surprised she asked but I answered that yes I had lost weight. She replied that it \u201clooked good on me\u201d and that it\u2019s a \u201csilver lining\u201d to my struggles. I honestly don\u2019t know what to think, as I feel this is so inappropriate to say someone?!",

It didn\u2019t occur to her in her incompetent mind, that it could be a trigger. Sorry, I would SWITCH advisors asap and tell her why your doing it, so next time she will think before she opens her stupid mouth and hurt another student",

I guess some people should just not talk if they don\u2019t have a single braincell left to think about how their words could hurt someone. I\u2018ve made similar experiences. One told me she\u2018s jealous of my loss of appetite while I was struggling immensely.",
