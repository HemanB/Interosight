  "title": "Request: I just realized my mom is one of the reasons of my eating disorder",
  "selftext": "I (25F) just moved back with my mom after living by myself for 6 years due to covid. I\u2019ve always struggled with eating well and eating the \u201cright\u201d foods and avoiding the \u201cbad\u201d ones. I even did my bachelors in nutrition because I wanted to know more and it was a topic I always felt drawn to. During my years in college I was very happy with my eating habits, I never felt guilty and exercised a healthy amount of time due to the fact that I was learning a lot and nobody shamed anybody about what you ate.\n\nHowever, now that I\u2019ve moved back in... I feel guilty every time I eat a chocolate, chips or if I just feel like eating some noodles for dinner. I started noticing that every time I eat a \u201cbad\u201d meal, my mom always makes fun of me saying things such as \u201cwow you\u2019re eating so healthy\u201d or if she sees me grab a chocolate and a little bit later some chips, she would tell me to stop eating or raises her eyes when I go grab some snacks. She does the same when I don\u2019t exercise as well, which of course makes me feel guilty even though deep down I know it\u2019s healthy to take breaks and to not be so strict with your eating habits.\n\nTo be honest I don\u2019t know where to begin to start healing again as I always feel ashamed of my body and what I eat while I\u2019m living with her, I\u2019m in a healthy weight and I\u2019m an overall healthy adult but now food controls my life and I\u2019m always struggling to choose what to eat.\n\nWhat should I do?",

      "body": "I realised the same thing not long ago. I recovered from mine a few years ago but it has since come back due to my anxiety being rocked by job stress and financial stress. Thinking back to when I was 11, as a jazz dancer I remember going to get an extra spoon of pasta and she said \"watch your figure you're putting on weight\"\n\nShe then influenced me to go on a diet with her, making me have salads instead of bread. No rice or pasta, only allowed fish or chicken breast. I was 11. \n\nMy dad would take me to dance classes out of town once a week and he would treat me to a pie telling me I need to eat balanced foods to grow. My appetite was gone by high school and I would eat one muesli bar a day and dinner. When a doctor finally said what was happening to me, my mum said it was stupid of me to think that the diet was for me too. I finally realised I needed the carbs, the proteins etc and started lifting weights. \n\nI know it's easier said than done but give weights a go and your body will want you to eat. You're gorgeous! When we are little kids we are told to have three meals a day, big breakfasts are important, get your 5+ and eat like the food pyramid says. That shouldnt go out of the window because someone else judged you. It may come from their own insecurities, or fashion magazines. But you do you. Get your nutrients, go for a walk or a run \ud83d\ude01",

She had me dieting at the age of 12... It took me a long time to realize she was projecting. I don\u2019t live at home anymore and she still does it.

It takes redirecting your thoughts and validating your own feelings. It\u2019s a constant battle you\u2019ll be fighting. But good luck! If you need to talk, DM me.",
