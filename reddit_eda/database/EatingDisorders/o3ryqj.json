  "selftext": "my best friend is at a healthy weight but she\u2019s fixated on gaining weight. she tries every weight gain pill/supplement/gimmick and focuses on eating \u201cfattening\u201d foods. she\u2019s reached a point where she doesn\u2019t eat healthy food because she thinks it\u2019ll make her lose weight. I think she has body dysmorphia because she is and looks healthy/average but she thinks she\u2019s very underweight, though I don\u2019t know if what she has counts as an eating disorder.",

      "body": "Yup there is. I have had this for some time, trying to control a lot of aspects of my diet, counting calories, nutrients. Getting supplements for protein and amino acids, eating high cal foods, getting way too many pills. After some time you realise that calorie dense foods don't help, you still need to eat like a normal human. something like 50% carbs 20% protein 30% fats in every meal you eat, you can't just overfill one slice of bread with butter. At the end of the day it's a mental health issue and it's about control, not so much about confidence. If you think she needs a doctor then visit one with her if she can't do it alone, if she needs to gain weight tell her she needs to get a blender, it really makes a difference. She needs to go to a psychiatrist, try to make sure she doesn't give up on that",

I still don\u2019t understand exactly what I\u2019m going through but I noticed my anxiety of eating in public places is because I\u2019m scared people will judge me for not finishing a plate or judge me for being too thin? If that\u2019s even a thing and I worry if I don\u2019t eat at a certain time I\u2019ll loose weight. I could be wrong about what I have but seeing things like real women have curves is hurtful because it makes me feel like I\u2019m not not a woman.",
