No matter how physically how healthy and good I feel I mentally still crave restriction, it gives me a purpose to be alive. Is it possible to live my life while continuing with my eating disorder?",

      "body": "Absolutely. Through my eating disorder, I\u2019ve often had periods of happiness and moments of joy. Life inherently has moments of negative and positive emotions. Our goal is to have more positives than negatives, and unfortunately I think we need to make recovery progress to have sustainable long term happiness. \n\nThat said, The goal of \u201c100% recovery\u201d can feel really daunting and out of reach. I know it is for me at least, and when loved ones tell me I can\u2019t be happy until I\u2019m 100% recovered, I feel frustrated and angry that my current progress isn\u2019t recognized. I personally feel that any recovery progress is good progress, and you can set incremental goals. You can be happy in the depths of your ed and during recovery, but you probably can\u2019t enjoy everything life has to offer while sick. \n\nHave you spoken to a psychiatrist or therapist? Sometimes we need a little boost to really enjoy all life has to offer outside of our ED. \n\nWishing you love \u2764\ufe0f",

Now, nearly 2 and a half decades into this, I\u2019m more than ever convinced that while full recovery can be possible, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a life where I\u2019m ever truly free from all aspects of this disorder, mentally or physically.\n\nBut that\u2019s why I\u2019m a fan of harm reduction done on an individual level. It\u2019s not \u201cgiving up,\u201d it\u2019s a team/provider meeting you where you are and working on quality of life improvements and incremental steps forward in that way, that may hopefully lead to pursuing further ED recovery, but not given up on if that doesn\u2019t happen. There\u2019s usually a contingency of ED behavior at least being somewhat reduced or managed/monitored, but I\u2019ve seen a lot of people able to enjoy life again without the pressure of choosing between \u201cyou have to recover 100%\u201d (which feels impossible for many at various points) or \u201cyou have to be super sick and utterly miserable 100% of the time.\u201d",

      "body": "My wife has been bulimic and on Prozac since she was 16.  She\u2019s 54 now.  She still purges occasionally.  I have a hard time getting frequency out of her, but I think it\u2019s around 3 times a month on average, based on conversations we\u2019ve had.  That said, she lives a happy and normal life.  She\u2019s active and at a healthy weight.  Her kids are 18 and 20 and well adjusted.  At this point she\u2019s been purging for so long that she can easily do it without using her finger, so when she eats too much and/or is feeling \u201cchubby\u201d, as she puts it, she just goes to the bathroom, bends over, and out it comes.  It\u2019s dysfunctional, I know.  Her sister is a psychiatrist specializing in eating disorders and I\u2019ve talked to her about it, but she seems to let it slide.  After all this time, I think she\u2019s resigned herself that her sister is functional and there\u2019s nothing she can do.  I have some of my own issues around food that a specialist would likely consider dysfunctional, and I\u2019m generally happy too.  We understand each other and sometimes tease about it to keep it light.  I ask her now and then how the purging is going and she says \u201cit\u2019s fine\u201d.  I ask her to elaborate and she keeps it very vague.  My issues aren\u2019t physically destructive, whereas hers I fear are.  We\u2019ve talked about it and I\u2019ve brought up my concerns many times, but she is unwilling or unable to change at this point, so I don\u2019t know what else to do.  Stress is certainly a trigger for her (and me), and that affects her happiness far more than the ED, so our focus is on eliminating stress as much as possible.  It\u2019s been this way as long as I\u2019ve known her, so I don\u2019t expect it to change.",

That\u2019s my opinion and I\u2019ve been struggling for just over twenty five years. \nHowever I do agree with those who say they don\u2019t need to be fully recovered to be happy. The more positive steps to recovery should empower you and give you a sense of confidence and strength ingredients necessary for happiness.",
