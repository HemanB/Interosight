  "selftext": "My adult sister has an eating disorder and is going to die from it. She was placed on a feeding tube 2 months ago, and she passed her psych evaluation at the hospital. She did well for 1.5 months, but now is not feeding herself again. She is convinced that food in her body is bad among many other issues. She\u2019s somehow brainwashed (I think from Facebook and other social media) and is NOT psychologically sound. I have no clue how she passed her evaluation at the hospital. She has a son who she has now started to neglect and not pay any attention to. She isn\u2019t working or doing anything. She sits on the couch on her phone all day. Her husband is doing his best to handle everything, but doesn\u2019t know what to do. She says she wants to go to the hospital all the time because she doesn\u2019t feel good, but when it\u2019s time to go changes her mind. The doctors have said if she continues this path she is going to die. \n\nWhat can we do?! We\u2019re desperate. ",
