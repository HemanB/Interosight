I can\u2019t go inpatient, I own a home, have two dogs and I\u2019m single so I have no one to take care of my ish and pay my bills while I go get help. What do I do. Where do I start? I\u2019m so scared I\u2019m close to death and for the first time I\u2019m willing to get help, it just feels like I can\u2019t. How do I break these habits? Any book recommendations? Anything? Have any of you helped yourself? I even went 4 years of college to be an RD to help myself but got so sick I couldn\u2019t finish my last semester. I\u2019m open to anything but IP",

I am now recovered with my very own child (which was a primary motivation) and did it all online during covid lockdowns (we had long lockdowns in aus). \n\nIt wasn't cheap but I used a private psychologist to do the CBTE course (cognitive behavioural therapy for eating disorders). The first half will focus on eating habits and relearning to eat, this is because you cannot focus on the heavy cognitive parts without the brain fuel to process the heavy thoughts that come with therapy. \nThe second half focuses on attitudes and thought processes- basically unravelling the why of your disorder and how to stop or challenge different habits. \n\nIt definitely isn't too late and it isn't impossible. You can recover but it will take some time, patience and grace.",

I did an intake for outpatient treatment in my state (coercion by my EX therapist) but didn't qualify because of my vitals and labs (low heartbeat and low sodium). I swore I wouldn't go inpatient, I owned a bakery, leasing the building, I had wholesale customers that included grocery stores and I was the brains and brawn behind the operation (I only had three employees), had two kittens - two TWO MONTH OLD kittens at that. long story short - I procrastinated, but six months later I gave in and went. \n\nMy situation was similar to yours - same height, same digits, no period for 13 years, extremely high level of commitment responsibility...but you know how they say to use the oxygen on yourself before your child if the plane is going down? same applies here. you're not going to be much of a mom to your dogs or pay very many bills if you're dead.",

I will second what someone said earlier that your life is far more important than anything else- if you lose that, all the reasons cited for not doing IP are moot. That said, I understand your reservations- I am also a pet owner with responsibilities and not a lot of outside support. Some animal shelters/rescue agencies do offer temporary care/fostering for pets whose owners are in need of medical treatment/help. Try contacting some in your area to see if this is possible (even if you don\u2019t use it, it\u2019s good just to have that option in your back pocket.)\n\nIf IP is completely off the table- there are IOP and day programs that are super helpful in starting the recovery process. It will, at the bare minimum, help you get on a schedule, a meal plan and connected to a professional. \nEven if you decide not to go into IP or IOP, both of them will absolutely have resources and references for other sources of help and support. It\u2019s worth a call. You are worth reaching out and asking for help. \nIf this seems too daunting, could you ask a friend or trusted acquaintance to help with contacting one of them? Sometimes our emotional ties to these situations can make seeking help infinitely harder- someone on the outside helping will alleviate some of the emotional labor.\n\nAnother thing that greatly helped me was EMDR therapy, which can be done in person or remotely. I had spent 10+ years doing CBT/DBT and while it kind of \u201cmanaged\u201d my struggles, it didn\u2019t alleviate what I was dealing with and I often felt more stuck. Three sessions of EMDR was infinitely more helpful than all of the previous methods I tried combined. You just have to find the type that helps you. \nIf you have health insurance, you can typically search for therapists through your providers website. There are therapists and other low cost/free support options listed on the [NEDA website](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/free-low-cost-support). \n\nAs far as reading material: Life Without Ed, Boundaries, Unbearable Lightness. \n\nRooting for you OP.",

Try contacting some in your area to see if this is possible (even if you don\u2019t use it, it\u2019s good just to have that option in your back pocket.)\n\nIf IP is completely off the table- there are IOP and day programs that are super helpful in starting the recovery process. It will, at the bare minimum, help you get on a schedule, a meal plan and connected to a professional. \nEven if you decide not to go into IP or IOP, both of them will absolutely have resources and references for other sources of help and support. It\u2019s worth a call. You are worth reaching out and asking for help. \nIf this seems too daunting, could you ask a friend or trusted acquaintance to help with contacting one of them? Sometimes our emotional ties to these situations can make seeking help infinitely harder- someone on the outside helping will alleviate some of the emotional labor.\n\nAnother thing that greatly helped me was EMDR therapy, which can be done in person or remotely. I had spent 10+ years doing CBT/DBT and while it kind of \u201cmanaged\u201d my struggles, it didn\u2019t alleviate what I was dealing with and I often felt more stuck. Three sessions of EMDR was infinitely more helpful than all of the previous methods I tried combined. You just have to find the type that helps you. \nIf you have health insurance, you can typically search for therapists through your providers website. There are therapists and other low cost/free support options listed on the [NEDA website](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/free-low-cost-support). \n\nAs far as reading material: Life Without Ed, Boundaries, Unbearable Lightness. \n\nRooting for you OP.",
