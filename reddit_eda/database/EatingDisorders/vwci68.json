Everyday I wake up and hit myself with words \u201clook what you did to yourself\u201d and when I look at my self in the mirror I hate it . I always want to stay home so people can\u2019t see me. I really don\u2019t know what to do. How can I start healing ? How can I put a smile on and be proud of myself or at least accept my self ?",
