  "selftext": "Needless to say, there have been some...developments this week, and unfortunately, the coronavirus has food implications!\n\nFor those of us who struggle with snacking, portion control, and binging behavior...how have you balanced this with the instinct/logic to stock up on food re: coronavirus? This one is really frustrating for me. I usually don\u2019t purchase snacks or extra food to keep in the house because I end up eating it all or binging at some point. But now that everyone where I live (NYC) is stocking up on food in preparation for self quarantine, I don\u2019t know what to do. Half of me is like \u201cBUY THE FOOD. SURVIVAL FIRST.\u201d The other side of me is like, \u201cYou won\u2019t actually run out of food, people are panicking. Just continue as normal.\u201d Thoughts on what to do? I\u2019m incredibly torn.",

I would say I have trigger foods (ice cream, Nutella), but honestly when a serious urge comes (like you're not in control of your body and you see what you're doing and know it's wrong and hate yourself, but you can't stop) I just go from whatever is the sweetest to the least appetizing, like stale crackers. I don't think I have to explain the feeling of being so full, but still unable to stop until you're in literal pain - you guys seem like you've been there. \nI haven't seriously binged in a while since I started taking Contrave, but it's great to see this because people who don't struggle with control over food DO NOT get it. They think you're explaining a case of overeating when you say please don't bring cupcakes I will eat them all. Like no seriously, I will eat every cupcake and lick the plate for crumbs and then I'll go find something else and something else...\nIt's just really refreshing to see genuine understanding here.",

      "body": "Love the monkey analogy lol. It totally feels like I'm constantly trying to outsmart my binge brain. When it comes to making food and binging on that, I've tried to cut down on how much I make, or immediately putting extra stuff like batter in the freezer. Even that isn't fail proof. \n\nYou're definitely not alone. It's always embarrassing when my husband discovers I ate literally all of his cheese, but he's been living with all my eating problems for 6 years now and doesn't show signs of leaving. I know he doesn't like it, but he still loves me, and it's helped me remember that I'm more than just my binge self.\n\nAlso, I think they sell single serving mug cake kits now and they're pretty good! I also have a sweet tooth and it's hard to find stuff I won't binge on, but I've discovered that popsicles and fudgesicles do the trick and are really hard to binge on because I get a brain freeze.",

          "body": "I thought this was going to be about binging from anxiety, which is something I am having issues with lol. \n\nMy first grocery trip, I impulse bought a lot of comfort junk, which I ate through in like... two days and felt terrible about. 2nd trip, I bought a bunch of frozen veggies, canned beans, tuna, pasta, rice, cup noodle. Stuff I had to cook to eat. Also bought some comfort food like hot chocolate, frozen gyoza, instant oatmeal--but all still stuff I have to prepare before I eat it. That's honestly the key for me. I'm not going to binge on something I have to go through the trouble of cooking. I didn't buy out the store or anything but I bought enough to feel comfortable with in case things do get more serious.\n\nFor me, my binge trigger foods are bread, peanut butter, cereal, shredded cheese, and crackers. Turns out I can buy weeks worth of food that don't include any of those ingredients. Also highly recommend those individual servings of instant rice, pad thai kits that only have 1-2 servings, etc.",

          "body": "Love this insight (I\u2019m OP). Yeah, I\u2019ve noticed before that buying non-instant or non-snackable foods does help. However, my concern is sometimes if I don\u2019t buy any snacks at all, I end up making stuff\u2014like mug cakes, crepes, pancakes, very carb heavy items\u2014and binging all of that, which can be just as calorific. My solve for THAT was to just not buy flour and make baked goods anymore, but in a time of stockpiling it naturally is a key staple and also sometimes I want to make things like zucchini fritters and I need to buy flour...\n\nIt just gets so frustrating and humiliating sometimes. I feel like I\u2019m trying to trick some kind of monkey (my binging brain) into a cage (not binging) and I\u2019m pretzeling myself over something that \u201cnormal\u201d people don\u2019t even blink twice about. Thanks for making me feel less alone though, everyone.",

People around me only know that I have trouble eating enough but don't know about my bulimia so it's extra hard to deal with this on my own.\n\nI hate that it is took such a huge crisis for reality to really hit me but I've actually been doing great these last ~ two weeks. Whenever I even get the slightest urge to b/p I just hit up the internet and read about Italy/corona in general... And it almost completely subsides. \n\nOf course it's still in the back of my head but I can handle it so much better. To be honest, I always felt so f'ing guilty about how much food I literally wasted but now it's just so much more real and close to home. \n\nI really hope you'll be able to stay healthy and safe too!! And I'm proud of you too! Every ED is hard to go through, however mild it may seem, and it takes a lot of willpower to not give in to it!",

I don't buy into the whole panic *that much* but I sure as hell don't want to be one of those people who didn't prepare themselves at all and have other people tell me \"hate to say I told you so\" *if things really get as bad as some people think*. \n\n\nPersonally...\nActually the pandemic is what kicked off my recovery for real this time.\n\nI live close to Italy and seeing how they're doing over there and that food is indeed getting scarce slowly gave me a big reality check... \n\nI bought canned food, rice, snacks, chocolate, cookies, peanut butter, whatever I could find that's high caloric and stocked up on it so that it will lady me at least a month or two. \nI put it away in my pantry (out of sight out of mind) and started eating semi normally again. (I still count calories but don't binge and purge anymore)\n\nThe worst thing that could happen right now is continuing my behavior and having some sort of medical emergency because of it. First off, beinf as underweight as I am is also pretty scary during a pandemic as I'm not sure how my body would handle the virus. And secondly, I don't want to have to go to a hospital where I'd take up space that's desperately needed *or* get the virus there  on top of whatever I'm there for.",
