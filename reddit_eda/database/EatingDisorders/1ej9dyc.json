  "selftext": "I\u2019ve had a long battle with PTSD and severe depression. I usually would binge after work because of all the stress and self loathing - cake, icecream, chips, fries. \n\nToday, though I was emotionally at a low, I didn\u2019t binge! Instead of door dashing fries, I had some carrots and hummus. \n\nIn tears, I feel like I hit a breakthrough. Just wanted to share - change is possible. Keep fighting! ",
