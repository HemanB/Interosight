  "title": "I think my friend has an eating disorder and it\u2019s triggering me",
  "selftext": "I have been in recovery for two years now, and other than a couple brief relapses, I\u2019ve been doing really good. I made a friend last year, let\u2019s call them Georgia. Georgia has always had weird eating habits, such as eating extremely slowly and cutting food into tiny pieces, to the point they get full up really quickly and end up not eating enough. They have gotten worse recently and I\u2019ve been around them for a few days and they half finish their meal and say they\u2019re full up. They also refuse to see there\u2019s a problem, or even tell me that even though it\u2019s obvious. I was fine with it before bc I thought it was because of their autism, but they\u2019re underweight and I have been getting more and more triggered by their eating habits. I had a month long relapse the other month because I saw their legs, unfortunately where I live now doesn\u2019t offer the same level of support for ED\u2019s than where I used to live.\n\nI\u2019m relapsing, and I know it\u2019s partially because of Georgia. Not that it\u2019s their fault but I feel so competitive and self conscious eating with them as they barely eat. They\u2019re my best friend and I don\u2019t want to let them go, but I can\u2019t be around them when they eat like that. My ED is telling me that I should because I like the trigger, but obviously I don\u2019t want my ED to win. I\u2019m just scared of it getting bad. I\u2019m going to tell my therapist about what\u2019s been going on next session I have but I have a bad feeling I won\u2019t get the help I need until I get really unwell. I want to recover but it\u2019s very hard alone. My mh services in my area are terrible.\n\nIm wondering is it worth keeping them as a friend? Should I try get them help? I would tell their family but their family can be toxic sometimes, at least one of their parents but I know they\u2019d get them the help. I would unfortunately lose their trust. Please help I need advice",
