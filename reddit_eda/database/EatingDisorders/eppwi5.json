  "selftext": "Hi. I am on mobile so sorry for formatting. \nI\u2019m in a relationship with a girl and I love her more than anything. She is so beautiful and perfect in my eyes. However, she does not love herself like I do. She recently has been diagnosed with bulimia (except she does not binge) and it is getting worse. She has had it for a while though because one time we purged together and we gave each other tips on how to do it better. Looking back, it was fucked up. At the time, I was excited to have someone indulge in the same bad behaviours as I do. I am (trying) to be in recovery after 4 years of bulimia and when I look at her I see my past self in the early stages of this vicious disease. My girlfriend is also very open about her eating disorder and doesn\u2019t mind talking about how she just purges, is fasting, etc in public. I feel like I may have encouraged her because in March she caught me purging and tried it. I feel awful. I love her so much but whenever she talks about these things it just makes me miss my old habits so much. She also kind of makes it obvious to me when she is purging or fasting and I do not know if it is a cry for help or for attention. It also hurts me to see her go through what I went through. I do not know what to do because she is my best friend.",

I think if it\u2019s detrimental to your own health and recovery, you should shut this avenue down with them. Tell them where you\u2019re at and why you need this for yourself. It\u2019s not ideal but put yourself first. It\u2019s hard to do but you are worth it.",

It may be bad but in order to not hinder your recovery, it may be best to distance yourself from her.
