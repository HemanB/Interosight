It's been three years and it seems to be showing up again.\n\nmy body doesn't have the strength to do this again although my mind says otherwise.\n\nVenting helps but so do things that can prevent this from occurring, I think it will help me in the long run. Cheers",

It helps me some to keep a short list of activities on hand that comfort or distract me when I get the urge to succumb to disordered behaviors...snuggling into a cozy bed with a book or podcast, taking a bath, going for a walk, having a solo dance party. Whatever it is you do to love yourself and de-stress.",
