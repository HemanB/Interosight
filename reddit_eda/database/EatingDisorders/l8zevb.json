  "title": "Request: I fainted and got my wake up call",
  "selftext": "(F18) A few days ago I fainted while I was walking my dog. I hit my head on the ground and it still hurts. I skipped breakfast and didn\u2019t drink much. I\u2019m underweight and been struggling with an ED since I was 15 and my family doesn\u2019t know I control my weight because I don\u2019t \u201clook\u201d typically anorexic. I never thought of it as a problem because I never got to the extreme with not eating. I had phase of counting calories but I still keep a careful track of what I eat. Nobody knows I panic when I see the numbers grow on the scale and can\u2019t see the bones on my chest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is the first time I understood it has a direct affect on my health. My mum noticed I should eat more and now she forces me to eat. She knows I have had some mental health issues in the past so each time a new problem emerges she pushes it away by telling me I\u2019m seeking attention. She is naturally underweight and always hated this about herself but also comments on other people when they\u2019re overweight. She judged me when I ate more than her and she judges my appearance a lot which makes me feel terrible about myself. When I confront her about this, she tells me that I shouldn\u2019t be so \u201cfragile\u201d, because it\u2019s only her opinion. When she does sometimes notice I don\u2019t eat normally she gets aggressive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know I should get some help but on the other hand I\u2019m afraid to tell anybody because they\u2019ll think I\u2019m seeking attention, but on the other hand I\u2019m afraid that when I move out it\u2019ll get out of hand.",

Also, talking to someone could make a world of difference. sending lots of positive vibes your way, I believe in you!",

Leave some for us!\u201d And it triggers it again and makes me feel like shit. I told my mum a couple of times that these comments make me feel bad about myself but she never listens and just says it\u2019s her opinion. Anyway, thank you for the kind words \u2764\ufe0f",
