It was an easy excuse to say no 2 eating. Saying that - 10 yrs later - being vegan actually really helped me heal and have a better grasp on my ED and has helped me live a healthier lifestyle - like I can restrict but in a healthy way vs being in a toxic cycle. It is interesting starting this way tho bcuz caring about animals and environmental impacts of not being vegan became more important and a part of the reason I\u2019m vegan later into my journey of veganism. Lol sorry I\u2019m rambling.",

I would assume people are more likely to restrict carbs- than protein. \n\nLet\u2019s remember it\u2019s about the intention of the diet that makes it an ED or not, not the actual diet, you can be Keto, vegan, paleo, plant based, IF, low carb, or eat anything and not have an ED.   \n\nWhat makes an ED is an intention and feeling of control around food, not the actual food.

Based on the people I met in treatment, 2/12 of us were or had been vegan, although several more were vegetarian. I was the only one (as far as I know) who was vegan before I fell into my ed, the other person went vegan during theirs. In any given group of people with eds, there are probably more vegans than in a random sample of the general population, but I don't think that the majority of people with eds are vegan or that most vegans have eds. I also don't think that most people with eds \"start off\" by going vegan, because there's a whole phenomenon of people going vegan in recovery (often as a way to reduce food guilt and avoid weight gain, both of which are disordered and not recovery focused). \n\nIn my case, even though some professionals have tried to convince me otherwise, going vegan was not part of me developing my ed. I went fully vegan when I moved out of my parents' home and went to uni, and then I developed my ed the summer after my first year at uni, so there was a whole 8-9 months where I was vegan but not at all disordered. I had also previously been pescatarian and then vegetarian for most of my life (since I was 7). I am still vegan now a full year into recovery, weight restored and all!\n\nI think it is a red flag when people suddenly go vegan, especially if they do any of the highly-restrictive versions of veganism that go beyond protecting the environment or saving animals, eg. raw veganism. Unless you absolutely have to have a diet that restrictive due to a medical condition, there is no reason to make veganism even more restrictive than it already is. Also, suddenly going from a \"normal\" diet to a strict vegan overnight is bound to set you up for difficulties figuring out what to eat which could lead to an ed. If anyone is looking into becoming vegan, I would say to not do it until you are stable in your recovery, and I would advise that you start with something less restrictive like pescatarianism and gradually work towards veganism if you can do it without old ed habits coming back.\n\nSorry for the very long post, I hope this all makes sense!",

Saying that - 10 yrs later - being vegan actually really helped me heal and have a better grasp on my ED and has helped me live a healthier lifestyle - like I can restrict but in a healthy way vs being in a toxic cycle. It is interesting starting this way tho bcuz caring about animals and environmental impacts of not being vegan became more important and a part of the reason I\u2019m vegan later into my journey of veganism.
