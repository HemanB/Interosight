  "selftext": " \n\nHi friends,\n\nI want to share a bit of my story and I hope it will give you some hope. I developed my ED at 10 years old. I\u2019ll spare you the details but it was a long, horrific and often unbearable 17 years that I suffered from my eating disorders. I did not receive treatment until I was in my 20s and once I started treatment it became an even more horrific fight for my life.\n\nEating disorders are no joke. They are dangerous, serious and deadly. I am saying this because I care about your life, your well being and your quality of life. Eating disorders suck everything out of you... I am not talking physically as we all know ED\u2019s come in every shape and size - I am talking they take away your personality, friends, family, interests. They completely wreck your life and do so unapologetically.\n\nAfter years of treatment I can proudly say I am recovered from my eating disorders. And I know you can too. If you need support, I\u2019m here. If you need encouragement, I\u2019m here. My hope for you is that you\u2019ll find someone safe and reach out to them for help. It takes a village. It takes help. AND it is 100% ACHIEVABLE.\n\nRECOVERY IS POSSIBLE! RECOVERY IS AMAZING! I BELIEVE IN YOU!",

      "body": "It\u2019s absolutely possible and this is coming from someone who for years was adamant it wasn\u2019t possible for me specifically (us with EDs really like to make ourselves the exception to what is possible bc it\u2019s what the ED tells us.) \n\nFor me, I know there will never be a time in my life where those terrible thoughts do not creep up, but they don\u2019t control me. I am at a point where I am just angry. I\u2019m angry at all my ED stripped from my own life. Opportunities, my physical body (I have lasting damage), and even the possibility of having children. I\u2019m angry at the people I have lost to their ED. I\u2019m angry at the lies it told me and the way it coerced me into consuming my soul and wreck my body.\n\nBeautiful, smart, and talented people just overtaken by this nasty disease.  My ED became apparent at 7, and by 23 I was dying and for 7 years I\u2019ve fought like hell and today, at 30 years old, I am alive to tell anyone who may benefit from it that it IS possible to not only be in recovery, but to be happy without the eating disorder. I can also tell you that even though it\u2019s a daily battle, it DOES get easier.\n\nLife is extremely short, please, please, PLEASE, do everything you can to keep this horrid disease from taking even more from your life. Even if you don\u2019t feel like it is worth living in the moment, try to trust that there are people who see your worth even when your can\u2019t and there will be so much in your future that will make it all worth it. Even on the hardest days. \n\nMuch love warriors! \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c",
