  "title": "Request: My girlfriend of 5 years has an eating disorder.",
  "selftext": " \n\nWhat can I do to help her? I'm unsure of when exactly  it started but she told me within the first 6 months of dating. She  told me her brother and others would make fun of her for being  overweight by her brother and some people at school when she was in  middle school and high school, so I can assume it started around 10  years ago since she is 25. She is like 5' 7 and maybe weighs xxx pounds (very thin)  now. Her parents know but I'm not sure to the extent, since they never  mention it. They are probably just pretending it's not a problem because  they feel bad/helpless. Heck, I'm not even sure how often she does it  because we don't live together, but I do know she has acid reflux and  sensitive teeth because of it. I try sometimes to talk about it but she  just says that she has good days and bad days sometimes. I've told her  to talk to a professional because I feel helpless, but she gets  defensive. I'm at a loss. I love her and want to help her to the best of  my ability.",

Usually not talking about eating helps me personally. If you\u2019re having a snack, offer her some casually. If you don\u2019t make it a big deal, she\u2019s likely to be less defensive of it.",

      "body": "It sounds like you are a very sensitive and caring partner to her, which is a lot of help already. Its also great that you are encouraging her to seek professional help. In my experience, especially when considering seeking some form of treatment it was a lot easier (if I wanted the help, because sometimes I didn\u2019t, because I wasn\u2019t ready) if someone I trusted and cared about helped me make those phonecalls, appointments, etc. however, you know already that you cant force her to get help she is t ready to receive. offering to make calls, schedule appts, if you are able might be helpful if she has anxiety about the nuts and bolts of getting treatment.\n\nim sure you already know this too, but I would avoid making comments about her appearance, food choices, etc. even positive remarks can be misinterpreted or twisted by her illness. being a safe person to eat with but not the food police (which is a hard balance to strike, I realize) is what would be helpful- because she won\u2019t feel pressure, but will also (potentially) begin to feel comfortable making some steps, with you. Sometimes when no one acknowledges something that is a very obvious problem the ED can convince sufferers that \u201cit isn\u2019t bad enough to reach out\u201d or that they \u201caren\u2019t really ill\u201d etc so I do think that somewhere deep down she appreciates that you are aware that she is in pain and that you see her suffering. In addition, it\u2019s useful to make sure she knows that you see her behind her illness- and that could become a really motivating factor for her to get better: you love her personality, her talents, her skills, etc and those are denigrated by the disease.\n\nI would also just remind you to make sure you are taking care of yourself, as well. I know you don\u2019t live with her but caring emotionally for someone with a serious disorder can take a toll on your own health so be sure to keep yourself well, and allow yourself to set healthy boundaries as well. You\u2019re already doing a great job- it\u2019s clear that you care a lot about her.",

Just don\u2019t get mad or upset with her over it at any point, it will only make her worse. Don\u2019t try to force food on her it will probably make her very upset. Just show her that u care about her and how much u love her and tell her everyday how beautiful she is.",

If you fear it's to that point without her acceptance, mention things you plan for the future with the 2 of you, get her thinking of the ahead and not on the past or her present disorder. Get her out of  a cycle that's repetitive and try to go for dates like a walk in nature or just a nice drive.",

      "body": "First off, we all need a man like you in our lives.\n\nIt's clear that you want to help her which is amazing.\n\nRecovery is the choice of the individual, nobody can make us (trust me all of my loved ones have tried). The sufferer has to be ready to make the choice for themselves.\n\nEating disorders are chronic and difficult to treat with a high rate of relapse. This doesn't mean recovery isn't possible, it's just really fricking difficult.\n\nI find being able to speak openly with the person I'm eating with is so helpful. Being able to casually mention \"I'm anxious that when the food comes out that something will be wrong\" (for example) and experience a supportive response makes me feel so much more at ease with eating.\n\nTake it day by day. One day she might want to eat with you and stuff, other days she might dig the heels in. One day she might over react, one day she might have a lovely meal with you. Be supportive, understanding and forgiving when she over reacts. Celebrate the small victories when you have a nice meal together and really savour that time with her. \n\nDon't ever try to make her eat. Express concern and be tactful with her. Choose your timing well when raising concerns. Encourage her to get help and look up local resources. Tell her she isn't alone. When she talks to you about it, really listen to her. If you don't know what to say in response to her, it's OK. Remember you're not an expert and you won't become one overnight. Just be as supportive as you can.",

      "body": "I think you feel helpless because you are.  People with mental disorders or addictions have to first acknowledge the problem and then feel the necessity of getting help.  I lived with an alcoholic for years feeling helpless because he was ruining our family with abusive behaviour.  Saying anything just made matters worse because he felt 'pressured'.  Ironically, he lost me and alienated himself from his kids and eventually sought help and is now a non drinker.  Your GF will have to come to terms with it and deal with it.  It's wonderful that you are trying to be an encouragement to her.  She is not ready if she's getting defensive.  I stayed because I felt guilty to leave.  I sought counselling for myself and eventually realized that the responsibility for the situation was not mine.  I wasn't the one with the problem.",

I always asked him to help but now I regret it because he tracks my eating and if I buy anything junk food like he will make me throw it away. I know he is trying to help but it makes me want to sneak food and binge more. This has now been discussed and worked on. \n\nIf she is seeing any therapists or groups encourage her to go and talk about her session afterwards with you. It seems she isn't doing that but maybe encourage her to go to group therapy? Its a good start. There is a foundation called Linda Tremble that does them for free. It is UK based but maybe they will take her? \n\nTL;DR: Encourage help, don't force her to eat.",
