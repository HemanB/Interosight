  "selftext": " \n\nI don\u2019t know how to be okay with seeing parts of myself as bigger or smaller everyday, or even if these changes are real. I\u2019ve dealt with body dysmorphia for almost as long as I can remember, and even with therapy once a week, I still struggle with accepting what I see in the mirror everyday. Every morning I wake up and inspect my stomach, thighs, arms to make sure they aren\u2019t bigger or different than they were the previous day, and every morning I look different to myself. Does anyone else feel as though their body fluctuates everyday? Is this real or just dysmorphia messing with my mind? Any advice would be more than greatly appreciated.",
