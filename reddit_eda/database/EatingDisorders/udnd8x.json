      "body": "There are usually two main reason people binge:\r\n\n1. Physical restriction - you are literally eating too few calories/not enough nutrients to support your body's energy needs/healthy body function and the binges are your body's way of making up for it. \r\n2. Emotional restriction - you are telling yourself that certain foods are \"off limits\" - for example, \"I can't have cookies and potato chips because these foods are bad for me\" - so eating the \"forbidden\" foods is ALLL you can think about (because that's just the way the human brain works.) \r\n\nI trust that you can figure out which one you are (it may be both). \r\n\nIf you're in bucket 1, you need to eat food - when you're hungry, when you're not hungry but know that you won't have a chance to eat for a while and will be ravenous later, at regular intervals throughout the day, until you are full. You need to eat well-balanced meals (fats, proteins, and, YES, even carbs.) You may find that you need to eat bigger meals in order to feel full than before your eating disorder, but that's okay - your body is making up for potentially years of restriction. Your hunger levels will settle eventually.  \r\n\nIf you're in bucket 2, you need to stop telling yourself that you are \"not allowed\" certain foods. You need to have these foods around and available whenever you want them. Sure, you may \"overdo\" it at first, but eventually these foods will lose their novelty (ie you will get bored of them). You will probably even find that eventually you won't want them anymore/choose to put something different on your plate instead! \r\n\nI would also look into the Intuitive Eating protocol for fixing your relationship with food (basically, it teaches you what I already mentioned above and more). There are tons of great Intuitive Eating resources online, including the original Intuitive Eating book. Good luck!",

I still have my slips weekly, sometimes multiple times a week, but it is much more manageable.\n\nMy advice - quit dieting, quit exercising, quit counting calories\n\nFocus on yourself. Go to therapy and get on medication if necessary (I am still on medication and have been from the ages of 21 when I had severe depression and suicidal thoughts, to today, where I am 32. I am also a male.\n\nDisordered eating comes when you have mentally changed your thinking with food and what food really is. It ALL has nutrition in some way, so it is all \"good\". Do not restrict anything but that does not mean you have a free range to eat an entire box of cookies, or three, like I used to do.\n\nThe biggest thing that worked for me was changing my environment. I was in the Army and I needed in-patient treatment to get me out of the Army for 30 days. This got me semi-better but I think therapy is definitely beneficial even without inpatient.\n\nhope this helps!",
