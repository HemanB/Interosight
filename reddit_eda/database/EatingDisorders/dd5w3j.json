  "title": "Request: Any tips on how to stop binging?",
  "selftext": "I struggled with anorexia since 2015 and kind of entered a quasi recovery state in 2018 where I got really into fitness and calorie counting. I\u2019m trying to release myself from my eating disorder and finally return to normalcy so lately I\u2019ve let myself eat a more normal amount of food without calorie counting (keep in mind I haven\u2019t really been restricting for a long time now, just being very careful of what and how much food I put into my body). However, this has led to entire month of binging (think at least two or three times a week) and I really don\u2019t know how to stop. I feel my body becoming softer and I don\u2019t know how to react or cope. I stuff myself until I\u2019m sick and it\u2019s becoming a habit and I feel so lost. My mind is so angry at me for losing the willpower I took years to create.",

Stop restricting food in all it's forms (i.e. keto, low carb, fasting, restricting after a binge, etc). Make peace with all foods. Including the forbidden ones.\n2. Eat 4 meals a day including snacks. Trust me. Eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and a little more. In order to stop your brain from sounding the \"WE ARE STARVING\" alarms and pumping panic hormones throughout your body,  you have to consistently feed it. If you are currently bingeing on 1000's of calories in 1 sitting, you can eat 3+ meals a day with much less consequence. Think of it as eating more to eat less.\nTrust me. As soon as your brain and body trusts that it won't be deprived again, the binges WILL stop. And you will FEEL it. The food obsession/fixations will STOP. You will feel clear headed and strong. \nNourish and honor your body. \u2764\ufe0f",

Where you are eating without control, in secret, with shame associated after you binges, not even tasting your food hardly. That is a problem, and it won't stop when your body realizes it's not in starvation mode anymore. This will become your new normal and itll be very problematic. \n\nI can't tell you how to stop because I'm bulimic and don't know how to stop either. I understand their point of saying don't stop, but I don't agree with it. \n\nDo you see a therapist? Seek professional help.",

As one former treatment center director always told us, it's like switching chairs on the Titanic. If u are truly binging (eating what most people consider an abnormal amount of food), if it's in secret, if u feel out of control or ashamed, u may be headed down that path. If u have a therapist and/or nutritionist I highly recommend speaking with them about this. Having said that, there is validity to.previous comments about your body avoiding going into starvation mode. From ur post, it sounds like uve been in recovery to.some degree for a while so that should have settled down at this point. When u feel the urge to binge coming on, stop and ask urself if u are physically hungry, how long it's been since ur last meal, what emotion are u feeling that u may be trying to numb out?

It\u2019s an evolutionary advantage, and it happens across species... it\u2019s just humans have the mental ability to purposely restrict, whilst you\u2019d not see that purposeful restriction in other animals. \n\nIf you forgot to feed your pet dog one evening, he\u2019d be really really hungry the next morning at breakfast and he\u2019d wolf down his food really quickly in the hope that more would be given to him. Alternatively, in the wild when animals face famine, they will eat everything they can when food is around - just in case they\u2019re faced with another famine. \n\nYour body is trying to save you. It\u2019s totally acceptable for you to eat significantly more than you have previously. Once your body learns that it isn\u2019t in a famine scenario anymore (which will happen if you eat consistently, regularly, and don\u2019t deprive yourself), the hunger will level off. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to deal with, I\u2019ve had it myself... but if you listen to it and feed yourself more, it fades eventually.",
