  "selftext": "I'm a 30 year old woman with an aggressive eating disorder. \nTW for sexual abuse.\n\nWhen I was six years old, I was repeatedly raped by an older cousin. I'm sure it's not difficult to imagine the trauma that comes with SA, but there was a line he said to me that stuck with me, that reverberates in my mind. He said \" I'm doing this to you because your body is so beautiful, I can't resist it. You also shouldn't wear these short dresses. It's your fault.\"\n\nI never recovered from those words. What followed was a 24 year old self inflicted ritual of abuse and torture. Binge eating, puking, drug use, alcoholism, extreme workouts being some of them. \nI started dressing up to hide my body. I'd wear a chest binder so nobody would pay attention to my chest. I'd wear oversized clothes, didn't do my hair. I've never worn makeup. \n\nI don't go outside. Men scare me to the point that I throw up when I think about an interaction with them. \nI have been to numerous psychiatrists and have only been told \"it was a long time ago\" and that I must \"face my worst fears\" or step out of my comfort zone. \n\nI don't have a comfort zone, let's make that clear. I've only been in pain, since I was 6. I think about death a lot. \n\nThat's about it I guess. I just wanted someone to know a part of my story. \nIf anyone has any suggestions on how to deal with self hate and eating disorders please let me know. \nThank you for reading.",
