  "selftext": "Can\u2019t include the video unfortunately, but it was an ad for a calorie counting, dieting app called \u201cEato\u201d and they specifically had the \u201cIf I get more pretty do you think he will like me\u201d part at the beginning, and then played the beginning \u201cShut up, count your calories. I never look good in mom jeans. Wish I was like you. Blue-eyed blonde, perfect body\u201d part.\n\nI know this isn\u2019t new. People have been misusing this song on diet-TikTok for years\u2026 it\u2019s just even sadder to see it used in a literal advertisement for weight loss\u2026 *this* is what they\u2019re trying to encourage.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, but it really does *not* take a genius *OR* someone with an eating disorder to realize that this song is clearly about someone who struggles with body image issues and insecurity whether you know they\u2019re talking about having an eating disorder or not.\n\nIt\u2019s just disgusting.",

And I\u2019m 10 years weight restored, and 8 years mentally recovered, but I don\u2019t know how to make others care enough to ban advertisements like this.\n\nEdit: Especially some of the ads I\u2019ve seen recently which have started with \u201cwhat I eat in a day\u201d straight to calorie counting ads AND the calorie count mentioned IS ALSO below the minimal amount that is generally seen as minimally okay.",
