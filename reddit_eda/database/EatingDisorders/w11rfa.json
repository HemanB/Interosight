I\u2019m still in recovery so sorry for being so raw. But definitely tell your family to not make comments about your weight or how good you\u2019ve been eating, cause some peoples mind automatically goes to you called me fat which is obviously tied to the ED. Also I love the comments above \u261d\ufe0f*",
