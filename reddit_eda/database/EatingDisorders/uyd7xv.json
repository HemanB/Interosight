  "selftext": "I'm in a very small discord server with some friends, where about 5-10 of us are active and chat, and the rest of the people I'm assuming don't check the server or just get notifications. We were discussing cheese because I said I didn't like it, and we were joking about the mould etc. My friend received a DM from someone in the server asking if we could spoiler or put TWs for food. I don't know who it was or whether or not they were part of the conversation or just got notifications, but it just seems odd to be putting trigger warnings for food, when food is something that should be normalised for people with EDs rather than further creating a barrier of fear around it. Thoughts?",

      "body": "Interesting topic. It's important for those in recovery to identify triggers in order to help overcome challenges throughout recovery (lived experience here). For example, early recovery, my friends in a small whatsapp chat all shared recipes and meal pics where they'd been to cool restaraunts etc. They were all aware of my ED and recovery, and tbh when there would be a surge of notifications around recipes... food pics... emotions that would come up: frustration, annoyance, sometimes sadness that I would deny myself those foods even though I wanted them. What did this show? What I needed to work through and overcome to enjoy discussing food and meals freely, which I've only ever dreamed of! Sometimes exposure is needed, sometimes we take breaks because we need to protect ourselves and our recovery. Finding balance is when we heal.\n\nIt's hard to see the neccessity in 'TW' when discussing food, one of the wonderful parts of recovery is when food becomes exactly what it is again, rather than something that holds fear.",

So surely using tw for food makes it seem like it's also somehow wrong or scary?? Seems really counterintuitive especially since 'normalising' food is so important when it comes to eds. I saw someone compare the use of a food tw to how ed treatment is done - you're constantly thinking about food, talking about it etc. it's essentially exposure therapy and avoiding it is going to be more harmful, especially if it's with a warning which is usually associated w scary and bad things",
