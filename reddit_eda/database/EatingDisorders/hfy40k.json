  "selftext": "Need help for my son (M15)\n\nMy son came home recently from a socially distanced (UK) outing with his girlfriend.  She shared with him she may have ED tendencies including 1) vomiting after meals, 2) anxiety when too much food is served to her on her plate.  I\u2019m looking for guidance to share with him.\n\n1) how to respond to GF?\n2) what resources there are for her in the UK (we are recent immigrants)\n3) how long before we adults intervene?  He says the relationship will be over if we raise with her parents (which I am ready to do when needed?\n4) what support should we offer him?\n\nShe shared COVID isolation has made her situation more challenging.  Any thoughts welcome.\n\nTLDR: son\u2019s girlfriend may have ED, seeking help.",

      "body": "Heya, that sounds like quite difficult situation for everyone. Obviously your son and you both want to do the right thing by her. I would suggest against going straight to her parents, and depending on the relationships with everyone (and social distancing ofc) maybe try to chat to her about it and see if she is currently getting any help. \n\nShe can raise this with anyone at her school / college if shes goes to school, or she can chat to her GP.  [https://www.beateatingdisorders.org.uk/recovery-information/going-to-the-doctor](https://www.beateatingdisorders.org.uk/recovery-information/going-to-the-doctor) has some great resources for these types of conversations if you think they're appropriate. \n\nDon't break her trust without first encouraging her to reach out for herself, but know that at the end of the day you cannot be responsible for her. I hope this helps.",

They will do an initial assessment within days, if she is judged high risk then she will be accepted for treatment within five days, otherwise it can take longer but shouldn\u2019t be more than two weeks but no more than four weeks.\n\nI would encourage you to gently persuade her to ask for treatment as I know how damaging Eating Disorders are, her being truthful with your son is a good indication that she herself is worried.  Bare in mind that if her medical team believe her to be at risk, they may have to inform her parents or her school.",

Assuming she is a similar age to your son it\u2019s important he encourages her to speak to her GP as support as you get older is hard to access however he needs to do that in a supportive encouraging way not in an accusatory way. \nI would check it the BEAT website as it has lots of useful information.",

I'd be worried about him taking on a caretaker role and would just want to make sure he has boundaries and understands that you can't help people who won't help themselves and that doesn't make either of the people involved bad",

My first advice would be for your son to help persuade her to talk to her GP and parents if possible. The GP will do blood tests and measure her vitals, I was very ill from purging and it can affect your heart and everything.\nThe GP will then refer her to CAMHS and the ED service to monitor her and it will be good for her to get on the system. I have had help for four years now in the uk and depending on where you are in the country the help can be great!\nBEAT is also great and there are a lot of charities online",

To some  people they were predisposed genetically to have an eating disorder, but those cases are very few.  Most cases come from a poor upbringing, poor boundaries and the person with an eating disorder like any addiction has no who they are and how they got into that mess of trying to control their body.\n\nI feel bad for you son because he sounds like he feels responsible to rescue her.  You really want to be observant and ask your son why he\u2019s focusing on other people instead of himself.  \n\nPlease know it is not your job to help someone even doctors don\u2019t save, they can\u2019t they give enough information so the patient does all the work on their own.  \n\nYou have to make a tough call and focus on your boundaries, if you already have enough on your plate what are you willing to prioritize.  Addicts are self destructive and addicts should not be focusing on relationships instead get as much help, be self sufficient so they can be strong for any relationship.  \n\nThese are some tough decisions.  You help her, she becomes dependent and you guys will end up resenting each other because you have poor boundaries.  What are your boundaries?  Figure that out first and then talk to your son about them and figure out a plan for you and your son first and then research helplines and suggest them to the person with the eating disorder.  \n\nThe only way you can address the elephant in the room, the addict is confronting kindly, sitting them down and listing your boundaries and being firm on them.\n\nLet\u2019s be real here, your son has pretty poor boundaries and he learned them from you otherwise you would be blindsided coming to reddit asking questions.",

Your BA means nothing to me, but it means everything to you and I know you worked hard and I congratulate you for that.  \n\nYou have that right to not know me, I respect that.  You, willing put yourself on the internet, on a public forum where everyone is allowed their perspective, I am exercising my right.  I don\u2019t find your information healthy.  You still have your addiction because you don\u2019t know who you are.  Why should I follow someone who is still trying to find who they are?  It\u2019s blind leading the blind.\n\nWhether you are offended, that\u2019s on you.  That\u2019s your problem.  Do I still consider you needy, yes.  The fact you feel so entitled, convinced your bragging of a useless BA degree, which no one can hire you right now with already shows you lack self awareness.  Your lack of self awareness is a liability to any employer.  I still believe you will recover and that will be in your own time.  May your journey continue.\n\nI guarantee you\u2019re going to look at your eating disorder as an addiction.  Anorexic, being underweight, under your genetic set weight, you\u2019re drunk constantly. Bulimic when you puke, you release endorphins makes throwing up addictive and the high you get from the attention you get from forcing yourself to be tiny rinse and repeat.  But again, congrats you got over the worst.  You realized re-feeding yourself to your genetic set weight does not mean you will be obese.  Now all you have to learn is who you are and coping skills, like insults from the internet.",
