  "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo the situation is pretty bad atm. The last time I saw them was last year and then it was bad. Our other friend saw him recently and said he was worse. I don't want to assume a diagnosis but they're extremely underweight. Veins are bones are prominent. They're quiet and they're family hasnt seemed to have intervened that much (I contacted a family member to ask about they're progress. ) me and my two other friends have tried to be gentle and ask in different ways \"what's going on?\", \u201chow you managing? We all care about you and are a lil worried.\" We are trying our best not to make comments on they're appearance and to just be there to make him feel supported in general. However this isn't enough anymore. Me and my other friends are currently in discussions about what we can do but we have never been in this situation before and we don't want to overstep a boundary and ruin our relationship with him and his family. Also to add he is trans so he is dealing with body issues on a whole other level.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone have any advice? (UK based)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you",

The UK has mental health services available for free, correct? (I\u2019m US where it can be very costly to get treated) You could let him know how you all care about him and would like to ask him to begin seeing someone. You can help him find access if he wants, I\u2019m not sure how complicated it is there. \n\nYou\u2019re a good friend, I\u2019m glad he has someone to notice and care and look after him.",

      "body": "If you do suggest they get help and they don't react negatively- help them get assistance AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. They are far more likely to accept help soon after they admit they may need it, rather than longer down the road. Also, it can be EXTREMELY difficult getting assistance on your own when you are in such a bad place mental health wise. My partner offered to call and schedule my first few appointments with doctors/therapists. I 100% needed that. I could never have made those phone calls on my own.  I'm not saying you should do anything against his will or without him agreeing to it first, but if he does say he needs help offer to help with as much as you can right in the beginning. It can be very difficult to make yourself go to those first appointments- a friendly voice telling you it's safe and helpful and will help you feel not as bad, made it easier for me to make myself go. \n\nYou sound like an amazing friend- continue to be there for them, and they have a much higher chance of recovery.",

Just know ur an amazing friend. Ive had an ed since i was 4. The one thing i need and needed most. Wasnt a parent to be there for me. But a friend. Ur company alone should help. Also symptoms of not eating in public or wanting to eat alone are potential symptoms of arfid. Starving urself for days can be signs of an anorexic i *believe*. Not sure tho.",
