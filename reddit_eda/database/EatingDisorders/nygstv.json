  "title": "Request: Want to stop binge-purge cycle but afraid of gaining weight",
  "selftext": "So 1.5 years ago I was on the upper end of my BMI. I\u2019d been trying to lose weight for a while but never had time to workout and I went out too often to have a clean diet. Quarantine however let me have the time to regularly exercise and diet which helped me to lose a good amount of weight in a few months. I didn\u2019t realize then but realized later that I was restricting myself way too much and justifying it by saying \u201cif you want results, you gotta work for it\u201d. And I would binge a lot on cheat days. I later realized these are symptoms of bulimia. Earlier this year I started self-induced vomiting and that\u2019s just made things worse. I decided to recover and so in April I stopped dieting and it was going great for 2 weeks until I took a photo w a friend on an occasion and then when I later saw it I felt like I looked fat (I probably didn\u2019t). But that just made me go into a hate spree and I decided to diet again. And so the binge purge cycle started once again. But this is making me miserable, especially with added stress from college. I really don\u2019t wanna be worrying about my body and food all the time. I know the right thing to do would be to stop dieting and start eating intuitively but I am so scared of gaining weight. I know I shouldn\u2019t care about this but I do. Ever since losing weight I have been feeling a lot more confident, I can wear the clothes I want and I don\u2019t feel as insecure. So if I gain weight I won\u2019t feel this confidence anymore which is why I\u2019m so scared of gaining weight.",

If you have Instagram, start following people with different body types, like moms who are post partum and \"larger\" people. I've started to notice that seeing normal bodies more often has shifted the way I look at my own body. I do less worrying about carrying some extra weight. I'm the heaviest I've been in my life, but am more secure in my body than I was when way thinner.",

      "body": "Hey girlie! I\u2019m a fellow binge eater. Firstly, I feel you. I used to cut my meals down to one meal a day and when I checked how many calories I should consume (I\u2019m short) to lose weight, it was 1200 a day. That\u2019s child size portions. It\u2019s not enough for a growing adult. I tried eating one meal a day so I would feel like I am eating enough for an adult bc I was consuming a 1000 calories in one sitting and fooling myself into thinking I ate enough. And horrible would be an understatement to describe such an experience. I was dizzy all the time, if I ate anything over a 1200 I looked bloated and gained weight and the cycle was awful. My body felt weak. I stopped going out with friends, my hair was falling out, I would only see my bf (now ex for obvious reasons) in the morning so I\u2019d be at my \u2018skinniest\u2019 and never eat out with him and only go for drinks. Just writing this is bringing me pain. Then I found this YouTuber \u2018abby\u2019s kitchen\u2019 and let me tell you, she absolutely changed my life. I\u2019m still learning amd def not super healthy but she made everything better. She is a registered dietitian and she said, \u2018don\u2019t restrict food but try to make it balanced. If you\u2019re eating cake, don\u2019t just eat it but have something else. It\u2019s all about balancing carbs, fat and protein so you can achieve satiety. And only 80% of your meals need to be \u2018healthy\u2019 which just means nourishing.\u2019 Your healthy foods can be things you enjoy and trying funnel recipes. So I took a leap and started eating lunch and dinner. I eat salad for dinner and the meal my mom cooks which used be very carb heavy and I consumed a lot of it. For lunch, I also have a balance of protein carb and fat. I start my mornings off with firman b12 for energy and vitamin d bc ya girl is deficient. It honestly helps a lot and I see food as my fuel and something that is there to nourish me. I also go on daily walks for about 30-45 minutes after dinner to help with the digestion. So here\u2019s my little start. I hope this helps and please go watch her videos,  and try not to listen to the toxic diet culture. I wish you the best and I know you got this! Text me at any time if you want to talk about it (:",

Try easing into it, slowly increasing your variety and portions to a level where you dont feel hungry all the time.\n\n\nMaybe try getting clothes that fit you, or will fit you, so you dont have that nawing at you each day?\n\n\nIve went through seeing myself in photos and thinking i look fat during the first year of my recovery, it gets better. Now i look back on those photos and theres absolutely no way i could call myself fat in them.\n\n\nOf course getting a professional to help you is probably the best course of action.",

Reframing the gaining as consequence made me realize I need to fix my relationship with food. I tend to binge when I\u2019m stressed or anxious and have nothing else to do. When I stay busy I\u2019m wayyyy less likely to binge and can maintain a weight rather than gaining. Figure out your brain hack. What makes you purge? Stress? Certain food? Boredom?",
