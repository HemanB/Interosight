  "selftext": "I bring my lunch with me to work every day, and it\u2019s always rice and vegetables.\n\n It\u2019s bland and flavorless, and it\u2019s all I\u2019ll allow myself to eat. It\u2019s almost always my only \u2018meal\u2019 of the day. And without a doubt, my coworkers always comment/joke about my lunch, and it\u2019s very triggering.\n\nThey will ask what else I eat, or where I get my nutrition and I obviously have to lie. I hate it so much, it makes me not want to bring a lunch at all, but I know that\u2019ll bring up more questions. How do you deal with people being invasive and commenting on your ED?\n\nIm scared to bring up my discomfort with their concern over my eating",

That said, doesn't make it any less frustrating. \n\nWhen I was anorexia restricting (many years ago at this point) in college I was always annoyed at people constantly making comments on my food choices and how I just ate vegetables, small amounts, etc. Honestly, what was worse was when I started recovery and people would make comments like Oh wow you eat SO MANY TIMES in one day you're eating all the time. Basically anyone commenting on what I ate was frustrating. \n\nNow as an essentially fully recovered person I no longer can imagine caring about these comments. I think it's because after several years (repetition repetition is everything with recovery) of expanding my food choices and learning it's ok to eat \"normal\" meals, something shifted in my brain. So I know it sucks now, but if you stay strong with recovery, these types of things get better. Xo",

Here\u2019s a nice list of things you can say:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not interested in talking about that.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t ask me about my food.\u201d\n\nSilence.\n\nAbruptly change subject.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about food.\u201d\n\nLearn to say exactly what is on your mind. It will feel really bitchy at first but you\u2019re allowed to set a boundary and the more you do it the less this will happen. I had to do this at my current job and they never ask anymore. However, I have to add, if that\u2019s the only meal you are eating i suspect you\u2019re co-workers know very well why you eat that every day. Perhaps they are concerned by, or judgmental of your condition. I hope you are in treatment. If so, the phrase that has had the most power for me is, \u201cI\u2019m in treatment for an eating disorder. I\u2019m following guidelines given to me by my clinicians and I prefer not to discuss it further.\u201d Once it was out in the air I used the phrase \u201cdoctor\u2019s orders!\u201d to remind people. \n\nBrainstorm phrases that will work for you, practice them out loud, and go for it!\n\nEdit: I know that a lot of people would be super uncomfortable telling their coworkers about their health conditions and you don\u2019t owe anyone an explanation! Short and simple answers are great too.",

Everyone needs to eat to survive. Try to respond to your coworkers with health-focused statements. This is easier said than done depending on where you\u2019re at, but remember that food makes your body and your mind strong and you have no reason to feel ashamed for nourishing yourself \ud83d\udc95 (That said, it sounds like maybe you\u2019re not nourishing yourself as much as you deserve. I really hope you can work to focus more on the nourishment you need rather than on the ED thoughts that are stopping you from getting there)\nIdeas on how to respond:\n\u201cJust keeping it cheap and getting my vegetables in!\u201d\n\u201cDoing what I need to do to survive!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a creature of habit- I found something I liked and I\u2019m sticking to it!\u201d\n\u201cIm eating everything I need to keep me going through the day!\u201d\n\u201cI appreciate your concern for my boring ol lunch but I think I\u2019d shock the whole office if I changed my ways, so if ya don\u2019t mind I\u2019d rather avoid talking more about my same ol meal cuz I\u2019m not planning to change!\u201d\nOr some variation of those, depending on your personality. Humour is my favourite because you can get people to shut up and still come across as nice! As a vegetarian, I used to hate people commenting on whether I got enough protein (you don\u2019t see me asking them if they got enough of their daily nutrients!), but I learned to realize people are just looking out for me because they care, and they are just genuinely curious! \nBe kind to yourself! (And to those who care about you). I would also highly recommend looking up some CBT exercises to help with your negative thoughts, a thought record is a good place to start!",

For \u201enormal\u201c people talking about food is a smalltalk topic, for me it is stress and causes anxiety every time I have to eat with others. Unfortunately it is a social obligation at my workplace to eat with the others at the cafeteria. I eat salad and every time someone comments on the huge amount of salad I eat. It makes me go crazy. I feel ashamed for the amounts I eat and fat, even though I know that am skinny. I managed it to tell them that i consider it rude to comment on my food and I started to preventively tell the waiter that it\u2019s too bad I can\u2019t fit even more on my plate. It helps a bit and I fight off the stupid comments if I start and then change the topic. \nI few weeks ago I had to attend a workshop and the thought of eating with strangers stressed the hell out of me, I almost left as I realized there is no way to eat alone without being considered odd. I mentally prepared myself that there will be comments and I can handle it. Of course, someone commented in the \u201cmountain of salad\u201d and I just replied that I am sure I can allow it to myself considering how lean I am, the \u201chealthy sized\u201d girl making the comment was a bit bewildered but left me at peace. \nAnyways, due to corona I can finally eat alone at my desk, which is very relieving.",
