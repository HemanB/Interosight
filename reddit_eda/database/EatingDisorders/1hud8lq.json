The fear of eating doesn\u2019t really stem from the fear of weight gain anymore it\u2019s just about feeling full. \nI think for me it is about feeling greedy. I would recommend trying to talk to someone about it. Maybe they won\u2019t totally understand it but if they have a healthy relationship with food they can insure you that fullness isn\u2019t a bad thing. You will always be scared of it if you don\u2019t face the fear. But if you do it now it will become easier. I have learned to deal with fulness most of the time. I am sure you can do it to",

Also most of my family acts as if it\u2019s dangerous to be hungry at all, ever, and most of them also struggle with obesity. A therapist once told me that given my family history it kinda makes sense for me to not want to \u00abend up like them\u00bb and try to control what they apparently can\u2019t. I dunno, it fucking sucks anyways.",

Most of my major fears never did come to pass once I found recovery - they were kind of like a made-up obstacle from my illness. In fact I had a lot of fears that seemed to be endless. Recovery gave me a way to get them all out with the help of someone who understood and then have them lifted so that I could live life more normally. Hope that\u2019s helpful. :)",

For me, the only thing worked was exposure to food, and I received this exposure through inpatient treatment. It\u2019s so scary but please believe me when I say recovery is the most freeing lifestyle. During Christmas dinner this year, I became aware of how full I was and I noticed that I didn\u2019t mind. I didn\u2019t hate myself. I didn\u2019t have to immediately purge. I didn\u2019t supposedly feel the calories working. Facing your fears is so scary, but it\u2019s the best thing I\u2019ve ever done for myself. It\u2019s so hard. But I believe in you. If you need anything please message me I am here for you",
