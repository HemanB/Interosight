  "title": "Request: I think my friend is suffering from an eating disorder",
  "selftext": "(m17) think my friend (f18) suffers from an ED- she practically told me so. She constantly counts calories and tries to skip meals. She walks around her room constantly to try and burn them. She loves baking, but doesn't eat a bite. I am the only person she has confided in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI try to be very sensitive and everytime she says she doesn't want to burden me, i tell her we're in this together. I won't let her go through this alone. I've done a lot of research on Eds and what they are and what to say. But some results are contradictory.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI tried talking gently about the negative health implications and she told me she was aware but didn't care. She wanted it to get worse. She feels insecure in her body, saying she's fat. For the record, she genuinely, objectively isn't but everytime i try and reassure her she brushes me off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't want to involve school or doctors, if I can avoid it, as i don't want to betray her trust- i already feel guilty about typing this. My intentions, i should add, are strictly for her wellbeing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice or actions would be greatly appreciated, i feel a little out of my depth. If there is any information youd like to know, please ask. I dont really know what is relevant in these situations :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: OP  [Cbcieu](https://www.reddit.com/user/Cbcieu) has asked you PM them when responding",

As someone with an ED I can say that they do make a huge difference to my general health when I\u2019m restricting. Another harm reduction technique would be to carry a chocolate bar or some fruit in your bag, if she passes out or feels faint she\u2019ll need to increase her blood sugar level quickly.\n\nAlso, please be prepared for the fact that you might have to tell someone eventually. If her health is getting visibly bad and her parents/school don\u2019t notice then you might have to tell someone. Not to sound dramatic, but losing your friendship is better than having a dead friend.",

A big part of my recovery was just being around people who didn't order salads all the time, and engaged in healthy food talk as well as healthy self-talk. It can be contagious, even it if takes a long time (for me, years).",

I\u2019ve been on both sides, having friends who suffer and having an ED myself.
