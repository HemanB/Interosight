  "title": "Request: Falling back into restrictive habits while boyfriend can\u2019t eat solid food",
  "selftext": "I\u2019m 24f and would consider myself recovered from anorexia, or at least I did. I was treated for the disorder five years ago during my second year of college. Since then I\u2019ve been doing well, eating three times a day, keeping balanced nutrition, getting a healthy level of low impact exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight. \n\nRecently I put on a few pounds, and have been feeling absolutely awful about it, even though I\u2019m still well within the healthy range. I have been trying to maintain a healthy diet regardless of my disordered thoughts. To do this, I told myself I had to eat when my boyfriend eats. We live together, so encouraging that we eat meals together has really kept me motivated to eat enough to stay healthy. \n\nThe problem is that over time this subconsciously shifted from \u201cI have to eat if my boyfriend is eating\u201d, to \u201cI can\u2019t eat if my boyfriend isn\u2019t eating\u201d, and I didn\u2019t even notice the shift. He recently had his wisdom teeth taken out and can\u2019t eat regular meals. I have been spiraling into my eating disorder since. \n\nI have a hard time getting myself to eat in front of him if he\u2019s not also eating. But I am aware that I need food to survive and remain in recovery. I went from eating a well balanced three meals per day to the last few days where I\u2019ve only drank coffee. Today I forced down a small salad and a few chips. But I can\u2019t keep up like this. I have tremendous guild whenever I feel hungry, I have noticed that I\u2019m checking my body frequently, and I can\u2019t stop wondering how much I weigh. \n\nHow do I get control of my disorder again? I feel so stupid, because it almost feels like it never left. I can\u2019t really talk to my boyfriend about how I\u2019ve been feeling. I have been in recovery for our entire relationship. He knows I had an eating disorder years ago, and that health is important to me, but we don\u2019t really talk about it. I also have panic disorder and ptsd, so my ed wasn\u2019t really a top concern for a long time. \n\nThank you to anyone who took the time to read this. I would love to hear what you think.",

Once he can eat normal again and you can eat together it could become easier for you. its good that you realise your behavior, that's one step towards the better! Good luck, I believe in you\u2661",

      "body": "I had a very similar experience! My boyfriend at the time (now fianc\u00e9) and I would eat at the same times which was helpful, but then it slowly turned into me not eating if he wasn\u2019t. It was almost as if he was giving me \u201cpermission\u201d to eat, by eating. \n\nWhat I did, that has been helpful, is have the conversation with him. Since my last time in treatment (2015-2016) the thing that has helped THE MOST is being completely honest with him about food. It has made everything different (in the best way).\n\nHope this helps! You aren\u2019t alone!",

      "body": "This can happen when the underlying beliefs that first triggered you to restrict you're diet intake and obsess over the size and weight of your body are still in there. \n\nIt's like that function of autocorrect where your keyboard mislearns a word and keeps \"correcting\" it to the wrong word every time you try to type it... And you certainly CAN retype it the correct way every time it pops up but until you go into the programming and correct it at that deeper level, it's just going to keep popping up as the wrong one. Mindfully correcting it works but it's exhausting and easy to not notice so it sometimes slips on by you. \nI work with people with eating disorders every day and I've found that anorexia often has a deep self-belief component of being afraid to grow up, and/or wanting to be invisible and overlooked. \nWhen I'm able to help my patients recover whatever memory it was that first formed this belief in their unconscious mind, they can finally release it and we can rewrite the programming together. It's always such a huge shift for them to acknowledge the difference between maintaining a healthy weight and eating habits with conscious effort and simply loving themselves and their bodies so much that it automatically translates into honoring their body naturally and effortlessly in everything they do... Which includes what they feed it \nI wish you all the best on your healing journey! I struggled with anorexia myself for several years. Sadly for me, when in thought I'd healed from it back then, I didn't and over time it morphed into bulimia instead. I lived with they for decades. It wasn't until I became a hypnotherapist that I fully understood what was going on with my own unconscious programming. \nI am now finally free of all eating disorders! \ud83e\udd73",
