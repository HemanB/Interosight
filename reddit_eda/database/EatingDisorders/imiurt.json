  "selftext": "(TW\u2757)I've never liked my body but i never got unhealthy habits though i didn't like it and just kinda lived like that. For the past few months id say since may things have been going south i thought \"oh well since were in quarentine i can use this time to lose weight.\" Soon after that i got a sthomach flu and i was going long periods of time without eating and i started thinking \"this will be good for weight loss if i continue this i will lose weight.\" So even after i got better i continued to go a while without eating but it still wasn't anything to bad.\n\nOver the past few months I've began eating less and less and portion sizeing my meals. Now I'm going a day or more at a time without eating and every time i eat i feel guilty no matter what it is or how long I've gone without eating. I've started to take certain foods out of my diet and get nervous about eating certain foods and if i don't know how many calories are in the food I'm eating i feel very uncomfortable with it and get anxiety about it. People in my life have noticed and my doctor even told my parents she's concerd about all the weight I've lost. I'm proud and happy i lost weight but everyone says I'm skinny and i look great but i don't notice a difference in my body i still look fat i don't see a skinny girl like other people. That just makes me want to lose more weight.",

You don\u2019t have to tell anyone other than your therapist. People don\u2019t need to know unless you want them to. \nI think a lot of people feel out of control right now with covid and so people are feeling obsessive about their bodies.",

She threatened to take me to an ED unit once long before I ever started therapy when my weight first started to drop so she was already highly suspicious. I had mentioned purging to my therapist once before and nothing really came of it because I got scared and said I almost never did it which was a huge lie. After the letter was shown to my mom by my therapist. She was mostly confused and kept trying to ask me why I was doing this. My therapist stopped her from making me answer then since I was crying and couldn\u2019t really talk. It\u2019s also possible that your therapist might suggest you switch to someone who specializes in EDs or seek out a higher level of care if they aren\u2019t able to help you quickly improve. Some therapists won\u2019t see people with EDs because it\u2019s not easy to tell from the outside if someone is really heading for trouble. That\u2019s also why it\u2019s really important that you try to tell someone soon.",
