  "selftext": "Hi! I am 25 and I have been struggling with eating disorders for 16 years now mostly with anorexia but for the last year I considered myself fully recovered. During the past months I met a guy that's all I had been dreaming of and fell in love almost at first sight. The only problem is he's tiny. He's the same height and weight as I am and eats very little everyday and he likes my skinny body. He doesn't like women with curves and he actually fat shames them a lot. I have started having body image issues again, I am stressed about food the whole day and I don't like eating with him because he eats less than me. The possibility of living with him scares me and especially the possibility of getting pregnant at some point frightens me because I would be so much fatter than him. Nobody understands me, they all say it's not an even a problem. Any help would be very appreciated.",

I could tell that the \"picky eating\" he had warned me about went much deeper though. I was convinced he had anorexia. It stressed me out. I had worked so hard in my own recovery that watching him stress over a menu at a restaurant would cause fights. We broke up for other reasons but it wouldn't have worked. I always felt huge beside him and it brought up old demons for sure. My advice is if it is causing you stress, it isn't worth it. Fat shaming is not good for anyone, let alone a recovered ED patient. Consider it as necessary to stay in recovery, to let him go.",

Partners should lift one another and not tear each other down.
