Same with BN or BED where treatment focuses on behavior interruption along with nutritional rehab. \n\nA lot of treatment models (not saying this is ideal) focus on nutritional rehab, weight restoration (in typical AN) then moving to IE. This can be incredibly difficult for ED patients as early IE is about \"overconsumption\" without compensatory behaviors, which requires a ton of buy-in with body acceptance. Really not easy if you've been required to weight restore.\n\nBut agree, I think too much emphasis goes to weight restoration.
