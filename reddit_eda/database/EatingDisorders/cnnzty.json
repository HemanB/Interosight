  "title": "Request: A good piece of advice I got recently",
  "selftext": "I'm a 13 year old male recovering from anorexia, and I've recently become inspired to get involved in the community a little. I haven't been on reddit in quite a while but I decided that this is one way I could participate. Anyway:\n\nI was going for a walk with my cousin (24 years old and female) whom I have always been very close with. She is also recovering from anorexia so we chat about it regularly. We were talking about it for a solid 2 hours, and towards the end, she gave me a piece of advice that I've thought about a lot since. She said that when she starts hearing the anorexia thoughts, one of her methods of dealing with them is to make them sound stupid. Like, I don't know, say they're serving cake at a party and you notice the eating disorder thoughts coming. If you take a step back and make them sound dumb, it really puts it into perspective. For instance, you could tell yourself (sarcastically, of course):\n\nOkay, yeah. Let's have a freak out about this one piece of cake, I'm sure that will make for a good evening\n\nI've done the whole thing, the therapy, the nutritionists, the hospitalizations, and I hate to admit it but this is the thing that I think of most in everyday life. It really has helped me. Everybody has their own methods of working through the thoughts, but I thought I'd just try and share it. I hope this helps someone out there (:",
