  "selftext": "Does anyone else hate eating before the other people in your house eat? I always postpone eating dinner until my boyfriend eats, even when I\u2019m super hungry. He comes home from work and either naps or plays video games and doesn\u2019t eat dinner until 8 or later. I usually get frustrated and end up drinking to quench the hunger, and then wait to eat until he does or until he goes to bed. I don\u2019t know how to get the strength up to eat when he\u2019s not eating =\\",

      "body": "Yes I use to and it was one of the last things I could overcome in my recovery. (Besides ordering food by myself when I was in college and eating it alone in a public place) all I can say it is weird, but it does become somewhat normal for me anyways. I like the one to do it in stages that I read in this thread. Maybe eat half by yourself (like on a patio or living room while your boyfriend is eating but still technically eating by yourself). Or one day make an appetizer for like half of your meal then eat the other half when your boyfriend gets home. \n\nAlso I would recommend talking to your boyfriend about this struggle. Then maybe you guys can form some sort of game plan. I hope all goes well for you (:",

      "body": "I really relate to your feelings of frustration. I don't think you need to fight this in stages. I think you fight it by deciding that you supper is at a certain time, and you eat, knowing you will have to sit with the anxiety during and after, and knowing that you will not enjoy your meal and you will have to push through it anyway. I would even say to my boyfriend if he is supportive that I will be in a bad mood, and I would share my needs as well (I will be in a bad mood tonight because I'm going to do something that provokes my anxiety. Please leave me alone and know that it's not about you. Or please give me some extra hugs and cheer me on. Etc).\n\nThe first few times, it will be very hard, but it gets easier and easier as you continue to do it. It also helps to have a mantra of sorts. Megsy recovery often says something like \"My body does not gain weight based on what other people do.\" Your boyfriend could fast for a month and run a marathon every day, and you being near him, but not joining him will not change your body. I really needed this mantra when I went on a trip with my sister, who was not eating really at all. I was so hungry, and I got frustrated with her, but then I remembered that no matter how little she eats, my body will not be affected by her choices. I knew I would feel better if I just did my own thing and ate normally, and I did. The more I tried to compete with her, the worse I felt, the more frustrated I got, and the less I enjoyed the trip. I stopped competing with her and just focussed on trying to make good choices for myself and my happiness and I let her make her own choices.\n\nAlso, \"different bodies, different paths\". At this point, it is probably inconceivable that someone would wait to eat and not prioritize it, especially when you are so hungry. Someday, maybe you'll feel that way too, but in recovery, eating is, and should be your highest priority. Keep eating and challenging your fears, and the food focus goes away, bit by bit.",

Normally my parents force me to eat by then, which makes me feel really guilty. And if we eat together, I\u2019ll only let myself eat as much as she does. I\u2019m constantly trying to match her eating, which is very unhealthy because she has an ed too :(",
