I don't know why I was so scared of him, and it really made my service to him really poor. \nHe had a really weird last name, and I didn't want to call him his first name as I was raised to call older people by Mr/s last name unless they instructed me differently. \nSo I would attempt to say Mr his last name, and he would have a weird attempted laugh, this cheered his wife up and she said that's the first time he has even tried to laugh since his stroke. This broke my heart. Then I realised that I was so incredibly wrong. I didn't know this man, I didn't know the struggles he had been through nor what he was going through. All I knew about him was he grunted and only drank thickened water. \nSo, every day I was on, I made an effort to say his name, which I failed, but it still made him laugh at my attempt. \nOver time, my fear faded, and I would often catch myself having a little conversation with him... mainly with me doing the talking and him grunting and laughing in his own way.... until he spoke! He was able to say thank you, yes and hi. It was amazing to see his growth in the time. He eventually progressed up to mildly thick fluids and minced food, and each time, it was me, who got to deliver the new diet to him. \nHe managed to muster up a smile when I arrived and would tell me what he wanted to eat off the menu. After this, he was transferred to another hospital. But I will never forget him. \nIf I had continued on with the fear of patients like that, then I would have missed out on some bloody amazing people and their inspiring journeys.\nSomeone could be as ugly as a drop meat pie, or skinny as a rake or as wide as a house, it doesn't take away from them as people. When you sit down with someone and listen to their life stories, you will be absolutely amazed. \nI remember this one lady who was huge. She took up an entire bariatric bed and still needed a second bed in there for space. Like she was big. She wasn't an over eater. She had cushing syndrome plus hypothyroidism, and she left it untreated. She ballooned up and got massive infections that left her bed bound, the depression kicked in, and she went downhill fast. She had an awesome sense of humour, and I enjoyed chatting with her. She was smart, funny, and she was really pretty, and had fantastic hair! \nSo many people have beautiful personalities, but unless you look past their exterior, you won't see the real person.",

Nobody is going to stop to have a conversation about how a person came to be how they are now unless they are admiring and want tips on how to achieve the same.  I was totally slim and fit hiked every day, in the military and a few years later suffering from foot injuries on both feet one cause by domestic violence, I\u2019m overweight bc a broken ankle took nine months of bedrest to heal.  If you are bed ridden you might be at the mercy of someone else to take care of you.  The guy who hurt me is giving me frozen burritos to eat not my preference.  Half my family died including my mother, brother and my first child.  A lot more happened but you get the point.  Your life can take a turn for the worse and spiral out of control for the worse.  Why should you be judged by that?  Like I said nobody is gonna ask all that nor do they really care.  It\u2019s just pointless to judge it\u2019s a weakness of our own minds and yes there is heavy programming in our society.  I also thought the person I\u2019m judging could be calling for help if I\u2019m suffering a stroke or a heart attack!  Do you think they will help you if you just got done micro-slighting them and acting like you\u2019re above them bc of weight?  It\u2019s all embarrassing really.  Just try to turn the thoughts off when they start bc the tables can turn all too quickly.  Kindness is courage and strength.",

If your mind jumps to fat-shaming upon seeing another person, and you just let it be that way, you\u2019re fat shaming. If you choose to think after, \u2018well, no. it\u2019s not fair for me to judge someone\u2019s body,\u2019 or maybe even reconditioning to find a compliment to suit them\u2026 not only would that be the genuine marker of who you are as a person, but the shift will come naturally.

I learned this was just another part of my illness and obsession rooted in my eating disorder. What helped me was finding a 12 step program for compulsive eating and asking someone with the quality of recovery I wanted to show me how to work the program (to be my \u201csponsor\u201d). I tried to just think or feel differently on my own or other self-help methods but none of it had a lasting impact until 12 step. Hope that\u2019s helpful!",

I don't know why I was so scared of him, and it really made my service to him really poor. \nHe had a really weird last name, and I didn't want to call him his first name as I was raised to call older people by Mr/s last name unless they instructed me differently. \nSo I would attempt to say Mr his last name, and he would have a weird attempted laugh, this cheered his wife up and she said that's the first time he has even tried to laugh since his stroke. This broke my heart. Then I realised that I was so incredibly wrong. I didn't know this man, I didn't know the struggles he had been through nor what he was going through. All I knew about him was he grunted and only drank thickened water. \nSo, every day I was on, I made an effort to say his name, which I failed, but it still made him laugh at my attempt. \nOver time, my fear faded, and I would often catch myself having a little conversation with him... mainly with me doing the talking and him grunting and laughing in his own way.... until he spoke! He was able to say thank you, yes and hi. It was amazing to see his growth in the time. He eventually progressed up to mildly thick fluids and minced food, and each time, it was me, who got to deliver the new diet to him. \nHe managed to muster up a smile when I arrived and would tell me what he wanted to eat off the menu. After this, he was transferred to another hospital. But I will never forget him. \nIf I had continued on with the fear of patients like that, then I would have missed out on some bloody amazing people and their inspiring journeys.\nSomeone could be as ugly as a drop meat pie, or skinny as a rake or as wide as a house, it doesn't take away from them as people. When you sit down with someone and listen to their life stories, you will be absolutely amazed. \nI remember this one lady who was huge. She took up an entire bariatric bed and still needed a second bed in there for space. Like she was big. She wasn't an over eater. She had cushing syndrome plus hypothyroidism, and she left it untreated. She ballooned up and got massive infections that left her bed bound, the depression kicked in, and she went downhill fast. She had an awesome sense of humour, and I enjoyed chatting with her. She was smart, funny, and she was really pretty, and had fantastic hair! \nSo many people have beautiful personalities, but unless you look past their exterior, you won't see the real person.",
