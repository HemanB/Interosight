  "selftext": "I\u2019m Talia,  am a second year trainee clinical psychologist, with a passion and special interest in eating disorders and the idea of preventative strategies so that people don't end up being turned away from services, or alternatively on an 18 month treatment waiting list. Having had my own experiences of an eating disorder, alongside supporting friends and a family member I've found that approaches to treating eating disorders can be quite narrowly focused, often CBT for eating disorders is used in NHS settings and often treats presenting symptoms rather than underlying causes.\n \nI've designed a two-week compassion focused intervention for young people aged 16-21 with eating difficulties which is online and using virtual reality technology. There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that a compassionate approach may be valuable for people with eating disorders, due to high trait perfectionism, self-criticism and experiences of shame.\n \nI was hoping you may be able to share my research (if that's appropriate) on the sub reddit. I feel like it\u2019s something people would want to possibly take part in, as I know the eating disorder community is very proactive and focused on increased support, recognition and funding.  \n \nIt's received ethical approval from the university and has been designed by myself and other researchers without commercial incentive. I honestly just want to make a difference to people with eating disorders. \n\nTo see the full study this link is to the information page or i can be emailed at t.s.drew@surrey.ac.uk https://surreyfahs.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6A94ED7NhJUgoTz",

Does that make sense? Ken Goss is someone who has developed CFT-E which is a treatment programme for people with eating disorders using compassion. https://www.compassionatemind.co.uk/uploads/files/more-info-cft-e-introductory.pdf \n\nThis will (hopefully) come into services in the future sometime and is a more typical intervention in that it would be delivered by a clinician face to face rather than being a guided self-help, online intervention. Hopefully that answers your questions.",
