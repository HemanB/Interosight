I still struggle with \"eating in front of people is embarrassing\", so knowing that my hostess will go to bed and not feel compelled to sit there while I eat a snack makes me happy. There probably are lots of other points of view, of course, but count me in as another vote for \"ask\" or \"talk to her\".\nThere are also good things to have on hand that are safe and easy...like:\n- cut-up melon or refreshing fruit that she likes (in fridge);\n- jar of PB and honey + fresh apples on counter or in reach\n- yogurt in fridge\n- hard boiled eggs (not everyone loves these, but a lot do) ready to go, etc.\n\nAlso, when around her, try not to focus on food, topics of food, what you're planning to make for the holidays, what you take to work to eat...just let it all be dormant in her presence so she isn't struggling IMO. It's so hard b/c food is a big part of every single aspect of life (we know!) - but now is not the time to try and change her patterns of thinking. It's about making her comfy.",
