I don\u2018t want to see that you always look up the nutrition data of a meal before you eat it. I don\u2018t want to know how many times you\u2018ve been to the gym this week. I don\u2019t want to hear you say that you feel fat. I don\u2018t fucking care that you think I lost weight. I don\u2019t want you to comment on my body. \nFUCK YOU. \nWhy do you always say these stupid things?\nWhy does everybody say these things???\nIf it weren\u2018t for you I wouldn\u2018t even have this stupid disorder. \nI\u2018m doing better and I am trying everyday but then these people come along and say stupid things and I am triggered. It hurts even more when it\u2018s from a friend. I don\u2019t even know what to say in such a moment and also sometimes I simply don\u2019t have the energy to stand up for myself or others and explain the issue. \nHow do you deal with triggers especially from close friends? (they don\u2019t know I have an ed)",

Ppl are always going to make stupid comments or talk about food and \u201cgoals\u201d etc. and guess we hafta learn to deal with this fact that the whole world won\u2019t bend to make us feel better and make sure we are In a bubble\n I say that to my kids in eating disorder res where I work and tell them to set boundaries with family and close friends and remove themselves from conversations and situations that are too much or too triggering as well as to speak up for themselves. I remind them that they have to expect they will not b fully insulated from cruel and uncomfortable things all the time \u201cin the real world\u201d\nI work where I do bc I have been thru it. I know it\u2019s maddening and it\u2019s really fukking hard to deal with the triggers around us. but I\u2019ve been on a mission to be an educator and advocate and teach about Ed\u2019s. And I still practice using my voice. Idk if this helps but I understand and unfortunately it won\u2019t always be possible to get away from these things.  That\u2019s where our tools come in",

Ive been struggling with ED for a year now. somedays i dont eat almost anything and the next i eat sm that is throw up. My bmi is 19 and since a lot of my friends have bmi below 17, they always proceed to make comments about my body and i always just laughed it off, but after returning home, i cried a lot. Im homeschooled now and im better off without any friends besides one. Shes naturally really skinny and its so horrible looking at myself around her, but i somehow managed to make my peace with it and now were really good friends. I wish i could help but the only thing that worked out for me was distancing myself and cutting them off, then switching to homeschooling.",

You will always find comments like those, they are harmful I know, but not for everyone at the same level, most of the people don't even understand how a comment about food or body can potentially hurt someome. The good thing about friends is that you can share how you feel about it and maybe they can work on it.\nIt is something deeply rooted btw, no wonder why it is called diet culture.",
