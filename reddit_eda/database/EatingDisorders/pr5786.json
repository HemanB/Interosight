  "selftext": "My eating disorder seems to go in a huge cycle. When I'm in the phase where I'm eating the right amount and looking healthy, I still don't feel 'better'. My eating disorder is still there. It's still telling me that my arms are too flabby, my face is too fat and puffy, I'm eating too much and should be ashamed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn this phase I'm not eating because my ED is better. I'm eating because my body has been starving for so long that it just can't take it anymore, and it becomes stronger than my thoughts to restrict.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm too scared to tell my dietitian that I'm eating more now and have stopped losing weight, sometimes even gaining it, because I fear the invalidation of her thinking my ED is better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyone else the same?",

I\u2019m terrified to visit my psych again because I\u2019m afraid she will start assuming that I\u2019m \u2018better\u2019 since I\u2019m not underweight anymore. \nThe only time I was taken super seriously was when I was emaciated and my BMI was alarmingly low. This was during my relapse period. \nThe truth is ED is more than just eating, it\u2019s the thoughts and the cycle of behaviour.\nLay people unfortunately do not grasp this. \nThey associate anorexia as someone who\u2019s superbly and unhealthily thin, but I\u2019ve only been like this at two stages of my life.\nIt\u2019s so stupid because it\u2019s like someone thinking oh this person doesn\u2019t have cancer cause she/he/they aren\u2019t losing hair. \nThis ideology honestly harms my mental health more than anything",
