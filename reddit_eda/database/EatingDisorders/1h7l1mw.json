Relapse can happen, and stuff like that.\n\n2) My main eating disorder is Anorexia. I was 12 when I was diagnosed. I always thought because I gained weight I was over it. Come to find out that wasn't the case because I always had the \"disorderes thinking and habits.\n\nI was thinking about this and felt like I should be too old to have them problem, if anything I feel like I should have an eating disorder on the opposite end. Binge eating. \n\nI was wondering if anyone else felt like they were too old to have theirs as well?",

I was way to busy with that n def not looking for a partner n worked with all women. But yet I kept up the behavior. It\u2019s a negative coping mechanism n genetic n problem with brain wiring like pica people who eat chalk because their brain tells them it tastes n feels good. This isn\u2019t about vanity n appearance because most anorexics I know look horrible that thin n not attractive to anyone. We do it at all ages because it\u2019s a mental disorder not a choice we can pik up or put down when ever we want. If we could control it we wouldn\u2019t be sick.",

The mind likes to take fears and anxiety and play on them.  I think the Brian is just trying to use a defence mechanism or something but it's actually screwing us over but like you say, mental health is long term. \n My brother had a knee injury quite some time ago now and still hurts sometimes because the brain was so used to it hurting that it thinks it still should, this creating pain.  It's similar to mental health, which is why it can be such a struggle to get better.  But worth it I think, one day you'll realise a way to really help break those habits, and before you know it, you'll notice you think or do certain habits less.\n\nUnfortunately all healing and self improving is a slow process.  I've had enough health professionals tell me that one.  But all good things take time :)",

I also shared about the reality that I finally figured out I never was \"Cured\" of an eating disorder, it's just been in a state of remission, and that I think it is a bit depressing knowing I will be in treatment for this, like mental health services for the rest of my life.\n\nI can relate about the insensitive body image comments from a parent. I got a parent who is severely obese and she legit thinks she is thinner and fitter than the rest of the family. Tries to control all the food in her house, and claims the rest of us don't \"need to make pigs of ourselves\"",

Idrk but point is he is so preoccupied with yk keeping his body a certain way. He often says nasty things about certain body types and it's just blaringly obvious to like everyone in my family (except for my stepmom who just doesn't care lol) that he has issues with food\n\nI hope me saying this doesn't make you feel hopeless or something but moreso that you're not alone and these are not exclusive to certain ages and that you're not an outlier",
