Therapy taught me to think non biased(I guarantee you don't judge others as harshly as you judge yourself), recognise my emotion vs fact, rewrite my core beliefs, help deal with stressful situations, and as cringe as it sounds find who I am, therapy can work wonders if you let it. DBT should be taught in schools so everyone can learn to deal with emotions.",
