  "selftext": " \n\nHello all, I need some help pretty badly.\n\nRecently, my (22M) girlfriend (22F) has begun to sink back into an ED that she once overcame. Since recovery, she gained weight to a healthy level, but her dysmorphia came back as well. She refers to herself as fat, although she is so far from it. I try and tell her that she is beautiful, fit, etc. but nothing works anymore.\n\nAlso, she has taken to begging me to insult her so she feels driven to restrict. A usual evening activity has become her begging me to call her ugly/fat and getting angry and dismissive when I refuse. She accuses me of trying to sabotage her. I'm feeling very overwhelmed and depressed by all of this, and really need some help.\n\np.s. She has refused therapy and professional help, although she went through counseling in the past.",

I cannot support your eating disorder (ie, encourage restriction), but I can support you in fighting it. What can I do?\u201d\n\nAlso would say - take care of yourself. Get space when you need it. Dating someone with an ED can feel like dating two different people, and can be exhausting.",

No even in a positive way because it is a trigger even if you hear that your body is pretty. \n\nI would also advise you to just not give in to her and sit down and talk to her when she is actually in a state of clear thinking. Ask what you could do to help her and why she doesn\u2019t want help. \n\nTake care of yourself and try to stay strong! Go talk to someone would be my last piece of advice.",

      "body": "If you dont feel comfortable about telling her she\u2018s relapsing or she is getting mad when you tell her, try not to mention it at all. When I started to relapse my boyfriend at the time knew if he talked about it, it would make it worse. So he used the times when he was hungry to get some food for both of us, something like burgers for him and a safe food for me or something light like a salad. He then sat with me and ate and talked with me, like he would not notice me not eating something. Because he talked so much and also ate very slowly, over time I started eating slowly and if he needed to he sat there for hours talking to me until i finished my food. I didnt realize at the time but he really helped me, because he brought me to eat even if I felt like I could\u2018nt or i didn\u2019t want to. \nBecause of him talking and me being distracted i didnt think as much about it and if I\u2018m struggling nowadays I always try to eat with someone who knows I am struggling and it helps me very much. \nTelling me to eat something or saying my eating behaviors are unhealthy only make me eat less because i get very stubborn. So if talking with her doesn\u2018t seem like the right thing to do just try to give her food without telling her to eat her. Also works very good with fries or something else which she can eat in a few bits. If you also eat from the fries plate and talk enough she wont notice how much she is eating and how mich you are. But beware because this only works while relapsing because when she fall s deeper in her ED she\u2018ll realize it. (Still helped me tho but thats because he acted like he didnt see me eating which made me feel like i can eat). Just be sure to watch her afterwards to prevent her puking or something like this",

It can be insanely hard and scary to do, but the fact that she has been in recovery before hopefully opens the door.
