  "selftext": "I am done. I feel burned out, hopeless, helpless and loveless. Looking into the mirror I see a tired mare shadow of my former self. My hair, my teeth, my nails, my breasts ... it\u2019s all messed up. Today I have decided to recover from bulimia. I have struggled with eating disorders for the past 10 years of my life (I recently turned 21), from bulimia specifically since nearly 7 years. I have tried recovery and therapy so many times. I did not work out. I am very scared and I don\u2019t want to get fat, but this time ... I will do it. On my own. No matter how hard it is. No more excuses ... no more \u201cah only one time purging is fine\u201d. I made up my mind. Wish me luck ...",

It is possible, but it is so much easier if you can find some sort of support and accountability.  I know what you mean about that \u201cshadow\u201d feeling, but it is almost a blessing to be able to recognize and see that, because so many of us don\u2019t.  I\u2019ve lived in denial, and I\u2019m sure you have too.  That\u2019s when it takes over.  I truly wish you the best in your recovery.  You are important and worth taking care of.",

It's been a long road with relapses and I still struggle with binge eating but it has overall been very freeing and I have never regretted the decision to stop. You deserve a long and happy life - good for you for having the courage to and bravery to want to make steps towards recovery. Sending lots of love and good vibes your way \u2764",
