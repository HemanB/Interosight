But what I can say is this.\n\nI went to my doctor late last year begging for her help because my binge eating became uncontrollable. I literally would binge non-stop. When I was in university, I would starve myself all day, sometimes multiple days if I was depressed, and then binge once my hunger BEGGED me to eat, which would then make me feel disgusting after I consumed all that food. \n\nShe referred me to a group therapy ED program which really helped a lot! I Met people who had my exact ED and similar experiences. I made friends and also  made an effort to understand why my relationship with food was so toxic. The program also was educational. So it enforced intuitive, scheduled and balanced eating in order to dismantle all of the toxic and regressive diet culture thoughts we had. \n\nThis program helped me to see myself differently. It gave me a safe space to be ME because everyone else had the same thing and nobody judged me. I learned about food which helped me get rid of the \"ugh, I just don't even want to think about food cause it's exhausting so I wont eat\" mentality. I get it. Food can be such a trigger in so many ways. But it's a trigger for a reason. It's because we all have some type of trauma either mild or otherwise, and food became our coping mechanism too. \n\nI'm here if you need to talk, though I'm sure the rest of the forum would offer their help too. This community has also made me feel like I belonged. So, I'd recommend talking to your family doctor about your options for getting help. Maybe google some online resources too. If you have a supportive family, talk to someone in your family to establish a support system. Friends too. \n\nI know it's hard. IT can feel like food has control over you. I know what it feels like to feel disgusted with yourself but this isn't your fault. You can get through this!",

      "body": "Of course, it is deep. After all, you are not a machine and nobody is born that way.Maybe food reminds of how your father fed you and reminds you of his abuse? I mean, there it is. And then those stupid sisters body shaming you, for eating too much? And then the mother who rewards you feed food. All you received were contradictory messages about food and yourself. It was impossible for you to ever get it right because there was no way to get it right.\n\nI mean, your father and his sisters almost sound sadistic. There is no way under your circumstances for anybody to be at peace with herself. Don't blame yourself, because nobody could be different if she / he was in your shoes. I know it from myself. These are fucking difficult circumstances, impossible to cope with.\n\nRemember,you are not a machine, you are a complex being and, unfortunately, we, people don't function linearly.  So, cut yourself some slack.\n\nI know what you mean with being never good enough. I am still struggling myself with it, be in in professional issues and not to mention in love. I can certainly empathize.  I had and have ADHD myself and partly it has to do with malnutrition. For instance, magnesium is essential for being able to focus. But then, I could imagine that there is always this voice inside of you that says you can never get it right. Of course, you are trying to flee.\n\nLearning to love oneself is very difficult, especially when you have nobody to teach you. And it is learned. When you are being loved by your parents (I don't want to pry and hurt you, but you said your mother was amazing. If that is really the case, why can't you love yourself?) You need somebody to reflect that self-love and self-affirmation. It is an almost impossible task to achieve on your own and it is not this popculture thing that one gets from cheap articles in fashion rags or magazines. It's hard work.\n\nBasically, it is like rewriting a computer program. And I cannot  imagine how you could do it without professional help.\n\nSo, the first recommendation would be to look for somebody who is specialized on eating disorders. And you would need an experienced doctor since you treat your  kidney issues. I think you would need serious treatment at this point and amateurs and posters like myself might make your physical issues worse. That is the physical part, of which I would say, should be left to doctors with serious experience and reputation. There is too much that could be broken and that should be left to serious and good doctors exclusively.\n\nNow, you said you were in pain. What exactly is the pain about? What are you hurting about? Could you describe it more closely?\n\nBig hugs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBa",

It is no lesser a task than rewriting a computer program. You have to reset all your beliefs about yourself, about your parents, about your family, your friends. Does that sound easy to you? And then, you have these new beliefs and act according to them. You have to break all your automations. That is difficult and you sense that and it scares you.\n\nAgain, we are humans, we are social beings. Therefore, we depend on reflexions from others.

You need somebody to reflect that self-love and self-affirmation. It is an almost impossible task to achieve on your own and it is not this popculture thing that one gets from cheap articles in fashion rags or magazines.

There is nothing gross about you because you eat, either. The body is a chemical factory that works on multiple levels and just like a car that doesn't get fuel and water, it can't work. The same goes for the human body and food. So, in a way, the binge eating is both your body and your psyche fighting back.\n\nOther than that, I can't imagine that somebody who displays your honesty and the vulnerability in your post could be gross. It's too real, too authentic, too honest. Nothing gross there. People are suckers for honesty. And I bet, what you displayed here also radiates when you get in touch with people.\n\nWhich leads me to my next point: Have you been rejected in your past, especially in your childhood, by your parents and / or peers or whoever, because of your *most natural* needs and impulses? It was the case with me and I could trace back my own disgust of myself to that. I mean, of course, in my case, it was bad parenting, it was that my mother has and had her own issues that she projected on me. I had internalized it. That was where it came from in my case. And sexual abuse didn't help either, you know.\n\nI could imagine that you have narcissistic parents. And what kids of narcs do (as I did) is to internalize their parents' expectations. You have them inside yourself and they talk to you and then it turns into this \"thing\" . That \"thing\"  repeats all the things you were told back to you, again and again and again.

I believe that is where it comes from. At least in my case, it was.\n\nHave you been taught and told that you had to be a certain way and avoid being another way to be loved and liked? And otherwise would be rejected? That was (very much simplified) the program  I had running (and still do, to a certain degree) in myself. It's like a country under occupation. Imagine you are Poland and you are occupied by Hitler. That was what it was like inside of me.\n\nI would recommend you to read Alice Miller's books. She speaks a lot about these issues.

I haven't learned to love myself and I don't know how. Every day I wake up and wonder if I've lost weight or not. And frankly at some point food was my comfort. When I was 14 I found out I suffered from chronic kidney  failure which just made things even harder for me so my mom would always buy me food to cheer me up.

So, cut yourself some slack.\n\nI know what you mean with being never good enough. I am still struggling myself with it, be in in professional issues and not to mention in love. I can certainly empathize.  I had and have ADHD myself and partly it has to do with malnutrition. For instance, magnesium is essential for being able to focus. But then, I could imagine that there is always this voice inside of you that says you can never get it right. Of course, you are trying to flee.\n\nLearning to love oneself is very difficult, especially when you have nobody to teach you. And it is learned. When you are being loved by your parents (I don't want to pry and hurt you, but you said your mother was amazing. If that is really the case, why can't you love yourself?) You need somebody to reflect that self-love and self-affirmation. It is an almost impossible task to achieve on your own and it is not this popculture thing that one gets from cheap articles in fashion rags or magazines. It's hard work.\n\nBasically, it is like rewriting a computer program.

There is nothing gross about you because you eat, either. The body is a chemical factory that works on multiple levels and just like a car that doesn't get fuel and water, it can't work. The same goes for the human body and food. So, in a way, the binge eating is both your body and your psyche fighting back.\n\nOther than that, I can't imagine that somebody who displays your honesty and the vulnerability in your post could be gross. It's too real, too authentic, too honest. Nothing gross there. People are suckers for honesty. And I bet, what you displayed here also radiates when you get in touch with people.\n\nWhich leads me to my next point: Have you been rejected in your past, especially in your childhood, by your parents and / or peers or whoever, because of your *most natural* needs and impulses? It was the case with me and I could trace back my own disgust of myself to that. I mean, of course, in my case, it was bad parenting, it was that my mother has and had her own issues that she projected on me. I had internalized it. That was where it came from in my case.

Then it gets worse because this \"thing\" (\"*introject*\" is the clinical word) inside you that tells you that you were \"gross\" starts to lead its own life inside your head. I believe that is where it comes from. At least in my case, it was.\n\nHave you been taught and told that you had to be a certain way and avoid being another way to be loved and liked? And otherwise would be rejected? That was (very much simplified) the program  I had running (and still do, to a certain degree) in myself. It's like a country under occupation. Imagine you are Poland and you are occupied by Hitler. That was what it was like inside of me.\n\nI would recommend you to read Alice Miller's books. She speaks a lot about these issues.

My mother was amazing but my dad was abusive and to this day I remember the pain he brought me. I also Remeber him feeding me crazy amounts of food until I got sick. His sisters would body shame me and reduce what I ate when I'd be at their house and I was just 10 at the time. I've always looked at myself as not good enough for anyones standards. I also have adhd so I struggled alot with people and I was rejected often. It really hurts to write this because I realize that I haven't resolved any of this. I haven't learned to love myself and I don't know how. Every day I wake up and wonder if I've lost weight or not. And frankly at some point food was my comfort. When I was 14 I found out I suffered from chronic kidney  failure which just made things even harder for me so my mom would always buy me food to cheer me up. My relationship with food was always bad tbh and I feel so broken at times. I just want this pain to stop you know?",

And then those stupid sisters body shaming you, for eating too much? And then the mother who rewards you feed food. All you received were contradictory messages about food and yourself. It was impossible for you to ever get it right because there was no way to get it right.\n\nI mean, your father and his sisters almost sound sadistic. There is no way under your circumstances for anybody to be at peace with herself. Don't blame yourself, because nobody could be different if she / he was in your shoes. I know it from myself. These are fucking difficult circumstances, impossible to cope with.\n\nRemember,you are not a machine, you are a complex being and, unfortunately, we, people don't function linearly.  So, cut yourself some slack.\n\nI know what you mean with being never good enough. I am still struggling myself with it, be in in professional issues and not to mention in love. I can certainly empathize.  I had and have ADHD myself and partly it has to do with malnutrition. For instance, magnesium is essential for being able to focus. But then, I could imagine that there is always this voice inside of you that says you can never get it right. Of course, you are trying to flee.\n\nLearning to love oneself is very difficult, especially when you have nobody to teach you. And it is learned. When you are being loved by your parents (I don't want to pry and hurt you, but you said your mother was amazing. If that is really the case, why can't you love yourself?) You need somebody to reflect that self-love and self-affirmation. It is an almost impossible task to achieve on your own and it is not this popculture thing that one gets from cheap articles in fashion rags or magazines. It's hard work.\n\nBasically, it is like rewriting a computer program. And I cannot  imagine how you could do it without professional help.\n\nSo, the first recommendation would be to look for somebody who is specialized on eating disorders. And you would need an experienced doctor since you treat your  kidney issues. I think you would need serious treatment at this point and amateurs and posters like myself might make your physical issues worse. That is the physical part, of which I would say, should be left to doctors with serious experience and reputation. There is too much that could be broken and that should be left to serious and good doctors exclusively.\n\nNow, you said you were in pain. What exactly is the pain about? What are you hurting about? Could you describe it more closely?\n\nBig hugs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBa",

There is nothing gross about you because you eat, either. The body is a chemical factory that works on multiple levels and just like a car that doesn't get fuel and water, it can't work. The same goes for the human body and food. So, in a way, the binge eating is both your body and your psyche fighting back.\n\nOther than that, I can't imagine that somebody who displays your honesty and the vulnerability in your post could be gross. It's too real, too authentic, too honest. Nothing gross there. People are suckers for honesty. And I bet, what you displayed here also radiates when you get in touch with people.\n\nWhich leads me to my next point: Have you been rejected in your past, especially in your childhood, by your parents and / or peers or whoever, because of your *most natural* needs and impulses? It was the case with me and I could trace back my own disgust of myself to that. I mean, of course, in my case, it was bad parenting, it was that my mother has and had her own issues that she projected on me. I had internalized it. That was where it came from in my case. And sexual abuse didn't help either, you know.\n\nI could imagine that you have narcissistic parents. And what kids of narcs do (as I did) is to internalize their parents' expectations. You have them inside yourself and they talk to you and then it turns into this \"thing\" . That \"thing\"  repeats all the things you were told back to you, again and again and again. Then it gets worse because this \"thing\" (\"*introject*\" is the clinical word) inside you that tells you that you were \"gross\" starts to lead its own life inside your head. I believe that is where it comes from. At least in my case, it was.\n\nHave you been taught and told that you had to be a certain way and avoid being another way to be loved and liked? And otherwise would be rejected? That was (very much simplified) the program  I had running (and still do, to a certain degree) in myself. It's like a country under occupation. Imagine you are Poland and you are occupied by Hitler. That was what it was like inside of me.\n\nI would recommend you to read Alice Miller's books. She speaks a lot about these issues. In my case, what helped me a lot was somewhat getting in touch with my core self. I know this sounds vague and corny. But I don't know how else to put it.

My mother was amazing but my dad was abusive and to this day I remember the pain he brought me. I also Remeber him feeding me crazy amounts of food until I got sick. His sisters would body shame me and reduce what I ate when I'd be at their house and I was just 10 at the time. I've always looked at myself as not good enough for anyones standards. I also have adhd so I struggled alot with people and I was rejected often. It really hurts to write this because I realize that I haven't resolved any of this. I haven't learned to love myself and I don't know how. Every day I wake up and wonder if I've lost weight or not. And frankly at some point food was my comfort. When I was 14 I found out I suffered from chronic kidney  failure which just made things even harder for me so my mom would always buy me food to cheer me up. My relationship with food was always bad tbh and I feel so broken at times. I just want this pain to stop you know?",

          "body": "Of course, it is deep. After all, you are not a machine and nobody is born that way.Maybe food reminds of how your father fed you and reminds you of his abuse? I mean, there it is. And then those stupid sisters body shaming you, for eating too much? And then the mother who rewards you feed food. All you received were contradictory messages about food and yourself. It was impossible for you to ever get it right because there was no way to get it right.\n\nI mean, your father and his sisters almost sound sadistic. There is no way under your circumstances for anybody to be at peace with herself. Don't blame yourself, because nobody could be different if she / he was in your shoes. I know it from myself. These are fucking difficult circumstances, impossible to cope with.\n\nRemember,you are not a machine, you are a complex being and, unfortunately, we, people don't function linearly.  So, cut yourself some slack.\n\nI know what you mean with being never good enough. I am still struggling myself with it, be in in professional issues and not to mention in love. I can certainly empathize.  I had and have ADHD myself and partly it has to do with malnutrition. For instance, magnesium is essential for being able to focus. But then, I could imagine that there is always this voice inside of you that says you can never get it right. Of course, you are trying to flee.\n\nLearning to love oneself is very difficult, especially when you have nobody to teach you. And it is learned. When you are being loved by your parents (I don't want to pry and hurt you, but you said your mother was amazing. If that is really the case, why can't you love yourself?) You need somebody to reflect that self-love and self-affirmation. It is an almost impossible task to achieve on your own and it is not this popculture thing that one gets from cheap articles in fashion rags or magazines. It's hard work.\n\nBasically, it is like rewriting a computer program. And I cannot  imagine how you could do it without professional help.\n\nSo, the first recommendation would be to look for somebody who is specialized on eating disorders. And you would need an experienced doctor since you treat your  kidney issues. I think you would need serious treatment at this point and amateurs and posters like myself might make your physical issues worse. That is the physical part, of which I would say, should be left to doctors with serious experience and reputation. There is too much that could be broken and that should be left to serious and good doctors exclusively.\n\nNow, you said you were in pain. What exactly is the pain about? What are you hurting about? Could you describe it more closely?\n\nBig hugs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBa",

In regards for self love, as much as my mother was amazing I feel like there always have been too much negativity towards me from others so I'd always keep to myself. When I talk about pain I mean... Well I think it's psychological and it almost gets physical sometimes and I guess it has to do with my history of psychological abuse. It just gets really difficult sometimes because even if part of me knows this isn't my fault, I can't help but blame myself for the way I am and I'm unable to put the blame on others. I find it unfair to have to deal with this when I never asked for it. I'd just like to live a normal life and not have to feel the way I feel. I would like to have a good relationship with food.\n\nFor the doctors I'm not sure who I should consult. I don't know if it should be a dietitian or a regular doctor.

I am also talking to myself when I am talking to you about this, so, it's therapeutic for me, as well.\n\nYou need to consult a medical doctor and a doctor specialized on internal medicine for the kidney issues. These are the most important things. \n\nWhy do you blame yourself for being the way you are? What is the way you are?  You strike me as very normal, given the circumstances you have described here. \n\nAnd maybe it is time to learn to put the blame where it belongs - which is not you. That part of you that tells you, it wasn't your fault, speaks the truth. You know, abused children often take the blame for the abuse because otherwise they would have to change their minds and rewrite the script of what has happened. It is no lesser a task than rewriting a computer program. You have to reset all your beliefs about yourself, about your parents, about your family, your friends. Does that sound easy to you? And then, you have these new beliefs and act according to them. You have to break all your automations. That is difficult and you sense that and it scares you.\n\nAgain, we are humans, we are social beings. Therefore, we depend on reflexions from others. Therefore, you need somebody to reflect your self-love. Otherwise, you don't stand a chance of succeeding in self-love and change.\n\nAgain, what would be the \"way you are\"?",

You have them inside yourself and they talk to you and then it turns into this \"thing\" . That \"thing\"  repeats all the things you were told back to you, again and again and again. Then it gets worse because this \"thing\" (\"*introject*\" is the clinical word) inside you that tells you that you were \"gross\" starts to lead its own life inside your head.

Imagine you are Poland and you are occupied by Hitler. That was what it was like inside of me.\n\nI would recommend you to read Alice Miller's books. She speaks a lot about these issues.

There is nothing gross about you because you eat, either. The body is a chemical factory that works on multiple levels and just like a car that doesn't get fuel and water, it can't work. The same goes for the human body and food. So, in a way, the binge eating is both your body and your psyche fighting back.\n\nOther than that, I can't imagine that somebody who displays your honesty and the vulnerability in your post could be gross. It's too real, too authentic, too honest. Nothing gross there. People are suckers for honesty. And I bet, what you displayed here also radiates when you get in touch with people.\n\nWhich leads me to my next point: Have you been rejected in your past, especially in your childhood, by your parents and / or peers or whoever, because of your *most natural* needs and impulses? It was the case with me and I could trace back my own disgust of myself to that. I mean, of course, in my case, it was bad parenting, it was that my mother has and had her own issues that she projected on me. I had internalized it. That was where it came from in my case. And sexual abuse didn't help either, you know.\n\nI could imagine that you have narcissistic parents. And what kids of narcs do (as I did) is to internalize their parents' expectations. You have them inside yourself and they talk to you and then it turns into this \"thing\" . That \"thing\"  repeats all the things you were told back to you, again and again and again. Then it gets worse because this \"thing\" (\"*introject*\" is the clinical word) inside you that tells you that you were \"gross\" starts to lead its own life inside your head. I believe that is where it comes from. At least in my case, it was.\n\nHave you been taught and told that you had to be a certain way and avoid being another way to be loved and liked? And otherwise would be rejected? That was (very much simplified) the program  I had running (and still do, to a certain degree) in myself. It's like a country under occupation. Imagine you are Poland and you are occupied by Hitler. That was what it was like inside of me.\n\nI would recommend you to read Alice Miller's books. She speaks a lot about these issues. In my case, what helped me a lot was somewhat getting in touch with my core self. I know this sounds vague and corny. But I don't know how else to put it. I am waiting for your response.\n\nGood luck and big hugs.",

My mother was amazing but my dad was abusive and to this day I remember the pain he brought me. I also Remeber him feeding me crazy amounts of food until I got sick. His sisters would body shame me and reduce what I ate when I'd be at their house and I was just 10 at the time. I've always looked at myself as not good enough for anyones standards. I also have adhd so I struggled alot with people and I was rejected often. It really hurts to write this because I realize that I haven't resolved any of this. I haven't learned to love myself and I don't know how. Every day I wake up and wonder if I've lost weight or not. And frankly at some point food was my comfort. When I was 14 I found out I suffered from chronic kidney  failure which just made things even harder for me so my mom would always buy me food to cheer me up. My relationship with food was always bad tbh and I feel so broken at times. I just want this pain to stop you know?",

          "body": "Of course, it is deep. After all, you are not a machine and nobody is born that way.Maybe food reminds of how your father fed you and reminds you of his abuse? I mean, there it is. And then those stupid sisters body shaming you, for eating too much? And then the mother who rewards you feed food. All you received were contradictory messages about food and yourself. It was impossible for you to ever get it right because there was no way to get it right.\n\nI mean, your father and his sisters almost sound sadistic. There is no way under your circumstances for anybody to be at peace with herself. Don't blame yourself, because nobody could be different if she / he was in your shoes. I know it from myself. These are fucking difficult circumstances, impossible to cope with.\n\nRemember,you are not a machine, you are a complex being and, unfortunately, we, people don't function linearly.  So, cut yourself some slack.\n\nI know what you mean with being never good enough. I am still struggling myself with it, be in in professional issues and not to mention in love. I can certainly empathize.  I had and have ADHD myself and partly it has to do with malnutrition. For instance, magnesium is essential for being able to focus. But then, I could imagine that there is always this voice inside of you that says you can never get it right. Of course, you are trying to flee.\n\nLearning to love oneself is very difficult, especially when you have nobody to teach you. And it is learned. When you are being loved by your parents (I don't want to pry and hurt you, but you said your mother was amazing. If that is really the case, why can't you love yourself?) You need somebody to reflect that self-love and self-affirmation. It is an almost impossible task to achieve on your own and it is not this popculture thing that one gets from cheap articles in fashion rags or magazines. It's hard work.\n\nBasically, it is like rewriting a computer program. And I cannot  imagine how you could do it without professional help.\n\nSo, the first recommendation would be to look for somebody who is specialized on eating disorders. And you would need an experienced doctor since you treat your  kidney issues. I think you would need serious treatment at this point and amateurs and posters like myself might make your physical issues worse. That is the physical part, of which I would say, should be left to doctors with serious experience and reputation. There is too much that could be broken and that should be left to serious and good doctors exclusively.\n\nNow, you said you were in pain. What exactly is the pain about? What are you hurting about? Could you describe it more closely?\n\nBig hugs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBa",

It just gets really difficult sometimes because even if part of me knows this isn't my fault, I can't help but blame myself for the way I am and I'm unable to put the blame on others. I find it unfair to have to deal with this when I never asked for it. I'd just like to live a normal life and not have to feel the way I feel.

You strike me as very normal, given the circumstances you have described here. \n\nAnd maybe it is time to learn to put the blame where it belongs - which is not you.

And then, you have these new beliefs and act according to them. You have to break all your automations. That is difficult and you sense that and it scares you.\n\nAgain, we are humans, we are social beings. Therefore, we depend on reflexions from others.

          "body": "Of course, it is deep. After all, you are not a machine and nobody is born that way.Maybe food reminds of how your father fed you and reminds you of his abuse? I mean, there it is. And then those stupid sisters body shaming you, for eating too much? And then the mother who rewards you feed food. All you received were contradictory messages about food and yourself. It was impossible for you to ever get it right because there was no way to get it right.\n\nI mean, your father and his sisters almost sound sadistic. There is no way under your circumstances for anybody to be at peace with herself. Don't blame yourself, because nobody could be different if she / he was in your shoes. I know it from myself. These are fucking difficult circumstances, impossible to cope with.\n\nRemember,you are not a machine, you are a complex being and, unfortunately, we, people don't function linearly.  So, cut yourself some slack.\n\nI know what you mean with being never good enough. I am still struggling myself with it, be in in professional issues and not to mention in love. I can certainly empathize.  I had and have ADHD myself and partly it has to do with malnutrition. For instance, magnesium is essential for being able to focus. But then, I could imagine that there is always this voice inside of you that says you can never get it right. Of course, you are trying to flee.\n\nLearning to love oneself is very difficult, especially when you have nobody to teach you. And it is learned. When you are being loved by your parents (I don't want to pry and hurt you, but you said your mother was amazing. If that is really the case, why can't you love yourself?) You need somebody to reflect that self-love and self-affirmation. It is an almost impossible task to achieve on your own and it is not this popculture thing that one gets from cheap articles in fashion rags or magazines. It's hard work.\n\nBasically, it is like rewriting a computer program. And I cannot  imagine how you could do it without professional help.\n\nSo, the first recommendation would be to look for somebody who is specialized on eating disorders. And you would need an experienced doctor since you treat your  kidney issues. I think you would need serious treatment at this point and amateurs and posters like myself might make your physical issues worse. That is the physical part, of which I would say, should be left to doctors with serious experience and reputation. There is too much that could be broken and that should be left to serious and good doctors exclusively.\n\nNow, you said you were in pain. What exactly is the pain about? What are you hurting about? Could you describe it more closely?\n\nBig hugs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBa",

In regards for self love, as much as my mother was amazing I feel like there always have been too much negativity towards me from others so I'd always keep to myself. When I talk about pain I mean... Well I think it's psychological and it almost gets physical sometimes and I guess it has to do with my history of psychological abuse. It just gets really difficult sometimes because even if part of me knows this isn't my fault, I can't help but blame myself for the way I am and I'm unable to put the blame on others. I find it unfair to have to deal with this when I never asked for it. I'd just like to live a normal life and not have to feel the way I feel. I would like to have a good relationship with food.\n\nFor the doctors I'm not sure who I should consult. I don't know if it should be a dietitian or a regular doctor.

I am also talking to myself when I am talking to you about this, so, it's therapeutic for me, as well.\n\nYou need to consult a medical doctor and a doctor specialized on internal medicine for the kidney issues. These are the most important things. \n\nWhy do you blame yourself for being the way you are? What is the way you are?  You strike me as very normal, given the circumstances you have described here. \n\nAnd maybe it is time to learn to put the blame where it belongs - which is not you. That part of you that tells you, it wasn't your fault, speaks the truth. You know, abused children often take the blame for the abuse because otherwise they would have to change their minds and rewrite the script of what has happened. It is no lesser a task than rewriting a computer program. You have to reset all your beliefs about yourself, about your parents, about your family, your friends. Does that sound easy to you? And then, you have these new beliefs and act according to them. You have to break all your automations. That is difficult and you sense that and it scares you.\n\nAgain, we are humans, we are social beings. Therefore, we depend on reflexions from others. Therefore, you need somebody to reflect your self-love. Otherwise, you don't stand a chance of succeeding in self-love and change.\n\nAgain, what would be the \"way you are\"?",

It might lead you to abandoning them.\n\nSure, family has a priority. But family doesn't come first. You come first. Especially given the health issues that you are struggling with.

There is nothing gross about you because you eat, either. The body is a chemical factory that works on multiple levels and just like a car that doesn't get fuel and water, it can't work. The same goes for the human body and food. So, in a way, the binge eating is both your body and your psyche fighting back.\n\nOther than that, I can't imagine that somebody who displays your honesty and the vulnerability in your post could be gross. It's too real, too authentic, too honest. Nothing gross there. People are suckers for honesty. And I bet, what you displayed here also radiates when you get in touch with people.\n\nWhich leads me to my next point: Have you been rejected in your past, especially in your childhood, by your parents and / or peers or whoever, because of your *most natural* needs and impulses? It was the case with me and I could trace back my own disgust of myself to that. I mean, of course, in my case, it was bad parenting, it was that my mother has and had her own issues that she projected on me. I had internalized it. That was where it came from in my case. And sexual abuse didn't help either, you know.\n\nI could imagine that you have narcissistic parents. And what kids of narcs do (as I did) is to internalize their parents' expectations. You have them inside yourself and they talk to you and then it turns into this \"thing\" . That \"thing\"  repeats all the things you were told back to you, again and again and again. Then it gets worse because this \"thing\" (\"*introject*\" is the clinical word) inside you that tells you that you were \"gross\" starts to lead its own life inside your head. I believe that is where it comes from. At least in my case, it was.\n\nHave you been taught and told that you had to be a certain way and avoid being another way to be loved and liked? And otherwise would be rejected? That was (very much simplified) the program  I had running (and still do, to a certain degree) in myself. It's like a country under occupation. Imagine you are Poland and you are occupied by Hitler. That was what it was like inside of me.\n\nI would recommend you to read Alice Miller's books. She speaks a lot about these issues. In my case, what helped me a lot was somewhat getting in touch with my core self. I know this sounds vague and corny. But I don't know how else to put it.

There is nothing gross about you because you eat, either. The body is a chemical factory that works on multiple levels and just like a car that doesn't get fuel and water, it can't work. The same goes for the human body and food. So, in a way, the binge eating is both your body and your psyche fighting back.\n\nOther than that, I can't imagine that somebody who displays your honesty and the vulnerability in your post could be gross. It's too real, too authentic, too honest. Nothing gross there. People are suckers for honesty. And I bet, what you displayed here also radiates when you get in touch with people.\n\nWhich leads me to my next point: Have you been rejected in your past, especially in your childhood, by your parents and / or peers or whoever, because of your *most natural* needs and impulses? It was the case with me and I could trace back my own disgust of myself to that. I mean, of course, in my case, it was bad parenting, it was that my mother has and had her own issues that she projected on me. I had internalized it. That was where it came from in my case. And sexual abuse didn't help either, you know.\n\nI could imagine that you have narcissistic parents. And what kids of narcs do (as I did) is to internalize their parents' expectations. You have them inside yourself and they talk to you and then it turns into this \"thing\" . That \"thing\"  repeats all the things you were told back to you, again and again and again. Then it gets worse because this \"thing\" (\"*introject*\" is the clinical word) inside you that tells you that you were \"gross\" starts to lead its own life inside your head. I believe that is where it comes from. At least in my case, it was.\n\nHave you been taught and told that you had to be a certain way and avoid being another way to be loved and liked? And otherwise would be rejected? That was (very much simplified) the program  I had running (and still do, to a certain degree) in myself. It's like a country under occupation. Imagine you are Poland and you are occupied by Hitler. That was what it was like inside of me.\n\nI would recommend you to read Alice Miller's books. She speaks a lot about these issues. In my case, what helped me a lot was somewhat getting in touch with my core self. I know this sounds vague and corny. But I don't know how else to put it. I am waiting for your response.\n\nGood luck and big hugs.",

My mother was amazing but my dad was abusive and to this day I remember the pain he brought me. I also Remeber him feeding me crazy amounts of food until I got sick. His sisters would body shame me and reduce what I ate when I'd be at their house and I was just 10 at the time. I've always looked at myself as not good enough for anyones standards. I also have adhd so I struggled alot with people and I was rejected often. It really hurts to write this because I realize that I haven't resolved any of this. I haven't learned to love myself and I don't know how. Every day I wake up and wonder if I've lost weight or not. And frankly at some point food was my comfort. When I was 14 I found out I suffered from chronic kidney  failure which just made things even harder for me so my mom would always buy me food to cheer me up. My relationship with food was always bad tbh and I feel so broken at times. I just want this pain to stop you know?",

          "body": "Of course, it is deep. After all, you are not a machine and nobody is born that way.Maybe food reminds of how your father fed you and reminds you of his abuse? I mean, there it is. And then those stupid sisters body shaming you, for eating too much? And then the mother who rewards you feed food. All you received were contradictory messages about food and yourself. It was impossible for you to ever get it right because there was no way to get it right.\n\nI mean, your father and his sisters almost sound sadistic. There is no way under your circumstances for anybody to be at peace with herself. Don't blame yourself, because nobody could be different if she / he was in your shoes. I know it from myself. These are fucking difficult circumstances, impossible to cope with.\n\nRemember,you are not a machine, you are a complex being and, unfortunately, we, people don't function linearly.  So, cut yourself some slack.\n\nI know what you mean with being never good enough. I am still struggling myself with it, be in in professional issues and not to mention in love. I can certainly empathize.  I had and have ADHD myself and partly it has to do with malnutrition. For instance, magnesium is essential for being able to focus. But then, I could imagine that there is always this voice inside of you that says you can never get it right. Of course, you are trying to flee.\n\nLearning to love oneself is very difficult, especially when you have nobody to teach you. And it is learned. When you are being loved by your parents (I don't want to pry and hurt you, but you said your mother was amazing. If that is really the case, why can't you love yourself?) You need somebody to reflect that self-love and self-affirmation. It is an almost impossible task to achieve on your own and it is not this popculture thing that one gets from cheap articles in fashion rags or magazines. It's hard work.\n\nBasically, it is like rewriting a computer program. And I cannot  imagine how you could do it without professional help.\n\nSo, the first recommendation would be to look for somebody who is specialized on eating disorders. And you would need an experienced doctor since you treat your  kidney issues. I think you would need serious treatment at this point and amateurs and posters like myself might make your physical issues worse. That is the physical part, of which I would say, should be left to doctors with serious experience and reputation. There is too much that could be broken and that should be left to serious and good doctors exclusively.\n\nNow, you said you were in pain. What exactly is the pain about? What are you hurting about? Could you describe it more closely?\n\nBig hugs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBa",

In regards for self love, as much as my mother was amazing I feel like there always have been too much negativity towards me from others so I'd always keep to myself. When I talk about pain I mean... Well I think it's psychological and it almost gets physical sometimes and I guess it has to do with my history of psychological abuse. It just gets really difficult sometimes because even if part of me knows this isn't my fault, I can't help but blame myself for the way I am and I'm unable to put the blame on others. I find it unfair to have to deal with this when I never asked for it. I'd just like to live a normal life and not have to feel the way I feel.

You strike me as very normal, given the circumstances you have described here. \n\nAnd maybe it is time to learn to put the blame where it belongs - which is not you.

It is no lesser a task than rewriting a computer program. You have to reset all your beliefs about yourself, about your parents, about your family, your friends. Does that sound easy to you? And then, you have these new beliefs and act according to them. You have to break all your automations. That is difficult and you sense that and it scares you.\n\nAgain, we are humans, we are social beings. Therefore, we depend on reflexions from others.

My mother was amazing but my dad was abusive and to this day I remember the pain he brought me. I also Remeber him feeding me crazy amounts of food until I got sick. His sisters would body shame me and reduce what I ate when I'd be at their house and I was just 10 at the time. I've always looked at myself as not good enough for anyones standards. I also have adhd so I struggled alot with people and I was rejected often. It really hurts to write this because I realize that I haven't resolved any of this. I haven't learned to love myself and I don't know how. Every day I wake up and wonder if I've lost weight or not. And frankly at some point food was my comfort. When I was 14 I found out I suffered from chronic kidney  failure which just made things even harder for me so my mom would always buy me food to cheer me up. My relationship with food was always bad tbh and I feel so broken at times. I just want this pain to stop you know?",

          "body": "Of course, it is deep. After all, you are not a machine and nobody is born that way.Maybe food reminds of how your father fed you and reminds you of his abuse? I mean, there it is. And then those stupid sisters body shaming you, for eating too much? And then the mother who rewards you feed food. All you received were contradictory messages about food and yourself. It was impossible for you to ever get it right because there was no way to get it right.\n\nI mean, your father and his sisters almost sound sadistic. There is no way under your circumstances for anybody to be at peace with herself. Don't blame yourself, because nobody could be different if she / he was in your shoes. I know it from myself. These are fucking difficult circumstances, impossible to cope with.\n\nRemember,you are not a machine, you are a complex being and, unfortunately, we, people don't function linearly.  So, cut yourself some slack.\n\nI know what you mean with being never good enough. I am still struggling myself with it, be in in professional issues and not to mention in love. I can certainly empathize.  I had and have ADHD myself and partly it has to do with malnutrition. For instance, magnesium is essential for being able to focus. But then, I could imagine that there is always this voice inside of you that says you can never get it right. Of course, you are trying to flee.\n\nLearning to love oneself is very difficult, especially when you have nobody to teach you. And it is learned. When you are being loved by your parents (I don't want to pry and hurt you, but you said your mother was amazing. If that is really the case, why can't you love yourself?) You need somebody to reflect that self-love and self-affirmation. It is an almost impossible task to achieve on your own and it is not this popculture thing that one gets from cheap articles in fashion rags or magazines. It's hard work.\n\nBasically, it is like rewriting a computer program. And I cannot  imagine how you could do it without professional help.\n\nSo, the first recommendation would be to look for somebody who is specialized on eating disorders. And you would need an experienced doctor since you treat your  kidney issues. I think you would need serious treatment at this point and amateurs and posters like myself might make your physical issues worse. That is the physical part, of which I would say, should be left to doctors with serious experience and reputation. There is too much that could be broken and that should be left to serious and good doctors exclusively.\n\nNow, you said you were in pain. What exactly is the pain about? What are you hurting about? Could you describe it more closely?\n\nBig hugs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBa",

Well I think it's psychological and it almost gets physical sometimes and I guess it has to do with my history of psychological abuse. It just gets really difficult sometimes because even if part of me knows this isn't my fault, I can't help but blame myself for the way I am and I'm unable to put the blame on others. I find it unfair to have to deal with this when I never asked for it. I'd just like to live a normal life and not have to feel the way I feel. I would like to have a good relationship with food.\n\nFor the doctors I'm not sure who I should consult. I don't know if it should be a dietitian or a regular doctor.

You strike me as very normal, given the circumstances you have described here. \n\nAnd maybe it is time to learn to put the blame where it belongs - which is not you. That part of you that tells you, it wasn't your fault, speaks the truth. You know, abused children often take the blame for the abuse because otherwise they would have to change their minds and rewrite the script of what has happened. It is no lesser a task than rewriting a computer program. You have to reset all your beliefs about yourself, about your parents, about your family, your friends. Does that sound easy to you? And then, you have these new beliefs and act according to them. You have to break all your automations. That is difficult and you sense that and it scares you.\n\nAgain, we are humans, we are social beings. Therefore, we depend on reflexions from others. Therefore, you need somebody to reflect your self-love. Otherwise, you don't stand a chance of succeeding in self-love and change.\n\nAgain, what would be the \"way you are\"?",

I would like to have a good relationship with food.\n\nFor the doctors I'm not sure who I should consult. I don't know if it should be a dietitian or a regular doctor. And I guess I should talk to my therapist about this.\n\nThanks again x",

I am also talking to myself when I am talking to you about this, so, it's therapeutic for me, as well.\n\nYou need to consult a medical doctor and a doctor specialized on internal medicine for the kidney issues. These are the most important things. \n\nWhy do you blame yourself for being the way you are? What is the way you are?  You strike me as very normal, given the circumstances you have described here. \n\nAnd maybe it is time to learn to put the blame where it belongs - which is not you. That part of you that tells you, it wasn't your fault, speaks the truth. You know, abused children often take the blame for the abuse because otherwise they would have to change their minds and rewrite the script of what has happened. It is no lesser a task than rewriting a computer program. You have to reset all your beliefs about yourself, about your parents, about your family, your friends. Does that sound easy to you? And then, you have these new beliefs and act according to them. You have to break all your automations. That is difficult and you sense that and it scares you.\n\nAgain, we are humans, we are social beings. Therefore, we depend on reflexions from others. Therefore, you need somebody to reflect your self-love. Otherwise, you don't stand a chance of succeeding in self-love and change.\n\nAgain, what would be the \"way you are\"?",

I've been suffering from depression for God knows how much time and panic disorder for 2 years so all of these things are part of what I mean when I talk about the way I am. I wish I could just have a system reset but I can't just do it. It's so difficult to accept the fact that the people closest to you have brought you so much pain and created the messed up person you are today. They're family and I was always taught that family comes first and will love you more than \"strangers\". So I've always been driven to distrusting others since I expected cruelty almost (which was the case sometimes). Because if that I feel that if I let go of certain bonds with my family I'll be alone, even if I already feel that way frankly",

Again, cut yourself some slack.\n\nYou know, there is being alone and then there is being alone. The worst kind of alone is when you are with people who are supposed to love you, but reject you. Which to me sounds like what you describe. You are thrown back into yourself, into your loneliness, this black hole and that is the worst.\n\nAnd that is what abusive families do: Make your feel unworthy, give you pain and make you distrust others.\n\nImagine what would happen if you started to question your family system and their convictions? It might lead you to abandoning them.\n\nSure, family has a priority. But family doesn't come first. You come first. Especially given the health issues that you are struggling with. I believe your deserve your own focus, your own attention and your own love.\n\nWhat if a friend told you the story that you just told me, that basically she / he couldn't take care of her-/ himself because the family came first, while she / he was fading, nobody else was paying attention? Wouldn't you recommend your friend to focus on her/himself first? Because the friend is the most in need? How about that principle?\n\nYou are not healthy, you are under serious distress and serious pain. Who do you think would deserve attention and love under the given circumstances? You or the family?\n\nHugs.",

Some borderline therapies focus on exactly that. You practise it every day. You remind yourself every day. Until you do it automatically. \n\nNothing that you said sounds \"abnormal\" or \"gross\". Your family, OTOH, strikes me as a different story. Remind yourself that it is them, your family, talking inside your head, who tell you that you were \"gross\".
