  "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nMy niece is 10 I fear she may have an ED I noticed when she comes over she always goes to the bathroom after eating. A few times she has \u201cgotten sick\u201d in the bathroom and could not finish her food. Both her parents have made multiple comments on her weight and I tell them to stop every time. I\u2019m worried about her I don\u2019t know if I am jumping to conclusions she is very open with me so I feel she would be honest I just don\u2019t know how to start a conversation. Is ten years old young to start an ED. I apologize in advance if this could be triggering for anyone. I just want ti help her before it could be too late if it is a thing. Thank you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n I don\u2019t want to put the idea in her mind if she hasn\u2019t done these things purposely But I want to have a conversation",

Their logic and reasoning is obviously still very undeveloped. I think we forget that sometimes. We are reactionary beings. \n\nThey might not have the logic or self awareness to understand what\u2019s going on with themselves so it is a great idea to check in. \n\nI\u2019m the shortest person in my family because I was neglected and malnourished. I wish desperately I had intervention at 10 years old. It was the first time I wanted to kill myself. I desperately needed therapy. I wish anyone in my life had intervened.",

Studies show that early intervention is incredibly helpful with EDs too. I wonder all the time how different things would be if mine had been noticed earlier. Next time you\u2019re alone with her I would open up a conversation about it. Be honest about your concerns, but try not to be accusatory. She might be unaware of the dangers of what she\u2019s doing or that it\u2019s even an eating disorder. We didn\u2019t learn about EDs until 7th grade and I already had been engaging in behaviors before then.",
