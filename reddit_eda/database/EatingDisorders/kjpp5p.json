  "selftext": "Hello Everyone,\n\nSo I have binge eating disorder. Or at least I assume so, I was talking to a therapist prior to the Covid closure about my bad relationship with food. She told me to start intuitive eating and I have joined [r/intuitive](https://www.reddit.com/r/intuitive/) eating and started watching different intuitive eating youtubers. My only issue is that everyone in the ED community seems to be suffering with binging along with and additional disorder, commonly anorexia.\n\nI understand their struggle. They have a very dangerous ED but I feel like I can't relate to their stories. I do not think I have food guilt. That's is what I most often see people mention. Instead I describe my relationship with food like a toxic relationship. When I'm stressed or sad I go to food because I'm seeking comfort and temporary happiness. Instead I binge and feel like shit afterwards. I am not sure if it's guilt I'm feeling... Maybe. It's more of a physical discomfort.",

      "body": "I really want to validate what you are feeling. Binge eating is actually the most common eating disorder statistically, but is often cloaked in a lot of shame and isn't quite as acceptable to talk about as AN. The vast majority of online personalities with eating disorders talk about anorexia.\nWhat I'm hearing you say is you often turn to food for comfort to help cope with distressing emotions. This is actually a super normal and okay way to cope in itself. Emotional eating is not a sin. Finding other ways to self-soothe is critical though so that you have a variety of coping mechanisms to utilize rather than solely resorting to using food. I would encourage you to do some research on or talk to your therapist about self-soothe methods, focusing on using your senses. Good luck to you!",

Do you feel pressure to watch what you eat or compensate for binges? If not that\u2019s perfectly ok and does not invalidate what you\u2019re dealing with. There\u2019s not a competition for whose behavior is the most disordered.",

I am 23 F and have been restricting and calorie counting obsessively for almost a year and lost a ton of weight and became obsessed with seeing the number on the scale continue to go down. I had a cheat day 2 months ago that ended up being a complete binge. Now I've been wanting to binge once every week and it has my anxiety and stress levels very high because I have gained some weight and gaining weight is terrifying for me. Especially after losing so much of it and actually being super thin once in my life and people saying I look good. \nI am so f***** angry wih myself for binging and I hate myself for it so much. Im so uncomfortable with my body now and how much my stomach is sticking out that I don't even wanna take my clothes off or shower because I don't want to see my stomach. :( it truly is traumatizing and hard and makes me wanna cry.
