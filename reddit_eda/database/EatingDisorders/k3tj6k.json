  "selftext": "I'm 18 she's 16, she's struggled with this for over a year now,, it's been rough and she thinks it's not a big deal and I shouldn't care but I care so fucking much I don't know what to do anymore, \nI asked her to please go to her therapist herself but she said she lost track of time and didn't get to it,, she says she's gonna tell her this time but I feel like she really won't I know it's hard but she's clearly not well I have no fucking clue why I'm the only one to see it, it's so heartbreaking, I just need to be reassured and encouraged but the person that encourages me the most is the one I need to betray it feels so cruel but she's hurting herself with this and her mindset is the same as mine before I was involuntary hospitalized, it's so scary, I need guidance I can't tell everyone to my own therapist because of mandatory reporting and I don't think that's a bad thing I'm just trying to give her one more chance to tell her therapist and then I'm pulling the plug and writing a email,  I'm so lost and so fucking scared I love her so much, \n\nI know I'm not over reacting but this feels so wrong,",

I know it\u2019s hard and scary and I\u2019m so sorry that feel alone in all of this but you will be doing the right thing. If you\u2019re uncomfortable telling the therapist first perhaps you can try to talk to her once more and open a discussion about why she\u2019s been avoiding telling the therapist. *ETA* if that doesn\u2019t work, you\u2019re going to have to talk to the therapist yourself. \n\nAt the end of the day it just sounds like this has been really tough on you so remember to take a break and do some self care as well. Your mental well being matters as well.",

      "body": "If telling your therapist won\u2019t get her immediately institutionalized, I would highly suggest that. They will be a lot more knowledgeable than a group of people on the internet (obvi I\u2019m included). Also, going directly to her own therapist may feel like an invasion of privacy, which will make it harder for her to deal with everything. I know it\u2019s hard to bring it up, but if her mindset is similar to yours when you were hospitalized, you know how serious this is. \n\nI would ask her one more time to bring it up to them, and tell her how important her health is to you and how much you value her as a person, and her happiness. If she still can\u2019t tell her therapist, go to yours.",

It may give the doctor a chance to reach out and ask how friend has been without her even knowing you said anything.  \n\nAlso, you do deserve to feel OK, too. You shouldn't have to live your life on pins and needles wondering if today is the day she does something that may cause her harm. It is totally understandable that you are having a hard time deciding whether you should \"tell\" on her or not. Many of us have felt this way at one time or another about somebody we care about for various reasons. But remember, your gut reaction that something is wrong is exactly what you need to listen to. This might even be an act of self care for you and that is so important, too. \n\nShe will never know who told her therapist if you prefer it be confidential. You could even email anonously and explain the situation. I'm sure the therapist can handle it from there without even bringing you up or painting you in a bad light. Acts like this are done out of care and compassion, and when the person is able to understand that they will be incredibly grateful. \n\nYou're a very strong person for realizing you are not equipped to handle this situation and for seeking help. I wish you both all the best.",
