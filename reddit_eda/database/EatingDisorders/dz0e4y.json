  "selftext": " \n\nI'm afraid. I think I might have an eating disorder. recently, i've always struggled with the way I look but it's getting really bad. I'm weighing myself constantly, i've lost quite a bit of weight but I don't see a difference in my appearance and the people around me do. I still look huge and gross. I eat once a day and little as possible. The thought of eating makes me think I'm just going to become fatter and I'd do anything to stop it. I haven't talked to anyone about this yet. I don't want anyone to know or possible tell my parents. I decided to write this when I made a plan in my head to fake a migraine so I don't have to eat dinner tonight. What should I do?",

      "body": "I don't quite know about giving advice on eating disorders, but I'd recommend eating small meals throughout the day if you can. And by meal I mean what people would normally have for lunch or dinner. Just downsize it. It's a step in the right direction. I've gotten to the point where I'm bedridden and I'm sick as all hell, I'd recommend eating, this isn't fun. Please please just eat a few meals x \nAccepting your body for how it is will be the next step \u2661\u2661 your strong and you've got this x",

      "body": "I\u2019m not a doctor at all, let me preface this. But it sounds like you may have body dismorphia. It goes hand in hand with eating disorders and your mind can play tricks on you and make you feel like you are larger than you are. Let me tell you though; don\u2019t let your mind do that to you! I know it\u2019s tough, but please take care of your body. Start having meals you really love and treat yourself to them. \n\nI struggle with an eating disorder too, only just recently seeing help for it and learning why I have such terrible body issues. It helps a lot to understand why you feel certain ways about yourself and to treat it. If you can afford to start seeing a professional, I would recommend it. Also there are groups online and anonymous centers you can go to to help you through this sort of thing. \n\nOr, alternatively, if you\u2019d like to message me to just talk to someone who is going through something similar, I can at the least lend an ear. I\u2019d hate to give you terrible advice since I\u2019m still new to dealing with my own ED, but I know how hard it is to go through it alone.\n\nIn the meantime, please be kind to yourself! Don\u2019t look in the mirror if you have to, have someone hide your scales, and eat foods you enjoy to help pace yourself through it! \n\nEvery journey has to start somewhere, and knowing what issues you have is a great first step to helping yourself heal. You can do it! \u2764\ufe0f",

Judging by the fact that you are already eating once a day and not much, it\u2019s probably pretty bad.\n\nI don\u2019t know what advice to give, but you should probably consider talking to someone professional, like a doctor or something.",

      "body": "Good on you for being so concerned about this because EDs are relentless and rarely let go without professional help. There is so much isolation, shame from lying and keeping secrets, and physically damaging behaviors. You are not alone in this. I would look on NEDA's site and figure out what resources there are for you. Also, check out the advise for parents. Then, hopefully sooner than later, you'll talk to your parents so they can get on board. All of this takes education and patience, but don't underestimate how vicious something like this can turn into if it isn't addressed. You are worth being healthy and accepted for all of your perfections and  imperfections.  Best of luck.",
