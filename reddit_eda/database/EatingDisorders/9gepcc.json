  "selftext": "Does anyone else feel the need or desire for all their meals to be \u201cperfect?\u201d Like it has to be the right time to eat, you have to have measured the correct amounts of whatever you\u2019re eating, take a certain amount of time to eat and not be interrupted or disturbed while eating? This makes me sound crazy maybe, and I\u2019m reasonably flexible day to day with most of my meals, but I just prefer if I\u2019ve planned everything \u201cperfectly\u201d and all goes according to plan. Breakfast at 8, lunch at 12, snack at 3, dinner at 7, etc and I get to eat exactly how much I want with out anyone asking for any of what I\u2019ve alreadg measured... I\u2019m recovering from an ED and eating the right amount of calories, but this perfectionism about food and not wanting it to be interrupted or derailed is definitely the hardest thing to shake. Does anyone have advice for me?",

      "body": "I really agree/echo the sentiment that your body subconsciously sees this as a sacred opportunity; it's so accustomed to not eating often or well, that it sees food as a commodity to be cherished. That, to me, is why you want the situation to be perfect. The best remedy is to keep eating often, and never, ever miss meals or your meal plan if you have one. If you are undereating, your body is still thinking it needs to protect whatever it can get, so your brain reads this as \"do not let anyone/thing get in the way of this!\".  \n\nJust keep eating your nourishing meals per the refeeding plan, and remember: you are going to eat again in a short while. There is going to be a snack or meal just around the corner, and nothing will take this away from  you. ((hugs)) I understand.",

The need to ritualize and make sacred the food is a part of malnourishment and the refeeding is bringing that to the forefront. Also after awhile life will start to get in the way of those rituals rather than them getting in the way of life. I wish you the best of luck! Feel free to pm if you ever need support. ",

A big thing for me was variety. I ate the same thing at the same time for years! Don\u2019t be me. It\u2019s not as fun as I thought it was. \n\nBesides variety I recommend listening to your body. I spent years telling my body what to eat without actually listening to how hungry it was. \n\nAlso therapy!\n\nIt\u2019s gonna take time and you will mess up.

So I'll have to get multiple different foods with different tastes/textures etc. and always need a drink and a dessert. Sigh. ",
