  "selftext": "I responded to a post request to explain how the book [**Brain Over Binge**](http://www.amazon.com/Brain-over-Binge-Conventional-Recovered/dp/0984481702) helped me. This is my response.\n\nFirst I would just say when I read the book the solution really sounded just too dang simple to work. I mean I had been bulimic for thirty years. I am a smart person. I am a health professional and help others. I really thought I would just be found dead some day just lying by a toilet choked on my own vomit. So I was a little skeptical that anything could help me. So that said. \n\nHere is the summary. \n\nOne, one views ones urges to binge as neurological junk that is signaling the body to eat in a primal sort of fashion. \n\nTwo, one tells one self that higher brain functions do not have to respond to urges that don't make sense to them. So I convinced my self that it did not make sense to binge and I told myself to ignore the urge. Kinda splinting your thinking in two. \n\nThree, I stopped reacting to the urges because my higher brain functions told me that it really does not make sense to binge. \n\nFour, I stopped binging. No binge, then no purging. I KNOW THIS SOUNDS TOO SIMPLE. This might not work for a lot of people. I really did not feel that I had a lot of emotional trauma that I needed to deal with. I would advise anyone who feels that they do, to seek someone to talk to about that. I would say that emotional trauma STARTED me to be bulimic at age 13 or so. I know what that trauma was, and I know that that has been dealt with to my satisfaction. \n\nHowever the horrible habit of binging and purging remained. It brought me great personal shame and guilt. NO ONE knew I did this. If someone did know they never confronted me with it. I vomited sometimes many times a day! \n\nI thought that the book \"Brain over Binge\" was very helpful to me. It is written by Kathryn Hansen. I don't know her, but if I met her I would let her know that she probably saved my life. This reddit subgroup was helpful to me. A member suggested the book.\n\n I had never admitted aloud or in written form that I had a problem until I found this. I was too ashamed to ask for help. Not carrying this burden anymore is unbelievably freeing. Thanks for asking. If I can be of any help to anyone, I want help.\n",

I recovered for a few years, but some shizz happened in the past year and I've completely relapsed. It's worse than ever. I feel like I have dug myself into a hole and it's very, very hard to get out of.\n\nNo one knows about this. Not my parents, my siblings, my friends, not even my boyfriend.. no one. They all think I'm well beyond OK for my age and my career. Everyone thinks that I'm successful, self-sufficient, resourceful, smart, pretty, etc.etc. While I feel so ashamed for wasting so much money and not taking care of my body. The feelings of shame make me HATE myself and I continue to do it. I make a decent salary, but all of my money goes towards paying off bills because of debt I've accumulated because of this. This is all my fault and it makes me even worse about myself.\n\nSo why don't I just stop? Please, I wish I could answer that question. :(\n\nThere are times when I feel happy, athletic, and hopeful, and then I'm reminded of my financial situation, along with the lies that I've told my boyfriend and my friends, etc.etc., and I relapse back into this old behaviors. It's like I'm reminded how \"horrible\" of a human being I am for just being this way. \n\nI apologize. I'm just babbling right now. I'm reaching out because I'm not sure what else to do. I barely post on reddit and no one really knows me on here, so I figured I'd post and give it a shot. Thanks for listening!",
