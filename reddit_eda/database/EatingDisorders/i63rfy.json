You're not going to be able to fight this battle for them, and you can't force it fixed. \n\nIf they need to talk, or need help balancing a program, help them. Let them choose who they tell about their ed, and who they talk to about it. Avoid unnecessary comments about how much or what type of food they're eating, or anything that could sound like you're saying they're a burden (cost of food bill is much higher, can't keep food in the house).\n\nIn my program, we just had a session about the best caregivers. Look up caregivers for eating disorders, or caregiver type dolphin. This is classified as the best type, someone who is gentle and firm, compassionate, controls and regulates their own emotions.",

      "body": "Hi! I am so happy to see this post. I am 33 and going on 22 years with an ED. When I was 16 my parents sent me to outpatient treatment. I was pulled out before completing the program bc my mom decided she didn\u2019t like my counselor. That was very detrimental to my ED. That could be a reason I am still struggling daily. Here are some things I have always wished my parents would have done instead:\n\n1. Treat them and their ED as if they/it is normal. Because it is. More common than anyone knows. \n\n2. You will never understand an ED fully unless you have one yourself. Do lots of research. You\u2019re already talking to people on this sub which says a lot. I wish I had a father like that. \n\n3. Do not babysit their ED. \u201cWhat have you eaten today?\u201d \u201cDid you b/p?\u201d Etc. Instead, ask them how they\u2019re feeling? Is anything stressing them? How was your day? Provide a listening ear. \n\n4. Get them out of the house for fun activities outdoors. Spend quality time together. Fresh air and sun can do wonders.\n\n5. Avoid trigger food. It\u2019s different for everyone but try to have well balanced meals together.\n\n6. Group therapy was a wonderful outlet for me. I was able to meet other young women who were struggling and together we supported one another. \n\nThese are just ideas of support that I have personally. I did not get any of this information from a reputable source. I just know that for me, when partners, friends and parents have ignored my ED, I felt like an alien. I wanted to be able to have an open and honest conversation and not feel so alone. The fact that you care enough to write this post says everything I need to know about the kind of father you are. Young women need more of that and I thank you for being a good support to your daughters.",

In my house we never talked about it directly and I know that made me ashamed so I would say ask them questions about what they\u2019re thinking/feeling and tell them what you are. I think you can tell them your trying to be there for them even if it\u2019s not perfect all the time. With bulimia my parents would get really upset if they heard purging which actually did help me to stop solely because I didn\u2019t want to get in trouble and it was hard to do it without any noise. Also family therapy couldn\u2019t hurt. I wish you all the best health and happiness.",

You still need to eat.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I know you are mad at me, I can\u2019t let you self-destruct like this.\u201d \n\nMy favorite book for parents is Skills Based Learning for Caring for a Loved One with an Eating Disorder by Janet Treasure et al. It talks about neither hovering (I forget the animal metaphor) nor avoiding (ostrich), but being a dolphin (gently judging when needed). It is a SUPER hard balance, and obviously some kids need more of the emotional support and some kids need more of the firm authority. It just cannot be all one or the other. \n\nAnother thought is that when you are providing empathy and support, try to a) focus on supporting and validating the emotions and not the behavior and b) make sure that you are still providing empathy, support, and positive interaction in situations that have NOTHING to do with food, body image, or the ED. A lot of my clients struggle to give up their ED because they feel like if they do then their parents will think everything is fine and they won\u2019t be supported or taken care of emotionally. \n\n(Source: am personally recovered and now treat eating disorders)",
