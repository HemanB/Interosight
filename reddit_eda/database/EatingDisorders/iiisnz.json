  "title": "Request: I ate my fear food",
  "selftext": "Update from a while ago: I was sure I had an eating disorder and it turned out to be ARFID, but now I'm on my way to recovering! I ate one of my top fear foods, peanut butter. I developed ARFID from me panicking over peanut butter cookies at one point so this is a huge accomplishment for me! It was so good too, I can now eat more plus the peanut butter \ud83d\ude04 my ARFID surrounded my irrational fear of sudden allergic reactions and now that I ate that my next foods to try are honey nut cheerios, crab cakes and tuna, hopefully this turns out all well and I can eat normally again because my ARFID caused my OCD and it would be amazing to start getting better with my OCD too. I remembered fearing that I'd never be able to eat normally again thanks to the pandemic but I'm slowly getting there again and I can't believe what I'm doing since it's on my own along with therapy and my family helping me. It's so crazy but awesome \ud83d\ude04 thanks for reading!",
