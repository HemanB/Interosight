  "title": "Request: Boyfriend made a comment about my weight gain forgetting I\u2019m a recovering bulimic",
  "selftext": "I was complaining about having big thighs this morning and my boyfriend said, \u201cI mean you do have big thighs, but I love them!\u201d It seems harmless and I\u2019m sure he does love my big thighs, but it sent me into a sobbing mess. I\u2019ve gained weight in quarantine, and it\u2018s brought back some very terrible feelings from my bulimia; that comment obviously made it worse. He immediately realized what he\u2019d done and felt awful.\n\nI know he didn\u2019t mean it in a bad way, but it\u2019s HARD right now. I feel so gross. How do you cope with your significant other acknowledging your weight gain?",

      "body": "Hey! Im sorry, that must be so hard for you. Hopefully he will be more mindful now. If it helps, sometimes men just repeat things. Ive noticed they don't tend to notice little details, so it may be less that he *noticed* and more that he just *beleived you* when you said you had big thighs. \n\nDo you have anything lined up for when you get triggered? I have a box full of things that take me into a different head space. I call it my anxiety box. Mine is mostly filled with kidish things to send me back into that place before the eating disorder (I know that sounds really DD/LGish but its just something I've found helps me personally) and I also have extra green tea in there (which Is a comfort/calm drink for me), phrases that help me, like \"it is not your job to be a pretty thing to look at.\", and lastly, things that remind me of accomplishments I've made. \n\nHaving a box full of things that you find help when you get triggered can be very convinent in the moment. I know its not very helpful right now though. Im sorry that you are hurting. <3",

I might not be able to understand your pain but i can try give a lil advice for when it feels dark from my personal experiences. what I found help me feel a little better about my appearance was taking photos of my body that I felt looked \"unattractive\" and put some affirmations i wish to hear on the photo, for me it feels appreciating and i keep a collection hidden in my gallery so it's only for me to see.\n\nOr if i don't feel ready to take photos of myself, i take nice photographs of things that give me comfort like my bed, or the sun through my window, or something that reminds me of childhood when things were good. I'll take photos of it and either do the same thing like write affirmations or start with bridge statements which has also helped flipping my negative self talk, (a therapist named Kati Mortan on youtube made a whole video explaining this if you wanna watch it someday just type \"bridge statements\" and then her name) \n\nSorry for the long comment just hope this can at least help you or anyone else who's struggling.
