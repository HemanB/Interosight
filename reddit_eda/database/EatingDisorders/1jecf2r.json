  "selftext": "Curious to hear about other people's experiences and how it has affected your health and body. I want to scare myself from continuing the behavior. Not much has stopped me at this point. I've struggled with it for over a year and a half and have spent $25,000 on food that I just spit out. I feel hopelessly addicted, but truly, eating/chewing and spitting is the only good part of my day. But I know I need to stop. Someone give me a reality check. Yes, I know it supposedly messes with hormones, your GI system, etc, but I haven't dealt with any of that yet. I want to hear what happened to you after a while of doing it. I need a reason to stop. Thanks.",

I hit a pretty low point, and the lack of energy I was actually taking in meant I have had depressive symptoms for years, meaning my school work, mental health, and sleep schedule were all on a downwards spiral. I have trouble regulating my emotions, because it\u2019s been baked into my mind as a coping mechanism. There\u2019s no telling how much better my life would be now if I had gotten treatment earlier \u2014 it\u2019s one of the biggest regrets of my life.\n\nIn terms of physical health, oh boy. I lost my period for a number of years, to the point that my bones would be at risk of fracture and my joints would quickly be injured even under small amounts of exercise. Heck, I hurt my knee just climbing stairs. There\u2019s other things, like how it affected my teeth, led to my hair loss (which takes month to recover \u2014 I\u2019ve been in treatment for almost a year and still lose chunks of hair), and even made me start to lose things like eyelashes and my eyebrows.\n\nI look pretty okay now on the outside, because I\u2019m a \u201cnormal weight\u201d, but in truth, I really wish I had hit stop earlier in my life.\n\nPlease take care of yourself \u2014 treat it as seriously as an addiction, even if no one else will. Wishing you a safe road to recovery \ud83e\udef6",

Basically you need to figure out what your triggers are..mine were skipping meals & eating as little as possible & then craving junk food I never allowed myself to eat. Being bored too, so the busier I was the better. And always make sure to take care of yourself and do things that bring you joy whether it\u2019s going for a walk or reading a book. Just thinking back, I\u2019ve made a lot of progress since I posted that reply which is insane as I never saw it getting better. It takes a lot of consistency to break such habits & also undo all the damage done on the body. Your body doesn\u2019t feel safe if you\u2019re under eating/restricting food intake so the sooner you can get out of this state, the better. Good luck !! p.s feel free to dm me with any questions.",

It honestly gave me such good tips for example I\u2019ve switched to diet cordial and chewing gum to help fill me up. I also increased my daily calories so I can eat actual food every time I feel like chewing spitting. Which I know is not an option for you right now in comp prep. If I were you, I wouldn\u2019t try and make any changes until you are back on normal calories. It will be impossible right now . \nDo you feel guilty for how much money you waste on this? I feel so guilty. My husband has no idea.",
