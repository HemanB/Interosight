  "selftext": "Hi I feel bad talking to random people on the internet about this but I\u2019m not sure what to do anymore\u2026 \n\n\nBackground: my mom has been diagnosed with anorexia before and has been severely underweight. She would purge with another anorexic friend in college and would usually just obsessively workout while not eating more than throwing up. I\u2019m not sure how she got through it but even before I\u2019ve become concerned about her  she\u2019s always been underweight.\n\nThe reason I\u2019m concerned now is because recently I found out she takes multiple laxatives and fiber pills a day, she has become even skinnier(I can tell when I hug her it feels like I\u2019m hugging just bones) and she is always skipping lunch. My sibling has tried to bring it up to her (not very nicely or anything but still tried) and it did not work only ended with my mom crying and leaving the room. I didn\u2019t know what to do then so I kind of tried to ignore it but now I have recently seen her in a swimming suit and it made me cry, I feel horrible for judging her body but it\u2019s terrifying to see how small she\u2019s gotten. I\u2019m still a teen and have no clue how to approach her about it or what to do if she says she\u2019s fine, any advice would be appreciated.",

      "body": "Sweetheart, first and foremost: you are NOT responsible for your mother's well being in this situation. I really want for you to understand that deeply. \n\nOf course you are concerned and rightly so. An ED (especially this one) is overwhelmingly difficult to overcome and can ru\u00efn lives. So trying to get her to therapy is obviously smart. Yet be very aware that you are her teenage child and in that role you can't be the one leading her to recovery. Only she can do that.\n\nThe advice I want to give you..\nKeep away from judgment and discussion and focus on your factual observations. Don't be afraid to tell her this and how it makes YOU feel and what you would want for her. She is obviously not okay and she might be in denial, but if she gets to see and  understand what it does to her children she'll hopefully be able to take some action. Speaking from experience; people with and ED have terrible issues with self esteem and don't think theirselves worthy of anything. I'm hoping her maternal feelings will kick in so she'll at least do something, for you.\nAlso, as someone else already said, try to involve other adults who care for her. You should not be doing this alone. And if there's truly no one, please talk with a social worker (your school must have one?).\n\nEvery case is different and I don't know your family situation. But hopefully you can get something out of this that will be helpful. All the best!",
