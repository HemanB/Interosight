  "selftext": "I\u2019ve had an ED (binge and restrict) since i was in 8th grade. I\u2019m now in my first year of college and I still struggle a lot with being obsessed with what I eat. It\u2019s sad to admit but I literally structure my day around food. There have been time periods in my life when it has seemingly gone away but then it\u2019ll come back full force cause something triggered it. In this case I am terrified of the freshman 15 so i am constantly watching my intake and monitoring my body. This has led to a binge restrict cycle. Literally every single day I wake up and my first thought is what is my meal plan for the day. I\u2019m sorry if this is ranty I just want to know how other people get out of this mindset. I cannot afford therapy or any type of treatment considering I am a broke college student so what can I do?",

      "body": "My understanding is that restricting only worsens obsession with food. The other thing I can say is that you may want to journal your food intake and try to see what you were feeling as you ate. Trying to eat your food sitting down at the table, no other distractions, and thinking of what your food tastes like...can help. Then, logging how you feel after - are you still hungry, are you full, are you somewhere in between. Then, think of the fact that you are GOING to need to eat again - which means both bingeing and restricting are less powerful IMO. (Bingeing gets powerful because you are doing it mindlessly, not thinking about how you'll feel after - Restricting is super powerful when it comes to obsessing on food, because you are thinking that you may not eat again for a long time.  By realizing that you are promising yourself you can eat again in 4-6 hours - you hopefully take the power away from these two fears.)",

Now that it doesn\u2019t happen as often now, I don\u2019t beat myself up for it and try to restrict. If you can get free counseling services via your college that would be the best bet.",

      "body": "A few things inportant for you to understand:\n\n1. The freshmen 15 is a diet-culture myth not rooted in actual science and rooted in fear-mongeting diet-culture. Our bodies weight fluctuate throughout our entire lives--this is normal. \n\n2. Weight gain in general isn't inherently bad. That was one of the biggest fears fueling and maintaining my ED for years is just weight gain fears in general due to deeply rooted conditioned fat-phobia and being bullied for my weight as a child. \n\nAlong with the physical side of recovery and being intentional about fueling our bodies rather than being intentional about DEPRIVING Our bodies--the mental aspect will arguably be the most difficult yet most important long-term self-sustaining aspect of recovery. Weight restored\u2260recovered if ya mind still sick. \n\n--This is where CBT and DBT come in handy. Re-framing my thoughts alone and working on identifying disordered cognitions and their mechanisms surrounding food and purpose the behaviors serve and better ways to cope and healthier ways to think and the power of \ud83d\udcabAND\ud83d\udcab in dialectical thinking alone has helped to re-wire my brain over the years. My thoughts surrounding food are so much better and more in tune with reality. \n\nPower of AND: cldialectical thinking in general-- accepting two truths can co-exist at same time\n\n1. I can grieve/miss my old body AND never want to go back to where I was\n\n2. I can feel scared, feel it, AND do it anyways \n\nOpposite action:\n\n1. Instead of experiencing fear and wanting to runaway------> try-----------> don't avoid. Approach head on! Be brave. \n\n2. Wanting to restrict and reinforce disordered pathways------> challenge disordered thoughts and where these messages came from and challenge yourself to eat some food\n\n\n\nED treatment programs and intuitive eating dieticians/therapists throughout the years have given me lots of tools to help cope and challenge disordered beliefs. I highly reccolemd a team! We can rarely do this hard but necessary work called recovery in isolation. We can't heal in isolation period.",

They may even have telehealth IOP options. Insurance makes the process a little easier, bit if not there ARE still options available! Your Health should come first! If that takes a dump then your grades and cognitive health will likely decline as well. I relapsed in college after maintaining and sustaining recovery for years. College can be hard in general with all types of triggers. Support can be life saving and necessary. I had to take off of school, not once but a few times!
