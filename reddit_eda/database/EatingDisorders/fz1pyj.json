  "selftext": "I\u2019ve been bulimic since 1997,  as a 7th grader.\n\nAfter years of this, years of being unable to go three hours without vomiting, much less one full day \u2014 I managed to stop. I had to quit dating entirely, because this was a massive tigger for me, but I felt this was life or death. I stopped modeling, stopped swimming.\n\nMonday will be 100 days. The longest I\u2019d previously gone since childhood was 33.\n\nIt\u2019s a strange time to be in recovery: the isolation is actually helpful, because there\u2019s no concern about what people see or think, day to day. But I\u2019m also left completely to my devices, which has historically been bad news for the binging side of things.\n\nI think the true savior has been the fact that going to the grocery store is frowned upon. So I don\u2019t. I have what I need, but I don\u2019t binge because I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll go shopping again.\n\nAnd now, 100 days. I don\u2019t know what to do with myself.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for rambling. This was the whole point of posting: I want to have a private celebration. I don\u2019t want to watch anything disordered or eat anything \u201cforbidden.\u201d I just want to .. I don\u2019t know.\n\nSo, I\u2019m just here to hear .. anything. An idea or something. I don\u2019t know how to be sweet to myself but I really goddamned want to be.\n\nX.\n\nI hope you\u2019re well.",

Perhaps something like that? Or maybe journalling if you don't already, like write out positive things that you've achieved and benefits to it so you can look back should you reach a point where you need to",
