  "selftext": "When I ask this I have 2 particular celebrities in mind,  who are currently in the spotlight of social media. But my question really applies to anyone who's career involves any large amount of  physical activity.  I watch these people and wonder how they seem to have any enthusiasm or energetic presence at all, when it seems pretty obvious that they must be starving of nutrition? I think about how I felt when I was seriously depriving myself of food and nourishment. I wasn't only miserable mentally, but even with all of the energy drinks I was consuming and despite trying to stay hydrated, I still was lethargic and physically drained most days. How do they do it? Maybe they're taking \"uppers\" of some sort...",

      "body": "I think it\u2019s a combination of things, many of which hinge on them having teams of people supporting them as well as extensive resources. They have private chefs that can ensure that every calorie they do eat is as nutritionally dense possible, with little concern about cost. They also have access to surgery/procedures like liposuction, colonics, gastric sleeves, HIFU, lasers, etc that can literally remove the fat from their bodies or otherwise reduce their weights. This is in addition to state of the art exercise equipment and trainers. It\u2019s also worth noting that their body is a significant part of their livelihood, so it\u2019s essentially like a normal person having a job - for them fitness is a significant part of their job. All this is in addition to them having access to drugs/pharmaceuticals/supplements for anything from appetite suppression to mood elevation to stimulants, etc. Another relevant point is that there is a difference between maintaining a low weight and trying to lose weight when you are already thin. Someone who is already (for example) 100lbs can maintain that weight even eating 1500kcal+ per day, especially if they are exercising - this is vastly different than someone with a severe ED, who is perpetually trying to lose weight and thus constantly in a deficit. \n\nLikewise while many celebrities are thin, it is relatively rare to see them maintaining sub 17.5 BMIs for extended periods - and those that do seem to make relatively few public appearances - obviously there are a few outliers and I\u2019m sure genetics can also play a role - even celebrities in general make up a very small portion of the population. Even still plenty of models in Vlogs with talk about how they will put on 10-15+lbs in their off season, so while many are absolutely starving themselves in the short term, that is not nearly as exhausting as the prolonged starvation seen in some ED\u2019d people. The same is seen in celebrities who will drop weight for a role and then put some or most back on. Many of these people are also young, which certainly helps. Another thing to remember is that photoshop is still absolutely a thing, so it\u2019s also worth noting that some/many photos are not representative of what celebrities actually look.\n\nEven with their advantages, plenty of celebrities have spoken out about burnout, fainting, collapse, etc and plenty have cancelled shows/tours/appearances and even gone into rehab or other treatment for \u201cexhaustion\u201d. Likewise there have been plenty of formerly very thin celebrities who have decided to unapologetically gain up to more sustainable weights (look at Taylor swift, Camila C, Kesha, Selina Gomez, etc). \n\nI know for myself I have had had much better ED-life balance when I convinced myself to be \u201cokay\u201d with having a stable low-ish weight. While it would be great to be at my lowest weight forever - I know it\u2019s not practical to exist in a perpetual severe deficit; while being thin is an important part of my identity, it\u2019s not the only thing I care about, so I ultimately had to adjust my expectations of what was realistic for me and my body.",

I looked heavier when I was at my worst, severely depressed & barely eating each day. Also, part of aging is looking skinnier.

You should also not be drinking on antidepressants, which was her point. Alcohol is also objectively not good for your health, despite societal norms. (There are also numerous studies on antidepressants \u2014 as well as *many* firsthand accounts \u2014, proving that they are actually harmful, but I\u2019m not going to get into all of that.)\n\nThat being said, the point is: mind your own business & focus on yourself.
