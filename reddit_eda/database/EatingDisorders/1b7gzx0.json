Shes only 7 i feel i messed up by saying shes not fat that shes beautiful. I dont want her to think that fat isnt beautiful and i also said \u201cdo you understand me?\u201d I dont want her to think she was in trouble for feeling that way either its been about a few weeks since this happened. What can i say to fix this? ",

Maybe next time, try to validate that she was sad, validate that it hurts to have something say something negative about your body (I\u2019m not saying being overweight/fat is negative or a bad thing, but it was probably meant as an insult). Meet her in her feelings and tell her you understand why she\u2019s sad and it\u2019s okay to feel sad about it, you would probably feel sad if the same thing happened to you. Then be supportive and tell her, that that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s true. That the person said that, doesn\u2019t say anything about your sister, but more about the person who said it. \nThat every body is beautiful and should be appreciated. That she is beautiful just the way she is. That the child who said the thing, is in the wrong and is the one with an issue, not your sister. \n\nIt\u2019s a way to validate her feelings but at the same time learning her to repel insults by realizing, that it actually says more about the person saying the insult, than it does about her \n\nThat\u2019s probably what I would do in that situation, I\u2019m neither a therapist or a big sister though",
