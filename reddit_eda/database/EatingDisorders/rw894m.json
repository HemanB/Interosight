  "selftext": " \n\nWe recently started living together everyday he says  things about my body or weight but last night NYE I was getting dressed  really nice and he wouldn\u2019t leave me alone and called my lower stomach  disgusting and it has to go and grabbing on bits of fat skin. I\u2019m not  sure how to feel I just took everything off and tried to avoid him no  Happy New Years. He did apologizes and weirdly stick around last night I  just wanted him to go on with his plans. Im not sure how to discuss how  this makes me feel to him or just loose the weight and go back to my  old eating pattern. I\u2019d already been in the hospital for not eating and  when I got out he would order me food everyday without me asking he  actually did that recently I just don\u2019t know what to do anymore. He also  won\u2019t let me get a body mirror in the house so idek how I really look.  Sorry to vent like this you\u2019re welcome to cut out whatever you want",

The fact that he\u2019s doing it when he fully knows your history of disordered eating is a million times worse. He\u2019s mean, he\u2019s a bully, and he\u2019s most likely trying to put you down for his own gain. Sometimes people do this to make you feel like you\u2019re unworthy and no one else will ever love you to make you feel like you\u2019re \u201cstuck\u201d with them. It\u2019s disgusting and you need to leave him and block his number. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019ve had to deal with him.",

But also it seems like he thinks ordering you food and having you eat it & not letting you see yourself in a full length mirror mean your ED is gone.

Your body and looking at it and having feelings about it isn\u2019t the enemy of recovery, and making that taboo/not \u201callowed\u201d in a home that is yours too\u2026sounds like a terrible combo along with criticizing your body bc HE is allowed to?? Nahhh son.\n\nLike never even mind that he\u2019s taking control of what you eat away from you, like how could he/anyone be so unaware of the most basic ED tenant\u2014it\u2019s about control lol wtf he sounds\u2026not great unless he\u2019s genuinely just stupid.",
