  "selftext": "I think I have the weirdest binge trigger ever. I binged mutiple times this weekend because I didn\u2019t like how I ate that day? My mind is like everything needs to be a routine, and your meals need to be perfect and healthy. If you don\u2019t follow schedule you failed and you might as well binge. ALL or nothing mentality I think and I hate it!! And the worse thing is, yesterday I had like an \u2018odd\u2019 dinner but it wasn\u2019t unhealthy, it was just more of like breakfast food but my brain didn\u2019t like that, it didn\u2019t fit and I felt the need to binge. Like what? I\u2019ve been binging every weekend for months and it\u2019s all started when I started eating healthy??? Please help! I hate this - I have been gaining weight but IK it will catch up to me and I\u2019m in highschool grade 9 and im a girl so ofc Im going to blow any weight gain way out of portion",

It would definitely be worth trying to develop a more neutral approach to food\u2014 and weight. You might look into some intuitive eating resources so you can start unlearning the ways you categorize or moralize food.",

      "body": "I had a few thoughts:  \n\\- As others have already mentioned: restricting and being a perfectionist about your food intake often leads to bingeing, and you might be bingeing to cope with certain unpleasant feelings.  \n\\- Are you neurodivergent? Autistic people like me can get very attached to certain routines and dislike having them disrupted. I think routines are also a big thing for a lot of people with OCD/compulsions (and others with EDs, of course). It could also just be the all-or-nothing/perfectionist mindset in your case (are you a perfectionist in other areas of your life?)  \n\\- Is your brain looking for any excuse to binge, ie making it seem like \"having an odd dinner\" is a good reason?  \n\\-Why do you only binge at the weekend? Is it because bingeing means e.g. relaxation or a break to you? Is it a kind of weekend \"treat\"?\n\nIt might be worth considering some of these questions as you figure out how best to deal with the situation. Best of luck and lots of love <3",

      "body": "Hi OP, no problem!\n\nIf calorie dense foods are what makes you nervous, here a couple of tips that will hopefully help you out!\n\n(1) Not all calorie dense foods are bad, in fact, foods like olive oil, avocado and salmon have so many healthy fats and a slew of nutritional benefits that eating them in moderation actually helps your body out more than eating \"lower calorie\" foods. \n\n(2) Calories are an aspect of food, but it shouldn't dictate your entire life! Focus on getting the right micronutrients, having lots of fiber (fruits and vegetables) and trying to have a protein with each meal. For example, having a lean protein, starchy carb and fibrous carb with each meal will satisfy and fill you up while being healthy (you can look up examples of each category of food!!!). \n\n(3) You can also plan ahead, so every Sunday you can plan when to have calorie dense foods (even 'unhealthy ones' to treat yourself in moderation ofc) or you can write down the list of foods/meals you regularly have and see where each of them fall (i.e. low, mid and high calorie dense).\n\nThe key is to (1) separate healthy high calorie dense foods with unhealthy ones (but still treating yourself to the latter in moderation), (2) have fulfilling meals with good macronutrient ratios (lean protein, starchy carb and fibrous carb) and (3) eating regularly 3-4 hours with meals and snacks to keep your blood sugar up.\n\nSending lots of love OP xx",
