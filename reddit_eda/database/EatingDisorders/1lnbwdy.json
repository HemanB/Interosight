  "selftext": "I\u2019m using \u2018scary weight\u2019 for lack of a better term.\n\nAs somebody whose weight can fluctuate a lot in a week, I am for some reason terrified of seeing a certain number on the scale. I\u2019m not going to say what that number is, but it\u2019s just a few pounds more than my current weight and is a very healthy, normal number for my height and age. I understand it\u2019s silly to be scared of it.\n\nHowever, I dread the day I see that \u2018scary\u2019 number on the scale, and find myself falling into unhealthy, ED behaviors when I get close. Would love to know I\u2019m not alone with this weird pedestal I\u2019ve put one number on.",
