  "selftext": "I came in worried and asking for help about my ED because I do not want to relapse and she said, \"just eat\". I was like, \"well, if I could do it I wouldn't be asking for help.\"\n\nSometime later I was discussing again about how I'm worried about it and she asked me why am I so worried. And I was like, \"I just don't want to go down that path again, plus, I'm always hungry, so food is all I think about, but it makes me anxious\". And she asked why it she just told me that I should eat.\n\nI just want to know if I'm in the right for thinking that she is not the right therapist for me or if I'm exaggerating. Is it",

A therapist that I find amiable (regardless of what range of directness I may find preferable) would likely be someone I consider talented in their field. Therefore, yes, I would want to do right by them, if that makes sense. (I'm a pleaser, surprise!)\nBut the thing to remember is:\n- EDs that worsen will eventually preclude your mind from thinking properly, so in some sense, therapists are the ones who have to uphold reality.If the T got off to a solid start with the client, the client should ultimately trust their T.  \n- Saying \"just eat\" is poor because it reflects a sense of being tired of you/the person with the ED. It just hearkens to a parent trying to tell their kid \"Just behave.\"  -- what does \"just eat\" mean?  \n1. \"OP, sticking with your meal plan will definitely help you start to see things more clearly. I promise you are not remotely at risk of gaining endless weight, and you know that I promised you I would be honest with you.\"\n2. \"Let's talk strategies about how you would feel more likely to eat; can you find a person to eat your meals with? When you see them eating normally, it will remind you that eating normally is not equal to weight gain. Watch how they eat - they just do it without thinking. That is our goal for you.  Someday, you will get there and it really will be easy to just...eat.\"\n\n^^ Those are comments that I could say are more powerful to ME, but that's just my opinion. \nBTW, anytime people say \"just (anything)\", it's always when there is a herculean task involved.  \"Just go to sleep\" (to an insomniac or a fussy child).  \"Just get off my case.\" (when you are super angry and not likely to drop the issue)  \"Just study harder\".  \n\nI hope you don't feel alone in your feelings, OP.

A therapist that I find amiable (regardless of what range of directness I may find preferable) would likely be someone I consider talented in their field. Therefore, yes, I would want to do right by them, if that makes sense. (I'm a pleaser, surprise!)\nBut the thing to remember is:\n- EDs that worsen will eventually preclude your mind from thinking properly, so in some sense, therapists are the ones who have to uphold reality.If the T got off to a solid start with the client, the client should ultimately trust their T.  \n- Saying \"just eat\" is poor because it reflects a sense of being tired of you/the person with the ED. It just hearkens to a parent trying to tell their kid \"Just behave.\"  -- what does \"just eat\" mean?  \n1. \"OP, sticking with your meal plan will definitely help you start to see things more clearly. I promise you are not remotely at risk of gaining endless weight, and you know that I promised you I would be honest with you.\"\n2. \"Let's talk strategies about how you would feel more likely to eat; can you find a person to eat your meals with? When you see them eating normally, it will remind you that eating normally is not equal to weight gain. Watch how they eat - they just do it without thinking. That is our goal for you.  Someday, you will get there and it really will be easy to just...eat.\"\n\n^^ Those are comments that I could say are more powerful to ME, but that's just my opinion. \nBTW, anytime people say \"just (anything)\", it's always when there is a herculean task involved.  \"Just go to sleep\" (to an insomniac or a fussy child).  \"Just get off my case.\" (when you are super angry and not likely to drop the issue)  \"Just study harder\".  \n\nI hope you don't feel alone in your feelings, OP. They are not \"right\" or \"wrong\", they just are.",

I guess some people just in it for paycheck. Though that does make sense her not doing CbT or DBT. But she should still know enough about it to give u basics! I suggest cBT it\u2019s an evolution of DBT n has most of its components. \nAll I can say is Prozac has really helped with my ED\nN is only antidepressant used for ED\n Good luck. Let us know how next\nOne is. \nAnd I\u2019m very proud of you that you spoke up and advocated for yourself!! Always do that!! N tell next lady what you didn\u2019t like in previous counselor",

If your ED was restrictive, what you're feeling now is probably *extreme hunger* \\- your body's way of of ensuring that the food is not only available in this very moment but will be in the long run (in short - your body's gonna try to store as much energy as it can in case it's just temporary) - meaning after a longer time of \"just eating\" it should stop. What you should also know is that yes, you can (and probably will) feel bad about it; yes, you will probably feel sick from all the food more than once and yes, it will feel like it's never gonna stop. But the more you try to fight it - the stronger it will come back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoesn't cancel the fact that it was a shitty way of bringing it up to you and not explaining shit. Quite an awful therapist if I'm being honest.",
