  "title": "Request: Post request: how do we support my husband\u2019s sister in in-patient treatment?",
  "selftext": "My (29F) husband (35M) never had a relationship with his father (50sM), who went on to have 2 additional kids (15F and 19M). \n\n\nLate last year, his half sister (15F) reached out to him and they\u2019ve been talking regularly ever since. He\u2019s thrilled to have the opportunity to get to know her and she seems like a really smart, sweet girl. \n\n\nShe really opened up to my husband about her depression and anxiety, which he has also dealt with. She also recently told him that she has been struggling with anorexia and has been in the hospital because of issues with her heart. We want to be as supportive as possible.\n\n\nShe was just moved to an in-patient treatment program and does not have her phone to keep in touch. We\u2019d like to send her some care packages to help ease her nerves and make her feel more comfortable in a strange place. \n\n\nI feel like food probably isn\u2019t a good idea, so we\u2019re trying to come up with other things we can send her instead. I was thinking maybe some nail polish, face masks, a cozy blanket, maybe a game. Just some basic creature comforts. \n\n\nIf anyone has experienced what she is going through and has some suggestions for things that may have made their treatment a little easier, we would really appreciate it!",

Honestly, having someone like you guys in my life while I was really struggling would\u2019ve made all the difference and the fact you want to do more is phenomenal. You have no idea how much you guys being there, listening, and supporting is doing for her. As for things to give, I have never been in an inpatient ward but know a few people who have so i may not be too knowledgeable on the rules but a stuffed toy reminding her of you guys would be great or even sending letters (if allowed) I\u2019m sure would make her day!",

      "body": "The responses posted were wonderful. That\u2019s very thoughtful of you to want to send her something. Also, when I was in intensive outpatient (never inpatient) I was around a lot of inpatient people in group therapy and one thing that always stressed them was having to leave and everyone expecting them to be normal, some people even came home to a welcome home party (with food of course). It sounds counter intuitive but most people coming out of inpatient with EDs don\u2019t want that. They just want support as they continue focusing on recovery.",

You have a LOT of time in a program and honestly anything to help pass that constructively is so appreciated. My husband sent me a huge pack of fancy \u201cbrush\u201d markers and rude colouring books and they lit up my days \ud83d\ude02 beads for jewellery making and cord is also great! My favourite things were the letters and photos though, it\u2019s great to be able to hear from those you love (and with some stationary) reply. So that also could be nice, a letter set and stamps? Honestly it\u2019s so sweet of you to want to support her - anything will be appreciated. Steer clear of anything with \u201cedges\u201d even LEGO, and any reading material, anything like that will likely be confiscated or have to go through an approval process.",
