Bloating has slightly improved. \n6. I feel slightly more confident in my body. \n7. I\u2019m able to focus more on other things. \n8. I am a lot nicer to everyone because I\u2019m less miserable. \n\nHopefully this is encouraging to those of you who are starting recovery \ud83e\udef6",

The sooner you can give your body complete nutrition and start resisting all restrictive urges, the better.\n\nI've been on a very standard meal plan in recovery. I can't say that I've always felt fantastic. Early on, I was often in pain from stomach aches because my GI tract was adjusting. I did notice improvements in mood stability and energy levels within a couple weeks though. I really recommend a consult with an RD specializing in ED to discuss your nutrition.
