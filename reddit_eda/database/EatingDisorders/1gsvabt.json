  "selftext": "I really hope none of this is triggering! After suffering from anorexia for 15 years I was able to \u201crecover\u201d during lockdown. I know so many people struggled during that time but for me it was the first time I was able to focus on myself. I think being forced to not have much to do with my family helped me out a lot. \n\nEven when my ed was at its worst, I was never one to really get triggered by others. But I think now I\u2019m a healthy weight and it seems so many celebs are very thin all of a sudden, it\u2019s really triggering me. I\u2019m trying my best not to restrict and over exercise but I\u2019ve noticed I\u2019ve been focusing more on cardio than weight training again to lose a little weight. It\u2019s like there is this huge argument in my head constantly at the moment, one part of me is screaming to just slim down a little and the other is telling me that this is just the beginning of a relapse. I can\u2019t seem to escape all these images of celebs, especially Ariana at the moment and I think it\u2019s what has triggered this thinking. Or is this just a normal part of recovering from an ed? Anyone else feeling extremely triggered too? \n\nI feel so stupid for thinking I was over my eating disorder. I don\u2019t know what to do because I don\u2019t want to let anyone know I\u2019m struggling because they\u2019ll all be so disappointed in me. All anyone does is say how proud they are of me for coming so far and how amazing it is they never have to worry about me anymore. I don\u2019t want to let anyone down but I\u2019m really struggling with these thoughts. ",

I've been relapsing from my own shit in my own life, and I just wish she would address it so people finally talked about mental health. \n\nI pray to God everyday for everyone with this disorder.",

Most celebrities follow insane regimes to look like the \"ideal\" person just so they can keep their fame going. They really push the boundaries of their own body AND mental health because of it.

Body image problems are like, one of the biggest issues for celebrities themselves and the people looking at them.

She's a very clear case of someone who has been adjusting herself constantly for the public view.

A collective known to be fiercely  competitive and triggered by this competition with each other, if only in their minds. It's a hella storm. \n\nAs someone who once struggled many years with substance use, to me, this seems almost like, if there were drug dealer influencers, seeking to high jack the online substance abuse recovery community. \n\nI mean, thank God I didn't have to look at a bunch of beautiful,  influencers, over the top in their standards of petite, pretty perfection and popularity,  openly, glamorously doing a bunch of drugs, while looking peak beautiful, and like they have the most AMAZING life ever, and EVERYTHING is beyond GORGEOUS, ALL under the guise of, \"Oh, hey, this is my new HEALTHY ME, this is RECOVERY ME, because I slapped the recovery label onto my brand.  Meanwhile they weigh 90 pounds, EVERY weird angled photo is selected for how well it shows off their bones, and they are picking at a quarter of a whole wheat muffin. \n\nIt's like the world tapped into the recovery community label and high jacked it with EVERY worse behavior possible. The body check photos are insane. \n\nI only struggled with anorexia for a few years, now I'm older I don't care anymore. But, I struggled so many YEARS with other things, and it was brutal. \n\nLooking at the influencer communities, and the insanity of the manipulation is WILD. THANK GOD I never had to deal with something like this as a young person, or when my dysfunctional behaviors were at their WORST.  \n\nFood is never going to be illegal, and beauty,  is always going to be celebrated. The association of beauty with wealth, privilege, youth and thinness is A Thing. And, all those elements, with Ozempic and Influencers are a new generation's dual torches of horrific, collective dysfunctional behaviors, lightning the flame of a perfect firestorm.  \n\nIt's awful.
