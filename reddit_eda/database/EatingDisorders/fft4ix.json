  "selftext": "Perhaps a lot of people dealing with overeating can relate. There is this one food that always turns you into a ravenous monster, almost as if you were physically addicted to it. For me that's milk chocolate. If it's any other type of chocolate or candy I often don't even end up binging but milk chocolate is a blessing and curse to me at the same time.\n\nNow, the obvious answer would be to never touch my favorite chocolate brand ever again but that would be a really sad life. Has any of you given up on your favorite food for good or did you manage to limit the intake to a healthy amount?",

I know from being in recovery that due to the nature of my ED, my binging is usually caused by my restriction. I am still working on a lot of food exposure and unfortunately I usually just avoid highly triggering foods. My nutritionist and I have worked through food exposure and talking through feelings around eating foods together I would binge on or be scared of to put  a voice to the feelings and sit with it. I've found this exposure helpful but it is very hard and takes time. I have also tackled some of my binge temptation foods by allowing myself to have a little bit in order to honor my craving but recognize I don't have to binge.

I use techniques like CBT to stop the sequence of feeling and acting on cravings, questioning why I\u2019m having a craving and do I really need that thing? Am I hungry? Am I\nIn my calorie budget?

It's hard at first, but after about 6 weeks it actually gets really easy.  I stop craving my regular binge foods and it stops feeling sad to not be able to have them.

For some restriction only leads to more bingeing, but for me it is definitely an effective long term solution to my eating problems.  My bingeing seems to come from dopamine chasing due to my ADHD.

Once your craving chocolate, you want chocolate. Rice and avocado will never be chocolate. Then you\u2019ll just end up eating that, then getting the chocolate anyway and binging purely cuz you feel bad about it\u2019s Just enjoy the chocolate now and then add more carbs and fat to your meals till you no longer find the need to binge.

Looking back, I wish I had used some of your advice on certain binges of mine. Because some of them truly were triggered by not having enough food earlier in the day. But then again, there are times where I have had enough for all meals, balanced nutrition too, yet i felt the trigger to binge. Whether it was for a certain food or just food in general. \n\nIt's hard but I do appreciate your comment regarding trying to look into what food cravings may be signaling for us outside of just emotion. It's a great tool! Heck, I've met someone who had depression clear right up after she realized she was low on b12, so yes, nutrition itself plays a big part in all this!",

You don\u2019t have that feeling of \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be doing this so better enjoy it and eat it all now because I can never have it again\u201d. When you have no guilt and are full, you don\u2019t mind saving some until the next day. As some other users have shared, this may not work 100% for everyone. I can only speak for my experience. When I allowed myself to eat whatever, the rule I roughly tried to follow was 80% mostly Whole Foods cooked at home meals (not the store Whole Foods, idk why my phone always capitalizes that and I\u2019m tired of fixing it lol) and 20% not. I didn\u2019t follow this crazy strictly, but would try to think to have 4 meals I made myself then 1 meal out with friends if I wanted. At first I did gain a little bit of weight, which I know is scary for some people. It took a while to get out of the binging mindset. But after 7 months I had lost a ton. I would show ya before and after but know it\u2019s off limits on this for good reason. I know 7 months seems like a long time, but when we\u2019ve been dealing with eating and weight issues for so long it\u2019s really not. OO ANOTHER TIP that I think worked for me is when I was craving chocolate, I tried to eat it in the morning. I noticed in the morning I didn\u2019t want to feel as sickly full and I think being active during the day after eating it helped. \n\nThat was 3 years ago, and I have maintained a healthy weight since. Another thing I like to do is when I would look in the mirror and think my stomach or legs or whatever looked fat, I would try to thank them instead. Like I would have that thought then say to myself \u201cthank you legs for carrying me throughout the day\u201d. It sounds stupid, but I think thanking my body for what it does for me instead of pointing out flaws really started to change my mindset. Like I wanted to treat my body right instead of punish it if that makes sense?",

      "body": "I felt that way for a really long time. And I feel like we see all this stuff saying how biology makes you want to eat and to store fat because in the past we didn\u2019t have enough food. I\u2019ve been in scientific research since high school and the science field for a while so sorry if this is super nerdy lol but I don\u2019t fully buy that. Your body wants to be healthy above all. It is true that when you starve your body or are lacking certain nutrients, it\u2019ll try to gain a lot of weight in case it starves again. But once your body feels comfortable that it\u2019s not going to starve and you are getting all the nutrients you need it\u2019ll want to be a healthy weight. \n\nI think the biggest issue with people who diet off and on is when they diet they are not giving their body enough calories so then when they do eat they feel super hungry and also their body wants to hold all that in case you don\u2019t eat again. Your body knows best how many calories it needs. Not some app. I do think those apps can be helpful for a few days if you don\u2019t see why you\u2019re not losing weight, use it for a few days, and see if you\u2019re way over. Intuitive eating is way better if youre cooking stuff at home. Like when I\u2019m craving French fries I like to cut up a potato, add some salt and some olive oil, then cook them in the oven (or air frier is my new fav). In general the more whole foods you\u2019re eating the better. But that doesn\u2019t mean you should\u2019ve have chocolate or Taco Bell from time to time (Taco Bell is actually one of the better fast food places cuz they use more Whole Foods than other places). \n\nAnd if you\u2019re bored eating, sounds stupid but try out a hobby! Or lifting weights. You can def eat a lot more when you\u2019re lifting haha. Or if your stress eating then that\u2019s definitely something to talk about in therapy or by exploring your own thoughts and feelings more deeply. \n\nFrom my own experience and what every \u201chealth\u201d guru that isn\u2019t just trying to sell you something says, if you treat your body it\u2019ll treat you right back. I suffered from binge eating and eating disorders for a long time so I know the stress. Feel free to DM me if you have any questions / need to talk about stress eating... never offered that on a post before lol. Idk if that\u2019s weird. But offer is open \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I really feel for people who feel this way cuz I\u2019ve been there. I\u2019d also recommend checking out the book the dorito effect.

Once your craving chocolate, you want chocolate. Rice and avocado will never be chocolate. Then you\u2019ll just end up eating that, then getting the chocolate anyway and binging purely cuz you feel bad about it\u2019s Just enjoy the chocolate now and then add more carbs and fat to your meals till you no longer find the need to binge. And if you\u2019re still binging, you\u2019re not adding enough for you. Hope that helps!",
