  "title": "My brother's wife (F40) is Bulimic and does not seem to care.",
  "selftext": "They have 3 kids between the 2 of them. Dead bedroom relationship and there simply is no reasoning with this spouse. They do it openly where in a sitting, they would go to the washroom 3 to 4 times to purge, binge eat like there is no tomorrow. I am talking $100-200 worth of takeout per day.\n\nEarly in there marriage, the normal approach of being supportive and visiting professionals were taken but a decade on, she has totally embraced this and does not seem to care. The other day, kids came back from school hungry where she just cooked 2 pounds worth of shrimp and ate them alone and immediately purged. Kids had fast food.\n\nMy brother relies on takeout food and an air-fryer to eat as he also works full time and doesn't have much time once all is said and done.\n\nShe has recently managed to get an Ozempic injection to maintain this vicious cycle.\n\nMy brother is basically numb at this point and has given up. Kids are practically raising themselves. Brother oversees their schoolwork and has conversations with them about school/life issues when he can. Mother's affection is that of a pet owner to a pet. A couple of spontaneous hugs and kisses throughout the day.\n\nIf it matters, she is confirmed diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I personally feel that there is no resolve in this. My brother is in the marriage for the kids but I don't feel like it makes much of a difference. Is she at the point of no return? She consciously and clearly does not care. She is intelligent and educated.",

Even if a parent tries to hide an eating disorder like this, kids pick up on it, so the fact that it is out in the open is even more heartbreaking and scary. My mother had a an unhealthy relationship with food and because of that and other trauma from our childhood my siblings and I all have different iterations of eating disorders, but we are working through it. \n\n2. As for staying in the marriage for the kids- again I only know the details you have shared but perhaps you could raise the question to your brother- is that\u2019s what\u2019s best for the kids? Not only in terms of their daily exposure to their mother\u2019s eating disorder but also the model of a marriage they are seeing. \n\n3. It sounds like this feeling of numbness from your brother and her seemingly not caring is a survival mechanism and again I doubt she doesn\u2019t care. She may be just so far deep into her eating disorder. In my experience, my eating disorder was a way to cope with my emotions- I used food to numb my emotions. \n\n4. There are medications like vyvanse that can specifically help with binge eating disorder. \n\nI would say she really needs to see an eating disorder therapist. There are outpatient and partial hospitalization programs that could really help her too. I realize she may not be in the place to be willing to get help but if your brother could speak with a therapist that could be a helpful starting point to give him the support he needs and knowledge of how to approach this. I know this may not be financially feasible, so a great place to start could also be support groups, which could be less intimidating. There are free support groups for not only for those who are suffering from eating disorders but also for loved ones of those who are. \nIf your brother isn\u2019t willing at this point to do that, if you have the time and emotional capacity, you could consider doing so yourself and this way you could get advice or resources from others. \n\nhttps://www.allianceforeatingdisorders.com/groups/",

Obviously just a drug isn\u2019t going to help, and therapy and getting down to the root cause is essential. I think EDs are extremely complex, both chemically and emotionally. Taking care of the chemical aspect might assist in helping the emotional component",

          "body": "A chemical agent to aid an addiction in the addition of specialized therapy is not always a bad thing. However, I don't think it is wise to compare the chemical treatment of substance abuse to the chemical treatment of an eating diaorder. This is an opinion shared by my therapist who used to run eating disorder clinics. The mechanism of \"addiction\" to an eating disorder is not the same. In addition, Ozempic is not approved as a treatment for bulimia which is why I don't think there should be any discussion in favor of that method on this subreddit. I'd argue that this new Ozempic culture is incredibly disordered in a large percentage of cases (not all).\n\nWith that in mind, I'd like you to consider what the medications can potentially do to perpetuate disordered eating and diet culture mentality. If we use a stimulant such as Vyvanse, its mechanism of action is to suppress appetite. While appetite can be a component of eating disorders, appetite is not what fuels a disorder.  There are plenty of people who receive appetite suppressants to \"help\" binge eating with no therapy, and the medication is not enough. There are people who get gastric bypass procedures to try and \"control their eating\" who will still binge eat and engage in disordered eating behaviors. \n\nIn summary, chemical treatment can be okay, but it should never be the sole form of treatment. Drugs should be used in accordance with what they are used to treat, and discussing non-approved off-label use should not be encouraged on a subreddit meant to be more recovery-oriented.",

For example, Cymbalta is one of the best drugs (imo) for treating fibromyalgia and arthritic pain and for a while that would have been an off label use until it was approved as a treatment for those conditions. It started out just as an antidepressant. \n\nSemaglutides started out as diabetes medications, and for a while prescribing them for weight loss/BED was off-label. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s irresponsible to speculate that GLPs could be helpful with bulimia in combination with other therapies",
