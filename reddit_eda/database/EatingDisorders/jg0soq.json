  "title": "Request: how did you get back to eating normal sizes and not feeling guilty? How do you know the limit?",
  "selftext": "Hi guys, 17f. Ive been struggling with this since i was about 11. It got really bad for a couple of years, then i started recovery at around 14. The past 3 years have been hard but worth it; im eating 3 meals, i dont have mood swings, im not tired all the time.\n\nThis past year has been the peak. But Im starting to get antsy again. My mom tells me how ive got to stop eating so much, and i have been eating more than normal, but what is \"normal\"? Should i have snacks between two meals every day? How much is too much?\n\nI had to go up a pants size for the first time in years. I know its because im eating regularly and thats a good thing, but i cant even fit into my old pants anymore.\n\nTy <3",

But, if you've been restricting for a long time your hunger signals are probably off. I'm sorry your mom is telling you this but she's wrong-- we often need to go through a period of \"overfeeding\" to get our hunger signals back and be able to intuitively eat.",

      "body": "1-is common to eat more than \"normal\" on the first stages of recovery, your body is compensating for all the years of abuse, so dont worry too much about it. Try to drink enough water and eat until youre full (look up intuitive eating!). At first is difficult but with time your sense of fullness will adjust, be patient, conscious and keep working on it.\n\n2- My family does the same exact thing and it sucks, it triggers me a lot and it makes me feel shameful and disgusting. Heres how i cope with it: conversation. Most of the times they dont do it to harm my feelings and is the result of conservative/outdated mentality. I try to calmly explain to them that My eating is not their problem because it's still healthy, that i dont need to explain it, and that it hurts my feelings. If you are brave enough consider \"coming out\" to your family about your struggles. Lastly, if talking doesnt work, just straight up ignore them and keep in mind they dont understand the full context of your eating habits.\n\n3- weight gain is expected ofc but its great that you know its a good thing. When trying on new clothes try to make the whole plan something fun, try buying new clothes with Friends, go to places where you know youll have plenty size variety. Also, most weight gain happens on the first year of recovery, then itll mostly stay stable if You don't have any issues. It may be hard now and seem excessive but if You look at it from a greater spectrum it's probably not that much. \n\nLastly: stop weighting if You do \n\n(Edit: typos >:( )",

      "body": "I really admire your strength and commitment. What really helped me is starting with healthy snacks! There might be some residual guilt, but at least that will help until you start gaining the trust back with your body so you can enjoy all the yummy foods you like. Trust your body, not your mom's opinion. Some days I eat two huge meals and some days I just munch all day and once I started trusting my body, my weight was healthy and stayed that way, so I stopped worrying about \"losing control\" of eating and constantly fearing that I was going to turn into some binge-monster.

Talking to a dietitian is also good, they can help you figure out how much to eat and adjust portions based on your bodies functions.",
