  "selftext": "I decided to spend time with my friend for his birthday. I used to have bulimia and recovered from it. Took years for me to be okay with eating again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy friend was looking at old videos of us from 2 years ago and said \u201cback then when you used to be skinny.\u201d And I\u2019m honestly so hurt that my friend would say this to me knowing how insecure I\u2019ve been about my body.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow I feel so triggered. I want to go back home and forget about his birthday. I also don\u2019t have anyone that I\u2019d call a close friend. I feel so alone and misunderstood. How do I recover from this? Am I overreacting? Am I too sensitive? Idk",

That's what matters. \nIt was really hard for me to accept changes and people's stupid two cent comments of them noticing said changes. But you have to try to look at that photo differently. \nWere you healthy in that photo ? Probably not. \nWere you in the vicious cycle of ED? probably. \nWere you even happy? Probably not. \n\nThose things matter more. You got this babes. You're stronger than words",

I think it\u2019s a good moment to reflect on how we, as people with eating disorders automatically assign a positive value to that word, \u201cskinny\u201d and all of the things that we associate with it. I promise your friend does not think negatively of you for getting healthy, it is again your ED trying to lure you back in and twisting his words so that \u201dskinny\u201d is good and you \u201darent good\u201d anymore. That is the OPPOSITE of true. being in a healthier place physically and mentally will make you a better friend, a better person, a better student, etc- all EXTREMELY \u201cgood\u201d things. dont let your ED convince you otherwise. Also, I\u2019m not sure of your ages but often times younger males tend to not really think about their words- they say things without thinking about the implications- I promise he was not trying to hurt you or make a negative comment about your appearance- sometimes even my husband who is well into his 30s suffers from \u201cfoot in mouth\u201d disorder ;)",

That\u2019s absurdly rude and inappropriate\u2014it would be regardless if he didn\u2019t know you\u2019ve felt insecure, but the fact that he does know makes it worse.\n\nEDs are inherently isolating. I\u2019ve felt the same in the past and realllly been feeling the same lately\u2014like I don\u2019t have close friends and so it feels inevitable to put up with insensitivity.\n\nIdk if you\u2019re looking for suggestions but if you are, one thing that\u2019s REALLY helped lately for me lately is attending a weekly zoom support group for eating disorders. It hasn\u2019t solved my problems but it has made me feel so much less alone\u2026and like maybe trying to make new friends wouldn\u2019t be the worst idea in the world, haha.\n\nSending you lots of love and support, stranger.",

Maybe substitute the word with \u201cmalnourished\u201d \u201cunhealthy\u201d \u201cundernourished\u201d etc. as your internal dialogue. This will take time. That way going forward, if/when this comment comes up again you reply with \u201cya, look how undernourished I was. I\u2019m much healthier now.\u201d A true friend will whole heartedly agree. That your health is #1. And remember that it takes time to redistribute weight and maybe longer than 2 years. You are probably still healing.",
