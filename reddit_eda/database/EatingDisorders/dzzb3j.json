  "selftext": "My wife has a really bad eating disorder. I worry that it will rub off on my daughter. Combined with the eating disorder is really bad anxiety. She refuses to go to therapy. \n\nI'm worried about my daughter though. My wife gets to me pretty often and hurts me emotionally and I'm a grown man - I can only imagine the affect it has on our daughter. She's only 4. \n\nRecently our daughter is refusing to eat lunch at daycare. She eats decently at home, albeit slowly. I'm worried the eating disorder is starting to affect her. I've heard it can affect even kindergarten aged children. \n\nIs this normal kid behavior or the beginning of an eating disorder?  How do I make sure my daughter doesn't copy my wife's behavior?",

      "body": "Counseling or counseling with a dietitian who believes in intuitive eating may be helpful to the daughter then. They would have the most insight into what is normal and what is abnormal for her age. They could also coach you on demonstrating healthy and normal eating behaviors to the little one. As you know, the kiddos see and pick up on sooooo much more than you\u2019ll even know until they\u2019re much older. It\u2019s vital this is addressed now. \n\nI first began engaging with my ED in the first grade, and that\u2019s really only as early as I can remember. My mother had an untreated ED too. Earlier intervention by a professional could have saved me soooo much struggle. \n\nSo, it\u2019s your choice and it may be hard to find someone wanting to work with this situation, but unless you\u2019re going to leave your wife, I urge you to consider my suggestion :) Good luck! It\u2019s great that you have this insight and want to help your child develop normally and safely.",

While it could be eating disorder related, I would give it a week or two and see what happens. With a four year old, maybe making the food fun or allowing for some playing with foods could help. I would also recommend having the mom get help for her eating disorder. Even if she refuses inpatient treatment, there are free eating disorders anonymous meetings, recovery podcasts, and tons of literature focused on eating disorders and recovery.",

      "body": "EDs run in my family. Me, my sister, my mom, my uncle, and my grandmother all have an ED of some sort. My little sister (not the one with the ED) is someone I worry about constantly. She\u2019s much younger than I am, only 11, but she grew up in a house with three women who had EDs. She\u2019s very vigilant about that stuff, she\u2019s seen me looking into a mirror and instinctively knew I was criticizing myself, she hugged me and told me I look great. She\u2019s very slim and athletic and still worries about her body so I worry that she will develop one as well. I\u2019ve had my eating disorder since I was even younger than 11, she could already have one for all I know. \nMy advice is to have a GOOD talk about this with your wife. You are 100% valid in being worried for your daughter, I would be too. \nMake sure you teach your daughter healthy eating habits, and never make her feel ashamed for ANYTHING she eats. GUILT is a main factor in eating disorders, remember this. A major reason I developed anorexia is because of my mother criticizing my eating habits from an early age and never teaching me proper eating habits. My mother is bulimic and would always eat in secret/by herself so we never sat down for proper meals at proper times, she would occasionally make me dinner and then I had to just raid the snack cabinet/fridge for all my other meals. My whole life I never had breakfast, and would often just skip lunch at school because she never packed me anything and the school lunches were not appealing to me since I\u2019m a picky eater. In the end this lead to me only eating dinner, and I would eat a lot at once which made my mother angry because she thought I was binging even though it was my only meal that day. Even now, being a full grown adult who does not live with her, I only eat at night, even when I\u2019m trying to eat normally. The only food I can bring myself to eat during the day is meal replacement bars. \nI never had a father, maybe if I had a caring and supportive dad to make sure I was properly fed things would have been very different. Your daughter is so lucky to have a father like you who cares! \nThere\u2019s only so much you can singlehandedly do, your wife has a lot more she needs to do to make sure your daughter grows up with a healthy attitude towards food and her body. Your wife needs to realize that her eating disorder is not just about herself anymore, children pick up on behaviors very easily and it\u2019s not something they can simply un-learn when they are older. If your daughter develops an ED, it could be what kills her. \nAlso, as someone very stuck in their disordered habits, I know it won\u2019t be easy for your wife to just stop having an eating disorder. What she really needs to do is pay close attention to what your daughter sees and hears. She needs to NEVER criticize her own appearance or her eating in front of your daughter. \nYou can\u2019t control your wife\u2019s actions, she might never change because eating disorders can make people very selfish. Even if she doesn\u2019t change, just do the best you can. Love your daughter no matter what, be positive with her, always be encouraging. Never give up on her. Make sure she NEVER feels unloved. I really REALLY hope your daughter never has to go through this terrible disease. And I hope your wife can get better too.",
