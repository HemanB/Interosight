  "selftext": "I finally sought out help and contacted a center and after the intake assessment they suggested inpatient care. I can\u2019t take time off of work, I just started I don\u2019t even have sick days yet. \n\nBecause I can\u2019t do inpatient they can\u2019t treat me at all. I don\u2019t know what to do. It took so much for me to take that step and talk about everything and I obviously need help but they won\u2019t help me. \n\nI feel so helpless. I just want to be better. What do I do next?",

I put my stuff in a storage unit and went to treatment. I didn't lose my job but I did lose my paycheck for 6 weeks and lost my home (hence the storage locker). I strongly suggest you do the same. Your job doesn't matter, you can always get another one. And if you're unemployed you can get state funded health insurance and possibly disability or unemployment to cover the cost of your storage locker and medical bills (which you will be able to get a payment plan for). Please go to treatment. ED is the deadliest mental illness second to substance use disorder. Your life is at stake.",

But don't give up.  As mentioned, it's a disease.  You need treatment, so if you can find outpatient, go for it!\n\nI'm personally of the opinion that we overhospitalize in the US.  So as long as you are committed to getting better, outpatient or therapy with a specialist several times a week can work.  \n\nDo you have someone to help you at home?  That is also a good thing, that way they can help with safety if you are struggling.",

If you do end up taking unpaid sick leave I believe there are different levels of unemployment that you can apply for; assuming you are in a state that has something similar to California\u2019s Partial Unemployment benefits. I did inpatient in university 2 times and everyone in the program was either a university student or a child (it was a 24&under program) so I don\u2019t know a ton about inpatient for working adults\u2026\n\nBut I went to a residential program in CA about 2 years ago (when I was finally ready to take recovery seriously) and there was a woman there who was on unpaid sick leave and qualified for full unemployment benefits!\n\nFWIW you should go if you\u2019ve been recommended for inpatient; back when I first began my ED journey I was quite the overachiever and ended up needing to be hospitalized pretty early on in my pursuits. (Apologies if the language is triggering, I use morbid humor to cope; can edit if asked) I literally told doctors that they were being alarmist and the university counselors that intervened (to save me) that they were being dramatic. I\u2019m reaallyyyyyy grateful now that people stepped in and had the guts to deal with my rude ass lol\n\nWishing you the best \ud83d\udc95 hope this helps!",
