  "title": "12 year old sister thinks she's 'fat'",
  "selftext": "I have a 12 year old sister that thinks she's fat even though she's on the lowest scale of 'average' weight, almost on the underweight. She's tall and very, very slim.\n\nThere's some things to take into consideration. I don't know if they're relevant but she's got ADHD and is Autistic. A few years ago after family issues she's developed a lot of fobias which include claustrophobia. She used to be a child with no fear and turned into being scared to do almost everything. \n\nThis summer holiday She was abroad and played with some kids that lived where she was staying. One boy called her fat and I think this is where it started. \n\nA few weeks ago she was crying hysterically in her room and our mum rushed to her thinking she hurt herself. She kept asking what's wrong and only after a whole 15 minutes she managed to find out that my little 12 year old sister thinks she's fat. She starved her self for 3 days thinking this will solve her problem and loose weight but she ended up over eating the following day. \nToday again she cried and said she looked in the mirror and that all she sees is fat. She was begging mum to take her to a therapist because she doesn't want to see her self like that. (My mum is currently looking for eating disorder therapy).\n\nIs there anything that we can do that can help her along with therapy before this turns bad? \n\nTia.",

Making sure she's physically safe\n\nThis is all about preparing and collecting data that can support her potential hospitalization if needed. These are the most important steps.\n\nA1. Start bi-weekly !blind! weight measurements at your family doctor. This will be very important data: the doctor will see when to send her to ER/hospital and the measurements will help to get her admitted if needed.\n\nA2. Try to look up historical weight and height data from times when you considered her weight healthy (doctor's office, school forms, etc). Even early, toddler age measurements help: the early measurements will help identify her ideal growth curve\u2013the key thing eating disorder units look at for kids.\n\nTIP: It's best for a doctor to track her measurements, but your parents can take a look at it too using the chart below. Use the old measurements to see which curve her weight and height fits on, and then see where her current weight falls on the chart. If it's below all the curves, it's very important to visit your doctor or even an ER.\n- Online calculator: https://www.bcm.edu/bodycomplab/BMIapp/BMI-calculator-kids.html\n- Growth chart: https://www.dietitians.ca/DietitiansOfCanada/media/Documents/WHO%20Growth%20Charts/Set-1-HFA-WFA_2-19_GIRLS_EN_Extended.pdf\n\nB. Get the right mental health help\n\nB1. If she is not in hospitalization territory yet, ask for an outpatient referral from your family doctor to a hospital Eating Disorder program. Waitlists are long, do it as soon as you can.\n\nB2. Dietetitians, talk therapy with psychiatrists/psychologists did not work for us. It might work for you, but I was told at that point when my daughter had big emotional outbursts, her brain was already too starved to effectively engage with therapy. I'd only spend time/attention on it once your sister is fed back and is near her healthy growth curve again.\n\nB3. There is one therapy that could have helped when we were at this stage. It's called Family-Based Therapy, but the name is misleading. It's not family therpahy, it's a methodology which sets up the family with tools and ongoing support, so they can make the eating disorder patient eat and regain weight. It is considered controversial because it's high conflict and causes trauma for everyone involved. BUT the same thing will happen in the hospital, but from an even worse place.\n\nB4. Your parents might want to enroll in Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) which will give them tools to handle conflict with your sister well.\n\nI'm so sorry you are going through this. It can be a rough ride for the whole family.\n\nI'm happy to talk with your parents if they'd like to, just message me. I'm Toronto (Canada) based. I also have google sheet I used to track my daughter's condition.",

      "body": "Making sure she is eating is very important. The more she starves the worse the mental issues worse and it just feeds a cycle. Starving to help with the stress creates more stress and so on. We ate together and life stopped until we were done. There are millions of tips to add calories to help this process. Also be aware of social media/TikTok as there are many communities that show kids how to trick parents and pro-anorexia content. My kiddo was 12/13 when diagnosed and she had already lost lots of weight.",

      "body": "Sounds like how I was at that age. It was awful. I\u2019m so sorry. Eating disorders occur at a higher prevalence with ND girls, especially when we already feel so alienated. It\u2019s easy to believe that being thinner equals more friends, and that\u2019s just not true. \n\nFirstly, get her a therapist she trusts. It will take time. Sudden onset claustrophobia may be signs of something going on behind the scenes that you don\u2019t know about. I don\u2019t want to speculate but the same thing happened to me when I experienced trauma that I kept a secret for over a decade. I would advise someone who specializes in both eating disorders and trauma therapy, who can build her trust and help her navigate what\u2019s going on. Cognitive behavioural therapy combined with DBT changed my life, but I didn\u2019t start until I was 22. \n\nSecondly, look into stress management. I\u2019ve struggled with anorexia since I was 14, and I kept it a secret. My symptoms get significantly worse under stress, and that\u2019s when I typically relapse. It\u2019s huge that you know, and are able to support her. She might benefit from support groups when she\u2019s ready. It\u2019s nice to have a mediated setting to talk about shared struggles.\n\nLastly, if you have a scale in your home, hide it or get rid of it. Have her turn the other way when the doctor tests her weight. She doesn\u2019t need to know.    \n\nAs far as how you specifically can support her, try to find some common interests and give her a break from her thoughts. My younger sisters ED began when she was nine, and was worst from 13-17. During that time I spent a few days a week getting her out of the house trying new things. Pottery classes, going to a cafe, thrift shopping, anything to give her mind a break. \n\nShe\u2019ll be okay with time. She needs patience, consistency and support. Please don\u2019t discount how this affects you, and consider family therapy for anyone in your family who is supporting her. She doesn\u2019t need to know about it, though.",
