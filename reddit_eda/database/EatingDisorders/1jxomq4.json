It\u2019s all just a matter of where you are at mentally and if you are struggling with obsessive behavior and thoughts you need help and are more than deserving of it.",

It felt embarrassing being in treatment with the girls who looked like they were literally on death\u2019s door.

Or are those rules only applicable to you? Try and remember that they don\u2019t hospitalize people for no reason. In fact, most hospitals are so fucking insanely busy and lacking in rooms/ staff that they really only hospitalize people when it\u2019s absolutely medically necessary. Remember that you and your body are deserving of care. It\u2019s an exercise in futility to play the anorexia Olympics because no one ever wins; you will always believe that you can/ need to be thinner, that other people are better at being \u201csick\u201d, etc. I found that trying to work on removing \u201csick\u201d as an identity was really helpful.
