If you weigh less than that you can\u2019t give at all. \n\nThis one thing is helping me stay healthy in regards to the scale. \n\nDonating plasma helps lots of people with certain medical conditions and illnesses and when you donate they also give you money for every time you can give. \n\nSo it\u2019s a win-win.

When I'm at my parents' house there's a scale but I can rarely use it because they don't want me to and if they saw me they would ask me how much I weight which stresses me out (not to fatshame me or anything, just out of concern) so I do it when there's no one's home... Which isn't often.\n\nCurrently I live in a place where there's a scale and I noticed that it triggers my ED a lot because I can keep track of my weight and it encourages me to restrict. I weight twice a day. When I'll have a definitive home, I don't know if I'll buy a scale. Having one triggers me but when I'm going through tough times, it also helps me... And I think that in the long run I should learn to have an healthy relationship with the scale. But I've been in quasi recovery for a while so it may not be the best idea to you.\n\nMaybe start to weight yourself less to begin with. Try to lessen the number of times as you go, like someone who tries to stop smoking would do with cigarettes I guess. Eventually you'll maybe feel less anxious about throwing it out or won't need it anymore",
