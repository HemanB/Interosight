  "selftext": "*TRIGGER WARNING* \n\ni know it sounds crazy, but, i sometimes miss my eating disorder. Its something thats almost always in the back of my head and i dont really know who i am without it.\ud83d\ude15 \n On one hand it sucked but on the other hand it helped me cope with my emotions. It was my best friend, my security blanket and my form of feeling in control of my life. Sometimes when i feel depressed or lonely or really anxious i end up restricting or purging to take my mind off of the other stuff. It distracted me in a way.\n I just feel kind of lost rn and dont know what im doing with my life. Nothing really feels familiar to me except the ED. its almost sort of comforting in a weird way. \nAnyway im just wondering if anyone else can relate to this feeling/ mentality. \nThanks",

There are even times where I think if I hadn't had my ED as an outlet I'm not sure I would've made it through.  However, it's very important to keep in mind that even if i feels like your best friend, you're hurting an innocent body. Sometimes I have to think of my own body as a separate person to my head and it reminds me that my perspective on my ED can be twisted and detrimental. Acknowledging these emotions is a step in the right direction though and I'm proud of you! Best of luck in the future!\n\nedit: spelling",

Whenever I'm clean, my ED creeps back in, and whenever I'm using, it makes me stop caring enough to stop my ED. It's a vicious cycle- but both are playing with fire. Sometimes I wonder which one actually has a higher chance of death; I think the risk is pretty much equal with both.",

It became such a big part of my life and acted as kind of a band aid for all of the issues I had going on, even though I'm in recovery now sometimes it's hard to not go back to the mind set of \"everybody has their vices, at least I'm not on hard drugs\". There are even times where I think if I hadn't had my ED as an outlet I'm not sure I would've made it through.  However, it's very important to keep in mind that even if i feels like your best friend, you're hurting an innocent body. Sometimes I have to think of my own body as a separate person to my head and it reminds me that my perspective on my ED can be twisted and detrimental. Acknowledging these emotions is a step in the right direction though and I'm proud of you! Best of luck in the future!\n\nedit: spelling",
