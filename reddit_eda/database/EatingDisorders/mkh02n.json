  "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nMy name is Tyrone and I am currently completing a Master of Psychology (Clinical). As part of my research thesis, I am looking for participants to complete an online survey that should take 20-25 minutes and looks at the relationship between eating behaviour and positive core beliefs.\n\nThe study will contribute to the development of evidence-based treatment for eating disorders. We are looking for individuals over the age of 18 years. You can also enter a prize draw to win one of four $50 Amazon vouchers, which can be used internationally. The survey is completely anonymous and none of the information you supply will be linked to you.\n\nPlease use the link below if you would like to learn more about the research or complete the survey: [https://uniofsunshinecoast.syd1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_cwgQoFlU0WT8DPf](https://uniofsunshinecoast.syd1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cwgQoFlU0WT8DPf)\n\nPlease feel free to share the link with your professional and non-professional networks. A detailed information page is presented when first accessing the survey.\n\nI appreciate your time and I am happy to answer any further questions you may have. You can pm me at [/u/Tyrone\\_Psy](https://www.reddit.com/u/Tyrone_Psy/)",
