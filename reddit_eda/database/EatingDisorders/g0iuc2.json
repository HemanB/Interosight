  "selftext": "I\u2019ve been dealing with bulimia for over three years now and I\u2019m so fucking done. I\u2019ve been almost a year, uh, healthy (?),  and I refuse to go back. \n\nBut it\u2019s so tempting- \n\n\u201cJust eat. Just gorge yourself and indulge in everything you\u2019ve wanted to for so long. Just forget about those restrictions you\u2019ve made for yourself when you were recovering. Just eat. Then purge. You know it feels good. You know the euphoria and the high you get when you purge, how good it feels. How it\u2019s all worth it in the end. You\u2019ll be handsome, you\u2019ll be skinny. As of now you\u2019re just a gay ugly bitch, so just indulge in your vices and feel good.\u201d \n\n**NO** \n\nI\u2019ve lived that life! I\u2019ve been down that road! I\u2019ve suffered through all of that, gone a month without food and kept beating myself up for it! And I still wasn\u2019t happy! Wasn\u2019t good enough! I\u2019ve lied to family and friends and purposely hidden things from them! I refuse to live my life like that! \n\nBut it\u2019s so tempting...\nI just wish it all never existed. Deseo que lo se muri\u00f3. I just can\u2019t stop it, but I refuse start it. I know that \u201cone more snack\u201d or \u201cjust one purge\u201d will toss me over the edge and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to stop there. I don\u2019t want to relapse. I just- I need support, please.",

You have a whole community to lean on here, hon. And remember that you're lovable no matter what your ed says you look like.",

      "body": "Ugh....I feel your pain. I went through that cycle starting from 15 until I was 46 and finally decided to let someone else steer the wheel because I was too powerless to break up with that insidious beast. I even went 8 years thinking I was free and clear and then Wham! I got blindsided and then was on the slippery slope to depression and alcoholism. It started interfering with my work and severely dented my bank account. Our bank account, my husband's hard working money flushed down the toilet. I was hardly bringing home a paycheck.\n\nThe shame I felt from all of the deceit was too much. I thought will power, eating right, and getting exercise was the magic combo but instead, it fed into the disease. This is a horrible disease. It tricks you into justifying everything and it's voice is so overbearing. I needed an army to fight this so I finally consulted with an ED clinic and decided to dive in to an intensive outpatient. It was recommended I go into partial hospitalization which would have given me 45 hours of therapy a week, but I opted for a downgrade which was 25 hours. It was so scary. Within a day or two I started getting a little clarity. After 3 months I felt liberated...ish. One more year of therapy 4 hours a week was essential and now I live in a place where I don't have access. I am forever grateful for having the privilege to have gotten that therapy and rely on it everyday.\n\nI wish you the best, all of you. I wish you compassion and love for yourselves because you are worth it. We all are. If you have the means just face it and get some good help. After all, we have nothing to lose but our chains.\n\nNote: I tried three therapists before landing on The Emily Program in Seattle. Those previous therapists had NO idea about EDs. One, who was helping me analyze a dream about sea life compared my body to the sea lion. He literally said, \"they're big, like you.\" Screw you therapist man....",

I know this isn\u2019t exactly a groundbreaking discovery and many people have said it already, but one slip up does not mean all the progress you\u2019ve made means nothing! That was my mentality for so long and its very toxic. Being too harsh on yourself will just stimulate your urge to b&p more.\n\n\nI just binged a few hours ago and was considering purging but in the end made up my mind not to. I feel so disgusting and full right now and I\u2019M typing this whilst continuously burping which is so gross hahahahaha. Anyways know that youre not alone, we\u2019re in this shitty situation together! Ily and youre doing GREAT SWEATY",
