  "selftext": "I was due to begin my recovery through therapy in a day treatment facility, but my first day last just a few hours. Upon initial assessment my weight and heart rate were so low that I was taken to hospital for monitoring.\n\nFast forward 24 hours and I am now being admitted as a full time inpatient in an eating disorder ward for at least four weeks. I'll have very few freedoms (bathrooms locked, wheelchair to get around, supervised eating on my own) and I know life is about to get very hard.\n\nPlease take it from me - try to reach out or listen to those trying to support you before you ruin your life like I have mine.\n\nI am determined that this will be my rock bottom. Hopefully everyone reading this can get the help they need before they hit theirs.",
