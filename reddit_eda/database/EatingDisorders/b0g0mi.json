  "selftext": " \n\nI have been purging all winter long in my backyard in secret. Well living in MI and there being snow on the ground, my after meal activities are usually covered up by snow by morning. Well let me tell you what happens when the temperature changes. THE SNOW MELTS! Vomit on the other hand does not melt. So now I\u2019m trying to explain to my family why there is about 30 gallons worth of slush infused vomit in the back yard. SMH I\u2019m a train wreck. How do I explain to my family about how I got to this point?? Without lookin like I need to be admitted",

It\u2019s always a struggle and its never easy, and neither is the truth or the acceptance of it. But in order to explain and get on the road to recovery the problem must be acknowledged, and the truth must be told. I wish you the best of hope and luck\ud83d\udc9c",
