The fear and anxiety of chewing and just having food in front of you in general within the vicinity of anyone is harrowing. Especially around family. You are completely valid and seen.\n\nReally the only advice I have is either just block the view of food from everyone to create a dissociation of the food itself being seen and eating said food. If you can, find a person you are more comfortable to eat with or distracts you from the fact you are in that situation. \n\nIf possible, literally leave the room until you calm down. That's what I do at least.\n\nSorry if this isn't helpful. But honestly I'm trying to figure it out too.",

Now I have reached point where there is one friend that I can be around while eating (gives me anxiety still but I can do it with prep talk to myself) & I can go out and have a coffee with two friends.\n\n\nOne morning I was in a rush (woke up too late) and had appointment with my physical therapist - got asked did I eat breakfast (just little bit so I don\u2019t take my meds to empty stomach even though that amount of food equals almost nothing); but so told her what and how much, she then asked if I took anything with me that I could eat > at this moment I realized that maybe I\u2019m not doing so well that I have thought because I was almost horrified about even the thought of having the idea to have something with me that I WOULD EAT THERE!!? She asked this absolutely with only good intention & worry about how I will have energy and stuff.\nThen I started to think that what if I sometime do take something with me to have there, it is a place & someone I trust / try and learn to relax etc but at the same time I don\u2019t know if I could manage to do so because wouldn\u2019t it be awkward??\n\nI\u2019m sorry because I know I\u2019m not helpful really, but I understand what you\u2019re saying.",

I think we do know that this is mostly in our heads..WE negatively judge ourselves...I think keeping that in mind helps but also, people are quite self centred in general and don't give a crap because they are busy with their own crap.

You could choke but most people know to react to that so you can survive that too.  \n\nI don\u2019t mind eating in public spaces, but eating with people is very overwhelming for me.
