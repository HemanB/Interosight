  "selftext": "My girlfriend told me she has an eating disorder and I never know how to correctly respond to her. She\u2019s such a beautiful woman and I love her so much and there\u2019s nothing I wouldn\u2019t do to make her happy. She tells me the things she does and I try to give advice but she says \u201cshe\u2019s not ready to be forced into recovery.\u201d At this point I\u2019m pretty lost on how I should handle the situation. Can anyone give me some advice on this? What I should say and do to try and help with along with what\u2019s happening? Any advice is greatly appreciated. Hope you all have a good day.",

      "body": "I think it's wonderful you are so supportive. I don't know how long y'all have been dating but this sounds like a new-ish relationship. I would say be prepared to be very patient. ED is tricky. Some days will be better than others. Empower her to feel confident in herself. I used to depend on people to make myself feel better and, of course, I would never feel better. I had to be my own cheerleader and be confident in my decisions.\n \n\nI think it's very important to say that her ED isn't your responsibility. I say that because as someone who has/had ED (I'm figuring things out in therapy) no one is responsible for making me better but me. Don't get me wrong there are people in my life who, I would say, are \"responsible\" for my ED, but that's in the past. Now I'm in therapy dealing with my mental health and feelings. Also, make sure she's always hydrated. Nothing to do with ED. Just general, good advice.",

      "body": "I respect you so much for wanting to support her. My boyfriend did so much research when we first started dating to try and cope with my eating disorder...and even after 2 years trying to recover it can still be a struggle. \n\nAnecdotally, the things that my boyfriend has done that has helped me the most is the research he did to try and learn, which meant the world to me, as well as his level of compassion. He's a very easy going guy and keeps a very cool temperament if he does witness me having an episode or engaging in negative behavior. This is really huge. If we think you are going to get mad at us, we aren't going to be as open with you. We communicate A LOT because he wants to understand what triggers I have and what drives my behavior. \n\nAnother thing that my boyfriend did, which I think is crucial, is setting a hard limit on medical intervention -  meaning that we have an understand that as long as I am not passing out or putting myself in immediate danger, he pretty much needs to take a backseat in most situations. However, if I pass out or require emergency medical attention,  I've given him the leeway to intervene and make necessary choices in order for us to remain together. (i.e. - I need to meet certain nutrition requirements, maintain a certain level of intake, etc.)\n\nOne thing YOU need to do is decide how much responsibility you want to take with this. Eating disorders are no joke, and depending on where your girlfriend is, you are going to spend a lot of time watching someone slowly kill themselves. In a way, its kind of like that addiction mentality. And there are so many times where I chose my eating disorder over my loved ones. This will happen to you, and you need to realize that she is very sick. If you are not in a position in life where you want this kind of responsibility, you need to man up and end the relationship. I know that's probably what you do not want to hear, but its a harsh reality. And there is nothing wrong with you acknowledging and deciding that this is or is not something you want in your life. \n\nIf you are willing to stick it out, there are a few things you can do ....If she won't recover in general, you could at least suggest her talking to a therapist. Maybe shift the focus off of food and just on what's going on in her head? Even a few sessions might be enough to flip some switches on how she's thinking. \n\nAvoid equating her \"Beauty\" with anything to do with her size. Focus on dates and activities that don't involve food so that you two can still spend good quality time together without the stress of food being involved. \n\nReach out to  [https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/)  and their helplines.

      "body": "It\u2019s very kind of you to want to support her any way that you can. My husband (at the time boyfriend) was in the same situation as you, so I\u2019ll try to document some tips that I wish we would\u2019ve known from the get go. \n\nIf she wants to talk about her struggles, be there to listen. She may vent about how difficult it is to manage her food (to eat/stop eating/stop purging/whatever), and for you it might feel like it\u2019s really simple to just change. But to her, it isn\u2019t. Unless she specifically wants advice, try not to tell her what to do. You can\u2019t fix her problem. She has to do that herself. My husband would try to give advice, and it felt patronizing, even though it wasn\u2019t.\n\nListen to her and empathize with her to the best of your ability - \u201cthat\u2019s really difficult. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re feeling that way. It sucks. I know it\u2019s really hard. I\u2019m here for you and I love you regardless of what size you are, how much you weigh, etc. You\u2019ll always be beautiful to me.\u201d \n\nIf she\u2019s open to going to therapy, encourage her to go. You probably aren\u2019t equipped to help her get healthy on her own. Even if she doesn\u2019t want to commit to recovery, an ED focused therapist can break down WHY she feels the way she feels. Therapy has been the most helpful for my recovery.  \n\nDon\u2019t shame her or judge her about her eating habits. If she eats more/less than you\u2019re accustomed to, try not to call it out. I felt a lot of shame about my eating, and comments just compelled me to eat in private instead.\n\nFinally, remember to take care of YOURSELF! It is very difficult supporting someone through an ED. It\u2019s emotionally exhausting. Remember to recharge and respect your own capacity. If you aren\u2019t taking care of yourself, you won\u2019t be able to support her. Talk to her about how you feel as things progress. Keep an open dialogue, and you\u2019ll grow together. Good luck.",

Eventually the relationship with my ex came to an end, not due to her ED, but it definitely puts a challenging spin on the relationship.  My GF was in denial and thought that the last 16 years of her ED was perfectly normal and that she had it under control so she didn\u2019t need treatment.  The best piece of advice that I received was to simply tell her how it makes you feel.  I found those conversations were the easiest for her to stomach and not clam up from discussing her secret because she hated the light of the conversation being focused on her.  There\u2019s a lot of good advice that you\u2019ll find in this sub and I wish you the best of luck.  It might be a little cliche, but you\u2019re also partially a victim of her ED.  It really tore at my heart strings.  Such a sensitive subject.  One thing I did was reach out to one of her friends that she told me was also aware of her ED, it just helped me by having someone to talk to about the issue.  Feel free to DM me.",

      "body": "I\u2019ve been supporting my girlfriend with her ED for about two years. One year as a friend and one year dating. My best advice is get really good at apologizing. You\u2019re gonna do or say things that are triggering. You\u2019re not going to mean anything bad by it but EDs are enigmatic and some times you\u2019re just gonna say the wrong thing. When you do, dont try to justify yourself. Don\u2019t try to explain away your mistake. Just own it and say \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I will try my best to not do it again. How can I support you?\u201d\n\nThen from there the only thing to do is listen and act accordingly. If something really bothers you to the point that it needs to be addressed, try to find a time when there is flexible time and have support strategies in place.",

Just move more and don\u2019t eat junk food \u201c \n\nWhile these are very useful pieces of advice , eating disorders have little to do with food and a lot to do with emotions like anxiety, anger and frustration. \nSi just be a good listener and let your friend know she can trust you",

      "body": "I feel the need to repeat what someone else said: IT IS NOT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. I'm not saying dont be supportive or dont do research. I'm not saying that at all. But you need to remember her ED is not your responsibility. No one can fix it but her and it sounds like she doesnt want to. When I was deep in restricting, to the point I was awake for only 3 hours a day because i had such little energy, the part of my brain that regulated my ED thoughts would talk about how frail I was and incapable of caring for myself and how people would bend over backwards for me and take care of my needs. A lot of the good feelings from my ED came from being coddled by people. You walk a fine like between being supportive of the person and being supportive of the ED.\n\nSo I really want you to remember to take care of you first. EDs can make the person seem like someone else. It can be hard to separate who is the human and who is the ED. It can be emotionally exhausting and straight up, we can be outright abusive. If it ever gets to the point where you find yourself getting lost in trying to help, take a big step back and take care of yourself. You cannot help someone who doesnt want it.",

You should all be happy to know I\u2019ve been taking the advice you\u2019ve all shared. Empowering her, showing her no matter what she tells me nothing will change, spending quality time together, it\u2019s going well. She still gets choked up when talking about certain things, and I\u2019m working on trying to be a better listener so I know her triggers and what I must avoid. It was a tough journey to get there, but I did cook dinner for her this week, which I considered a win since she usually never lets me. Any other advice is greatly appreciated, and all of your kind words about me are helping me with my own personal issues. I hope you all are staying safe and well, and you have an amazing day.
