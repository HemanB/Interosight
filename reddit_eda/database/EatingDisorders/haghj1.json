  "selftext": "So I(24F) have been mostly recovered with spurts of binging, purging, and restricting over the past couple years but it doesn\u2019t consume my entire life like it used to. Instead of dieting I\u2019ve found that just trying to eat whole natural foods, I only eat a few processed things, and that\u2019s been working really well for me. I want to incorporate exercise so I can gain muscle and get stronger but it\u2019s like when I do that I in turn want to restrict my food so I see results faster, then I get really hungry and binge thus starting the cycle, instead of being able to eat my normal healthy diet. I can\u2019t seem to get both of those things in line together without obsessing over food again. If anyone has advice on getting over this hurdle I would so appreciate it! Thanks",

      "body": "First of all, I STILL struggle with this, so take my advice with a grain of salt. I like to make a protein shake with full fat milk about twenty minutes before I work out. So I make it and drink it on the way to the gym, while I\u2019m changing, and then I usually finish it when I start working out. I usually make it worth about 300 calories, which is how many my workouts usually report being on my watch. Then I\u2019m not super hungry after. This is usually about three hours after lunch though, so a few hours before dinner. If it was closer to a meal, I\u2019d probably do that after. I mostly do this to pace my calories and hunger, but also because it makes me not think about either too deeply. Obviously, I\u2019m thinking about it now, but it takes the stress off in the moment, you know?",

      "body": "Hi! I have also struggled with this. Over the past year or so (after struggling with eating disorders from 12 yrs old to now 26), I\u2019ve been slowly learning how to balance the both: eating enough and working out a normal amount. I spent many years starving myself, binging, and working out until I would pass out or be in a huge calorie deficit. Now, I eat a healthy, balanced, whole foods type diet w/out counting calories (not intentionally counting them at least) but sometimes I\u2019ll retreat back to my old \u201cneed to workout more/harder/longer to punish myself and lose weight\u201d mindset if I eat a little too much or something that\u2019s not super healthy. I try to quickly stop myself the second I start having those thoughts and remind myself that I\u2019m working out to stay healthy and to reward my body, not to punish or hurt myself. It\u2019s a constant mental struggle, but I just practice positive affirmations and remind myself that I\u2019m worth the health and happiness, and it\u2019s getting easier every day. You are worth it, too!! \n\nI think the best way to start incorporating exercise is by setting a schedule up. Start with exercising 3-4 times a week and see how your body handles it, and then add another day if you need to. Make sure your schedule and exercises are manageable and appropriate for the amount you are eating and your daily lifestyle activities. Maybe like an hour hike or walk, or a couple mile run a few times a week. Incorporate weights and toning exercises to tone and keep your muscles strong. Stick to the schedule as best as you can but allow yourself all the grace and patience you need. If you miss a day or don\u2019t feel up to working out, just skip it. Don\u2019t eat less or punish yourself in other ways when you do need a break. Tomorrow will come and you\u2019ll find the strength you need then to start again. \n\nGood luck!! \ud83d\udc9c",

      "body": "So it took me forever to get back into exercise, every time I tried I would get obsessive again, burn myself out, and then stop going. It was a whole cycle. I want to say that having a good recovery foundation and support REALLY helped, above everything else. I was in recovery for almost 2 years before I started working out regularly again. \nWhat helped me was 1) finding a form of exercise that truly gives me joy- I started swimming early this year, and while I haven\u2019t been able to swim in months bc Miss Rona stuck her head in, I remembered why I loved it so much as a kid and it\u2019s probably the first form of exercise since I was a ballet dancer that just makes me HAPPY. \n\nThe second thing I did was start an actual program. I\u2019ve NEVER been a runner, but last month I decided to sign up for a 5K. It isn\u2019t until the fall and I\u2019m following the None 2 Run program, which paces you SUPER well. The urge to do more and compete with myself more does rise up, but I\u2019ve found it\u2019s a lot easier to combat when I have a program telling me how much I should be progressing every time. \n\nThe idea behind the 5K for me was being proud of myself for something that is *entirely* good for me. Outside of recovery, I haven\u2019t committed to anything in a hot minute. Over the years my mental and physical health declined so much that I turned into the biggest flake. I\u2019m not a big fan of running while I\u2019m doing it, but the endorphins and the joy I feel afterwards is amazing and really encourage me to keep doing it. Swimming was of course like that even more so, bc I never want to get out of the water.  This is something I\u2019m doing for myself and not for my eating disorder. \n\nAnd I think that\u2019s where the important bit lies- if you\u2019re exercising for your ED, chances of it ever being healthy are slim. If you start exercising for yourself and because it gives you joy, it\u2019s a positive reinforcement- in the long run it\u2019s a lot more likely to influence you and cause change. So IMO finding something that rewards you beyond the ED voice saying you need to compensate or look a certain way- that\u2019s the way to go!",

      "body": "Awesome question!! Personally, I have a deal with myself. I ONLY work out AFTER all my meals are done for the day. My preferred exercise is indoor rock climbing so I will make a quick stop at home or bring a sandwich to work with me so I can eat early before I head to the gym. I am usually quite hungry after working out which is fine because I still have snack on the to do list but I don\u2019t have to have a full meal. If I want to outdoor rock climb on my day off I just try my best to have my food prepared or at least a meal or go with people who will want to eat after so that I\u2019m \u201cpeer pressured\u201d into also eating lol. Best of luck!! So happy for how far you\u2019ve come!\n\nEdit: after reading some comments I wanted to add that I only work out 2-4 times a week. I still see a dietician and therapist which keeps me honest. Setting boundaries for myself has really worked well.",

And I want to second making sure that the schedule and exercise are \"manageable and appropriate.\" I made the mistake of overdoing it when I initially came back to exercising and really hurt myself. For some context, I was focused on running and, even though I've never been a runner, I quickly increased my mileage from 0 miles per week to between 4-6 miles per day. My hips and shins did not like that! I hurt myself to the point where it was painful to walk for months. So! Go slowly!

I'm a little frustrated with the slowness of it all, but I try to focus on how well I'm doing this time around. I've also mixed my routine with yoga and icing (my shins, specifically). On top of that, I've tried to focus my attention on small exercise-related goals and how I feel, rather than on my general level of fitness or how my body looks. For example, I went from running 1 mile every other day to 2. My next goal is to start to incorporate 3 miles into my schedule - starting with one day per week and then slowly building. Another goal I had was around boat pose, for yoga (i.e., can I do it without having to hold my legs? This took about two weeks). And one last goal was around plank - can I hold myself up for 30 seconds? I had super weak wrists / lots of wrist pain when I started, but, after a month, I can plank without pain.\n\nAnd don't worry about missing exercise days! I take a day off when I'm not into it. It took me 20-something days to do 15 days of yoga lol Good luck!\n\nEdit: Oh, yeah, as far as eating - I have found that I get hungrier one days I exercise more, like when I run + yoga, rather than just yoga or rather than my off days. I'm trying to get more in tune with my body around eating, but that can be hard. I do have a new bowl that I like eating with.

The shift in mindset definitely took a while, but in time I found that I had gone from focusing solely on calorie burn, to more of a focus on physical and mental strength and doing things that bring me happiness. The first time I was able to hold crow pose was surreal- I had spent years doing mostly cardio 4-5 times a week and never would have even dreamed of having an upper body and core that were strong enough to support me. The supportive, calming, and accepting atmosphere of a yoga class make it even better.\n\nThis shift carried over to running for me as well- I also started focusing more on mileage goals and making a schedule/routine to help in achieving them. Though you can't really do it now because of Coronavirus- signing up for races is great motivation, and passing that finish line makes it all the more exciting.\n\nAs much as I can (and yes, I still occasionally struggle with this), I try to remind myself that my body is strong and awesome for being able to power through a flow yoga class and achieve new poses, or to carry me \"x\" amount of miles- and that food is fuel to help in achieving these things.",
