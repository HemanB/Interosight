  "selftext": "I always enjoyed coffee but never drank it as much as I do now that I developed my ED. There's multiple reasons why. It helps me poop. It cuts off my appetite. It's a calories free form of energy. I literally wake up most mornings and go \"I NEED to go get a coffee (black ofc) so I can poop, upset my stomach, won't feel hungry, and be productive.\" Obviously not healthy.",

I have cut back significantly some months ago when I realized I had a issue with eating. Now I have 2-3 coffee drinks a day, but a bit different then before. Before I drank black coffee, now I drink mocha lattes or um basically a chocolate milkshake with a little coffee thrown in lol. I feel like it\u2019s a good balance. I get my caffeine and I get to gain some weight at the same time.",
