  "title": "Brother\u2019s thin girlfriend called herself fat and triggered my ED",
  "selftext": "I (F27) have struggled with disordered eating and body dysmorphia since I was a pre-teen. I\u2019ve reached as close to \u201cbody neutrality\u201d as possible the past few years, trying to practice joyful movement and see food as fuel.\n\nMy brother\u2019s girlfriend is very thin and also taller than me. My mom is gossipy, and a few months ago, she told me \u201cCan you believe [brother\u2019s girlfriend] told [brother] she feels she\u2019s too big and needs to lose weight?! She\u2019s already tiny!\u201d and I\u2019ve been spiraling ever since. My response was \u201cIf she thinks she\u2019s big, I can\u2019t imagine how she sees us.\u201d \n\nWithout going into specifics, I am literally the exact average height, clothing size, and even shoe size (lol) for a woman my age in the United States. Most of my close friends happen to be about my size or larger, and my mom is plus size and has been her whole life. Most of the other women in my family are plus size as well. My brother\u2019s girlfriend is one of the only thin women in my life.\n\nEver since my mom said this to me, it\u2019s all I can pay attention to when I\u2019m around my brother\u2019s girlfriend or especially when we\u2019re in photos together (which is pretty often). I look at the photos and feel like I\u2019m literally double her size. I imagine how disgusted she must feel by my body or my mother\u2019s body. She is such a kind girl and I know she probably isn\u2019t thinking negatively about us at all. I know it\u2019s probably just an internal battle with herself. She could even be in this subreddit, who knows.\n\nBut I also struggle with (reverse?) body dysmorphia and while I generally can look in the mirror and find an angle of myself I\u2019m pleased with, I\u2019m always SHOCKED with how I look in photos, because it doesn\u2019t fit the mental image I have of myself at all.\n\nAll of this has thrown me back into disordered eating (anorexia and then binging) and punishing my body with exercise to the point of feeling sick. I imagine a photo with me and my brother\u2019s girlfriend where we\u2019re closer to the same size and I want that so badly.\n\nI\u2019d love some advice for how to work through this. Do I avoid being in photos? Do I tell my mom to refrain from mentioning anyone\u2019s body size from now on? She\u2019s currently on a weight loss journey herself and has been excitedly texting me updates and progress photos, which makes this more challenging\u2026\n\nJust feeling really bummed to be back in this headspace \ud83d\ude15\n",

You may have heard the saying \u201csecrets keep us sick\u201d (I\u2019ve typically heard this within eating disorder treatment) but the statement is true. I would have a conversation with your mom, and other members of your family that you trust, to set a boundary about discussing the size of other people\u2019s bodies, or even their own and be open about your current struggles. This sounds like a time to really lean into your supports and let them know you are having these mental battles.",

Body size and frame are a natural variation like hair color, skin color, shoe size etc. it would be impossible/unhealthy to try to make a poodle look like a chihuahua. Try to get in touch with a mental health expect because regardless of how you feel about your body you still need to nourish it",

Tell her how serious it is, how quickly you can fall back into it even with lots of progress, and ask her to please not mention body sizes, including her own weight loss journey. \n\nI think it\u2019s possible to portray this situation to her in a way that focuses on yourself and how certain discussions affect you, rather than casting blame on her or judging her as it may make her defensive. Not saying you would do that, but it\u2019s important to consider how it\u2019s brought up. If possible, you can look up articles targeted towards her POV: for example, \u201cMy daughter/son has an ED, how can i support her/him?\u201d\n\nI would look that type of thing up so you can have resources you can show her, and hopefully if she loves and cares about you she will take the time to understand what you\u2019re going through. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t tell you about her successes, but maybe she can learn to phrase it differently and talk about how she\u2019s been feeling about her health lately, rather than how she now views her body.\n\nBest of luck OP, and i\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this :( In the meantime, please do seek out therapy or if you already go, tell your therapist you\u2019ve been struggling lately!",
