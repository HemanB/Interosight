      "body": "Yes it is an issue. This is why I thought I didn't have a legitimate ED because I didn't have \"enough willpower\" for anorexia but didn't have BED because of the restricting cycles. One day I just decided to stop restricting and stop making out new diets. I realized I was acting irrational and that all my choices have led me NOWHERE. I started to eat normally or at least tried. I was still obsessed with food but a very important thing was, I started to recognize ED thoughts and decided to ignore them as much as possible. \n\nJust a few weeks ago I realized how my brain has started to turn normal and my hunger cues weren't so messed up anymore. I stopped being so obsessed with food. Like, any time I'd make plans with someone I only thought about food. Now, I look forward to eating tasty stuff but it doesnt dominate my life as much. There are also a lot of stuff I did and felt but I dont wanna get into the details right now. You can message me privately if you want.\n\nI'm STILL recovering and have a long road ahead. But a HUGE win for me is the fact I decided to start ignoring that stupid ass fucking ED voice in my head. So if you're wondering is it possible to get out of this?? 100%. Is it simple? It's literally simple. Is it easy? Not at all. But worth it.",

It thinks food is scarce so it is taking in as much food as it can when food is available. Please consider getting some professional help with this before it gets worse. EDs hijack life.",
