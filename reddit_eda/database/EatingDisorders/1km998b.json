  "selftext": "It\u2019s exhausting. The constant counting, the guilt, the rules I made up in my head that somehow feel more important than anything else. I think about food all day \u2014 what I ate, what I *shouldn\u2019t* have eaten, what I\u2019ll allow myself tomorrow. It never stops.\n\nAnd the worst part? No one really knows. I look \"normal\" on the outside. I eat in public. I laugh. I say \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d But inside, it\u2019s this non-stop battle \u2014 between hunger and control, between shame and the need to feel safe in my body.",
