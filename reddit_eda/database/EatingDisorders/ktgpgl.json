  "selftext": "I binge and purge, and have been for years now. But the binging is progressively getting worse, I just got the stimulus check and already blew through it, half of it or probably more on food. Now I'm negative in my bank account because I cannot stop buying and eating food. I sneak out from my boyfriends to buy meals to binge on and then go back over. Even when I know I am negative and can pay it off eventually. I really want to stop this for the new year but I cant do it alone. Any suggestions please, it is pretty bad",

I don't know if this is a binge/purge type situation but, regardless, the only thing that truly stopped my binging for good was getting rid of restrictions and training my brain that nothing was off limits with no compensations. It took a year + of eating what I wanted and when for my brain and body to realize it wasn't in a state of deprivation/fasting/restriction and I no longer had those urges to binge. I definitely did if I ever didn't eat enough one day (ie. Work was hectic, etc) but it was NOT the same type of urge you have in the midst of the restrict/binge/purge cycle and I just ate what my mind and body were asking me to with no compensation and no guilt. \n\nI wish you all the best.
