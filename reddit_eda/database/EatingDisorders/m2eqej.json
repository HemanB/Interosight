  "selftext": " \n\nHi. Let me start this off  by saying i\u2019m a 16 year old girl who\u2019s trying to lose weight for the  summer. I already don\u2019t have the best relationship with food because i\u2019m  autistic and there\u2019s a lot of foods that bother me. For the past year  or so i\u2019ve been a little overweight and insecure about my looks so i  finally decided to take action and try to lose weight. i\u2019ve been dieting  for about a month and it was going well at first. But now I feel like  i\u2019m becoming too obsessive with it. Like I even started worrying about  the calories in the vitamins i take. My mom also makes comments about my  weight whenever she gets the chance and constantly reminds me that I  need to expand my palette and start liking more foods, or i\u2019m gonna get  diabetes. So that isn\u2019t really helping me either. My biggest concern is  that for the past 2-3 days, i\u2019ve lost a lot motivation to eat and  haven\u2019t really had much in the past few days. And today I just can\u2019t  bring myself to eat at all and i don\u2019t like that. So my question is, am I  developing an eating disorder or am I just in some sort of diet  depression? (idk what to call it)",

      "body": "If possible, please get help with this. Even though it's not a full-blown eating disorder yet, it is a potential eating disorder and you definitely have disordered eating habits. I'm also autistic so I relate to the feeling of not being motivated to eat and that's how my ED started.\n\nTry to focus on eating regularly and six times a day/eat once every three hours if you can (I'm not a dietician or anything like that, but that is what my dietician at the hospital has told me is what a human should eat).\n\nIf you have any safe foods (such as the all-time autistic favorite: buttered noodles) try to eat that. I know it's difficult to find the motivation to eat, especially when you're autistic.\n\nAgain, please seek help from a health professional if possible. It's always better to be early than too late. Better safe than sorry.\n\nIf you need anything, feel free to DM me :)",

      "body": "From personal experience with ED and being autistic, it's possible but I cannot diagnose you (I encourage you to reach out to a doctor or therapist) Being autistic can lead us to hyper focus on one thing and become excessive. I know for me, health and nutrition has become one of my special interests and I need to be extremely careful not relapse into ED. The food restriction from obsessiveness leads to the ED (and then the ED fuels the restriction, it becomes a cycle). The are traits about autistics that are similar to those who have an ED, including being goal oriented. These traits are not inherently good or bad, but when our brains (whether you are autistic or neurotypical) learn that an ED behavior is satisfying and relieving anxiety, it uses those traits against you. Also autistics do often get diagnosed with an ED. The casual link isn't clear but there is a strong correlation. \n\nLong story short-it is NOT your fault, and you should definitely reach out for help while you are still aware of the problem.",
