  "title": "Request: Relieved to find a doctor willing to help",
  "selftext": "For years my therapist has urged me to try to get help through my medical doctors. But time and time again I got gaslit and brushed aside for not having lost \u201cenough\u201d weight in a short enough time, and treated like I was hysterical for trying to get help. This made me retreat and made my symptoms grow in isolation for years. Today, after getting a new doctor, I was finally shown some kindness and was treated with dignity. I can\u2019t believe how long I was treated the way I was. And I hope no one else had to deal with the same thing from those doctors. My doctor actually spent time asking me questions and examining me and listening to me, and referred me to an eating disorder clinic to help. I am anxious. I have no idea if I\u2019ll ever be able to afford it. But I\u2019m relieved to finally have been heard.",
