  "selftext": " \n\nHi  all, hope you\u2019re well :) I\u2019ve suffered with binge/purging my whole life  and have definitely made progress mentally speaking. I don\u2019t weigh  myself anymore (used to about 20 times a day), and I haven\u2019t purged in a  very long time. However, recently I\u2019ve put on a lot of weight and and I  would like to lose weight in a healthy way, mentally and physically. I  need help for this as I don\u2019t want to encourage bad habits and I also  want it to be successful to maintain a healthy weight. I feel mentally  strong, I just now need the guidance to go with it. What\u2019s the best  route to go down? Find a nutritionist that specialises in ED\u2019s? And if  so, how? Thank you! X",

Now I have recovered and am much happier however I am noticing recently that I am eating too much junk food because of stress, overeating, mindlessly eating etc.\n\nThis is what I am doing so far:\n\n1. Focus on health rather than losing weight. I am really trying to make this my priority.\n\n2. Do not starve yourself (obvious one I guess haha)\n\n3. Try new recipes, eat healthier food. I am eating SO much salad now, plant based meals etc. But you will need to do some trial and error to see what you like etc. \n\n4. Exercise in a way you enjoy... Gym, yoga at home, swimming, hiking..\n\n5. Eat foods that you like. No point eating foods you hate as you will crave other things soon after.\n\n6. I'm seeing a psychologist and I talked to her about this but if you have money I think it would be great to contact a nutritionist who specialises in ED. Idk where to find one though.\n\n7. Don't restrict too much. If your friend is having a birthday party, enjoy the food. If someone offers you a cake they made, don't say no. I am trying to have 1 day a week to eat whatever. If I am going out with friends or have an event where I will eat junk food, , then I skip the 'eat whatever' day. \n\n8. I suggest watching Abbey Sharpe's channel on Youtube and What Mia Did Next. They are so positive and helped me a lot. \n\nOK that is enough points hahahaha. I'm doing this new diet for nearly a month now. I honestly feel so much better but I'm still getting used to it. I didn't  lose much weight, just a tiny bit.\n\nMy psychologist suggested writing a food journal.. So like writing what you ate and seeing how you can tweak it and improve your diet without counting calories.\n\nTake all i said with a pinch of salt as we are all different and some of these suggestions might not work for you...\n\nAll the best :) \u2764\ufe0f",

      "body": "My biggest suggestion would be to take it slowly. Do not try to lose 5lbs or more in a month. Aim for 1-2lbs a month. Yes this may seem excruciatingly slow but for those of us with ED histories, any intentional weight loss needs to be as non restrictive as possible. This way it will be sustainable and hopefully not triggering. Avoid any temptation to make drastic calorie cuts (even 500 is too much for you in recovery) and if you notice yourself start counting calories or getting obsessive, take a break from your deficit. Be honest with yourself.\n\nAlso I would say give yourself a solid chunk of time with no weight loss efforts. I began recovery in May so I\u2019ve told myself I will not try to lose any weight until May 2021. At that point if I feel solid in recovery I might try to drop a small amount of weight. But this is to ensure you have had enough time to mentally recover and also because you might end up losing some weight unintentionally if you allow your body to settle. This is the concept of overshoot weight. I would highly recommend you also give yourself a year or two years post recovery to live your life and see where your body settles before trying to lose weight.",

      "body": "It needs to be a balance of what you eat and how much you move, but what you eat is the most important part. It's important you try not to restrict though, otherwise you'll fall back into bad habits (speaking from experience). \n\nFor me I found reducing my portion sizes helped. One of my main go to meals for price and time is variants of chicken breasts with frozen veg and a side such as beans or chips. I used to feel dissatisfied (not from hunger) if my plate didn't have a lot of food on it. I'd have 4 breasts or I'd have two breasts with two bags of veg instead of one and I'd add a full tin of beans on top of all that. \n\nWhat I do now is be stricter with my portions. Using the above example I would now do something like two breasts, one bag of veg, and a half tin of beans. This goes towards the other meals I make. I'm getting all the food I need from a meal like that as well as spending less money on food from not having to replenish so much. \n\nIt is difficult and I do understand the binge/restrict cycle. What works for me may not work for somebody else of course, but I feel the point of what you eat is still the most important part and without having to resort to counting calories or restricting intentionally.",

You can always allow a few treat foods in too just to keep a balance. Just keep a focus on health and not as much on weight and numbers. A little bit of activity for stress relief is really helpful too.",

It's normal to feel drained and achey when you lose weight but it goes away after a few days and you won't have cold turkey symptoms if you slowly eat foods that are harder to digest like eggs, meat, mushrooms, fish, dairy. You can look for a nutritionist or do it yourself,  you will be successful either way",
