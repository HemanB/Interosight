  "title": "Request: Developing hate towards people who eat less than mw",
  "selftext": "I'm currently on a diet. Unhealthy, but I'm overweight and want to have normal weight. And nothing else works form me, I can't loose weight slowly because I loose motivation.\n\nAnyway, when I'm on a diet I like to see other people eat unhealthy food, or large portions. Eg, I eat my super small lunch with friends who eat a lot and wait for the comments \"you eat too little\" etc etc.\n\nBut, when someone eats less than me, just because they are busy or forget about eating (how TF is this possible) I am furious. I start to lecture them on unhealthy habits, and what it could lead to. When my bf does it I even prepare food for him, just to be sure he ate way more than me.\n\nIt happens also when I am in remission and eat normally. Does anyone have similar problems and how do you fight it?",

      "body": "I\u2019m underweight and always make sure I eat less than others, because it makes me feel somehow better about myself. It is really toxic for me because even when I\u2019m very hungry I don\u2019t let myself eat more than others. It gives me satisfaction when others tell me \u201cYou eat so little! No wonder you\u2019re so small\u201d but I always play it off as in it\u2019s just how I\u2019m built and not an ED. I started eating less than I should because my mum is naturally very thin and when I would eat more than her she would make nasty remarks about it or joke. This eating thing is always a competition for me and it makes me so unhealthy. I don\u2019t \u201clook\u201d anorexic and I don\u2019t go to the extreme but I have an obsession with keeping my thinness. Just be careful with this because it can escalate very quickly. xxx",

I guess you can\u2019t really get over it but you learn it to make it less extreme with time and dedication.",

I kept a journal for a few months when I was really struggling and so many of the entries are like \"xxxx didn't finish their food etc etc\"... it's really hard to deal with, but what helped me was to remember that even if we ate the same things, we would not look the same. Also all of our bodies have different needs so just because I eat one thing doesn't mean I should eat less or healthier. Good luck, I know it is hard.",

      "body": "Hi! First of all, I'm sorry that you're struggling with this \u2013 ED's are super competitive and unfortunately it's a hard mindset to break. I've definitely struggled with this myself, and it's hard, but I would suggest trying not to wait for the affirmations of \"you eat too little\" as you described. When someone *does* eat less than you, try working on recognizing that emotion, but not taking it out on them (they're not doing it because of you! I totally understand how personal it feels but it's up to us to combat that).\n\nUnfortunately, the only way to really get over this is to stop comparing yourself to other people's eating habits, and to work on not restricting. Remember that it's likely that nobody is paying as close attention to their food as you are, they're just eating to satiety. It's really about getting rid of the connotation of \"good\" eating and \"bad\" eating.",

      "body": "Great news is that you are aware of it so you\u2019re already a big step forward. I was bullimic for 14 years so can relate to the envy of others seemingly having more control over themselves around food. Control, gosh darn control is all I wanted and while I still work on this each and every day, I do think I\u2019ve found control for the most part but I was always focusing on the wrong thing, food!\n\nThe only thing that\u2019s ever helped me is to LET GO of control. Even the act of letting go is still control in the end. For example, if you\u2019re holding onto a pencil in your hand that\u2019s a choice but you can actively choose to let go of that pencil too. In the end it\u2019s up to me as to whether I decide to let it go or keep holding on. I kept thinking about what I was afraid of, what am I holding onto so tightly? \n\nFor me, I realized that I was afraid of getting fat because it meant my parents would reject me or be disappointed. This is because in all actuality, their love felt conditional to me. I felt I had to be perfect and couldn\u2019t make mistakes (\u2018get fat\u2019- I know that isn\u2019t a mistake now though). \n\nTo make a long story short, I decided that \u2018fuck them\u2019 that\u2019s their issue and I still deserve love no matter what. So I bought a scale and I binged for the 27 millionth time and struggled all night to keep it down, I wanted to accept my action and see the damage. All night the voices came, telling me to purge, that I was a pig, I have no self control. On and on Negative Nancy went and normally I would give in except that first time.\n\nThe next day I checked my weight and barely put on a pound. Moving forward I decided to continue trying to forgive myself each time I binged and to just keep it down and try again the next day. My progress wasn\u2019t linear and each time the voice would come Negative Nancy (the ED) and I (another voice I name Positive Polly) would remind her that \u2018it\u2019s ok, you\u2019re still worthy of love even if you over eat. If anything, go ahead, eat the donut cuz you know it won\u2019t add a million pounds. Just enjoy it as tho it were your last donut on earth\u2019. Every meal it would be this tennis match in my head but slowly Positive Polly started getting louder and more trustworthy. \n\nIt\u2019s very different for everyone so I can only speak for myself but I think what anyone with an ED has in common are those damn ED rooted voices in our head encouraging us to do whatever behavior it asks of us or makes us feel like shit. Realizing and hearing that Negative Nancy voice helped me learn that I could control the volume and turn it down. It\u2019s never going to go away for me but at least I know when she\u2019s talking instead of Positive Polly.\n\nThat was a rant, a purge of words (pun intended lol) but hopefully that can somewhat help to know you\u2019re not alone. Next time your Negative Nancy comes in your head and starts comparing quantities of food, treat that voice like a scared bully and tell them \u2018I see you but I got this, I\u2019m allowed to eat however much I want. I am always in control, even if I choose to let go of it. If I let go, it\u2019s because I want to.\u2019 Or something like that.\n\nSometimes it takes a NegAtive Nancy to help us realize that we can control our minds and it just takes practice to make that Positive Polly voice louder!",
