  "selftext": "I turned 27 a few months ago, and I've been relapsing on and off with my restricting for a little while. When I read posts and watch videos about other people struggling, I feel like they're almost always in high school and maybe early college (so early 20s at the oldest). I feel like I don't see a lot of people closer to my age and older talking about their struggles, and I feel kind of embarrassed in a way. I know it's silly and mental disorders don't discriminate by age, but it feels like I'm too old to be struggling with this, so as a result I don't really like bringing it up to the people that I know in real life when I am having rough moments. Anyone else relate? How do you cope with it? ",

      "body": "Honestly, I see this question posted pretty routinely, and I just don't understand it. Why would it have an age limit? It's a mental health issue.\n\nIt reminds me of the outdated understanding of ADHD - EDs are not just for young women as much as ADHD is not just for little boys. I know your post didn't mention gender, but this is the common trope/ stereotype.\n\nI've had an eating disorder for over 20 years, and it's waxed and waned over time, but never completely left and it ever will. I can only speak from my own experience, but for me, it's a way of thinking about things and a toxic coping mechanism (often a little sadistic voice/ influence) that will always be there in some kind of way. All I can do is manage it.\n\nOver time we learn coping mechanisms and how to deal with it better, some of us never participating actively in these ED behaviours again. This can give the appearance of 'growing out of it' I'm sure. However, in my humble opinion, there's always going to be risk because it's never truly gone. This is why we are \"in recovery\" forever afterwards and tend to relapse in times of stress. It's a mental health disorder, and you don't just grow out of those, unfortunately. \n\nThis is just my 2 cents, and I don't mean to offend anyone with different viewpoints. All I'm trying to say is, I see this question posted all the time, and it's always got many of us that are 30+. Please do not feel like you should feel ashamed, childish/immature, or an outsider. Many, many people who are older sadly still suffer with this. Honestly, just think about how many baby boomer generation women have a questionable approach to food. Those grown women in the wellness industry that are clearly restricting unhealthily. Im sure we all know at least one. Be kind to yourself and remember that it's a mental health condition that you will simply need to monitor throughout your life. Just the same as someone with anxiety, depression, or any other mental health condition does.",
