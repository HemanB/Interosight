  "selftext": " I had a medical scare earlier this year and was unable to complete most my university school projects. I got an extension for one of my courses. I completed this course today and handed it in after a couple weeks of grinding out the work (it took a lot of effort).\n\nMy dad came to campus with me and he offered to get me a tea and treat. Instead of declining, I said yes and I ended up getting ab iced cinnamon tea latte AND a large banana loaf slice with cream cheese icing. I was terrified at first, but I ended up getting it anyways and facing those fears.\n\nOh my gosh- it was delicious! I forgot how much I loved banana bread!\n\nIt\u2019s pretty rare I get to eat baked treats because of my celiac, and it\u2019s rare I get to celebrate something as difficult as finishing a course. I was super proud of myself for school, and I was happy I rewarded myself with something I love like tea and baked goods. (My dad also gave me a bite of his peanut butter square and it was also delicious.) \n\nNot only did I do something difficult for my degree, but I also was able to eat a fear food (banana bread and a sugary and creamy drink) without feeling immense guilt. \n\nRecovery is amazing, and I\u2019m glad I was able to share this moment with my dad.",
