  "selftext": "\nIm so tired. I ate today i was finally happy to eat without feeling bad....but then I was called fat and then I was talking to another anorexic and I was happy and told her I ate today and that I felt so happy for eating and I was proud of myself for eating but that someone had called me fat for it ....she just laughed and told me I deserved it. She told me that eating was gross and I deserved being told that. That I should accept who I am and my place in life . She told me I need help because I\u2019m stupid for eating and that I need to stop. I told her just because she was an anorexic DIDNT mean she had the right to bring others down for eating and I might of been harsh on her but I was hurt and told her I hoped she had fun dying.  I left it like that and left cuz I just needed to cry and I did I broke down crying and felt like such a failure. I felt like I am not validated as an anorexic for eating or not being sick enough. Im so tired of feeling this way. I was actually happy for once for eating and that feeling got ruined and now I just wanna stop . I don\u2019t want to eat anymore thanks to her.",

We were working with kids and she would spread her \"message\" to them telling complete lies like meat is killing them and they eat too much and are filled with poop, along with other food related conspiracy theories. \n\nI sympathized with her and felt bad, and I get that anorexia is one fucked up intense illness, but I'm so sad I didn't report her, I was 20 and super naive, but it's not ok to spread that message to people who are already have such a difficult relationship with food. She was on project runway and the kids looked up to her. I think she's an evil person, literally hated \"fat\" people, basically anyone who wasn't underweight, and kept preaching only drinking juice and that our bodies don't need solid food, telling everyone they were killing themselves with food... ironically \n\nshe was deeply sick, and your anorexic friend is too. I would cut her off, you need to survive and not every anorexic is like that, she's just being mean, and it doesn't matter if it's her illness speaking, you need to protect yourself from that kind of thing, you are starting to heal and feel your worth and you can't lose that hard earned sanity.",

I use my skills daily and for every encounter and needing validation from others is very manageable or if they are with strangers its an obsolete situation. \n\nIf my comment isn't helpful then you're not looking for help. I listed 2 nationally recognized resources that are the gold standard in all ED treatment. How is that not helpful? Anyway I'm bored with this. If you don't get into recovery y'all will still be looking for validation and purging at age 40. It will rob you of so many things. One of the 1st rules of DBT is no one can make you \"feel anything\". I nor anyone else can invalidate this for OP. I wasn't there. I speaking from a purely subject place. I feel like OP invalidated the other people there by how they were addressed. Truthfully I don't have any thoughts about her validation. I'm not interested in it. I'm interested in the recovery aspect and that she's so quick to throw it away how can I offer guidance on that. That's what I care about.

According to actual DBT skills, it\u2019s okay to hold space for two opposing things to be true at once. They can struggle with feeling like they deserve recovery and still fully deserve it at the same time, there\u2019s nothing wrong with needing outside support. Please approach with empathy rather than black or white thinking like \u201cyou don\u2019t want help\u201d or the implication that they\u2019re throwing away their whole recovery by having a bad day. \u201cGet tough\u201d isn\u2019t necessarily helpful for everyone, and it certainly isn\u2019t helpful for people in rough patches who are clearly already trying their best Xx",
