  "selftext": " \n\n(20F) I'm supposedly a \"healthy weight\" according to my doctor but I used to be fit pre-covid and every time I step on the scale now, I feel like shit. I don't want to stop weighing myself, but how do I avoid the \"I don't deserve to eat anything\" mentality? How do I distract myself? How do I break this mindset and find a will to exercise instead of not eating? I made a pumpkin pie yesterday and wanting any makes me want to cry.",

      "body": "Hey! I just started seeking professional help after 4 years because I was very much the same way. I think the first thing you need to do is to not use the scale anymore. I know it\u2019s hard, but please hear me out. For me, the best way to distract myself is to spend time with friends. I know this is hard given the current situation but maybe find at least a small circle of people in order to get your mind off food. The best case scenario is to seek some type of therapy. Best of luck and shoot me a message if you ever want to talk",

Instead of trying to use your will power to try and not eat which will hurt your progress and your fitness in the long run. Your mentality should be. What can I eat to boost my energy and metabolism. That way you will have the mental and physical energy to exercise. A pumpkin pie is just full of carbs that will make your energy levels crash. Write a list of foods that will give your body the essential vitamins and minerals to feel healthy. Quinoa for example is full of pretty much all the essential amino acids your body needs. Starving yourself is shooting yourself in the foot since you will feel weak and without energy and not even want to exercise.",
