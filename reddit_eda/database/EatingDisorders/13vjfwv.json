  "selftext": "So i've been diagnsed with anorexia for 2 yrs now and i am recovering so much though recently things have been going downhill a bit. ive also been doing weed for almost a year now and i never realzied it but i think it helps me SO MUCH with eating. I get really strong munchies and i dont even think about \"what the hell why are you eating!\" or \"that food is unhealthy!\". isntead i get SUCH a positive mindset and i just feel good i dont even think of it as a reward its just what i deservfe all the time ( the food). and yeah recently thigs have been going downhill like ive been more concerned with food and i purposefully avoid meals but im just so happy that weed helps me get rid of those feelings and just let my body get its fuel!! i dont want to rely on weed to eat but i just think it helped me immensely and im jsust happy abot that. this is just a little positive rant but i needed to share it.",

It allows you to gear your experience with cannabis usage towards a medicinal methodology rather than just for fun. I think microdosing might be a good thing to try if you feel that the usage is ever negative for you. For example, heightened anxiety, and other health issues are possible with regular use (even more nausea and gut related issues). It sounds like you are being mindful, but are just aknowledging how it's helped. I may be biased, but I too was able to have more progress in my actual long term ED treatment because I included cannabis usage. It can be really scary for those whom have never consumed it. I have worked in the medial industry in Arizona for growers and medical users. Please let's link up on DM if you have any questions. Id love to share people I know who can help you continue to educate yourself- also if you can tap into r/intuitiveeating on here I also found that method of food consumption helpful. (Eating what feels right, etc).",

Food became part of my life day to day, instead of an after thought or fear. The best food I ever ate was not because it was amazing, but because it was the perfect combo while just slightly \"feel the music with your skin\" high. Also, not to brag, but I invented mini corn dogs once. I realized a couple hours later...but for a little bit I felt like a food genius.",
