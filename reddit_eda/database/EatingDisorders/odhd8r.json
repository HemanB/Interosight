(My house burnt down, and I had to leave an abusive situation, and move to a whole different province)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLove you all.",

I recently realized that it's been almost 8 years (most of them in quasi recovery or relapses) that I have been anorexic and seeing how fast the time flies really scared me. I don't want to hit that 10 years mark. Your post gives me hope that maybe one day I'll be free from my ED too",
