My sister went to a new PCP for her and got one on the first appointment. It's helped her lose some weight (not as much as others), but it's really helped motivate her to do a lot of strength training and eat well on top of it (from all food groups) so she is developing really good habits. I believe the people who look saggy or experiencing the digestive issues aren't following the recommended exercise/eating habits as it's supposed to wreak havoc on your body if you don't. \n\nI've also heard though too it's helping with the \"food noise\"/cravings and even with general anxiety in some people.

I was able to learn helping eating habits to stop binging through therapy, but even after learning healthy eating habits there really is not anything that helps the food noise go away nor did it help my portion control so much. \n\nBut after starting mounjaro, the food noise went away. It helped me continue to see myself in a positive light and genuinely helped portion control. And since stopping it after a year, the things I become accustomed to during mounjaro have continued to stay with me. \n\nThe way I think about it is I did so much hard work on the front end to stop the purging and to develop a healthy relationship with food and my body. And then mounjaro helped give me the little boost I needed to start losing weight- something I had struggled to even start doing because I had been unsuccessful so many times.

Sometimes I would do 1600-1700 because I do the plated method so I can get full with veggies and protein and the right fats/ carbs for me\u2026\n\nI would see inches come off but not weight. Went to Dr and she checked my insulin resistance and my score was through the roof. It\u2019s not diabetes it\u2019s literally my body working against me\n\nIf you google PCOS, it explains it more. I\u2019ve had Drs tell me too it\u2019s very hard to lose weight with PCOS. I was always healthy and fit so I knew something was up\n\nAt first my ex didn\u2019t believe me and then his friends sister told us she had the same issue and what worked for her was a high protein diet and some other tweaks and he understood better because she was always tiny and had gained weight out of nowhere",
