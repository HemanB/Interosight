  "selftext": "hi all, i hope this is the right place to ask this. i am going to try to not be super specific to not be triggering.\n\ni was in a treatment centre for anorexia from the age of 12 to about 15. i convinced the treatment centre i was at i was better and didn't need any more therapy. i was 100% lying, but i hated the centre so much and i had panic attacks every time i had to go.\n\nover the next couple years, i still struggled a lot with my body image but i became weight-restored. my family and friends all stopped worrying about me, i even went through a stint in grade 11 where i gained a lot of weight. i was horrified when i went to the doctor and saw the number and lost the weight through calorie counting and exercising a lot.\n\nthe thing is throughout this whole time, i still felt very similarly to how i felt when i was younger and struggling. in terms of body-image, guilt, restrictive patterns, etc.\n\ni am now 20, and this past year was a tough one. i was eating in an extreme deficit, back on my ed twitter account, taking constant bodycheck photos, etc. i lost weight and the people in my life noticed. but i felt like a fraud, like even though i was doing restrictive behaviours i felt like my illness wasnt valid and i was just going through a phase or something.\n\ni am trying to take care of myself now and not over-restrict to lose weight. but it's very hard for me to not slip into my old ways of restriction. \n\ni guess i am  confused about what recovery means. when you are fully and legitmately recovered, do you never get these feelings again? does my relapse mean that i was never recovered in the first place? i wish i could understand these feelings, i am so frustrated at hating my body and myself so much that this is how i treat myself. \n\nthank you all for listening, i hope you stay safe <3",

Also by centre do you mean centre Syracuse? Sorry I just went there and thought maybe you might be someone else who went there",

And I've been trying to gain weight, I struggle a lot due to extreme body dysmorphia. I have now gained weight but I'm not weight restored. My Ed nurse told me even when you're recovered fully you can always have Ed related thoughts, especially in stressful events. Recovery isn't a straight line unfortunately, it comes with many breakdowns and relapses. But hopefully when you learn to have a healthy relationship with food, the Ed related thoughts should die down, I don't purposely restrict anymore or take laxatives, but I do struggle to eat due to anxiety and lack of appetite ( even if I haven't ate). I used to binge eat a lot, before my eating habits turnt bad. I know how to have a good relationship with food but it is hard, I understand that completely. I know you'll be able to overcome this, take your time and don't rush eating etc. I hope you're well \ud83d\udc95",

I do not have cancer. On the other hand, I may not be binging or purging -- I have no *external* evidence of disease -- but in the way my mind works, my ED is still there. The urges still crop up. I have to be careful of triggers. I recognize some behaviors as dangerous.

My last real relapse only lasted 1 weekend and it was over two years ago. I purged all weekend, told my boyfriend (now husband), he helped me through a couple weeks of bad thoughts.\n\nNow, a few months ago (when I joined this sub) I had a couple weeks where I thought I was going to relapse. Anxiety has always diminished my appetite, I was dealing with PTSD treatment at the time, it was a bad time. But I got through it none the worse. And honestly, I think I have a healthier relationship with food and my body. \n\nI've really leaned in to the idea of radical self acceptance the last several years. I had to. I had gotten pregnant with my son (my motivation to truly recover), I couldn't risk the pregnancy, I had to learn how to deal with a rapidly growing and changing body.\n\nAre there things I'd change about my body? Hell yeah. Is having the aesthetic I want worth losing everything my body can *do* and risking more health complications and making myself miserable? Fuck no. So I accept my body as it is. I'm not super in love with it, like oh yeah I'd fuck me lol. But who is? I respect my body for what it can do and am mostly \"meh\" about the way it looks. I'm not a big fan, but it's whatever. I've taught myself (with a lot of therapy and a lot of repetition) that how I look really only matters to me, and I choose to let everything else in my life matter more.",

I truly believed in my darkest moments that it was going to kill me, I had even accepted it and almost wanted it to kill me because I felt so incredibly hopeless in my situation. I required so many services during my illness, ER visits, Inpatient, Outpatient, Social workers involved, feeding tubes, heart monitors,... Basically, I was told that it was a shame that I had gotten treatment so late by one of my many psychiatrists. After turning 18 for a while, I was cut off from the services that helped me stay alive during my teens. I relapsed but then I decided... it was time to recover. Nowadays, I won\u2019t say I\u2019m completely like I used to be. The shadow of your experiences always looms over you but I eat what I want and when I want. I don\u2019t count calories. I don\u2019t binge, restrict or purge. I don\u2019t compare my body to every other girl in the room to see if I\u2019m smaller.

Maybe there are people out there who just flip a switch and one day their ED is in the past, but I think for most of us it\u2019s about doing what you can with what you have.  And realizing that baby steps and time are the best weapon. I want things to happen so fast, and I start getting dejected when I realize I\u2019m still so far from all of my goals- but then my therapist or my boyfriend reminds me of how far I\u2019ve come in the past 2 years.

So you may be having a set back, but you are still in recovery. I kind of think recovery never ends since this is how we have coped with things in the past so we need to be cognizant of it. \n\nThis sounds weird, but something that really helped me was to give my eating disorder a name. I chose Edna, real original I know. But I did it because I didn\u2019t want to just try and suppress my ED thoughts. But I wanted to recognize them for what they were. So when I had or have weird food or body image thoughts, I ask myself is this me talking or is this Edna?

I find it hard as mine started when I was young and hit hardest when I\u2019m a teenager. It was part of who I was for so long that in a way it\u2019s a safety net to revert to.\n\nI hope you stay in recovery and you can find a peace in this world",

I still struggle with thoughts, and as mentioned I had a minor lapse, but I no longer give into those thoughts on the regular. \n\nRecovery gave me my life back. I was able to figure out who I am outside of food and size.\n\nGood luck!",

Also by centre do you mean centre Syracuse? Sorry I just went there and thought maybe you might be someone else who went there",
