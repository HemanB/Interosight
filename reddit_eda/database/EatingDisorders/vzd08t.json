  "title": "My friend has POTS and an ED and it\u2019s getting scary",
  "selftext": "My friend has had an ED for years upon years and she was diagnosed with POTS a little over a year ago. I\u2019m only here because her POTS has gotten worse on top of her already preexisting ED and it\u2019s just ruining her every day life. Making her feel sick all the time. She doesn\u2019t eat or drink anything because she says she doesn\u2019t feel hungry or doesn\u2019t want to eat/drink because it makes her feel sick. She used to be like an hourglass. Slim waist thick thighs. But she has lost so much weight I\u2019ve never seen her so skinny in my life. Like she isn\u2019t just \u201cskinnier\u201d. It looks like she\u2019s slowly dying. It\u2019s an extremely unhealthy skinny. She lives w me and I just don\u2019t know what to do and she doesn\u2019t have any drive to help herself either. She also has Covid rn and went to the hospital but they literally did nothing for her. They didn\u2019t even give her fluids THAT SHE MOST DEFINITELY NEEDED because she isn\u2019t eating.",

      "body": "Hey there, firstly I want to say you\u2019re an incredible friend for seeking help on how to support her. I also have diagnosed POTS and anorexia, which is a horrible combination to have. I can understand where you\u2019re coming from seeing her so sick, because at my lowest I was sooo sick all the time from my heart. Fear of fluid intake because you might gain is the worst part, people with POTS need way more water than people without, and then not eating enough sodium on top of that only exacerbates things. Unfortunately there isn\u2019t much you can do about the ED besides support her as best you can, and let her know you\u2019re there for her. There are lots of places that have resources on how to help loved ones with EDs, but since everyone is different I would recommend approaching her by asking how you could best help. (like my boyfriend does puzzles with me while we ate to distract me, and blocked out the nutrition labels on everything!) \n\nAs for helping with POTS; if she\u2019s able to, try to get her to drink more water. I don\u2019t really have any tricks to that since I also have a fluid intake mental block, but I know that I have to do it if I want to function. Though I do find putting lemon or lime juice in it makes drinking it a little easier. Sodium doesn\u2019t have to come in food either, salt tablets and electrolyte pills are great ! You can get them on Amazon. Pickles, olives, salted duck eggs, kimchi, most any preserved food is great as well. If she has any safe foods have her add lots of salt to it. Finally, if it\u2019s an option, she can do medication. I take propranolol (60mg ER), and it\u2019s made the biggest improvement and has managed me down to minor symptoms when they used to be severe. \nAgain thank you for looking out for your friend like this, and I hope this helped if even a little bit.",
