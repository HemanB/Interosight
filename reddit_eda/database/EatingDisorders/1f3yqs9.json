  "selftext": "Hi, I know this is a mega stupid pick-me thing to say. But I feel like no one cares. I have told three people that I am in eating disorder recovery, and so far I have not heard anything or received any support. All one person has said so far is \"I look healthy.\". While it was with good intentions, all it did was make me spiral.\n\nI feel like if one of my friends was in eating disorder recovery, I would be checking on them, u know. I'm so petrified that I made a mistake by telling them or they are telling other people. And knowing them, unfortunately, I don't think that this is out of the picture.\n\nI know how awful people can be when they learn about people's eating disorders, particularly if they don't look like the typical type. One of my friends had already told someone else about my issues while I was standing next to them. I was so ashamed. I regret my decision to ask for help. Whenever I reach out, it only backfires.\n\nPeople only started caring about my issues when I became underweight. It's hard to trust people now, and the only people who are supporting me are the ones that I pay (Dietician, psychologist etc.) T\n\nThey're not my real friends I know that but I had no one else to talk to and I needed to give them some sort of explanation for why I was acting so strange otherwise, they would never talk to me again. I would rather have shit friends than be alone. I feel more lonely than ever, and I know that I'm not but I just want to feel cared for. It's so incredibly hard for me to make and sustain friendships. I'm just really lost right now.psychologist,",

      "body": "Honestly, it might just be the case of people not knowing what to say. It's the same with any illness when you get sick, people want to be supportive and caring but they're not quite sure how - do they pretend it's not happening and treat the person as they normally would? Or do they ask questions, talk about it and shower the person in compliments and love?\n\nIt's hard, because you don't know how the person who is sick will react or what they need in that second. Everyone is different.\n\nIt could also be the fact it's about your weight too. Weight in general is a sensitive topic. You say someone looks healthy and like you said, you could make that person spiral. You say they look skinny and you've just encouraged that person to continue their ED ways because they thrive on compliments.\n\nIn my opinion, continue with your recovery and remember that not everyone understands this journey. If you feel that your friends aren't being helpful or are making your progress more difficult then don't be afraid to distance yourself or cut them out completely. This is your life and you are in control.",

Being underweight to show you're not ok, to force others - doctors, friends, family - to care. You have to learn to use words instead, to fight for yourself, and accept that easy access to attention and healthcare isn't worth risking your life.\n\nI'm absolutely not saying that anorexia is about getting attention. I'm saying that navigating the moment when you're not severely underweight anymore, and people start thinking you're alright when you're not, when the situation isn't so dire anymore medically speaking so suddenly having access to quality care becomes difficult- that moment is weird, and can push people in the direction of a relapse.\n\nYou need help, care, then ask for it. Demand it. \n\n I hope I managed to convey what I wanted to, without being mean or offensive. Sending only good vibes.",
