  "selftext": "Several years back I gained a lot of weight.  Through extreme calorie restriction, I lost the extra weight, and I got into lifting weights, but the restricted calorie diet gave me some pretty disordered eating habits. My relationship with food is very touchy and I still struggle every day to find the balance between binge eating and/or not eating at all. THEN, I went through a divorce within the past year, and got \u201ctoo skinny\u201d according to family and coworkers (which is so inappropriate for anyone to comment on). I have been struggling lately as my appetite has picked up (I work out a lot) so my muscle mass has increased which has led to some weight gain. I am at a healthy weight currently, and I know they mean well, but when people just take it upon themselves to point out that I look \u201chealthier\u201d and that I \u201cwas too skinny\u201d, it is SUCH A TRIGGER.  It makes me feel like I have to restrict myself again since other people are noticing... how do you deal with that??",

A few times a year, or if I'm having a month with a lot of these comments, I'll make a big post about all the reasons why you shouldn't comment on people's weight or appearance in general. Sometimes I'll share the frequently shared post about talking with your daughters about eating habits and appearance [This one](https://m.facebook.com/lovewhatreallymatters/posts/1050392618316469). I seem to get fewer comments for a while after sharing something like that.",

You can respond with, \"I'm really happy, and I've been making sure to move more mindfully!\" or \"I really feel balanced and at peace in my life right now,\" and that invites them to discuss with you the ways you've been moving and eating more mindfully as a result.",

      "body": "That is an honest and efficient response. Even if it doesn't feel honest, it is. EDs are a medical issue. \n\nFor me, and it took years to wrap my head around my own mental health but I find describing things as medical symptoms makes it easier.\n\nFor example, especially recently, I've been putting it like this:\n\n\"My appetite is non existent because my mood is low.\"\n\nGranted, I've only been telling close friends, but it puts me at ease to put it in more, third party, medical terminology to sort of validate my experience. I find it to be empowering. \n\nIt may not be like that for you and OP so I'd suggest considering what I have to say and try to incorporate what works for you and leave out what doesn't. Everyone is different and my advise or commentary may not be applicable to you or OP. \n\nKeep on trucking, my loves. You're worth it all.",

Some helpful responses that don't make them feel like they need to be defensive (because you don't want to invalidate others in order to validate yourself), \"I appreciate that! I am focusing on (thing I like) about myself at this time, though.\" or even setting an example by shooting a non-body related compliment back at them, like \"your hair is really pretty!\" or \"I like the color of your dress/shirt!\" (because it focuses the attention on an inanimate object such as clothing rather than on the actual body itself).",
