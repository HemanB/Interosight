  "selftext": "Please help me. I have difficulty eating. Like I'll have a full plate of food in front of me but my body just won't accept it. I have difficulty even putting the food in my mouth. This happens for a few days every once in a while, frequently. I end up starving myself for long periods. This happens for a few days every once in a while, frequently. I end up starving myself for long periods. I've searched the net multiple times regarding this condition and I can't find anything. I don't know if this classifies as an eating disorder, but I've been going through this for a very long time. I get so weak eventually that I have to force food down.",
