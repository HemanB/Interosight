  "selftext": "Hi all! \n\nI\u2019m writing this because I honestly don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019ve been struggling to eat.. honestly anything for the last month/last 2 months. I don\u2019t really know what triggered me so badly, but I feel guilty whenever I eat. I don\u2019t see food as \u2018oh yummy, food!\u2019 anymore but as carbs, calories and sugar that will make me fat and I hate that I think about food this way. \n\nI am very good at hiding it, whenever I\u2019m with other people I just eat, doesn\u2019t matter how much or if it\u2019s healthy or unhealthy, but all I can think about when I eat (especially something with a lot of sugars/calories/carbs) is how this will affect my weight and my body. Let\u2019s just say that if I would be alone 24/7, I would probably only eat breakfast for the entire day and that\u2019s it (which is so dangerous). \n\nI also just feel guilty when thinking about things I love (or loved) to eat, like chocolate and I can\u2019t imagine people eating something just because they like it. For example, my friend was eating a chocolate bar while we were in a Zoom meeting, and all I could think about is how she could eat something like that without feeling guilty. That\u2019s when I realized there\u2019s something very wrong and dangerous about my mindset, not with her just enjoying her food. \n\nI downloaded this one app a few days ago that gives you advice on how many calories you should have, and I\u2019ve been tracking it like CRAZY, almost obsessive, so I think that triggered me even more. I absolutely hate myself when I eat more than the recommended amount of calories and wanna punish myself the day after.\n\nSo, I know this is very complicated, maybe too complicated for a simple Reddit post, but can someone please give me some advice on how I can stop caring so so so much about carbs, sugars and calories so I can eat whatever I want. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m losing control and that I\u2019ll ACTUALLY only eat breakfast, instead of only thinking about it.",

      "body": "Im not a professional and currently struggle with ED as well but from my experience with obsessive tracking and guilt from eating this is what helped me.\n\nGet rid of the scale. And definitely don\u2019t use those tracking apps like myfitnesspal because since you have this relationship with food, it will only make things worse. Delete it. \nTry not to count calories, and instead focus on eating regular, balanced meals..\n\nRemember that your body will burn calories from just existing (TDEE) so i just eat 3 meals with some snacks (including \u201cunhealthy\u201d things from time to time) and try to block food tracking from my mind throughout the day. I think you should get a dietician to give you a food plan of what your body needs exactly. (Will probably be eat 2-3 hours, 3 meals and 2-3 small snacks) because remember that it pretty much averages out to have your body burn those calories anyway when you eat this way. \n\nI added a bit of strength training and a bit of cardio just so i can eat more and increase metabolism lol... but important not to overexercise, obsessively count how much you burn, not weigh yourself. I try to close my eyes and trust the process mindlessly and focus on other things\n\nMay seem weird but I just tell myself that people without EDs eat regular meals and snacks, enjoy carbs and sugar, and exercise moderately and live their lives fine with stable weight without restricting... \n\nDefinitely seek professional help cause i know that food guilt mindset is difficult to deal with by yourself:( they will help you improve much faster and make sure you stay on track. and this is my experience after a lot of time with a dietician, eating disorder specialists and a therapist. I still feel guilty after eating sometimes and have negative thoughts about my body but its a process",

It can take a long time to undo that and find what's right for you. Try to have some compassion for yourself. \n\nThere are two ideas that have helped me recently. First, letting go of the identity of being a thin person. I realized how much suffering was caused by my need for others to perceive me that way. Without trying to unpack all the reasons WHY I have that identity, I simply ask myself, \"what would I do if I didn't have the identity of a thin person?\" and it has helped me through a lot. \n\nThe second is asking myself how I'll physically feel after I eat something. Meals are relatively short, but they're followed by many hours of having that food in your body, energizing you. I tell myself I can eat whatever I want, but to at least consider how I'll feel afterward. Sometimes that means eating processed sugar, because I truly feel it will be satisfying and my body is asking for it. Other times it means eating an apple. The point is, try letting your body tell you what it wants, simply by asking how you'll feel afterward, without prejudgment. \n\nI hope that provides some help. I don't know much, but I've been struggling with this for a long time and have made some progress here and there. Feel free to send me a message if you ever want to talk through more of this.",

      "body": "What helped me is simply eating. Even though you feel guilty, keep on eating normal amounts of food (at least 3 meals + snacks). I did this and at the beginning I felt so guilty and wanted to cry after every meal. Then the guilt simply disappeared. I still have some bad days but it's so much better. Also I didn't gain weight at all, but even if you do it's okay. If you need to work so hard to maintain a certain weight then it's not the healthy weight for you, also it's not sustainable and it ruins you mentally. You can also check @millyg_fit on ig.",

      "body": "Start small with drinks or something. I LOVE green tea lemonade and make myself a pitcher of it whenever I have time on my days off (I work full time). Hot tea with milk or cream is also pretty nice and calming in the evenings.\nYou're obviously tense from the ED (I know I am from my own), so I think the hot tea will help you relax a little, plus milk is supposed to make you sleepy. If you're well rested you'll likely feel better.\n\nBoth these drinks are mostly water, so I don't find them especially intimidating, but they also just make me feel good.\n\nWhat I also do is make food at home like cheesecake and steak n whatnot.\nIt's easier when the calorie count isn't on a label, and I know what all is going into the dish so I'm not paranoid about unhealthy added sugars.\nTrust me, I internally freak out when I see added sugars on food labels. \n\nI've lost 50 lbs in 5 months from hardly eating and working so many hours and I get so hungry every few weeks I HAVE to get meat in my diet so I buy my own steak even tho my fam is making whatever else for dinner.\n\nAlso Greek yogurt with honey and blueberries is tasty. And cottage cheese with some blackberry jam mixed in is another favorite.",

I indeed feel like I have to be thin so others won\u2019t \u2018judge me\u2019 or something like that, which is... bizarre. If I feel fine, who are they to criticize me...?
