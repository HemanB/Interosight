And she said something recently like \"if you have something to say about someone's body they probably already know and *have a team of professionals helping them*\" which screams ED to me, unless she is genuinely sick some other way. Also we know she is vegan and incredibly selective about what she will eat. I really hope she has a change soon. I personally even think that her sudden relationship change and choosing to start a romance with a married man who just had a baby is a symptom of her ED and inability to make good life choices. I was hella problematic when I was my sickest and it's just too familiar.",

Children\u2019s bones don\u2019t always, or even often, show like that. Exposed bones don\u2019t equal being a child. Pedophilia is not being attracted to women who look extremely thin and bony. Pedohpilia is being attracted to people who are quite literally and obviously *children*. \n\nBeing thin or severely underweight is not necessarily correlated with being childlike. Furthermore, implying that Ariana looks like a child because she\u2019s so thin reads to me that you\u2019re actually implying she looks like a child because she doesn\u2019t have womanly \u201ccurves\u201d aka breasts/hips/butt. There are plenty of women that do not have these features. They don\u2019t deserve to be equated to 12 year olds rather than grown women. I get what you\u2019re going for with comments like this, but just be careful what ideas you\u2019re actually throwing out there. Some pedophiles are attracted to 15-16 year olds who *do* have curves. \n\nI completely agree that she has body issues, likely an ED, and looks very ill and concerning. But claiming that she looks like a child because of those things? Not accurate. Potentially harmful. Make better comments.",

      "body": "Eating disorders are a mental illness. They are a symptom of a greater problem and a form of self harm. Another form of self harm is sabotaging your relationships and getting involved in messy situations you know you should not be in. Things people do in active addiction (or active ED) to self harm can include: literally hurting your body with force, starvation or substances, cheating, getting involved with partnered people, excessive lying, dating very promiscuously (to the point of harm), spontaneously quitting a job or moving to a new city, berating friends when they express concern, breaking off friendships with people who care about you, isolating yourself from friends and family, drastically change their appearance, get involved with people or groups that are harmful (drug scenes, abusive relationships), etc. Exhibiting these behaviors doesn't necessarily mean you're mentally ill, but when they are harmful to you it could be a symptom of that. This move was a risk to her career that she's spent her entire life building. She has won back public perception many times but she knew this was harmful to the people around her and potentially to herself as well. Most people with ED can confirm that at their sickest they made very poor life choices. Sometimes, people in active addiction or active ED are sought after by those who are looking to be with someone they can manipulate or harm and get away with it. Do I know all or any of this is true for Ari? Of course not. But from my personal experience it seems very obviously possible. I truly hope I am wrong.",

Pedohpilia is being attracted to people who are quite literally and obviously *children*. \n\nBeing thin or severely underweight is not necessarily correlated with being childlike. Furthermore, implying that Ariana looks like a child because she\u2019s so thin reads to me that you\u2019re actually implying she looks like a child because she doesn\u2019t have womanly \u201ccurves\u201d aka breasts/hips/butt. There are plenty of women that do not have these features. They don\u2019t deserve to be equated to 12 year olds rather than grown women. I get what you\u2019re going for with comments like this, but just be careful what ideas you\u2019re actually throwing out there. Some pedophiles are attracted to 15-16 year olds who *do* have curves. \n\nI completely agree that she has body issues, likely an ED, and looks very ill and concerning.

Furthermore, implying that Ariana looks like a child because she\u2019s so thin reads to me that you\u2019re actually implying she looks like a child because she doesn\u2019t have womanly \u201ccurves\u201d aka breasts/hips/butt. There are plenty of women that do not have these features. They don\u2019t deserve to be equated to 12 year olds rather than grown women. I get what you\u2019re going for with comments like this, but just be careful what ideas you\u2019re actually throwing out there. Some pedophiles are attracted to 15-16 year olds who *do* have curves. \n\nI completely agree that she has body issues, likely an ED, and looks very ill and concerning.

Pedohpilia is being attracted to people who are quite literally and obviously *children*. \n\nBeing thin or severely underweight is not necessarily correlated with being childlike. Furthermore, implying that Ariana looks like a child because she\u2019s so thin reads to me that you\u2019re actually implying she looks like a child because she doesn\u2019t have womanly \u201ccurves\u201d aka breasts/hips/butt. There are plenty of women that do not have these features. They don\u2019t deserve to be equated to 12 year olds rather than grown women. I get what you\u2019re going for with comments like this, but just be careful what ideas you\u2019re actually throwing out there. Some pedophiles are attracted to 15-16 year olds who *do* have curves. \n\nI completely agree that she has body issues, likely an ED, and looks very ill and concerning.
