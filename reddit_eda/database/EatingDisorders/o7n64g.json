  "title": "Request: I'm pretty sure my Boyfriend has an ED but I don't know what to do to help",
  "selftext": " \n\nHi all,\n\nMy boyfriend was decently overweight before we started dating. He lost many many pounds very very fast over the course of 3-4 months by restrictive eating with no exercise. Though, because we were close friends at the time, and I saw him every day it didn't immediately hit me that he was losing weight extremely fast.\n\nAfter those 3-4 months we started dating, and we've been together for 6 months. He's still losing weight, even though he really doesn't need to anymore. I try to be supportive and suggest regular healthy meals; but he doesn't eat more than once a day. I'm fairly sure his diet is causing him other health issues as well, but he's yet to make a doctor's appointment.\n\nIt's gotten a bit worse now since some COVID restrictions have been lifted, and he's started going to the gym on top of this. I'm just worried that this might get out of hand, and I'd rather try to stop it from getting any worse.\n\nI know there's no possible way that he, himself, thinks he might have an eating disorder, or that his dieting is causing him these issues. If any of you have any suggestions on steps I can take to either make him aware of how dangerous this can be, or suggestions about what to do in general it'd be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

      "body": "OP, you are a wonderful and caring SO. It does sound very concerning, and it's more common than ever for men to have EDs (in case anyone thinks it's still not likely or typical). There are so many resources for help, but the real issue is breaking past the defensiveness to have him see an MD. \nIt would be wonderful if you could just have him agree to see an internist who specializes in ED treatment as well, and have them give him a general evaluation. By doing this, it helps to have someone medically trained that can provide actual data to support what they see.\nIf by some amazing possibility he is NOT diagnosed with one, then no harm, no foul. He's healthy - terrific. But, my senses - all based on your own knowledge and love for him - show me that something is very wrong.\nYou cannot make or force a person to get help when they have an ED, but you can definitely support them and value them-- and see if you can help them understand how valuable they truly are. \nIt doesn't matter if a person is 85 when they develop an ED -- life is worth living without it. It's a journey, but worth it. <3 hugs\nhttps://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/",

They are not in themselves a form of \"health choice\". ED's are a symptom of a much larger psychological problem, which truly, none of us can diagnose, as you said. The truth is: if he is behaving differently on a trend, getting more extreme, continuing to lose, and is unable to self-reflect in realistic manner-- there's a problem.\nOne of the first methods to recognizing EDs is actually via friends and family, who know the person, their habits, and their norms.",
