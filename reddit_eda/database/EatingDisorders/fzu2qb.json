  "selftext": "I\u2019m pretty sure my sister has orthorexia, but she hasn\u2019t been diagnosed with anything so that\u2019s not the point. I\u2019m in recovery from anorexia, and I\u2019m already struggling under quarantine, let alone the fact that it\u2019s easter (so much food), AND I somehow managed to catch covid. Everything is great(:\n\nCovid completely killed my appetite, so it\u2019s a struggle not to just... relapse. It feels so EASY.\n\nPlus, my sister is on a very intense diet at the moment, and you can tell she\u2019s taking out her frustrations on me by criticizing every \u201cunhealthy\u201d thing I eat. \n\nPart of me wants to relapse to show my sister/family how much this hurts, and also because I wanna be worse than my sister. At this point I\u2019m running out of ideas for why i shouldn\u2019t :/",

I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re in such a terrible and unsupportive environment right now. I\u2019m truly so sad for you, it is awful that the Ed is calling to you at this time. I hope you continue to eat, please don\u2019t give the disease a toehold. You matter.",

And I know it\u2019s so easy to slip into old habits but in the long run you know that\u2019s not what\u2019s best, hell use your recovery as a way to say f you to anyone who has put you down. You do you, avoid your sister when you can, talk to your parents about what\u2019s going on and how it\u2019s making you feel, and find someone who can keep you accountable, wether it\u2019s a friend or just posting updates on here, and maybe if you haven\u2019t already find a therapist you can talk to over video chat or call a free hotline. But whatever you do please don\u2019t go back down that hole.",

Hold strong; she is not ready for recovery in the ways you are and that\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t judge either of your journeys, just be yourself and maintain your health for you.",

      "body": "Your sister is lashing out at you because she's miserable, and irritable, and angry.  That's what life in an ED is like, and that's not the life you want.  Does she really seem like she's happy and carefree?  Is her life what you *truly* want for yourself?  To have everything revolve around food, to obsess over every bite, to deny yourself food you enjoy?  To do all of that for nothing because you'll never be truly satisfied with your body no matter how much weight you lose?  That's her reality right now, and I hope so badly that she's able to get herself out of it too because no one deserves that.  But whether she does or doesn't, that can't affect your decision.  Your life is yours, not hers, and you get to choose what you want it to look like.  This situation right now is an important decision point.  Three years from now, do you want to look back and regret relapsing because of the misery it caused you, or do you want to look back and be grateful that you continued working toward recovery because of the freedom it granted you?\n\nAnd to be blunt, relapsing would be letting her win.  She's trying to hurt you and get a rise out of you.  Don't let her.",

      "body": "Almost the exact same thing is happening at my house, so much so I asked my sister if SHE made the post! I recommend keeping your distance if possible (I know, not the best idea but for now it might be good) and talk to your parents. I\u2019m a bit sociopathic so I\u2019d recommend threatening a relapse to your parents if nothings done. I know it won\u2019t likely do much but talk to your sibling and tell them about orthorexia and how it can be dangerous and how it\u2019s affecting you. This might not help but that\u2019s all the advice I could recommend.",

      "body": "Ok, listen. If everything is as bad as it's going to be, and you say you're \"in recovery\" and not fully comfortable in being completely recovered, you're going to most likely relapse. Unfortunately, that's a reality you will most likely face. As much as that sucks, there's no beating around the bush. You've probably realized it too, and that's ok. Relapses are common, they are frustrating, and they mean NOTHING. In your recovery, you might have things happen to you that you can't control that will cause you to spiral. College, sickness, massive trigger whatever. It sucks and it happens. What does matter is what you choose to do with it. Communicate and be honest with yourself and you're team (including your family). Be easy on yourself and take it slowly.",
