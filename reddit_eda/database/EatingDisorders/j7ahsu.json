  "selftext": "  \n\nI did something terrifying today and I just wanted to post it here as I need support. Sorry if it\u2019s too basic :(\n\nI have realised that I have a problem. I can\u2019t control looking at the scale, I can\u2019t control binging, or purging and I certainly can\u2019t the self loathing that I have. I\u2019m obese and because of that I hate myself. But I shouldn\u2019t and I refuse to any longer. I need to change my brain so I\u2019ve taken an important step- I threw out my scale and it\u2019s ridiculous because I feel like sobbing. Because there\u2019s some sick twisted thing in the back of my head telling me that I need it. But I don\u2019t, and I\u2019m not going to let it hurt me anymore. I\u2019m done with my disorder bring in control.",

I haven't owned a scale for 20+ years and it's been instrumental in keeping me mentally healthy. I know how my body should feel and concentrate on that, not numbers. Best wishes \ud83c\udf40 feel free to dm me if you're looking for some encouragement or insights.",
