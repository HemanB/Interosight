  "title": "Study On Eating Behaviours: Participants Needed!",
  "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI\u2019m a PhD Student in psychology at Queen\u2019s University in Kingston, ON. I\u2019m currently investigating the relationship between disordered eating, perfectionism, and interpersonal relationships\u2014and would very much appreciate your help/participation!\n\nParticipation would entail completing some online questionnaires (link below). It should take less than 15 minutes. This is, of course, completely voluntary! However, people who complete the survey will be entered into a raffle for $25 (CAD) Visa gift cards. Specifically, 1 gift card will be given for every 25 people who participate. For example, if there are ultimately 75 people who respond to the survey, then three raffles\u2014each for $25\u2014will take place.\n\nThe link to the survey is [HERE](https://queensu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9TbE2j0iYXunmn3), or alternatively copy and paste the following link into your browser: https://queensu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9TbE2j0iYXunmn3. Your responses will be kept completely anonymous. Please feel free to contact me at 13pl28@queensu.ca if you have any questions or concerns!\n\nThanks in advance for any time you can spare!\n\nPauline",
