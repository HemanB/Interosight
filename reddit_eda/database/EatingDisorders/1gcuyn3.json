  "selftext": "I'm a guy who used to have an eating disorder. I fall in the same category as a lot of other men, as my illness went unnoticed until it was almost too late. I was denied treatment twice before medical professionals took me seriously. This is the second time I hear \"eating disorders in men are one of the most dangerous things ever\" and there is definitely some truth to it imo. Female EDs are extremely severe and alarming, but how about the guys? They don't get talked about as much and I think we should change that. I survived, but there are lots of guys suffering in silence. Let's talk.",

Im nowhere near recovered and still face the daily struggles of feeling like i dont deserve to eat, like i need to earn food, or just flat out losing appetite simply because i saw or smelled food. some days the action of putting food in my mouth is nauseating and triggers my gag reflex even if its one of my favorite foods. I vape to keep the hunger at bay knowing itll make me nauseous and i constantly put myself through loops where i feel hungry until the hunger turns to nausea and then eventually the nausea goes away if i just dont eat, then i feel hungry later again but i know if i ignore it long enough the hunger simply disappears. Ive been losing weight i seriously cant afford to lose,losing a lot of muscle mass ive worked hard to build over the course of my life, my metabolism is very fast and ive lost so much muscle mass. My endurance for daily physical activities has dwindled down to almost nothing and i cant even have sex without getting tired anymore. I used to be active enough to run a mile in under 5 minutes, i used to eat all the time and theres so many other factors as to why ive gotten to where i am today but having an eating disorder after growing up eating everything in sight and being active all the time has been by far the most detrimental thing for my physical and mental health out of all the other shit thats happened in my life. If this keeps up im gonna eventually be unable to take care of myself and care may come to me involuntarily, or at some point i may just give in and fade away to nothing just the same as my appetite does; slowly and without anyone noticing. The unfortunate reality is that people just arent ready to talk about mens mental health. Nobody cares how you are as long as you can get your job done, provide for others, or overall be useful in some way. Men who struggle in western society are always kicked while theyre down and nobody cares. Men need to learn to move on without the support or approval of anyone else in order to survive and thats why we men bottle everything up. Its backwards for a man, someone known for providing and caring and protecting, would need any form of care for themselves because men should always already be in a place to do their best for others regardless of what stage of life you're in.",

Both genders face significant challenges, but the experience for men often comes with unique barriers.      \n      \n\n\nWhat makes eating disorders particularly dangerous for men is the lack of attention and concern they receive from healthcare providers. Many men find their struggles dismissed or not taken seriously, delaying proper diagnosis and treatment. As a result, men often present with more severe symptoms when they finally seek help, which can lead to worse outcomes and potentially higher mortality rates. This is especially concerning given the stigma that discourages men from recognizing their symptoms or speaking up in the first place.      \n      \n\nAdditionally, men who identify as LGBTQ+ are 10 times more likely to develop an eating disorder than heterosexual men, highlighting the disproportionate impact on queer men. In fact, the majority of men diagnosed with eating disorders are part of the LGBTQ+ community. These factors underscore the critical need to address eating disorders in men with the same urgency and inclusivity as for women.",

Usually by the time men seek treatment it\u2019s \u201ctoo late\u201d or significantly more severe than female peers. \n\n\nMen represent up to 25% of people with eating disorders. \nEven so, women are up to five times more likely to be diagnosed and 1.5 times more likely to be treated for an eating disorder than men are. \nMen with eating disorders tend not to recognize their symptoms as problematic, in part due to the stereotype of eating disorders as being a \u201cwoman\u2019s problem.\u201d \nBy the time men with eating disorder symptoms present in healthcare settings, their cases tend to be more severe, in part due to their denial of symptoms, anticipated or encountered prejudice, and even denial of treatment because of their gender. \nHealthcare professionals tend to minimize the symptoms of men with eating disorders.\n\nSource: https://anad.org/eating-disorder-statistic/",

Youve come so far, maybe havent made it yet but isnt it something wonderful to see the end goal of recovery in sight? Stick to your goals op, you got this!",

          "body": "To my knowlege this is very true. I cant tell you how many times my eating disorder took over an prevented me from having any kind of food for up to days at a time. Im nowhere near recovered and still face the daily struggles of feeling like i dont deserve to eat, like i need to earn food, or just flat out losing appetite simply because i saw or smelled food. some days the action of putting food in my mouth is nauseating and triggers my gag reflex even if its one of my favorite foods. I vape to keep the hunger at bay knowing itll make me nauseous and i constantly put myself through loops where i feel hungry until the hunger turns to nausea and then eventually the nausea goes away if i just dont eat, then i feel hungry later again but i know if i ignore it long enough the hunger simply disappears. Ive been losing weight i seriously cant afford to lose,losing a lot of muscle mass ive worked hard to build over the course of my life, my metabolism is very fast and ive lost so much muscle mass. My endurance for daily physical activities has dwindled down to almost nothing and i cant even have sex without getting tired anymore. I used to be active enough to run a mile in under 5 minutes, i used to eat all the time and theres so many other factors as to why ive gotten to where i am today but having an eating disorder after growing up eating everything in sight and being active all the time has been by far the most detrimental thing for my physical and mental health out of all the other shit thats happened in my life. If this keeps up im gonna eventually be unable to take care of myself and care may come to me involuntarily, or at some point i may just give in and fade away to nothing just the same as my appetite does; slowly and without anyone noticing. The unfortunate reality is that people just arent ready to talk about mens mental health. Nobody cares how you are as long as you can get your job done, provide for others, or overall be useful in some way. Men who struggle in western society are always kicked while theyre down and nobody cares. Men need to learn to move on without the support or approval of anyone else in order to survive and thats why we men bottle everything up. Its backwards for a man, someone known for providing and caring and protecting, would need any form of care for themselves because men should always already be in a place to do their best for others regardless of what stage of life you're in.",

In the late 80s, my parents took me to our family physician and he literally laughed-out-loud over my parents' assertion I had an eating disorder. \n\nWhen no one, even doctors, teachers, coaches, parents, etc have the understanding males can have eating disorders too, it's allowed to continue and become more ingrained. \n\nIt's still framed as a \"girl's problem\", and there's sexism, effeminacy-perceptions, homophobic-anti-gay-allegations that men fear will come of admitting and seeking treatment for it. \n\nIt's growing faster for boys than girls, and finally some celebs like Zayn Malik, Ed Sheeran, Jordan Fisher, Dennis Quaid, Ashley Hamilton, Russel Brand, Elton John, etc. \n\nAs a teen boy, it's not uncommon to see thinness, when pubuerry has the effect of sharply increasing their metabolism, they are often phyically active, but even their increased hunger doesn't catch-up with their physical changes. And boys who get it tend to be heavier than normal, when there's not a cultural expectation for boys to be unrealistically thin as what still exists for women. \n\nAs a common issue for anorexic girls, they lose or lessen their periods, what alerts parents and doctors of their illness, what boys then don't. obviously. Male clothes hide both weight loss and gain better, when male clothing is rarely ever tight or body-conscious. \n\nA boy or man who is working out is given a sort of space culturally to work hard to change their bodies, and many males with EDs are in sports or weightlifting. \n\nI can't tell you how many times I openly binged at meal times in the dorms or high school, and no one said anything but almost slappinig me on the back for eating like a starving dog.  And no one ever connected my thinness to purging when that wasn't within their cultural understanding.  It was just how I lived for decades, part of my daily life, and no one outside my family even noticed it. \n\nI had been obese since 10, and at 14, was in full-blown anorexia and bulimia. I won't share numbers, but I think I can share I lost half my body weight. I would go on to struggle with it until my 40s.",
