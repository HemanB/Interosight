  "selftext": "As an overweight woman with an ED whenever I am lured into bringing it up or why I'm not eating, I have to explain myself. I am met with \"you're a little big to have one, aren't you?\" , \"arent people with EDs usually skinny?\" Etc...  I had a really hard time coming to terms with it and actually thinking it's a disorder because of comments like these. \nPlease do not listen to these people. It is hard and we need help. We do not need to have our EDs pushed to the side because people consider them \"success stories\". We are not \"success stories\" we are people that have a problem. We are people with a serious disorder. \nI developed my ED after I was raped at 15. I hate everything about myself now and I thrive on losing weight. If I eat I make myself throw up. If I dont eat, I throw up. I eat less than a quarter of calories I should a day and still try to reduce it to less, because I hate myself so much. I do not like eating. I get triggered by eating. My fiance makes me eat when I try to have a \"water diet\". He is helping me overcome my ED instead of telling me I don't have one. \n\n\nNo matter your weight, your ED is valid. \nNo matter your skin color, your ED is valid. \nNo matter what sex you are, your ED is valid. \nNo matter when your ED started, your ED is valid. \nNo matter your age, your ED is valid. \n\nPlease don't let anyone tell you that it is not. I love you. You are cared for. You ED is valid. I am here for you.",
