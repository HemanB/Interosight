  "title": "Request: Can my college legally force students with eating disorders onto the meal plan?",
  "selftext": "Hi all. College student somewhere on the east coast.I was recently diagnosed with an eating disorder. I've noticed that my condition noticeably improves when I can prepare my own food and eat in private. My school is now requiring everyone to eat dining hall food. In the past it was optional and if you had an eating disorder or special diet you didn't have to pay for the meal plan and could make your own food. They've said the new rule applies to everyone and we all HAVE to eat on campus. Is this legal? It feels like an ADA violation but I don't know if eating disorders are protected the same way as mental illnesses. Any advice or thoughts is appreciated.",

      "body": "Excellent advice; OP, if you live on campus, it's just a requirement like being required to pay for parking if you own a car. It's not to control you, but simply because they would be irresponsible to not infer that your living on campus dictates the necessity of food availability. Without a reliable grocery store right near your housing, they cannot presume you'd have access to food. It would be hard for them to explain, if something happened to you, how they ignored your not purchasing a meal plan. \nAlso, it's likely required for insurance (insurance that protects the school/liability).  \nhttp://www.collegecounselorservices.com/faq/do-college-students-have-to-purchase-meal-plans/",
