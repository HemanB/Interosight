  "selftext": "\n\n(M27) here. Have had a rough time for most of my adult life hating my body and struggling with ED despite being a healthy weight for most of it. \n\nHad a depressive episode for a couple of months and must have gained abit of weight, partially due to just not working as much. \n\nThe other day another colleague made a remark about it. I told him I didn\u2019t appreciate it. He said I was being sensitive, and it escalated much more than it had to.\n\nI\u2019ve never had these sort of interactions with women and feel like they are much more educated /empathetic about this stuff than guys are to each other (obviously not always though) \n\nAnyway I\u2019ve really spiralled in the time after. Why can\u2019t people just keep their mouth shut and be respectful, particularly at work. \n \nWhat are some good responses In the future? \n\nI\u2019m not going to ignore it any longer, however it\u2019s especially frustrating when it involves work. Since it might potentially mean getting less work. \n\nThere\u2019s no HR or anything where I work (very male dominated industry doing sound) and I feel like my bosses wouldn\u2019t take my side if i were to talk to them about it.\n",

      "body": "Yeah same. Make fucked up comments, receive fucked up answers. If you make fun of me walking really slow or make comments about me not being very fast with my fingers, I am going to tell you that I've had very poor motor control as a child and had to start school a year later because of it because I couldn't even hold a pen. Might make you think twice before telling me that I clearly haven't been sewing for as long as you next time.\n\n\n\nObviously that one is pretty mild, but a lot of the time when people feel the need to make comments about my food, I just go \"I'm glad that I even forced myself to eat today, because there are days when I don't.\" and depending on how mean their comments were, I either make it more uncomfortable or not. Like I also have several physical problems that make it hard for me to eat, so I might either disclose one of them, or all of them + the eating disorder. Depending on how uncomfortable I want to make it.",
