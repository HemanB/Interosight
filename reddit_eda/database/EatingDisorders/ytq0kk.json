  "title": "Weight loss without calorie tracking",
  "selftext": "Let me start by saying that I am sure you've heard this story before - \"I love my body, I want to lose weight for me\" and you probably see right through it. Please hear me out.\n\nI am 5\"1 (about 155 cm) and I weigh quite a large amount. It is a LOT of weight to carry on such a short body. I can feel my weight starting to take toll on my physicality and flexibility, and I hate it since I'm otherwise an active person. I can't bend over quite as easily to tie my shoes or pick something up off the floor, my knees, shoulders, and ankles ache a lot... it's painful and uncomfortable to be my size, and I know losing some weight would be a surefire way to help me overcome some of these issues. I'm also not trying to be \"thin\" - I'm just trying to move without pain.\n\nThe issue is that the major reason I've had such sudden weight gain is due to the fact that I have (undiagnosed) binge eating disorder and have had it for virtually as long as I can remember. My relationship with food is frail, and although it's improved a lot recently, small comments can still set me off. One of the most mind blowing things I've learned about binge eating is that tracking can actually set off a binge rather than counter it. As such, I am really truly at a loss for how to lose some weight while also battling an ED. It feels like two such conflicting problems and I'm torn, I feel sad, and I feel hopeless. I love my body because of the way it moves for me and carries me. I don't want that to go away.",

      "body": "In this specific case I think that if you attribute your weight gain to BED then weight loss has to become second priority to treating your ED. Weight loss might come as a result of it but it also might not. You\u2019ve expressed some respect for your body which is going to help so much. If you have the resources I\u2019d seek care for the ED because it\u2019ll use any weight loss efforts to keep you sick. You\u2019ve gotta be healthy to even consider the subject of healthy weight loss",

Not sure the correct term) bulimic, I have a little bit of experience with this though my experience was different because I also purged with exercise and had anorexic tendencies at sometimes. \n\nHowever, I agree with the person above that treating your disorder first is most important. I am not saying this is best or right for you because it is a faith-based method but what helped me kick off my recovery was Overeaters Anonymous. I went every day and having the group was so helpful. It is not too hard to find local meetings as they are more common than you may think and the group is super welcoming.",

      "body": "I\u2019m the same height! My ED is OSFED/UFED. For me, I was incredibly unhappy at my weight. I also couldn\u2019t move as well and I couldn\u2019t keep up with my husband. I focused on movement, just walking, and some very light weights. It took a year, and weight loss was very slow, but my weight did go down. As far as food, I focused on what I learned in ED recovery, eat protein, a produce, and a starch at every meal. Small snacks to keep you full. I never counted calories, but I did manage the portions by eating protein at every meal the size of my hand, half the plate full of produce and 1/4 a starch (also learned in ED recovery). It was definitely more of relaxed approach to weight loss and very intuitive eating informed\u2026 move my body, eat balanced meals. See what happens. If I have weight loss, great! If not, that\u2019s fine as well. It\u2019s more about the lifestyle of nourishing and moving your body than hitting a specific # on the scale.",

You eat something \"bad\" or go over your \"caloric budget\" for a day, feel like a failure, and then binge. It is a terrible cycle. It is why many binge eating treatment books (e.g. Overcoming Binge Eating Disorder by Dr. Fairbanks) simply punt the issue,  especially if you are already at a healthy weight. It is also why calorie tracking is SUPER tricky with binging, and why it has to been done in a particular way. \n\nHowever, in our experience, there's a solution. You just need to adopt a different mindset when tracking calories. Treat every day like a new day, an opportunity to improve and to meet your caloric budget. And if you fail, understand that that's OK! We are all human, and we all make mistakes. Treat yourself with kindness and self compassion. Then, tomorrow, (with gentleness in your heart) try again! \n\nIf it helps, I made a free calorie tracker called [Clean Slate](https://cleanslate.sh/) for people who struggle with BED  but also want to track calories (usually to lose weight). Originally, I built it as a private tool for my wife and I. However, after it helped us, I was like, why not let other people us it?\n\nBut above all, I really hope that you treat yourself with self compassion and kindness. It is really hard to go a long period of time without binges and you\u2019re gonna have weeks where you just mess up.  Sometimes the cause might be known, like the death of a parent or a pet. Sometimes the cause might be totally random!  But you clearly have had a lot of success thus far with your BED, and I will hope that you don\u2019t view the occasional binge as a total failure. It\u2019s bound to happen.  The key instead is to forgive yourself, dust yourself off, and try again!\n\n\nPS:  If you are hungry, that is a classic trigger for binge.  I highly recommend introducing more fibrous veggies, like broccoli or carrots, into your diet, as well as lean protein, whether yogurt, fish, chicken, tofu, etc.  These are foods that have been shown to minimize hunger, and that\u2019s a super useful tool in your toolkit.\n\nPPS:  If you can afford therapy and are currently not in therapy, I recommend it in the strongest possible terms. BED is very difficult to treat without help, and a trained, kind professional is the best ally you can have!\n\nPPPS: You can lose weight without tracking calories. However, I would argue that intuitive eating comes with its own set of problems and is tricky to do right, just in a different way!  That is because our modern food environment is really tricky, and most of the foods are very caloric,  which makes it hard to intuitively eat.  You can also try fasting, which is another way of doing caloric restriction without counting calories.
