It didn't last because I have no stamina for that kind of thing. I still ate dinner I just skipped lunch and breakfast for a couple days. Then I forgot all about that for a while and ate normally (minus my tiny portion sizes and constant no breakfast) I was about 16 when I started to think about it more and I lasted longer. (I skipped breakfast and lunch as well as having small dinner portions (I would have skipped dinner but my parents would have made me eat it regardless of what I said) I'd say that went on for about a week till I couldn't take it anymore and started eating. Now I eat lunch, but still no breakfast. My portion sizes have always been small because I don't have a big appetite. I also don't get enough nutrients cuz I don't like much. I don't think I ever really had an eating disorder cuz it never lasted long and I never saw myself as fat. I guess I just didn't want to be fat. I still don't. Yet I eat a lot of unhealthy things, like today I had a plate full of slices of cheese and I had a hot chocolate. (They both were so good) Unhealthy food is definitely my weakness.\u00a0\nSometimes I do kinda feel guilty when I eat badly but I never bother to do anything about it (I never purge or work out) I have absolutely no motivation to work out or take care of myself.\u00a0\nBut idk I'm pretty sure I've never had an eating disorder. Even though my family always says I don't eat enough.\u00a0\nIdk.\u00a0\nShould I be eating more? Cause I can feel satisfied with the portion sizes I currently have.\u00a0",

I have never been judgmental about the way people look and it saddens me to know there are so many people who feel the way I feel. I was never taught how to eat healthy and my mother always fed us junk food. I was sooooo picky growing up and now that I have realized I have an eating disorder I really want to try foods that I have never tried before like a cherry. It\u2019s wild to me that my mother would just be like ok and would just let me eat junk instead. I\u2019m actually excited to start trying new foods in the future! When I get better of course. But I recently tried sweet potatoes and am in love because they really are so good lol.",
