  "title": "Request: Should I be worried if my partner who was previously hospitalized for an eating disorder is throwing up occasionally",
  "selftext": " \n\nMy partner was hospitalized for an eating disorder about five years ago during college. She has talked to me about it and says that she is in recovery and has it under control but still struggle sometimes. I also have my issues and remind her she is lovable and worthy even if she struggles or is imperfect.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed that when things are going well she still throws up a couple times a month. When things aren\u2019t going well (stress in our relationship, stress at her job, stress with her family) she throws up multiple times a week or even every day. I don\u2019t bring it up when I notice.\n\nI have asked if there is anything I can do to be supportive and she says It\u2019s not my responsibility and she has it under control, which I accept. I\u2019ve encouraged her to see a therapist (she has expressed wanting to see one just for a normal life help). Is there more I should be doing? I want to maintain healthy boundaries but also worry about her.",

      "body": "There are 3 reasons why someone would be throwing up that often:\n\n1. Medication or health condition making her sick- she needs to see a doctor to get that straightened out.\n\n2. Anxiety so high she's getting sick- if anxiety gets to be bad enough that you're throwing up regularly, you definitely need to talk to a therapist and doctor. \n\n3. Eating disorder- she has a history of one, so this is most likely what's happening. You start off thinking it will only be this one time to help you cope because it was a bad day. Then it gets worse and next thing you know you're in full on relapse. If that's the case and she is/was serious about recovering she definitely needs to talk to a therapist and doctor. \n\nThere is no reason to be throwing up that often. If this is a recent relapse, it's best to address it before it becomes more ingrained. You should be worried. \n\nPlease address it carefully though. Come from a place of concern and try not to sound accusatory. You can suggest seeing someone and offer to help her find some help, but don't force it or make ultimatums. Remind her that you care about her wellbeing and that you just want to see her healthy and happy. \n\nAlso don't force her to stop or be a nazi patrolman about her puking. That will mean she'll become even more secretive and/or stop seeking you for help or disclosing it with you. You can be clear that you don't like seeing her suffer, but she needs to find another healthy coping skill before this one is stolen away.",

      "body": "Yes. It is a clear sign of relapse. The sooner something is done to prevent the situation to decline, the better.  \n\n\nIt is not ok to purge even if we are stress, that is a warning sing, and that is not a fully recovered case. It is not your responsibility, sure, but that issue is clearly not under control and she is delusional to think so. Throwing up causes serious medical issues, that are not to ignore.  \n\n\nI suggest keep trying to find her a therapist. Maybe you can make a list of places for her to call (a ED specialist would be best) and offer to take her and wait for her. It is scary the first time. But is true if you push too much it can be unhelpful.",
