  "title": "Request: No appetite, afraid of relapse",
  "selftext": "I'm recovering from a severely broken leg (4 months post op). I'm facing another surgery next month to remove scar tissue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy doctor prescribed me Prozac because this has been hard mentally and caused a lot of trouble with anxiety (I used to cope by being active, but now I can't be active). The medication is helping me a lot, but I also think this medication has caused me to completely lose my appetite. Like I have no hunger but I can feel my stomach rumble. If I don't force myself, I can go all day just eating a cracker or piece of fruit and then something small at dinner.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis has been going on for a few weeks, and I have lost weight. My physical therapist is concerned because I need to be gaining muscle in my injured leg and starting weights soon, and not losing weight.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore breaking my leg, I had really adopted a much more positive outlook on weight and nutrition. I went from being underweight and not strong to gaining weight through healthy eating and focusing on exercise and strength. Now I can't workout like I used to and it's been hard.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used to struggle with disordered eating and would restrict myself a lot. I've gotten better and gained weight since then, but this lack of appetite and weight loss now is confusing and difficult. I feel horrible for saying this, but I sort of feel myself relapsing into old habits. Although I don't have an appetite right now, I am struggling to make myself eat even though I know I need to. I think part of me finally feels in control again by being able to restrict my food intake. I need to not be doing this because I need to recover from this broken leg and I don't want to fall to bad habits again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice?",

      "body": "Hey there, I am in a similar situation, currently recovering from a broken foot. What helps me is surrounding myself with my loved ones and eating with others, even when I am nervous to. I too was on a healthier food/exercise kick before my surgery, so I understand how you feel. I try to remind myself that nourishing my body allows for a faster recovery. Food is there to help us. Our current post op recovery is only temporary and we have to try our best to take care of ourselves. Restriction makes me feel like I have control in this current situation where I also feel helpless. It isn\u2019t easy. DMs are open if u need a recovery centered support buddy. \u2764\ufe0f",

      "body": "Hi, I am a Registered Dietitian who specializes in eating disorder treatment. What you are going through sounds so challenging- physically, mentally, and emotionally. I have a lot of clients who experience something similar. They get sick or have surgery or change meds, eat less due to poor appetite, and then this ignites old ED thoughts, such as:\n\n \"Well I was fine eating so little, I should keep doing this.\"   \n\"I know the weight loss was unintentional, but what if I put a little effort in? I wonder how low it could go?\"   \n\"I don't want to gain the weight back, so now I have to keep restricting to stay here.\"\n\nI'm not sure if you are experiencing any of these types of thoughts, but I just want to put it out there as something I have experienced, as well as many of my clients.\n\nFrom a nutrition science perspective - your body has an increased need for calories and protein during the healing process. Disordered eating effects the metabolism and in a period of restriction, the metabolism slows down to protect the vital organs/functions. This includes the heart, lungs, brain, and central nervous system. When the body is in preservation mode (as in restricting, fight or flight mode, in the face of real or perceived danger), less energy is directed to the digestive system, reproductive system, and extremities. Your body has an increased need for nutrients during the healing process AND being in a state of malnourishment will actively take the nutrients you are receiving away from your leg healing. \n\nYou could talk to your doctor about potentially adding a low dose of or switching to Remeron (mirtazapine) which helps with anxiety but also improves appetite. This could be a viable option for short-term until you get back in a stable place with your appetite and recovery.\n\nIn the short-term, here are some tips to improve your appetite/nutritional status:\n\n\\- The taste of sweetness can stimulate appetite. If you are struggling to enjoy savory foods, eat something sweet! It's okay if the only thing that seems appealing is ice cream. Your body needs nutrition and our minds are more judgmental about the foods we eat than our bodies are. You can also take bites of something sweet to stimulate appetite and then take bites of something savory to help get different types of nutrients in.\n\n\\- Lemon/citrus can stimulate the salivary glands, which sends a message to your digestive system that it is time to eat. Smelling or tasting lemon, or even sucking on a lemon candy can help stimulate salivation before a meal and improve ability to eat.\n\n\\- If you are having a hard time with volume of food, try to sip water at meals to save space for the nutrient dense food. Stay hydrated outside of meal times, but save space at meals for food.\n\n\\- Drink nutrient dense beverages! If food is hard, then drink juice, chocolate milk, Boost/Ensure/Orgain, smoothies, milkshakes, or anything else that you can get down.\n\nYou can do this. Just the fact that you are reaching out and asking for help means there is a part of you that wants to take these steps in recovery. The word \"re\" means \"back\" or \"again\". You are just going back to cover your steps again, which widens your foundation for the future.\n\nLots of luck and easy eating to you!",
