  "selftext": "The pandemic has not been kind to me. When it started I had reached a number I had never seen on the scale before (which wasn\u2019t even that bad, in retrospect). I decided to use my extra free time to start counting calories obsessively, working out, etc. and dropped to an unhealthy number on the scale and still thought I needed to lose more.\n\nSuffice it to say, that was not sustainable and while I\u2019ve refused to step on the scales for weeks now (I don\u2019t think I could handle it) I know I\u2019ve reached my starting weight, if not more. While I\u2019m still not \u201chappy,\u201d one thing I\u2019ve noticed is that I can eat a big meal and I don\u2019t get a \u201cpregnancy belly\u201d since I\u2019m not just skin and bones anymore. It\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been appreciating and wonder if anyone else has noticed the same thing.\n\nAnyways I hope the pandemic has been kinder to you, the mental struggle is way harder than I anticipated.",

But I started binging the first few weeks of quarantine and then I weighed myself. I was the heaviest I have ever been in my life. I then stopped eating normally and insanely calorie counted and restricted - finally back on track again though :) Hope you\u2019re well!!!!",

      "body": "Yep. I ate relatively healthy pre-pandemic and felt good. Then the stress and isolation triggered binging and lethargy. I gained quite a bit and now all my clothes are tight. \n\nThat then triggered obsessive weighing and restricting/binge cycles. I\u2019m a mess right now, but I\u2019m taking steps to get back to a healthy place. I know I\u2019m going to struggle now to not spiral into orthorexic behaviors. The struggle is real.",
