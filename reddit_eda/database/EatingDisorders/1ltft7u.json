  "selftext": "There is no universally accepted meaning of what \u201cclean\u201d eating or \u201cclean\u201d food means. Ask people what they believe it means and you\u2019ll get several different, conflicting answers. \u201cIt means no seed oils.\u201d \u201cIt means no dairy.\u201d \u201cIt means no meat.\u201d \u201cIt means only organic.\u201d \u201cIt means no sugar.\u201d \u201cIt means gluten free.\u201d \u201cIt means no fat.\u201d \u201cIt means no grains.\u201d \n\nIt relates to \u201cpure\u201d which also doesn\u2019t have any real meaning when it comes to food. And what\u2019s the opposite of clean? \u201cDirty\u201d! The media insinuates people who don\u2019t eat \u201cclean\u201d whatever TF that is supposed to mean, are eating \u201cdirty\u201d or are \u201cdirty/unkempt/disgusting\u201d themselves which is FALSE\n\nI wanted to post this because I found the language can be very sneaky and get into our heads and cause or contribute to disordered eating. I now hate this phrase. Beware when you see it. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS \u201cCLEAN EATING!\u201d",
