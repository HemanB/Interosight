  "selftext": "My friend has anorexia and avoids eating and eating in front of people. I thought maybe it would be nice to offer her to eat together sometime, on the sole condition that she eats how much she wants and nothing more. If that means she won't even eat a grape for the first 26 times we eat together, that's completely fine. I'm okay with it. It's a process. But I hope that seeing me eat and being positive and understanding about her eating habits will teach her to eat with others and to eat something in general.\nBut I don't have an ED and I have no clue how they work, so if this seems like a bad idea, then I won't do it. I would NEVER force her to eat, end of story. But I guess I wanted to ask the sub if the people here would like it if a friend reached out to them pitching this plan.",

That everybody would understand if I say \"Hey I could have a smoothie.\" The one thing triggering me tho is when I actually say that I want to eat something on the go and my friends say they dont want to.

If you two are really close friends, which I\u2019m presuming you are, it will be a lot easier because she might feel more comfortable with you.\n\nThe first thing you need to do is ask her first, but try not to make it about her eating disorder as much as possible (we\u2019re already thinking about our eating disorder behaviors all the time and having it brought up by a friend can be worse). Say something like \u201cThere\u2019s a few restaurants I wanted to go to. Would you want to come with me? If you don\u2019t it\u2019s ok too.\u201d That way she won\u2019t feel like she\u2019s being controlled and will feel like it\u2019s her decision.\n\nIf she says yes it might be a good idea to suggest a few options of where or what to eat and have her pick from those (if she feels comfortable with that).\n\nWhen ordering or getting food it\u2019s important to not make any comments about the food, like \u201cThis tastes delicious\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m full\u201d. It also might be helpful to order/make something for yourself that might be more of a challenge food for someone with an Eating Disorder (ex: order a burger instead of a salad). That way it might make her more comfortable in ordering something, knowing that you\u2019re comfortable ordering something bigger. Also make sure that you clear your plate or eat most of your food. It can be triggering to see that the person you\u2019re with only ate a couple of bites (We are CONSTANTLY comparing). \n\nI hope you found some of these tips helpful and just try to not beat yourself up about it if she isn\u2019t comfortable with eating with you quite yet.

Coming from someone with an ED who\u2019s working on recovery, having someone there eating with me and showing me that it\u2019s okay would\u2019ve helped me to rationalize what food is and what it means. I would stay away from trying to make it about her anorexia though, that might end up pushing her thoughts in the opposite direction if it comes off as \u201cso-and-so and I are doing this together just to get me better\u201d and it\u2019d be a chore rather than a friend being there to support her. Give it a shot, but just try to be really relaxed and chill about it. Also try to not catch her off guard because she might close you off from her problems if her defensive mindset takes over. Good luck with your friend, I hope my advice made sense and let me know if you want me to expand on anything",

I wanna show her that it's okay to eat and if I talk about it like it's a whole achievement I feel like it will be like a chore like you said. So we'll just have fun but with food there.",
