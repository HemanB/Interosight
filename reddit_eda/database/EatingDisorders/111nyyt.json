Honestly, I'm not the best person for advice but it always helps for me to mix in healthy stuff with other stuff like chocolate protein bars, veggies with my chicken or balancing meals like usually my lunch is healthy while my dinner is not. Obviously this isn't a complete change but it's a good building base for me at least (I won't lie though I'm still really bad with it but I try).",

It sounds like maybe you are glorifying certain foods too much, and likewise, demonizing others, which is making you want the foods you deem unhealthy, and not want the ones you deem healthy. Actual health is not all or nothing. \n\nThe healthiest relationship you can have with food will likely involve eating some salad, some chocolate, some pizza, and some apples, but in some seasons of life, the ratio processed food may be different than others for a variety of reasons. Health happens over time. Not in one day.",
