  "selftext": "My wife has had an ED since she was 13.\n\nWe\u2019ve had a hard road with it, but she\u2019s resisted a intensive treatment. We tried very hard for years to \u201cdo it ourselves\u201d, but at best had moderate success, usually temporary.\n\nShe finally kind of hit rock bottom, and agreed to go into an inpatient program about 3 weeks ago. She\u2019s been taking it incredibly seriously, and is working harder on this than she has on anything else I\u2019ve seen her do. She looks, sounds, and feels alive for the first time in a long time.\n\nIt\u2019s lonely, but we have visiting hours about 4 days a week. The program is lovely, and provides great support.\n\nTangentially, we closed on a house at the same time, and so she\u2019s excited to not have to move, but also, I\u2019m excited she gets a clean break and a new start. The night before being admitted was the last time she will ever be in the old place.\n\nShe\u2019s described her ED as almost its own entity, and kind of like a voice in her head. For years \u201cit was [her] only friend.\u201d I\u2019ve told her this is a demon, it will say anything to kill her. Today she gets her first pass and will see the new place all moved into. We are going to sage the house; we are going to exorcise that motherfucker.\n\nI just wanted to share something happy.",

Would you mind sharing a bit more (in a PM is fine if you\u2019re more comfortable) about how and why she realized inpatient was inevitable?  \n\nI truly can\u2019t help but wonder if a more intensive (if not impatient) program is in my future, seeing how incredibly long I\u2019ve struggled and battled and just had a horrendous time with ED and disordered eating/thinking, and it would help to hear another person\u2019s story about what ultimately led them to seek more help.",
