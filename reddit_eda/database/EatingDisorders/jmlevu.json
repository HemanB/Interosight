  "selftext": "  \n\nTW: Suicide and Self Harm.\n\nOver the past month and a bit, I moved to university and began to lose my appetite as well as seeing a degradation to my mental health. There was one night where I binged a whole bunch of snacks and then felt an urge to throw it all up, which I resisted. Recently, my suicidal thoughts have become overwhelming and I've started starving myself as well as not taking the medicine that prevents me from bleeding out when I menstruate. I'm anaemic due to my period which means I don't feel hungry unless it's really bad, and I want to punish myself by starving myself and getting closer to death. If I use starvation as self harm, does this mean I have an eating disorder?",

Using food/lack of food to control/punish is a waterfall of red flags, normal folks don't do that. You're going to want to take this post to a therapist and let them guide yo through whether or not this is ED or something else, and how to approach coming back from it. \n\nAnd remember, if this does turn out to be ED, you're not somehow failing. Or morally wrong. Or gross or weak or stupid, you're sick. Being sick happens, and you'll get better with the right care,  but you've gotta find a doctor to help get that care. Good luck.",

      "body": "Like the other user said, no one here can diagnose you but eating disorders are more or less defined as using harmful behaviors around food and having abnormal habits with food. I can\u2019t say you have an eating disorder but starvation and other bad behaviors as self harm can be classified (by a professional) as eating disorder behavior. But I cannot say that you have an eating disorder. Please, please, please seal help though. It\u2019s best to get help early on rather than later because things can get even more ugly really quick. No one wants to see another life be wasted away to an eating disorder. It sucks.",

Some people\u2019s eating disorders are due to self harm, looks, control, etc. \n\nThe only difference is that if your #1 problem is self harm, focusing on treating that (instead of focusing on recovering from your eating disorder) might be the most helpful thing you can do. (Also it sounds like it is, and it\u2019s really dangerous. Please please get help!!!)",

      "body": "It could. I kind of switched off between various ED behaviors and self harm (cutting) so sometimes they would fill the same void of wanting control and to punish myself but other times my ED was about feeling accomplished via weight loss. I\u2019ll say for me bingeing and purging filled a very similar void to self harm most of the time. They can overlap but I think only a psychiatrist could make the final call after a lengthy discussion about your feelings and reasons for different behaviors.",
