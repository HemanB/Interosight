  "selftext": "I have been bulimic/anorexic for 12 years, and the past 24 hours have been the most \"purge and restrict free\" day I have experienced since I was 14. A personal victory for me but I wanted to thank you guys. A user encouraged that I start attending ED Anonymous meetings and they have really helped pave the way for my recovery. It never too late to ask for help. \n",
