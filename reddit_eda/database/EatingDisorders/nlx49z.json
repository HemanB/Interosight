  "selftext": "Hi, i\u2019m a 17yr old female, and i\u2019ve been struggling with disordered eating for as long as i can remember. In the last year or so i\u2019ve developed full blown anorexia. \ntoday my mom asked if i wanted to go get a slurpee from 7-eleven, and i agreed happily. \nshe asked me what size i wanted and i said \u201clarge\u201d. she looked at me and said \u201cseriously? Do you really need all of that?\u201d.\nthis crushed me, when i got home i ended up pouring the drink down the sink.\nmy mom and dad constantly say those kinds of comments to me and my brother (we are both extremely under weight right now). \nfor reference both my parents are overweight and have continually warned us about gaining weight. ( they don\u2019t know that i have an ED as i try and hide it)\nI HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO DEAL WITH MY PARENTS. please if u have experienced something similar, share you advice/story with me.",

      "body": "first of all, are you ok right now? that must be so hard. maybe your mother didn't have any malicious intent behind her words, but still, it hurts to hear things like that from your very own parents. there shouldn't be anything wrong with getting a slurpee, if a person wants one they get one, end of story :( i've been through something similar as well w my parents through recovery, but i've figured out ways to get over it. the best way to get yourself over that hurdle is to first understand. to assess the situation as it is. for example, when my mother would make a rather triggering comment, i would think, 'oh, this sounds pretty triggering. but it wasn't meant to trigger me, was it? it was hardly directed towards me, and her making that comment probably resulted from her own lifestyle and her own problems. my mom would have absolutely no problem if i ate this (insert food) right now. which means i have no reason to mull on this conversation any longer.' \n\nsometimes, my sister would be even more triggering that my parents. we both suffered from the same ED for quite a while. it was pretty hard to recover when a person i saw every day showed the very disordered habits i was trying to overcome. but then i realized that her eating habits, or anyone else's eating habits for that matter, didn't have to affect mine. maybe she would make her recovery later, but i wanted to make my recovery as soon as possible, since i had the knowledge and will to do so, and because i missed the life before ED so much. and maybe, after i make a successful recovery, i could be there for my sister when she makes her own recovery. there was no way that she would directly tell me to stop my recovery. because she too, deep inside, would know that her current habits are wrong, and that i was facing those fears and making a constant effort to get out of that dark hole. \n\nsee, what helped me most was belief in myself. don't let yourself be swayed by those around you. you're strong, you're in charge. you can, and you will.",

      "body": "Yes! Please tell them. If you can\u2019t figure out how to,  talk to you pediatrician and have the Doctor help you start that conversation. There is a learning curve to understand eating disorders... you can\u2019t start that process until you start it! Give it a chance to start. Give your parents time to begin that process. You need help and they will too. The upside is a normal healthy life, happiness, not having to struggle daily and hide things from those you love! It\u2019s not an easy journey. It will have ups and downs, but it has to start somewhere! Please get help telling them! You are not alone! If communication with your parents is hard, give them time...eventually you will probably find that this will get way better than you might think it will. Remember ED is a disease and it\u2019s one you are in together. It is the disease, not a blame game, though others actions and words can affect you. You need to be able to talk about it.",

My mother always comments on my weight, what I eat, and how much I eat. She\u2019s always directly and indirectly called me fat, and in ways she\u2019s encouraged my ED. Dealing with parents like that is probably the worst thing in the world, and I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with it. \n\nAs for the advice portion of this comment, have you tried journaling about it? Writing about how you\u2019re feeling and how it affects you might help. Even if it\u2019s just word vomit on the page, and it makes no sense, it helps to get it out. \nTalking to others is also a great way to deal with things like this, and my personal DMS are open if you ever need someone to talk to! \n\nI hope this helps at least a bit.",

      "body": "This is a great insight. My mom had no idea that what she said was hurtful to me and just needed it to be pointed out. My dad said kinda shitty things which idk how he didn\u2019t know were hurtful, but it could\u2019ve been how he was treated as a child or a \u2018tough love\u2019 approach. Sometimes it was \u2018joking.\u2019 But it really messed with me. One day I finally stood up for myself and said something to the effect of \u201cplease don\u2019t comment on what I\u2019m eating. You might think it\u2019s helpful or funny but it\u2019s actually hurtful and makes things worse.\u201d He replied kind of jokingly, \u201cpeople will always comment on what your eating wherever you are\u201d to which I replied, \u201cI disagree, and even if that were true, I\u2019m asking you not to and you are now one person who is aware and can choose to respect it.\u201d He has never commented about what I\u2019m eating since then, and I\u2019ve even eaten challenge foods/things he used to comment on with him. It was a spur of the moment comment on my part (fueled by knowledge I gained in treatment/therapy) but it was one of the best things I did. I did it in a calm, logical way and I think that did the trick. I didn\u2019t go to treatment/say this until I was 27-28. If anyone else isn\u2019t comfortable saying like this, please don\u2019t feel like you have to. I just wanted to share this and how liberated I feel since. \n\nOP I hope that you are able to get the support you need and deserve \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95",
