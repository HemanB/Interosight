  "selftext": "It\u2019s been a few months since I noticed Ed behaviour coming back. \nTbh I didn\u2019t do anything to stop them, I miss having one. \nA part of me doesn\u2019t wanna go back but the other side just wants to be sick. \nMy partner is very supportive, he\u2019s always remind me to eat and gets worried when I don\u2019t. \nBut I feel lonely in this I don\u2019t wanna tell him everything first because I don\u2019t want him to worry all the time about me and second I cannot tell him all of it, if that makes sense. \nIs there anyone who is going through the same?",

What helped for me was asking myself why do I feel the need to relapse, as we all know, eating disorders aren\u2019t actually about our bodies, for me I wanted to relapse because I felt the need to be acknowledged as pretty, to be seen so I started digging into that, especially why I think thin=pretty, cause that isn\u2019t true and a lot of my body image problems come from the standard we live around, but I don\u2019t have to hold up to this standard. + I took a piece of paper and wrote down the good things from when I used to be severely disordered and the bad things. Having to remember the lies, the stolen food, puking, constantly weighting myself, the self hatred, the fear of people looking at me because my body dysmorphia made me think I was hideous, the lethargy, the times I couldn\u2019t get out of bed, no energy, obsession, having no personality, interests or hobbies beside my ed really woke me up and made me realize that I, in fact, don\u2019t miss my eating disorder and I should work on myself instead of allowing to lose myself again.

But the monster inside my head still tells me that I can\u2019t tell anyone bc it\u2019s shameful and disgusting and embarrassing and I believe it. I\u2019ve been stable and steady since April but last week I \u201crelapsed\u201d or whatever you call it. And then all week I\u2019ve been off. And today I relapsed again with bf no where near home so he won\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve been lying and saying I\u2019m fine bc I feel ashamed to give someone else my problems to deal with I guess? And now I feel like I\u2019m pushing him away.",
