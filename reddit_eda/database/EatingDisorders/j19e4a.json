  "selftext": "Hey, \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I have been together for over 3 years and plan to get married in December. Since the beginning, I was aware that she struggled on and off with restricting and it has been something she has sought treatment for in the past. I\u2019d say it\u2019s mild, and during the beginning of quarantine she was doing great and got to a healthy weight. I made it a point to compliment her body during this time as her 0 size clothes started not fitting, but she seemed pleased with her progress overall. \n\nI\u2019ve noticed that she has recently relapsed and is restricting more and more. It kills me and I know it\u2019s wearing on her but it has never been something she is super open about - she just says it matter of factly that she struggles. I love her more than anything in the world and would truly appreciate any advice on how I can best support her and partner with her to get her back to a good place. Thanks in advance.",

The more you highlight other areas of her life that she is successful in, the less pressure and focus she will have on her body and eating. \nInvite her to learn something new with you.. maybe you\u2019ve both wanted to learn a language or how to be more crafty? Sign up for a class or use an app.",

      "body": "Try cooking together.  Knowing what she's eating mat help. And ask if she thinks a food log will help. It may help to keep her accountable. But you need to be careful with that bc it may cause her to spiral worse. Also if you have a scale in the home see how she feels about removing it. Really she is obsessing over the numbers on the scale or calories so try giving her something to keep her occupied. And focus on a healthy food relationship. Not guilt",
