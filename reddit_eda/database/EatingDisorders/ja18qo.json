  "selftext": "So today I ate lunch! Okay so I never eat so this to me makes me so happy because i didn\u2019t feel guilty and even tho I ate so much more than a normal person would...I\u2019m still happy that I don\u2019t feel guilty for it. At first I was hesitant and I was having a mental breakdown because I didn\u2019t want to eat and i felt terrified to even try and recover. However after I stopped crying i decided to just go for it and eat and I did so I\u2019m not planning on purging. I just will try today to recover. I also decided to not weigh myself today because i know if i do it will make me regret everything i ate and it will make me depressed so I just won\u2019t weigh myself.",

      "body": "Yay!! I have this similar significant memory of when my family went skating. My grandpa gave us kids money to spend on anything from the concession and I went and bought a box of Smarties (Canadian/British candy that are like m&ms. I love them. I just have so many awesome childhood memories associated with them... This included). \n\nI ate the box and I was so proud and happy. I hadn't felt any emotion in months, and it was just the first time I felt happy. I showed everyone my empty box and my family was so happy and proud of me. It was so nice that I was offered that money with no one expecting anything from me or begging me to spend it. It was just my idea and I went for it and it was so lovely. I don't remember feeling anxious about it whatsoever. Just so happy. I didn't think about it or agonize at all and stop myself. Happy memory. \n\nI can't remember where that memory falls in the timeline of my recovery. I don't think for me, it started my recovery. I think it was more of a one-off moment where it was like my anorexia just disappeared for some reason. In any case, I proved to myself that food could be a happy thing again and not a terrifying thing like it had been for so long.\n\nGood luck!",
