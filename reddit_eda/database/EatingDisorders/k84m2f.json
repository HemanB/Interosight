  "selftext": "Please tell me about your ED story and what damage you inflicted on your body.\n\nSo many people continue their disordered eating habits because we usually see the weight loss and body shape changes long before we experience any symptoms of the serious damage we\u2019ve caused. The immediate pay off seems to overshadow the long term issues we\u2019re warned about. I know for me, I didn\u2019t see anything bad happening and being so young I couldn\u2019t even comprehend fully what it meant to be creating *eventual* damage.\n\nSo please, share your story and what it all did to your body. If I had seen enough genuine testaments to why I shouldn\u2019t starve myself I may have never started in the first place. We can\u2019t turn back time, but we can educate those struggling with the same demons we once were.",

      "body": "a lot of the damage was in the immediate; lanugo was the worst and i felt like an absolute monster.   \n\n\ni think the longer effects were; no gag reflex. it ceased to exist, i couldn't b/p anymore and couldn't stop myself for years throwing up at random intervals, or i'd be eating food and suddenly it would all come up in front of my family or friends. it took years to right this but it was so embarrassing and humiliating.  \n\n\ni get heartburn and acid reflex really badly still and my metabolism is totally ruined, it's stressful and emotionally draining to still even in recovery have to be conscious of what you eat because your body can't process it properly. \n\ndamage to my teeth; i have pretty much no enamel left even though i always have and still brush like mad, they're so sensitive and when it's cold i get shooting pains, i've had them whitened once already because of the garish colour they turned from all the stomach acid. you don't know how important your smile is to you until you can't smile anymore.   \n\n\nbones; they're so fragile now, even though i've recovered i'm frightened if i fall i'll crack something. my joints would click and sometimes it hurt to get out of bed in the morning, i had to rub ointment and cream on my legs and arms because it just hurt so badly, and in the cold it actually made me ache and slowed me down to a snail pace.   \n\n\nheart; i never had heart problems, but i pushed my cardiovascular system to the absolute limit and i'm shocked i didn't get heart failure from the sheer stress i was putting on myself, but heart palpitations did become quite frequent for a long time and i never knew if it would become something more sinister without me knowing. a friend of mine actually went into cardiac arrest due to how low her weight was.  \n\n\nreproduction; my periods stopped and they've never ever been normal since, but this was during my time with bulimia, and now when i get periods they're either a day of spotting or 10 days of full blown cramping, lift doors opening in the shining, vomiting episodes. i couldn't have children for a long time and i'm one of the very lucky ones who's weight gain returned their fertility and it's not something i'd change for the world now. i didn't know i wanted children until i realized i couldn't.   \n\n\ni lost my eyesight at one point whenever i got up, i'd stumble around until it came back or cry until my father came into the room. i was eighteen and unable to get out of bed without falling over.   \n\n\nmy legs and arms tingle all the time even now, they go dead in a few seconds and take forever to wake up. you WILL have to put on weight at some point unless you're intent on dying that way and my god the stretch marks. i've always had matchstick legs and believe me - they aren't immune despite being small. when you care so deeply about your appearance - the damage you're going to be doing it to the future is definitely important imo. \n\nlaxative and diuretic abuse ruined my bodily functions for a long time and it can seriously inflame your colon so you can't even go to the toilet without assistance, and the damage can continue from there. \n\nmy voice breaks all the time because of the damage i did to my throat, i go from sounding high pitched and sweet to scratchy and like i smoke a twenty deck a day, it's humiliating and upsetting and brings me to tears from time to time. \n\nrashes; i had rashes so badly, i still get them now if i don't eat enough and have to powder myself with make up and hope no one notices. \n\ni don't think i'll ever be comfortable looking in the mirror, and i wish someone had told me this when it first started so i could get help. it went on for so long, undetected, and now it's permanently skewed my vision of myself. i won't ever be satisfied, i can't be satisfied. whether big or thin, normal or underweight - nothing is good enough for me. i hope one day it will be but i'm still waiting for that one to happen. \n\ni'm now insulin resistant, meaning i can't eat carbs (not diabetic, i try really hard to not let it get to that stage), else i might develop type 2 diabetes.  \n\n\ni'm still anaemic after over ten years. i bruise like mad, i'm scared if someone touches me i'll bruise, i usually come out in awful purple bruises too and you can't even hide them. \n\nand i'm also short because i denied my body the nutrients it needed to let me grow. \n\nthose are just the physical things, the mental damage i did to myself is something else all together. i won't go into detail because i can't really bring myself to do it, but years of my life have been spent in therapy, on medication, sick time off work, horrible scars, impulsive and stupid behaviour, drug taking, terrible family relationships, really rocky and turbulent relationships (you're vulnerable. bad people know this.)",

Something that had never even ocurred to me and I feel like a lot of people dont know is that repeated vomiting is actually quite heavy on your back. So apparently 10 years of hunching over a toilet mixed with some bad luck/genetics can cause you to have 2 herniated discs at the age of 20 (which is when I first started experiencing the pain). Sometimes its better, but other times when theres been some strain on my back I can hardly sleep from the pain because I cant even get in a comfortable position and my legs feel like they're sleeping all the time. I know there's probably a lot worse that can come from ed's but I thought I'd share a bit of an \"unusual\" one or one that people dont commonly think of.",

      "body": "I had EDNOS for about six years and anorexia for one. TW >!I wasn\u2019t even very underweight clinically- everyone told me I looked great, not sick!< and they were confused as to why I had a diagnosis... until I showed them my labs. \n\nKeep in mind I\u2019m 21. My kidneys were failing, creatinine levels super high. Really bad iron deficient anemia, I couldn\u2019t even walk up a flight of stairs without taking a break. I went to the doctor after exercising because I started feeling chest pain and palpitations all the time and he said I could have gone into cardiac arrest. I had swelling in my legs because my kidneys couldn\u2019t filter the water and my circulation wasn\u2019t strong enough to pump all the blood against gravity. My hair was falling out, my eyes had constant dark circles under them. I was freezing all the time and for *seven months* after weight restoration, I had severe night sweats and hot flashes every single night because my metabolism was just so messed up and trying to regulate. My EKG showed how hard my heart was trying to work to keep me alive. I\u2019ve fainted in so many awful places: in the shower, at school, work, doctor\u2019s office, *almost* while driving on the freeway. I\u2019ve gotten mild concussions and cut my eye from fainting in inconvenient places. You can\u2019t plan it. And fainting isn\u2019t fun. My body shakes violently when I wake up and I\u2019m numb and I can\u2019t stop crying and it\u2019s really scary. \n\nI also have nearly constant UTIs (but that might be from my awful water drinking habits, which is connected to my ED) and the antibiotics cause yeast infections so it\u2019s a fun back and forth between the two. I was in a wheelchair for three months after being admitted to treatment, even though I didn\u2019t feel sick or thin enough in any way. \n\nSLIGHT NSFW >!My reproductive system had shut down. Unfortunately, that also meant no sex because I couldn\u2019t get lubricated. That was hard, I felt broken as a woman without my period but when it started up again during treatment, there was constant vaginal discharge from trying to catch up.!< I\u2019ve seen people with permanent infertility or *permanent* gastroparesis (paralyzed stomach). My best friend went into cardiac arrest and was barely resuscitated in time, she\u2019s also had seizures from her ED. \n\nMentally? It was *all I could think or talk about.* I didn\u2019t have a real relationship with my now-husband and that got me into recovery. Everything I thought about lead back to the eating disorder. I couldn\u2019t study or have any hobbies. *I did not have friends.* None. My whole life was my eating disorder, with my boyfriend on the side. Looking back at last year, even in treatment, everything was a blur because my brain wasn\u2019t working properly. I don\u2019t remember so much of what happened because my memory is so bad. My husband (bf at the time) had to hold his arms out *every time* I stood up because I would fall so often. I slept under 6 blankets and still wasn\u2019t warm. I slept all day. I\u2019d come home from work and school and just sleep in my free time, not study or have fun or do anything. \n\nWhat my husband says about my eating disorder days: hair was falling out, kidneys and heart were failing, bags under my eyes, almost passed out every time I stood up, sleeping all the time, my irritability (I was grumpy all the time), it was all I could think about, I had no friends. That\u2019s what he took away from this and it was really hard on him, especially trying to keep me alive when my doctor told him I could die. \n\nI know I\u2019m not unique and I don\u2019t even feel like I was ever sick. Like \u201cI could go back and do it again but safely and not have all the bad things happen\u201d. But that\u2019s not true, there is no \u201ccareful\u201d with eating disorders. It\u2019s a slippery slope you have no control over. I really really hope you can get the support you need from this, because you deserve it and I don\u2019t want anyone to go through the hell of an eating disorder.",

I relapsed for less than a year this time around and caused that much damage. I have also had abnormal liver enzymes after restarting recovery and have low bone density. Meanwhile, I was on the border of UW and normal, maintained a menstrual cycle the whole time, had some chest pain but it wasn't super concerning, and had normal electrolytes.

      "body": "I had anorexia as a child, but I was caught pretty early (my parents had me seeing a doctor after a few months, and they really figured out what was up after about 8 months and I was hospitalized after being really unwell for about 9 months.)\n\nI want to comment the damage that I had because there was damage even after less than a year of ED. For me though, it was all reversed. I don't comment that because I want people to think it's no big deal, but to add to what everyone else is saying about wishing they had stopped much, much sooner before things became permanent.\n\nFor me, the biggest thing was stunted growth. I have a twin sister who was easily a foot taller than me at my worst. After many years of eating enough, I slowly caught up and we are now (15 years later) close to the same height (I am maybe only an inch or two shorter now). \n\nI also had a delayed period. I didn't start until grade 11 of high school, but that was already 6 years into recovery and so when it came, it was pretty normal. \n\nI had a bone density test and I had a few different scans and ultrasounds and such (I don't know for sure), and they were all okay. If I remember right, I was headed down a bad path, but I stopped in time.\n\nOtherwise, I had some hair loss, and a very hairy body that also reversed themselves. I also had problems with dizziness and blacking out and that has gone away now. \n\nFood focus was a huge thing for many years. I couldn't stand not eating or being slightly hungry. It made me feel crazy. That went away after a few years.\n\nI add this comment to say, don't lose hope and think, meh, it's too late anyway, might as well keep going. Sometimes these things can be reversed if you stop early enough, and with persistent, patient effort. It took me many years to feel normal, but for me, that was possible. \n\nI'm very sorry to those who have had permanent damage and I wish you well <3",

I think the most damage to me was my mental health, and although it\u2019s not as tangible as physical health, it\u2019s so real as everyone here knows. The unhealthy mental state I was in has continued to mess with me long after I\u2019m considered healthy physically. I\u2019ve also lost my twenties, as I wasn\u2019t dating or hanging out with friends or making experiences because I was too obsessed and fearful of food. I started my marriage off on a shaky foundation, I have more regrets than happy memories, and I have a lot of broken or rough relationships. My career sucks because I was unable to pursue anything with confidence and lacked focus on much else besides food and exercising. Even though I have learned a lot and become a smarter person in some ways because I have this extra challenge as a part of me, I would trade all I have gained from recovery to have never had an eating disorder. It took so much from my life and it will continue to be a challenge because I let it stay for far too long. It\u2019s so not worth it...make healthy decisions for your future self.

I\u2019ve been on/off (mostly off) but recently I feel like I got worse.\n\nI know I\u2019m kind of late to this but I think I might\u2019ve done damage to my digestive system. I\u2019ve been using laxatives on/off from Octoberish 2018 to this past June 2020 (so like a year and a half). I relapsed this time last year (December 2019-February 2020) and lost some weight but was still in the \u201cnormal\u201d range for my height. I also started purging more too during this time. \n\nI  somewhat \u201crecovered\u201d around when Covid started in March, but only because my sister who was roommates with me at the time wanted to go to the cafeteria and I felt bad about her going by herself across campus to the only one that decided to stay open. I ate only breakfast and dinner, but still used laxatives and puked after breakfast when my sister and I got back to the dorm. I waited for her to go to the library to do it. My sister and I had our own rooms but shared the common area and bathroom. \n\nAt the end of June I stopped using the laxatives only because the bottom of my legs and hands got tingly and I started feeling weird (idk how to describe it). \n\nIn July I started getting hemorrhoids (or that\u2019s what the doctors think but I\u2019m paranoid it\u2019s something else). I get bright red blood on the toilet paper and they gave me some cream. It did help for a while but it started coming back again like last week. Between then and now, id have light bleeding but nothing big I guess. Last week my lower left side of abdomen started hurting when I poop too. \n\nI had jaw surgery for my underbite on Friday and I haven\u2019t pooped since Thursday. Ever since June I\u2019ve been using probiotics and in October I started using the psyllium husk in my smoothies that my parents have but I stopped using the husk. I haven\u2019t pooped since Thursday like I said and idk if it\u2019s because of my surgery or what. But I\u2019m paranoid that I permanently damaged my digestive system and might need those pouch things to take my poop. I\u2019m also suspicious that I can\u2019t poop now w/o probiotics because I haven\u2019t taken those since Thursday either. \n\nI have a doctors appointment on Tuesday and I\u2019m gonna come clean and talk to her about this. I literally just told my mom earlier today about abusing laxatives for so long but I\u2019m not sure if she understood me because my jaw\u2019s still swollen from the surgery and I can\u2019t really talk",

I couldn't left home because I live at 4th floor and I couldn't walk up the stairs. Why? Because by throwing up multiplie times a week since I was 12 I have developed inflammation of my stomach and my gulp. It was bleeding repeatedly for years and led to huge blood loss. Normal hemoglobin level should be around 12-16 g/dl. My was 3,2.

      "body": "My experience was similar (although less severe but my purging took up maybe 4 years out of the 7 that my ED was most active) Purging wrecks way more than your throat. The sort of explosive act of forcing vomiting via gag reflex creates a lot of pressure and in your head and abdomen. I think my hemorrhoids now are from purging tbh. I used to strain muscles in my back all the time as well. \n\nAnd for OP, hemorrhoids don\u2019t ever go away completely without surgery. Not that they are the end of the world but they are really annoying. \n\nPurging also gave me chest pains for years even when I had stopped or rarely did it. I still get them sometimes. At least one of my teeth is visibly worn down from my hand going past it also. These things aren\u2019t that bad but I went to treatment twice and I know I was headed for much worse if I hadn\u2019t. BP and HR were totally messed up but I got help soon enough to reverse it fairly quickly. The sooner you get help the better chance you have of repairing damage.\n\nEdit: I added this as a comment on your post since it was related. This is mostly addressed to OP. So sorry about your back.",

Something that had never even ocurred to me and I feel like a lot of people dont know is that repeated vomiting is actually quite heavy on your back. So apparently 10 years of hunching over a toilet mixed with some bad luck/genetics can cause you to have 2 herniated discs at the age of 20 (which is when I first started experiencing the pain). Sometimes its better, but other times when theres been some strain on my back I can hardly sleep from the pain because I cant even get in a comfortable position and my legs feel like they're sleeping all the time. I know there's probably a lot worse that can come from ed's but I thought I'd share a bit of an \"unusual\" one or one that people dont commonly think of.",

I relapsed for less than a year this time around and caused that much damage. I have also had abnormal liver enzymes after restarting recovery and have low bone density.
