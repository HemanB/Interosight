I just wanted to lose a little weight.  I didn't plan to develop a full-blown ED and it sounds like you didn't either.  A lot of people fall into the trap of \"I can use these unhealthy behaviors just a little bit, or until I reach my goal weight\" and then end up not being able to stop.  It's way more common to happen that way than to just not be aware at all, so don't feel bad about that.\n\nAnd for what it's worth, for the longest time I thought my ED was only because of bad body image.  Only about my weight.  It wasn't until later when I realized that even though I started restricting because of body image, there was a lot going on underneath the surface that contributed to my ED too.  Control, trauma, etc.  I promise that there's something underneath the surface for you too, and you just haven't found it yet.  It might not be one of the conventional things but it's there.  So you aren't that different from the \"other ED sufferers\" after all.",

My eating disorder morphed into some weird disgusting love child of anorexia and bulimia and at the end of the day nobody shoved my fingers down my throat except myself, but that doesn\u2019t mean the struggle that I have with eating and myself is my fault. \nI\u2019m sure there is more to your eating disorder than just wanting to be skinny, whether it is some childhood trauma or other emotional barrier that you have learned to cope with by purging. Honestly, EDs are basically one giant fucked up coping mechanism. It\u2019s solving one problem while giving you a million other problems that are hugely life threatening. \ngotta love the ED life tho right :\u2019)",

Even once I knew it in my head it didn't stop me. That doesn't invalidate the disorder, because for many of us, that *is* the disorder. \n\nEDs are not cookie cutter. We are all in this together but the way we got here doesn't always align, and the ways that we feel better and get healthier are not going to match, either. Your ED is your own. You can take advice and listen to the experiences of the others, but you shouldn't write it off as \"well theirs was worse so mine can't be real\" or \"they went inpatient when I didn't, so I should be quiet\".

I remember thinking clearly \"What if I make myself throw up more? No one will know the difference and I can lose more weight.\" It was a very deliberate decision. But that decision was made on a foundation of: a lifetime of negative messaging about being slightly overweight, untreated dysphoria (I'm transmasculine), and usage of food to self-medicate depressive symptoms. I wouldn't have made that conscious decision without those factors.",

If I came across ED communities or posts or whatever that I could relate to at the time, I'd make up excuses as to why I'm \"not like them,\" or it's \"just that one thing,\" or the classic, \"well I'm not skinny so everything I do is justified.\" The first time I purged was on purpose and I was very aware it was \"a thing that bulimics do\" but again - I was so convinced that that wasn't me. Nope! It was just that one time - then it was just occasionally - then it was a few times per week. But I still did not feel like I had bulimia or disordered eating because \"it's not every day and I knew what I was doing and I genuinely need to lose weight.\"\n\nThe point is - some of us are really hyper-aware of our situations. Some of us aren't. And I think for those who aren't, a lot of it is steeped in denial and \"I feel fake because mine isn't as severe\" or \"mine started a completely different way,\" it is the way our brains try to distance ourselves from the reality.

But really I know that I couldn't stop, even if I tried. If I try to eat normally for a day, there's still that voice in the back of my head tallying the calories and a rising tide of anxiety that won't let me calm down until I write the calorie count down. Any attempt to release control of my intake makes me feel like I'm just spiralling out of control and if I blink, I'll open my eyes and find myself morbidly obese. Sure maybe a part of us chose/wanted this life, but I don't think that makes our disorders fake. I think just wanting/choosing it to begin with is disordered thinking. From the moment you think \"I don't care if it's fucked up, I just want to be skinny\" the disorder is already taking hold of you and eating away at your mental health. \n\nOur brains love to try to convince us that it's our fault, we're making all this up, it's all in our heads, Etc. If I eat more than 500 calories in a day I start thinking \"You don't have a disorder, you're fat. You don't have a disorder, you're just an extreme dieter with a victim complex. It's all your fault, and if you tell your family, they're just going to hate your for letting this happen. You did this to yourself, just grow up and eat like a regular fucking person.\" But it's hard to deny the disorder when so much hair comes off my head in the shower and I don't even care, or my vision goes fuzzy when I stand up quick and it feels like a victory. \n\nI think the traces of imposter syndrome and guilt are just another part of the disorder. Just another method the disorder uses to protect itself. Because if it's all fake or your fault, why even get help? If you chose this, why can't you just unchoose it? Eating disorders are more mental rather than physical for good reason. If the problem was just your intake, you could just start eating more. The physical symptoms are something you are tecnically in control of, the problems are the thoughts and feelings that drive your actions. The feels of \"wanting/choosing\" this are just part of the disorder, tricking you into thinking you're more in control of things than you really are. Really deep down no one wants to think/admit that they have a disorder. The thoughts are a protective measure to make you feel like you're still in control.",

          "body": "Same, I feel like I'm an imposter because part of me wants this. Sometimes it feels like I could stop any time I want to, I just don't want to. But really I know that I couldn't stop, even if I tried. If I try to eat normally for a day, there's still that voice in the back of my head tallying the calories and a rising tide of anxiety that won't let me calm down until I write the calorie count down. Any attempt to release control of my intake makes me feel like I'm just spiralling out of control and if I blink, I'll open my eyes and find myself morbidly obese. Sure maybe a part of us chose/wanted this life, but I don't think that makes our disorders fake. I think just wanting/choosing it to begin with is disordered thinking. From the moment you think \"I don't care if it's fucked up, I just want to be skinny\" the disorder is already taking hold of you and eating away at your mental health. \n\nOur brains love to try to convince us that it's our fault, we're making all this up, it's all in our heads, Etc. If I eat more than 500 calories in a day I start thinking \"You don't have a disorder, you're fat. You don't have a disorder, you're just an extreme dieter with a victim complex. It's all your fault, and if you tell your family, they're just going to hate your for letting this happen. You did this to yourself, just grow up and eat like a regular fucking person.\" But it's hard to deny the disorder when so much hair comes off my head in the shower and I don't even care, or my vision goes fuzzy when I stand up quick and it feels like a victory. \n\nI think the traces of imposter syndrome and guilt are just another part of the disorder. Just another method the disorder uses to protect itself. Because if it's all fake or your fault, why even get help? If you chose this, why can't you just unchoose it? Eating disorders are more mental rather than physical for good reason. If the problem was just your intake, you could just start eating more. The physical symptoms are something you are tecnically in control of, the problems are the thoughts and feelings that drive your actions. The feels of \"wanting/choosing\" this are just part of the disorder, tricking you into thinking you're more in control of things than you really are. Really deep down no one wants to think/admit that they have a disorder. The thoughts are a protective measure to make you feel like you're still in control.",

Also @OP I empathize with feeling like your eating disorder is fake, a very dangerous (and common) part of ED\u2019s in general is thinking they\u2019re fake because a lot of people let themselves do more dangerous behavior if they think their previous mindset was healthy.

          "body": "I mean... one thing to ask is, could someone who doesn't have disordered eating habits actually want to force themselves to throw up to be skinny? Would they commit these actions knowing it could become a life-threatening habit, if they were really doing okay?\n\nTo me, it makes the most sense to see everything as on a spectrum of some sort. I think the  desire to prioritize being skinny over basic needs in and of itself indicates a pattern of thought that reflects disordered eating. And of course, there's extremes on the other end.",

But then am I never gonna loose weight? And then one thing leads to another and all of a sudden I find myself back in the cycle of binging and restricting that I worked hard to get out of.",
