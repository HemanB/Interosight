  "selftext": "There is nothing about Thanksgiving i like. The food is meh, you're expected to try everything and you don't want to touch any of it. You have to be around family :/   I tried to pull the my babies need me card, but that got called out because my babies are in the NICU (twins). They were supposed to be home by now but they're just taking a little extra time.\n\nFirst family dinner i really only touched the cheese ball, and the second kinda the same but also the rolls. Everything else i just don't want. With how bad my food aversion is i only want to eat foods i like",

Last year I had it with my parents and grandfather and saw my sister and one nephew because they dropped off a pie. It was normally done at my grandmother's. I have a strict eating schedule and I'm also autistic so I don't like half the food on Thanksgiving and now I can't eat anything. I thought my grandmother understood my disabilities more, but this Thanksgiving my mom was upstairs and my dad was in the kitchen which left me with my grandmother on my mom's side and grandfather on my dad's. They were criticizing what I ate. They told me I needed to eat more calories because, at that time, I was eating my snack, which was popcorn, yogurt, and berries. I recently gained weight which wasn't good. They also said they didn't believe I got to be 185 pounds. Fuck off. I was and I developed an eating disorder. I had to lose 50 pounds, so I didn't get diabetes, and I did lose it. I think I'm going to listen to my dietician, PT, and myself over someone who eats like crap and criticizes their granddaughter. I asked her point blank if she understood chronic hypoglycemia as a medical condition. She said yes. She said oh but what's wrong with you could be your not taking a multivitamin. My mom came back downstairs and had my back but I was stuck listening to her and my grandfather talk down to me for five minutes. I thought our relationship was getting better, but nope. She fucked it all up. It's back to, oh, I've just been busy and ignoring her. It saddens me because of how much I miss my grandpa, who passed about five years ago, who I have no doubt would support me through anything. Two of my nephews were sick, so my sister and brother in law didn't come. My brother and sister in law and his kid spent it with her parents. They are who I get excited to see. My grandmother favors them. I'm the messed up sick child cry baby who still lives at home and can't work. She can fuck off. I have 11 medical conditions. I was in the hospital from a seizure on Sunday. She should be grateful I'm alive. I suppose I needed to get this all out....I semi feel better actually. I'm so excited for therapy Thursday. Sorry about your babies. It really freaking sucks how we're judged and supposed to just be okay and not feel anything on holidays especially ones that revolve around food. But fuck it.
