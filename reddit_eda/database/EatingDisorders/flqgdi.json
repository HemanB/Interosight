  "selftext": "At the moment, I\u2019m a little more than 1.5 years into recovery. But even though I\u2019ve been barely engaging in behaviours for the past couple of months, I\u2019m really tempted to relapse. I live with my family, and they\u2019re not very supportive of my recovery. They constantly criticize what I eat & talk about their diets, and it\u2019s really hard to hear. School is usually my escape but I\u2019m not going back for a LONG time because of covid. Any tips?",

Do you have the option to go out on walks/ride a bike around town if things get too intense at home? \n\nHow old are you? Would it be an option to go to someone else's place during self isolation? \n\nThis is a tough one and a sensitive matter for some but I did that (I'm in my 30ies though) because I just knew that I wouldn't be able to pull through all of this on my own without getting into a deep depression.

I don\u2019t know how old you are/if you can drive/etc? But I went to the store before the whole outbreak and bought myself a few things that I like to eat that are good for my recovery, like goldfish crackers and pita chips. If you\u2019re still able to get groceries away from them just go stock up a bit, even just once, if you can. My family all goes to \u201cboot camp\u201d and they eat low-carb and stuff like that, and it makes my ED flare up, or I crave carbs really badly and it makes me miserable, so I have a handful of goldfish and i feel a bit better. Try squirreling away things in your room, if you can- other than that, just avoid them mostly? Talk to supportive people and do something that can help keep you busy and your mind off them/food- I do a lot of hand sewing and embroidery during that time :)\n\nHope it gets better for you!",

      "body": "In addition to the other wonderful suggestions I see here, I wanted to mention the idea of setting boundaries.  If your parents aren't very supportive of your recovery it might be more challenging, but could still be worth a try.  You could say something like, \"it would be really helpful for me if you would stop commenting on my food choices and discussing diets in front of me.  I'm not asking you to stop dieting, but to please talk about it with each other when I'm not around.  Do you have things you'd like me to be more mindful of that would help you, such as doing additional chores, giving you space, etc?  I know this quarantining is hard for everyone and I think setting some respectful ground rules could help everyone.\" \n\nI've been doing this with my mom lately because she's big into diet talk and isn't always the most receptive when I try to set looser boundaries.  I like it because you're asking for what you need while also being open to hearing what your family needs, which I think could make them more willing to listen.  They might not be perfect but would hopefully be open to compromising and at least making an effort.",
