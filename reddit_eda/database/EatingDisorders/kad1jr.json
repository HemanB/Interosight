  "selftext": "My parents did a lot to try and help me but it wasn\u2019t doing much so after awhile I asked to see a psychiatrist. It\u2019s been less than a week since I\u2019ve met with my psychiatrist and my parents got mad at me because I wasn\u2019t improving even after everything they\u2019ve done. I told them I was trying  but they said I wasn\u2019t trying hard enough, I wasn\u2019t following the psychiatrist\u2019s advice, I kept skipping dinner, etc. For the past 3 days I\u2019ve been exercising for hours trying to burn off the calories I consumed from a binge just so I they\u2019d see me eat dinner. I feel like my binges have gotten much worse since now I know I\u2019m capable of burning a lot of calories if I exercise multiple times throughout the day. The problem is that sometimes, like right now, my body just can\u2019t take any more and I fall short on the calories burned. I only have 2 hours left until dinner and a lot more calories to burn but I\u2019m too tired to carry on.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to tell my parents. I feel like such a burden to them.",

      "body": "my parents were unsupportive and not understanding at the beginning of my recovery. however, i asked them to do research to understand what actually goes on in our heads and how hard recovery is and that made them understand a bit more. believe me when i say i recognize this and my heart hurts for you. you deserve to be taken seriously, but i will remind you that no matter how much or little they can see your small wins, i am so proud of you. any progress, big or small, is so good!! the small wins will turn into bigger ones in the future, i promise that it will get easier with time. but it does really take time, unfortunately. there is no quick fix which sucks, but man how much you will learn and grow during the process. \n\nand also, the binging might be a response to restriction or overexercise. i hope that you will find peace within yourself and know that your body will heal if you hold on. take one meal at a time, and try allowing yourself to rest. binging and compensating is a living hell, but as someone who has been there and is now almost fully recovered i can assure you that recovery is possible. it won\u2019t always be this way <3 i wish you love and luck. i believe in you!!",
