I already knew everything would be bad, and I didn\u2019t feel like looking at all the labels. I could already feel the stress...it honestly shut me down and I\u2019m still in a horrible mood. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do..",

These are my safe foods that keep my nourished and healthy with a good balance of all food groups, and I know which brands I like and can afford so I never need to look at a label. This is what works for me.\n\nAlso, hard rule that I don't buy ice cream when grocery shopping with other people because it is ALWAYS an ordeal of me pacing the freezer aisle trying to decide if I can buy ice cream and if so what kind. It takes forever, it's a thing I'm willing to do on my own if I want ice cream but I won't subject someone else to the madness.",

I know my diet might be lacking (though I'm a vegetarian anyway), but at least it helps me get SOMETHING in. For protein I like to get beans and sometimes an egg. Just stuff you can steam or boil (not using oil, cause thats one of my fears). This way I NEVER check any ingredients lists cause I literally eat stuff that has only one ingredient. Maybe this could help for you too",

      "body": "I get this feeling, especially considering how MUCH food you encounter in a grocery store. It can feel a bit like sensory overload. However, the notion that \u2018all the food is bad for you\u2019 is misguided\u2014food IS good for you, and the foods you categorize as \u2018bad\u2019 or \u2018unsafe\u2019 are considered normal to non-disordered eaters. Try this: eat what sounds good and is nutritious (fats, proteins, grains, veggies, fruits, sweets\u2014yes, candy chocolate all that) because food is meant to be enjoyed as well as used for fuel. DO NOT turn over onto the nutrition label and check fat content, ingredients, calories. Those of us in recovery aren\u2019t going on diets anytime soon because (a) diets are fads & statistically proven to be mostly ineffective in making a person \u2018healthier\u2019 and (b) losing weight is not the objective when choosing what to eat (unless this is agreed upon with a professional). You are not dirty or unclean or gluttonous for eating natural&artificial sugars, packaged food, or high calorie treats\u2014this will not make you unhealthy or throw you into a body you don\u2019t want. The eating disorder is enough torture for a life; try to be compassionate to yourself and stop looking at the labels.",
