  "title": "Request: Anorexia is ruining the relationship between me(26, F) and my sister(24, F)- any advice?",
  "selftext": "Hi firstly title says it all. In brief, I was hospitalised for anorexia a few years ago and after maybe 6-7 years would say I\u2019m pretty much recovered mentally and physically - it has taken a lot of strong will and I\u2019m proud of myself! \n\nI posted previously with a concern that my sister (very sporty, runner etc) was losing weight and I had noticed this and was concerned she may be developing some disordered eating habits. The responses were mainly saying that I was being hyper aware and overly obsessed with regards to eating habits (understandably) when in fact it could simply be a healthy weight loss. I accepted this may well be true and tried to ignore my concerns. \n\nFast forward another few months and my sister admits to struggling with eating via text to myself(and asks for help from me!) and she is now clearly underweight and starting to look ill. I feel vindicated by this after previous responses but in all honesty, I wish I had been being a bit psycho (!) and hoped nothing was up- sadly this isn\u2019t the case. \n\nI\u2019m mainly looking for any advice on how to deal with this... my parents are trying to book a family holiday in a few months- I have just seen my sister and there is no way I can spend any length of time around her without feeling angry and hugely triggered by the whole situation. I don\u2019t want to risk my own health when I am doing so well currently. I also don\u2019t want to speak my mind to my sister too much as I know when I was ill, I loved people noticing I was underweight (barmy I know but that was how this mental illness manifested itself in me and I\u2019m very wary of this. I don\u2019t want to bring attention to her weight too much if I can help it). Secondly, any advice on how to tell my parents a holiday is off the cards without breaking my sisters confidentiality? I love her dearly and do not know how to act around her/towards her to stop this lasting 6 years like it did with me. I\u2019m at a loss because I recognise there is nothing anyone could have said to prevent my decline all those years ago. I am unfortunately not going to see her until she is better and this may be many years and this saddens me...",

I would say try to talk to her as much as possible, but let her know that this may be triggering for you and maybe set some boundaries? E.g no mentions of weight or how much she has/hasn't eaten or how much she's exercised. Whatever may trigger you.\n\nThe fact that she has started talking to you is an absolutely great start, and I wish my sister was as open as yours. I would try and share experiences, and maybe say things that you wish people said to you when you were sick. Your past experiences, though very sad, may be vital in helping her recover. To me, there is nothing better than someone just understanding what you are going through.\n\nAs for the frustration, omg i cannot relate more. My mother (52F) is also showing ED symptoms, and it is so easy for us to get angry with each other accusing each other of eating less than the other. It is so much easier said than done but remember you were in her place once, and you may get angry, but you are angry at the anorexia, not her. Try to make that work in your favour maybe? You're saving her from something you have already been through.\n\nI wish you the very best, my DM's are always open",

      "body": "I have the same with a current best friend&house mate. I\u2019m in recovery (and seeing a therapist) whilst she is losing weight and saying things like \u201comg I\u2019m so full!!\u201d after only having like 2 bites of dinner. It\u2019s frustrating, I hate it, I\u2019ve had to leave the room before because of it. And we used to cook & eat together but I can\u2019t anymore because it\u2019s so triggering to eat like a whole bowl of pasta whilst she stops after a few bites. So basically I get what you\u2019re saying and you\u2019re totally valid. I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s gotten like this :/ \n\n My first advice is to take a step back and don\u2019t be involved in her recovery process. It sounds like you\u2019re already doing that, which is great. She can reach out (hopefully) to other friends for help and support, and you aren\u2019t in a place to help her because of your history and that\u2019s FINE. Her actions will make you feel worse etc etc so it\u2019s better just to stay out of it. You are not responsible for her recovery. I\u2019d suggest for her to go to a therapist, but only when she\u2019s ready to hear that of course. \n\n  I think the family holiday stuff is really tricky. Have you already said that you\u2019ll go? I think you can come up with an excuse for it, like saying that you wanted to use the summer to go travelling with other friends or something (but then you actually have to follow that through otherwise it looks suspicious). It\u2019s hard because you can tell your parents that you had a falling out or something, but then they will probably ask her about it. I think if you\u2019re planning on avoiding her until she\u2019s recovered anyway, then you can tell your sister that you don\u2019t want to go on holiday because it\u2019s triggering for you. And then maybe tell your parents a lighter version of the truth like \u201cwe had a fall out\u201d. But I\u2019d warn your sister that you\u2019ll tell them an excuse like that, so then she doesn\u2019t over react when she hears it from your parents. I know you said you don\u2019t want to bring any attention to her disorder because she might react positively, but if she sees that she\u2019s hurting someone dear to her( to the extent that you can\u2019t be around her), then she might think twice about what she\u2019s doing. We all know that this mental ill was destroys your life and your friendships and unfortunately this is just how it goes. It sounds harsh but we\u2019ve all been there. \n\n  The truth hurts but sometimes it\u2019s the only way to do it :( but I totally understand why you don\u2019t want to go on that holiday. And you shouldn\u2019t if it will be really detrimental to you.\n\nEdit: I don\u2019t know how your parents are, if they are the supportive type or not, but if I had a child and they went through an eating disorder then I would want to know. It would kill me to think that my daughter was struggling and I had no idea. I\u2019d also encourage them to talk about it, but yeah, only if it doesn\u2019t make things worse.",
