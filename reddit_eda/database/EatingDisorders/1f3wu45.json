I would binge 10k+calories then starve myself and restrict like crazy. \n\nI\u2019m now at the point with a mix of therapy as well as medication (I was diagnosed with adhd and BED and have been prescribed vyvanse) that I only think about the calories of what I\u2019m eating occasionally. I still binge sometimes, I still lightly restrict sometimes, I still have trouble \u201callowing\u201d myself to eqt certain foods, but life is 100000x better. \u201cRecovery\u201d which I guess is what I\u2019m going through is 100% worth it.

Eating without distractions, like watching TV or scrolling on your phone, can help you reconnect with your body\u2019s hunger and fullness cues.\n\nAdditionally, it might be helpful to work with a therapist who specializes in eating disorders.",
