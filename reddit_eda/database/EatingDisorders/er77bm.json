  "title": "Request: How to support my (male) friend with anorexia",
  "selftext": "I am fairly new to the world of EDs, but I've been reading as much as I can. Please do correct me if I make any incorrect assumptions, use improper/unhelpful language, etc.\n\nOne of my (F17) closest friends (M17) was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa in middle school, before I met him. He mentioned this in passing a few months ago, but he heavily implied that he had fully recovered. I didn't think much of it at the time, especially given that he had gained quite a bit of weight since middle school (he's still extremely underweight, but has improved significantly). \n\nHowever, lately I've noticed that he has been severely restricting. I don't know if he's been doing this all along and I've just been oblivious or if he's been backsliding, but I've seen him go at least 8 hours with only a few bites to eat. I'm extremely concerned about both his physical and mental health, so I've been reading what I can in an attempt to understand his experiences and be a positive force in his recovery. [FYI: his parents and doctor are aware of this issue, but I'm not sure if he's receiving any treatment]\n\nHe recently initiated a discussion with me about his eating habits. He knows that he is substantially underweight and he wants to change that, but he also says that he feels full all of the time and that he doesn't really eat when stressed. The word \"anorexia\" was never mentioned, but it was the implicit context behind the discussion. I would like to bring it up again to discuss the disorder specifically and find out how he experiences it (as has been recommended in many of the articles I've read). Would it be appropriate to say something like \"I know that you've struggled with anorexia in the past and I've noticed that you haven't been eating very much lately. I don't know a lot about eating disorders, but I would like to learn more if you feel comfortable sharing\"? I think the most natural time to bring this up would be the next time he's eating virtually nothing at lunch, but would it be better to bring it up when food isn't around?\n\nSecondly, if he chooses not to discuss the matter with me immediately, when/how can I bring it up later? What is the appropriate amount of \"pressure,\" so to speak, to apply?\n\nThirdly, I imagine that this is especially difficult for him considering that society does not typically associate anorexia with heterosexual males. Is there anything I should be cognizant of in that regard? Anything I should or should not bring up, or that I should be prepared to discuss?\n\nThank you for any and all advice!",

Perhaps also add that you are concerned and ask how you can help. Knowing someone cares and is there to talk is the main thing. Yes, much better to bring it up when food isn't around. If someone brought up my eating disorder while I was trying to eat or around other people, that would make it a lot more difficult.\n\nI don't think the fact he's male should be brought up, unless he wants to talk about that. I had a male friend that struggled with anorexia (we both did) and his triggers were different, but there were more similarities than differences. It's a coping mechanism underneath everything.",

Since he initiated the first conversation, you can simply say \u201csince we last talked about this, I have some questions...\u201d or \u201cI\u2019d like to know more...\u201d or \u201chow are you feeling since we discussed...\u201d\n\nI know as someone (M28) with AN I would feel very threatened and embarrassed having someone basically say \u201cyou\u2019re drawing my attention and now I need to step in to save you.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s hard to know the right thing to say, but you have to come at it completely neutral and in a non-threatening way of the walls instantly go UP. \n\n\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f",
