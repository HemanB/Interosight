  "selftext": "How do I change the fact that food is the thing I look forward to most/my biggest joy at the end of every workday?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think I should pursue a hobby that would bring me joy and purpose. However, literally nothing in the world sounds better than plopping myself in front of the TV and eating after a long day of work. I don\u2019t feel motivation to try a new hobby. I feel like I deserve to do what brings me the most happiness and relaxation at the end of the day. However, it is really starting to pose a problem for my health. I\u2019m obese for the first time in my life and really need to get this under control. I just have no idea how\u2026",

      "body": "I felt like this for about a decade when I was semi-recovered. I thought I was fully recovered, and I had been obsessed with food for so long that I was no longer even aware of it and it just became normal for me to not be able to focus on anything or find joy in anything, and to think about food constantly. I had to leave university early often because I couldn't handle not being home and near food. Whenever I was anywhere where I didn't have access to food, I was feel really anxious and uncomfortable. \n\nWhen I reached the next level of recovery, all that went away. When I started eating the things I had been afraid of, and in quantities that I was afraid of, consistently, and I stopped my weird eating rituals, my mind became freed.\n\nIt was not about needing to gain weight for me (though for some it will be) because I had been at a higher, healthy weight for many years already and was still obsessed with food. In my specific case, letting go of disordered habits actually made me lose weight because I became less food focused, and I wasn't doing my food rituals that I had been doing that made me feel deprived and starving.",

I got down to 140 pounds before realizing I had a problem. I commited to eating enough and eventually food became such a part of my life that it was all I cared about. I\u2019m still working this out and I have binges frequently, but I\u2019m getting better. The biggest thing that has helped me is finding/rediscovering passions and friendships. Before I eat I play my instrument or call and old friend and I find that I feel more fulfilled with \u201cnormal amounts\u201d of food and care less about the amount or the feelings in general. I hope this helps and be strong. Counseling has also helped me so maybe if you can afford it?...",
