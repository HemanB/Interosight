  "title": "Help: The guy I\u2019m dating is triggering me with body comments",
  "selftext": "So I (24f) have been dating (30m) for 5 months now. He knows about my ED and I often try to explain what\u2019s going on in my head whenever I face challenges. He often is quite wonderful in supporting me.\n\nI\u2019ve told him early on that I will probably gain some weight in the next months because I\u2019m in therapy for my ED now and work with a doctor/dietist/family therapist/therapist/etcetc and I want to make it work this time. Wasn\u2019t looking for his approval, just wanted to mention it since not mentioning it was making me anxious. HOWEVER.\n\nThere have been some instances where he comments on my body. Like: \u2018I love how the weight you\u2019ve gained looks on you/You look healthy/You finally have a lil booty now/Your boobs looked sad before (???) and now they don\u2019t/When we met I was really confused by how your body looked but now you\u2019ve grown into your skin a little more/I\u2019m worried because I can feel you\u2019re less muscular than before\u2019\n\nComments like these are probably meant in the nicest way possible but I\u2019ve tried explaining how these comments trigger me massively. Like, throw me into small relapses almost instantly. I wish I was stronger than this but the ED voice is still very present.\n\nHowever, he keeps on insisting that he doesn\u2019t like it when I tell him what to say and what not to say. So the comments continue. I\u2019ve tried explaining to him that I am just asking him to take me into account, i\u2019m not trying to censor him in any way. This request was met with defensiveness and a stubborn: BUT I WANT TO EXPRESS MY POSITIVE EMOTIONS!!!\n\nHow to move forward send help I can\u2019t keep on being triggered like that but I don\u2019t know what to say anymore\n\nEDIT: he said that he tries to be respectful of my triggers but that somethings things just blurt out of his mouth",

The fact that he's trying to frame this as you being controlling is at best immature and at worst a massive red flag. \n\nYes, a lot of people do not know how to help someone with an ED and might say hurtful things when they're trying to be helpful. But you have *told him* these things are not helpful (and even harmful), and he's not only continuing to say them, but stubbornly insisting that he should get to say them *even knowing* that they hurt you. Even if they are \"blurted out,\" he could acknowledge it and apologize for slipping up. He isn't. He also could share his \"positive emotions\" without commenting on specifics -- would it have been *that hard* to say \"you look amazing\" or even \"your \\[body part\\] look\\[s\\] amazing\" without commenting on how that part of you has changed? \n\nPlease, seriously consider whether this person is worth jeopardizing your recovery. It is absolutely not an unreasonable request to ask that he stop commenting on your body, especially while it goes through the changes it needs to recover.",

      "body": "If you have told him clearly how these comments (even though they are meant to be supportive) are triggering and he doesn\u2019t stop, you may need to end the relationship. Before then, maybe you need to explain clearly that, even though it doesn\u2019t make sense and even if it sounds encouraging, some words are triggering, depending on how long you\u2019ve been together and if it\u2019s been a long time, maybe you need to try couples therapy or find a support group. I am only a person in recovery so the following suggestion may or may not be helpful, but maybe ask him to write down his thoughts. Explain to him that you\u2019re not ready to hear them and maybe one day you will be and if you are, then he can share them with you, that way he is able to express how he feels without triggering you. I know it\u2019s tempting just to break up with him immediately however, he does seem supportIve. He simply doesn\u2019t understand how to support you. Furthermore, it would be far worse to be with somebody who silently was thinking unsupportive thoughts because sometimes those thoughts come out n different ways. Finally explaining an eating disorder in an intimate relationship is difficult, and it\u2019s difficult for a partner to understand even if this relationship doesn\u2019t work out having the practice of discussing it with someone is good nevertheless, I would keep in mind a deadline do not give him an ultimatum. But  how many months or weeks do you want to stick around in until you see some change in his behavior. Maybe that\u2019s sneaky but I think it might be protective for you.",
