Biggest regret of my life is not changing doctors (they were useless/misleading/unfit to practice medicine) and not getting diagnosed and treatment sooner. During that time I was also making choices that, unbeknownst to me, were exacerbating my illness and I was trying to troubleshoot/treat the symptoms on my own since my doctor was failing me so profoundly. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s necessarily what you have going on, but that was 5 years ago now (and many near death, life-threatening incidents later) and I\u2019m still not in remission when I believe I could have been had I had immediate intervention. And as an uninformed, oblivious patient, you do NOT want to be making those calls for yourself with no relevant medical knowledge or diagnostic tools. You know your body better than anyone else, if something is wrong, speak up. \n\nAnd most importantly, if you take nothing else from this: be your OWN advocate medically, no one else is going to do it for you (including your doctors, no matter how good they are). Best case scenario it\u2019s nothing, but it\u2019s worlds better to be safe than sorry, I promise you.",

I lost 20 kg in 2 months before being diagnosed, was always tired and the frequent urination only started a while after the diabetes. \n\nHyperthyroidism is an option. If you suffer diarrhea and terrible stomach pain, celiac. Crohns is an option too. \n\nMany health issues can cause this, but do see a doctor.

I thought I was eating a lot pre recovery but it turned out i was just in one meal a day stasis and everything more than that felt like a lot. \n\nOnce I started feeding myself I started getting that intense starvation all the time. When you stop eating ver an extended period of time your hunger hormones start to shut off, and once you start eating again they go into over drive Bc you\u2019ve been starving yourself for so long. \n\nMy starvation feeling has gotten somewhat better over a few months of concentrated effort. Eating disorders are also bad for your heart which could explain some of the light headedness. My heart resting rate has slowed (in a good way) considerably since eating the proper amount of food.  Do you have anxiety or depression? General malaise is usually a symptom of some less \u201ctangible\u201d disorders like mental health stuff, thyroid issues, nutritional deficit, iron deficiency, etc. \n\nOdds are very high that whatever you\u2019re experiencing is treatable/curable so don\u2019t wait to go to the doctor. I know it can be scary but if you\u2019re relatively young you might just need some life style changes to get your body back on track. Get a full blood panel done and ask for a nutritionist If you don\u2019t already have one :) you\u2019ve got this!",
