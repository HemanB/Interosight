When I try it just comes out. I dropped 20 lbs in only a few weeks. I know a lot about ED\u2019s and it seems like one, but I can\u2019t pin it on any specific ones I know about. It\u2019s truly confusing. I even went to the hospital. They did a million tests but couldn\u2019t tell me anything. Then now was told that it was most likely anxiety, and things mixed with each other. I have bpd, but I don\u2019t think they are linked in any way. It\u2019s just a whole separate issue. Sorry I can\u2019t help, but just know you aren\u2019t alone!",

Because she did tests and couldn\u2019t find the root of my nausea that Id had for around 6 months. I came back to France where I live now and went to the doctor here and shared with him this info and he was horrified that my doctor prescribed me that (his words \u201cit\u2019s like an atomic bomb in your stomach each time\u201d not to scare u just to say it\u2019s super aggressive medicine as it\u2019s used to curb cancer patients nausea). He prescribed me different tests and turns out I had a staph infection and that was somehow making me nauseous and finally he gave me the right medicine to fix this and I recovered!! Maybe you can inquire about getting tested for this? I can\u2019t remember specifically what kind of staph it was (this was about 6 years ago) but doesn\u2019t hurt to ask! Either way, hope you and OP feel better soon!",
