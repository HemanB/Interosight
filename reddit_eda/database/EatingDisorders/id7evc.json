  "selftext": " \n\nI used to be a big binger and I\u2019ve dieted for what feels like half my life and I\u2019ve never been happy about myself, but the last year I\u2019ve started having to lie about what I\u2019m eating because I know it\u2019s not enough and it worries me So basically, I\u2019m pretty sure I could stop at any time but I try to eat about xxx cals (extremely small amount) from when I wake up to until dinner where I eat just a normal dinner and then I don\u2019t eat again till the next morning. I could eat more if I wanted to but I don\u2019t want the extra calories, so I don\u2019t. I know that I obsessively calorie count, I was really upset with myself the other day because I had a few squares of chocolate and found out it was x cals and I\u2019d already eaten my limit for the day, i have a full list on my notes app of all the calories in different treats and food I like, to the point where I could tell you how much calories is in almost anything. I also weigh myself every morning - I know I shouldn\u2019t but I can\u2019t help myself, I need to know and it ruins my day if it goes up even by a 1/4 pound . But I want to lose weight and if I was happy with my body I wouldn\u2019t need to do this.. so I don\u2019t think I do have an ED because I will stop when I\u2019m happy with my body. Im not able to restrict when my family gets a takeaway or something, whatever portion I get I always eat it all, I have not enough will power to only eat half or something, and then I just fell really upset with myself. I\u2019ve now lost a significant amount of in about 2-3 months and the less I eat the better I feel about myself and I\u2019m worried that\u2019s wrong but I don\u2019t think I want to stop",

If you\u2019re actively trying to recover, start by eating more frequently, but not bigger portions just yet because you\u2019ll end up with a horrible stomach ache. \n\nHaving an eating plan (AKA rules) is harmful because it\u2019ll increase the level of your food anxiety and the sooner you try to challenge those thoughts, the easier it\u2019ll be to recover. It\u2019ll be really hard, but it\u2019s worth going to someone to talk about the mental side of it and having a support system. \n\nI know this is a lot of info and it probably sounds harsh, but ED\u2019s are fatal and you need to be aware of how dangerous they are to fall into",
