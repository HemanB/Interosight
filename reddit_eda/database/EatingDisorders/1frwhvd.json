  "selftext": "I just watched *The Substance* this evening, a comeback for veteran actress Demi Moore. The visceral film is pure art in its *very* authentic depiction of body dysmorphia. In that sense, though, it is *very* triggering, especially if you have bulimia or an eating disorder in general. There are gross and disturbing scenes of puking and binge eating. Food looks alien and repulsive in the movie. \n\nBe warned: The film is about our experience, but it made me binge eat and, ultimately, purge. ",
