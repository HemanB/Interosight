  "title": "Request: I\u2019d like to post about seeking advice for my 4yo",
  "selftext": "I\u2019ve been in hospital with my 4yo son for two weeks. He hasn\u2019t eaten in 14 days or had anything to drink in 13 days. We are very rural and are waiting to be transferred to a children\u2019s hospital with a child psychologist and eating disorder team. \n\nHe\u2019s on an ng tube and is steadily regaining weight. I\u2019m happy with where he\u2019s at considering the services available to us right now. \n\nHis diagnosis so far seems to be PANDAS or OCD and anorexia. He\u2019s been put on anti anxiety meds and a sedative which have helped to calm his panic surrounding food immensely. \n\nHe has said that he\u2019s worried about germs in his mouth or crumbs getting stuck in his teeth or having too much energy and going too fast. \n\nI just wanted to see if anyone had any advice on how I could talk to him about this. We\u2019ve tried being logical which usually helps but not so much now. We\u2019ve explained how we keep germs out of food, how to get stuck food out of your teeth, and how we make sure he doesn\u2019t have too much energy but it hasn\u2019t helped at all. \n\nI just hoped that maybe someone had had a similar experience and might have some advice.",

Get him the best doctor's that you can. Get another opinion if you feel the need. If you don't like how one doctor is treating the two of you, get another doctor. Etc. etc.",

      "body": "What a tough situation.  I have a daughter with mental health needs.  I also have an anxiety disorder.  The tough thing is that anxiety does not respond to logic.  A professional can assist him in learning to tolerate food.  Occupational therapists do feeding therapy.  Look up exposure therapy.  It is a proven way to reduce anxiety and treat OCD symptoms.  Don't do it yourself, the professionals can do it safely as not to overwhelm him.  Best of luck to you.",

      "body": "I'm so sorry that you're going through this. I'm sure it feels absolutely horrible and I want to commend you for all of the care you're putting into his treatment.  He's very lucky to have you!  \n\nI'm not a professional but in my opinion it doesn't sound like he has anorexia.  People with anorexia struggle with body image and an intense fear of gaining weight, and it doesn't sound like he has those types of concerns.  The fact that he's so young also leads me away from that potential diagnosis.  While it isn't impossible for small children to display anorexic tendencies, it typically doesn't occur at such a young age.  And when it does show up in younger children, it's usually the thoughts surrounding body image or weight gain that start at that point--full blown restrictive behaviors tend to develop a bit later.\n\nTo me it sounds like the OCD/PANDAS route is the most likely, because the specific anxieties you mentioned aren't related to his weight but to things that tend to be common in those with OCD (and I'm assuming PANDAS, although I admittedly don't know much about that diagnosis).  I struggled with anxiety at his age and while my fears weren't related to eating, the anxiety was quite intense and difficult to rationalize with because I was so young.  And even now as an adult, I have trouble talking myself out of anxiety even though I'm aware that it makes no logical sense--so that could explain why trying to be logical with him hasn't helped much.   \n\nIf it does end up being considered an anxiety-related issue I'm expecting that they'll want to do exposure therapy to help him get used to eating and drinking again.  I'm also wondering if something in particular triggered his anxiety, like if there was some sort of traumatic event that set the ball rolling.  It wouldn't even have to be related to eating, as anxiety about one thing can manifest in other ways.  I think that the child psychology team will be working to try to find the root cause of the anxiety and can help treat that as well to prevent situations like this from arising again.",

Julie O'Toole, M.D. (pediatrician) and her team are known for working with really little ones with all varieties of ED's, plus co-occurring problems like OCD. Dr. O'Toole deals with issues of being afraid to swallow in kiddos, \"food phobia,\" medically caused eating issues as well as classic ED's.\n\nThe clinic itself is in Oregon, however I know she has done Skype and phone consults too. Dr. O'Toole is known for not being shy about NG tubes and also has a psychiatric nurse practitioner to work with psych meds. She can do inpatient hospitalization at the children's hospital near her clinic. \n\nPlease note: I have no personal experience with Dr. O'Toole or Kartini Clinic. This is info from my own extensive research,\n\nYou're both in my thoughts.",

It\u2019s not ideal, but it makes a normal life possible. In the short term, because the symptoms are caused by inflammation of the Amygdala, a limited course of NSAID like ibuprofen (Motrin) has worked for us in keeping the compulsive/intrusive thoughts under control. \n\nThe tough thing with PANDAS/PANS is that therapy doesn\u2019t work until the inflammation is under control, any more than physical therapy can work on a wound that had not been bandaged. \n\nI would seek out a PANDAS-conversant doctor as close to your area as possible. There are still pockets of resistance within the more conservative/older doctors, although a quick google of the CDC, NIH etc., make clear that this is a fully accepted diagnosis. \n\nFeel free to DM me with any questions.",
