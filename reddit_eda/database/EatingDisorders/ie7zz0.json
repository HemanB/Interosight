  "title": "Request: I have a friend who is really struggling with an eating disorder and she can\u2019t get help",
  "selftext": "Over the last month my friend has slowly started to reveal to us how big her issues are.  She told us she\u2019s been cutting herself every time she gets hungry and every time she does eat, she says it feels weird in her stomach and she throws it up.  .  Her dad calls her a fatass anytime he sees her eating.  This has taken a huge toll on her recently and she\u2019s going downhill.  I\u2019m seriously worried that she\u2019s gonna do something to hurt herself. She can\u2019t get help bc her dad would never spend the money and never take it seriously.  But she NEEDS help.  I just need to know what to do to help.",

      "body": "I would maybe try to call an ed hotline and explain the situation and see what they suggest or maybe tell her to make an appointment with her doctor and just make up an excuse to her dad. the only way my parents took me seriously was when i was admitted to the psychward honestly. \n\nthis is a tough situation and I would suggest being there for your friend as much as possible. some alternatives for self harm are ice on the places she wants to harm (numbing feeling), drawing cuts with a red marker (helps if she likes seeing blood) or a snapping a rubber band on her arm (this can hurt a bit but not as severe as cutting) I wish her and you all the best \ud83d\udc95",

She can go to a phych ward or go to counciling. If she goes please tell her to go to her pediatrician that she sees every year and bring ID so you can bring a birth certificate, passport, drivers licenses ect. and if she has it an insurance card or a photo of it. Tell her to talk to her docter about her rights and tell them everything they will most likely send her to a mentel health professional they will determine her treatment plan usually some sort of therapy. For more resources contact the national eating dissorder hotline 18009312237",
