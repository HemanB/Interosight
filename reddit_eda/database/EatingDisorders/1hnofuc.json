She\u2019s limiting what she\u2019s eating and spitting out food when she\u2019s \u2018full\u2019. She\u2019s super into anime and manga (age appropriate - mostly magical girl stuff) - I was keen to find out if anyone knows of any YouTubers who might talk about the issues she\u2019s experiencing in a way that she\u2019ll engage with better than me and my wife. We\u2019re also working with our doctor who says we should take it seriously, and have an appointment with a counsellor.",

Therapy can be a huge distraction and sometimes fruitless even with specialists (eg in our case).  \n\\- over indexing on your child's socials can be a distraction too \u2013 anorexia is a deeper issue with multiple concurent triggers.  \n\\- look up a children's hospital with an eating disorder program for kids, and get on the outpatient waiting list\n\nMy daughter's undiagnosed ASD was a key components for her crisis. If your daughter has a close to normal BMI, it's worth investing in a pschoeducational assessment, to see if its a factor in your case. Anorexia also has a bit different drivers and ideal treatment for people with ASD.\n\nAnorexia is often, at its very root, about control. It's worth reflecting if there're too many constraints on your child, or if there were any big life events that made her unsettled.\n\nAnd a word of encouragement: we had a really tough year in 2023 because of my daughter's anorexia, but the inpatient program worked, and turned things around. A year ago my daughter was on a hear monitor, now she's happy, healthy, and full of life. The important thing is that you picked up on it, and you are actively looking for solutions. You will find them and make it through.",

I want to be careful about recommending specific YouTube content around eating disorders for someone so young, but there might be a constructive way to use her interest in magical girl anime. Could you perhaps watch some of her favorite shows with her and use them as conversation starters about what makes the characters strong and special? Are you able to make mealtimes more relaxed and social, perhaps involving her in age-appropriate meal planning or preparation in a fun way? This could help shift the focus from the food itself to the social experience. Best thing to do is keep working with the counselor and doctor!",

You must also know how much nutrient content is in every food you serve so you know how to guide her. \n\nIt would help to let her understand that \nshe is in her puberty stage. She is still developing and her body will change in every stage of her development. Also, puberty hormones make children feel overly emotional. This will continue until their transition to adolescence stage. Social media mess up their thinking. They need to be guided and monitored during these stages. \n\n\u201cDuring puberty your child\u2019s emotions may become stronger and more intense. Their mood might change more frequently, quickly and randomly. Your child may have strong emotions that they\u2019ve never experienced before. It\u2019s common for them to feel confused, scared or angry and not know why.\u201d \nhttps://www.chconline.org/resourcelibrary/mood-swings-and-puberty/#:~:text=During%20puberty%20your%20child\u2019s%20emotions,angry%20and%20not%20know%20why.",
