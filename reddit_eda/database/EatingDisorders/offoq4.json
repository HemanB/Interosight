I don\u2019t know where else to talk about this but holy god this take is so prevalent it\u2019s disgusting. WHY DO PEOPLE THINK THIS IS OKAY. I know all kinds of conditions and disabilities deal with this weird behavior but it\u2019s so bad with eating disorders. Nobody would willingly wish for an eating disorder if they knew what it entailed. People are ignorant as hell and I\u2019m just so tired of this crap.",

This can be triggering, but the brain is plastic and you will make new body memories, which can reduce the discomfort of having body dysmorphia a lot <3",
