  "selftext": "so i was recently informed by my dad and mom i need to go to the doctors to get a vision and scoliosis test for school (which i think is bs), and upon hearing that i was absolutely mortified, because in my mind a doctor visit automatically equals being weighed, which terrifies me. i dont want anyone to know how much i am, i dont know how much i am and i just dont want to know, but its a pretty standard part of doctors appointments. i flipped OUT, literally sobbing and hyperventilating like a two year old and begging not to go, but its required to be documented and if i dont i wont be allowed to go to school. im freaking out and crying as i write this, im not even in recovery, but this would make everything so much worse for me. but im a minor so what if they force me? what do i do? can i just refuse? im so scared \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d nobody knows about my eating habits or thoughts, so im sure this looked absolutely childish and crazy to my dad, especially because i wouldn\u2019t outright say why i dont wanna go so badly",
