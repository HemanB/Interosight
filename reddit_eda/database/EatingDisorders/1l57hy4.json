  "title": "I'm 43 years old and still have an eating disorder that has completely ruined me and taken over my life",
  "selftext": "I  feel so embarrassed to still be struggling like this with anorexia. My eating disorder began when I was 8 years old, and now, 35 years later, I\u2019ve never fully recovered, despite trying many times. At this point, it feels like I\u2019m just meant to starve for the rest of my life.\n\nI lie to people, telling them I have a really fast metabolism and that I can eat whatever I want, but the truth is, I cry over a piece of cake. It\u2019s humiliating and exhausting, but I feel completely trapped. I weigh myself every single day, and the number on the scale determines whether I\u2019m going to have a good or bad day. I\u2019ve tried to skip weighing myself, but then I just obsess over it all day long, eventually stepping on the scale after work, even though I know I\u2019ll weigh more from simply drinking water or eating something during the day.\n\nLately, I\u2019ve also started to realize how my behavior is affecting the people around me. My husband\u2019s daughter recently called me \u201cso almond\u201d which I found out is a TikTok term for people who only eat healthy food in tiny amounts. She even started asking me how I never seem to get hungry or how I manage to eat so little. Of course, I lie. I tell her I just naturally have a small appetite or that I don\u2019t really like fast food. But deep down, I\u2019m terrified that she might pick up on my behaviors and develop an eating disorder. \n\nAnd the truth is, my health is deteriorating. I have difficulty breathing, constant headaches, dry skin, and my hair is falling out in clumps. My heart rate has significantly slowed down. My doctor told me this can be life threatening,  it can cause heart failure or even cardiac arrest. \n\nThe worst part is all the praise I get for my looks. I don't care about people's opinions but it feels good when people ask me how am I in such good shape, how do I stay so lean etc. I guess it gives me satisfaction knowing I, at least look good. \n\n\n",

I also had an ED and I don\u2019t know what people\u2019s situation is around healthcare but I had to make the bold step to tell my physician that I need help and I have an ED and body dysmorphia. They linked me to group therapy, a dietitian and a psychologist that I saw once a month. That was the beginning for me. \n\nThey told me to stop weighing myself which is the very first must do. I also had to welcome back all the food that I\u2019ve kept out of my life and not assign any moral value to any food like that\u2019s \u201chealthy\u201d food, etc. It\u2019s a total mind shift that takes a lot of work if you really want to get out of the shackles. I also remember the idea that in the midst of me wanting to have so much control, the whole thing was getting out of control and ultimately working against me. \n\nFinally, what worked for me is reading books about how all of this is structural and systemic, which points directly to people thinking you look good even though you\u2019re unwell. We\u2019re all trained to see what \u201clooks good\u201d from the outside because of social media, etc. People don\u2019t see the inside. I would recommend the book \u201cMy Body is Not an Apology\u201d if it would help you.",

      "body": "Totally feel that and my hearts breaks for you. I\u2019m 26 and have a sister who is 15. She\u2019s gorgeous and has absolutely nothing to worry about, but it terrifies me that she could start doing what I do, especially when people comment on my body in front of her. She\u2019s so smart and doesn\u2019t get swayed by what people say, but it only takes one wrong comment to get to someone you know? It can happen to anyone, I held strong for a long time but it eventually broke me and now here I am and I have so much guilt that she\u2019s had to witness me being sick for so many years. I was forced to grow up too young and I feel like maybe I\u2019ve done that to her by being like this and yet even with the immense amount of guilt, I still can\u2019t stop. It might sound over the top, but I was so musically talented growing up and was composing music from about 3-4 years old, like truly a gift that people would do anything to have. I had so much potential to do amazing things and because of that, had insane amount of pressure put on me by everyone around me and from myself as well. I wasn\u2019t good at anything else, basically failed every subject in school and was badly bullied for being different and yet simultaneously had a whole different group of people looking at me with amazement and huge ecxpectations. I would be introduced to people as either a difficult child with behavioural problems and learning difficulties or a musical genius that was going places and then I\u2019d have to sit down and perform on command. I never got the chance to make my own first impressions and was truly trapped and had absolutely no control of anything. My parents love me and even though they did so many things wrong that badly impacted me, I do believe they wanted the best for me and did what they could and knew how to do with what they had. They tried but so many of their decisions make absolutely no sense and it blows my mind anyone would even think to do that to a child and I resented them for a long time for it. I mostly don\u2019t anymore though as I\u2019ve been an adult for many years now and have done a great deal of damage to myself that is completely my own fault; one being this stupid ED. It\u2019s one of the only things I could actually control and something that would get me positive comments that weren\u2019t because of music or influenced by other peoples words. But the irony is that my ED has lead me to have no control over anything really and has been gradually destroying my life for years. I\u2019ve lost a lot of my musical abilities, I can\u2019t think straight, can\u2019t remember instructions properly, can\u2019t make decisions, can\u2019t be relied on, I\u2019m tired and weak all the time, my hair is thin, my skin is awful, I don\u2019t really have many friends and am chronically lonely, have extreme social anxiety and will often go days without leaving the house, I can hardly work and do very minimal hours, I don\u2019t look forward to things or get excited about anything and have no goals and nothing that interests me etc. I\u2019ve basically been depressed my whole life and nothing I\u2019ve tried has made it better so I\u2019m at the point where I\u2019ve kind of given up. I know my parents are disappointed in me for who I\u2019ve become which is so painful and I hate myself for letting them down and for also letting myself down, I\u2019m literally 26, I shouldn\u2019t be like this. I shouldn\u2019t be spending most days alone, I shouldn\u2019t be staying up all night and sleeping until late in the day, the highlight of my week shouldn\u2019t be the hour I spend with my psychologist. It\u2019s a sad life and one full of burdens and regrets and misery and anger. I\u2019ve totally lost myself and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever find her again. \nThe thing is, what you don\u2019t change, you choose, and so I think that if I really wanted to change, I might be able to, but I don\u2019t. I want to, want to if that makes sense, but I just don\u2019t care about myself enough and don\u2019t see the point anymore. I feel like it\u2019s too late and I\u2019m too far gone and even if I were to get better, I\u2019ve still done irreversible damage to myself and have missed out on opportunities to make something of myself and the one thing I could do and that was special, I can\u2019t anymore. Young me would be so upset to see this, she dreamed of writing music scores for movies and tv shows and she wanted to have 2-3 kids by now as well and I can\u2019t imagine either of those things ever being real. I can\u2019t write anymore no matter how much I try, so that\u2019s gone. Then with kids, I\u2019d have to socialise to meet someone for a start and even then, I doubt my body would ever be able to carry a baby after the way I\u2019ve treated it for so long and there\u2019s no way I\u2019d be able to adopt as I\u2019d never get approved for that because of the way I am and I could never afford to have a surrogate. So that\u2019ll probably never happen for me either \ud83d\udc94\nSo anyway, thinking back to my beautiful little sister, I truly wish she never had to see this at all but the fact that she has and can see how much my life has fallen apart as a result, I hope with every part of my being that it means she will never ever copy my behaviours because I just don\u2019t know if I can live with myself if that happens.",

          "body": "Totally feel that and my hearts breaks for you. I\u2019m 26 and have a sister who is 15. She\u2019s gorgeous and has absolutely nothing to worry about, but it terrifies me that she could start doing what I do, especially when people comment on my body in front of her. She\u2019s so smart and doesn\u2019t get swayed by what people say, but it only takes one wrong comment to get to someone you know? It can happen to anyone, I held strong for a long time but it eventually broke me and now here I am and I have so much guilt that she\u2019s had to witness me being sick for so many years. I was forced to grow up too young and I feel like maybe I\u2019ve done that to her by being like this and yet even with the immense amount of guilt, I still can\u2019t stop. It might sound over the top, but I was so musically talented growing up and was composing music from about 3-4 years old, like truly a gift that people would do anything to have. I had so much potential to do amazing things and because of that, had insane amount of pressure put on me by everyone around me and from myself as well. I wasn\u2019t good at anything else, basically failed every subject in school and was badly bullied for being different and yet simultaneously had a whole different group of people looking at me with amazement and huge ecxpectations. I would be introduced to people as either a difficult child with behavioural problems and learning difficulties or a musical genius that was going places and then I\u2019d have to sit down and perform on command. I never got the chance to make my own first impressions and was truly trapped and had absolutely no control of anything. My parents love me and even though they did so many things wrong that badly impacted me, I do believe they wanted the best for me and did what they could and knew how to do with what they had. They tried but so many of their decisions make absolutely no sense and it blows my mind anyone would even think to do that to a child and I resented them for a long time for it. I mostly don\u2019t anymore though as I\u2019ve been an adult for many years now and have done a great deal of damage to myself that is completely my own fault; one being this stupid ED. It\u2019s one of the only things I could actually control and something that would get me positive comments that weren\u2019t because of music or influenced by other peoples words. But the irony is that my ED has lead me to have no control over anything really and has been gradually destroying my life for years. I\u2019ve lost a lot of my musical abilities, I can\u2019t think straight, can\u2019t remember instructions properly, can\u2019t make decisions, can\u2019t be relied on, I\u2019m tired and weak all the time, my hair is thin, my skin is awful, I don\u2019t really have many friends and am chronically lonely, have extreme social anxiety and will often go days without leaving the house, I can hardly work and do very minimal hours, I don\u2019t look forward to things or get excited about anything and have no goals and nothing that interests me etc. I\u2019ve basically been depressed my whole life and nothing I\u2019ve tried has made it better so I\u2019m at the point where I\u2019ve kind of given up. I know my parents are disappointed in me for who I\u2019ve become which is so painful and I hate myself for letting them down and for also letting myself down, I\u2019m literally 26, I shouldn\u2019t be like this. I shouldn\u2019t be spending most days alone, I shouldn\u2019t be staying up all night and sleeping until late in the day, the highlight of my week shouldn\u2019t be the hour I spend with my psychologist. It\u2019s a sad life and one full of burdens and regrets and misery and anger. I\u2019ve totally lost myself and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever find her again. \nThe thing is, what you don\u2019t change, you choose, and so I think that if I really wanted to change, I might be able to, but I don\u2019t. I want to, want to if that makes sense, but I just don\u2019t care about myself enough and don\u2019t see the point anymore. I feel like it\u2019s too late and I\u2019m too far gone and even if I were to get better, I\u2019ve still done irreversible damage to myself and have missed out on opportunities to make something of myself and the one thing I could do and that was special, I can\u2019t anymore. Young me would be so upset to see this, she dreamed of writing music scores for movies and tv shows and she wanted to have 2-3 kids by now as well and I can\u2019t imagine either of those things ever being real. I can\u2019t write anymore no matter how much I try, so that\u2019s gone. Then with kids, I\u2019d have to socialise to meet someone for a start and even then, I doubt my body would ever be able to carry a baby after the way I\u2019ve treated it for so long and there\u2019s no way I\u2019d be able to adopt as I\u2019d never get approved for that because of the way I am and I could never afford to have a surrogate. So that\u2019ll probably never happen for me either \ud83d\udc94\nSo anyway, thinking back to my beautiful little sister, I truly wish she never had to see this at all but the fact that she has and can see how much my life has fallen apart as a result, I hope with every part of my being that it means she will never ever copy my behaviours because I just don\u2019t know if I can live with myself if that happens.",
