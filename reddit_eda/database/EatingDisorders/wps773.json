  "selftext": "1. Impersonalize yourself as you would to another human being. Instead of telling yourself things like \"bruh why cant i just do it\" \"im so stupid\" \"i hate that i keep relapsing im a failure\" imagine yourself to be your bff and now would you tell them the same as \"bruh why cant you just do it?\" \"youre so stupid\" \"i hate that you keep relapsing you failure\" ( or even better if its the 5 year old version of you)\n2. Be kind and self love is key\n3. Remember that relapse is normal and everyone goes through it u just have to get right back up\n4. If youre scared youll eat too much or binge ( when youre already full but still keep on eating) try intuitive eating (it really helped me on my recovery)\n5. Allow all food - Remember that that restrictive voice will only try to make you not eat ( you have to go against it ) So next time when it says \"omg thats too high in cals\" tell that voice to shut up and \"IM EXACTLY GONNA EAT THIS BC WOW IT LOOKS FANCY OMG YASSS IMA QUEEN/KING\" ((fun fact you are))\n6. Remove stress by meditating, do your fav hobby activity which could be dancing, gardening,art writing, reading wattpadetc cuddling to ur partner or a teddy bear, wearing makeup, kissing yoursel- ( ok maybe not the last one hah- )\n7. Tell the food rules and that ugly police that it can kiss its own barbie dolls ahole and that youre not listening to it (TRUST ME WHEN I WAS IN ED RECOVERY I THOUGHT I WAS WEAK AF BUT ONCE I GOT THAT FEELING OF CHALLENGE EVEN YOUR EGO WONT QUIT EVEN IF U DECIDE TO)\n\nty for reading them and omg ur already on it YOU GOO adorable human looking at my text rn from behind the screen hey i see that smile you got and ah wow i sense some positivity yay",
