I never got to see her recover. \n\nit means everything to me to hear about your recovery and to be able to cheer you on. even though it\u2019s just over reddit~ it\u2019s still so special to me. I\u2019m getting a chance I never got with her. \n\nI\u2019m sure angels like my sis are cheering you on as well- you are making them so proud too! \n\n*hugs & virtual confetti to you friend!*",
