  "selftext": "You ever feel like you can\u2019t even consider recovery until you physically look like you\u2019re dying because mentally I\u2019m already dying and that should be all that matters because this is a MENTAL DISORDER but no..I think people associate eating disorders with being shallow and they forget it\u2019s a mental sickness so how I look on the outside shouldn\u2019t make you question me at all even eating disorder clinics won\u2019t admit you if you\u2019re not underweight like they\u2019re supposed to be the experts in this they should know more than anyone it\u2019s not about your weight it\u2019s about what\u2019s going on in your mind..I\u2019m so tired of feeling like this but I still feel obligated to keep going",

The bottom line is that these thoughts are just another way that our eating disorders try to take over our lives. ED tells us lies and we have to fight harder than ever to get past them.",

That it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re over or under weight, if you\u2019re eating or fasting you have to work so hard to complete the simplest of tasks because you can\u2019t stand to look at you\u2019re body when you have a shower or been seen when you go outside worst of all every time you eat your have to battle this horrible bitch Ana, Ed, Mia, who ever tf screaming at you to stop you have to spend so much mental energy justifying every bite of food you take and then cope with the reproductions that inevitably come after.  If you feel like you\u2019re not sick enough, you are.",
