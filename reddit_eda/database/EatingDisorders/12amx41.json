I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m anxious or hungry because I have crippling anxiety and I\u2019m constantly overwhelmed so I legit can\u2019t tell \ud83d\ude2d I also never have enough energy to prep anything so I unintentionally starve myself. My stomach is also really fucked up so I can\u2019t even eat a lot at the same time so I don\u2019t waste time later. How do y\u2019all deal??",

No matter what, eat at meal times. It sounds like you've got an issue with volume as well. Eating 5 times a day and/or eating calorie dense food can help with that.",

      "body": "Prior to regaining normal hunger sensation, the cues my body sent that I was hungry was in the form of weakness, tremor, sore throat, brain fog, blurred vision, and the one I tapped into and relied on most to tell me I was hungry which preceded the above was an internal vibrating feeling, like my body was producing this deep humming sensation like a booming subwoofer at a consistent frequency. When I started to feel this, I knew it was time to eat as I knew it would take time to heal and have normal hunger sensations like a classic grumbling shuddering stomach. Maybe you experience these hunger signs too. It's too easy to dismiss and chalk it off to feeling crappy, we got very used to and adept at doing that, but it's important to tap back into it in order to help yourself recover. Your body is working *with* you for your greatest good, not against you. Your body is your teammate, your most loyal companion, and your cheerleader, not your rival. Friend, not foe. Much love to you!",
