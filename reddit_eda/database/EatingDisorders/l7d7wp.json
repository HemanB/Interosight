Basically, just try and ignore any type of worrying thoughts about food and dismiss them as ridiculous and harmful to your health. For example, if you want a cookie then go get one. If you want some chips then go get some. It\u2019s ok to get fast food and to have it guilt free. And eat healthy foods like fruits veggies and meats if you want. Food is meant to be enjoyed and enjoying food is a part of life. I used to eat intuitively (just ate what I wanted when the time came, til I was full and not in excess) and I was not even close to being overweight (not like being overweight is anything super horrible, but just saying that if you don\u2019t restrict you won\u2019t gain 10000 pounds and eventually your body will be self regulating and at a happy and healthy weight). \n\nI\u2019m no expert in EDs whatsoever but I just wanted to give you my advice in case it helps. \n\nBtw after a while you won\u2019t even think of food, and when you do think of food allow yourself to have it in moderation and til you are full and satisfied. \n\nIf anyone doesn\u2019t like my advice lemme know and I\u2019ll delete it cuz I don\u2019t want it to cause harm in some way if its wrong",

Start slowly introducing foods and eat when hungry. if you don't feel like eating start off with 3 small meals a day and gradually your body will get use to the routine. don't put any restrictions on yourself, that lead me back to square one. Eat what you want and when you want. Remember that you are strong, beautiful and you can recover from this! Do this for you and no one else! Following eating disorder and body acceptance accounts on facebook and instagram really help so you are part of a community and don't feel so alone. Also you should consult with a professional and therapist that helps. If he can't love you through this than that really says a lot about him and you don't need that toxic behaviour in your life especially at a time like this!",
