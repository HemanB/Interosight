  "title": "Request: I Feel Like My Life Is Ending",
  "selftext": " \n\nI feel like I\u2019ve completely lost it. My entire life is consumed by food it seems. Thinking of meals, looking at recipes, grocery shopping, watching weight loss videos, watching cooking shows, dieting (and failing at it). It\u2019s becoming way too much to handle. My head feels like it\u2019s gonna explode and I just want all these thoughts to go away. Every day I try my best to eat healthy and have healthy habits but I literally ALWAYS fail. My sugar cravings are impossible to ignore and I hate it so much. I seriously need help. I just want all this to end so I can finally be free. I\u2019ve been a slave to food for so many years and it\u2019s exhausting! I have no clue where to turn or what to do and I feel like I\u2019m gonna be this way forever. Someone please point me in the right direction, or at least talk to me so I don\u2019t feel so alone. Thanks for reading if you got this far",

If so, can you temporarily return to the old way?\n\n\\- Are the sugar cravings a new feeling, based on a new way of eating, such as a new low-carb diet?

For example, glutamine or d-phenylalanine.\n\n\\- Are you watching weight loss videos and cooking shows for distraction?

Search and explore to find other types of shows you like. And focus on them.  I love watching make up tutorials, commentary channels etc and I spend a lot of time navigating between those instead of watching mukbangs all day like before. It's really relaxing for the brain to have this break from your obsession.",

I remember crying in the shower once because even then I couldn\u2019t stop obsessing. Whether I decided to eat or not eat, I still obsessed mentally. I felt like I couldn\u2019t win. I was totally overwhelmed.\n\nThe biggest help for me in my recovery was getting on antidepressants. Please go see a doctor, STAT. I also started seeing a psychologist and dietician, and both of them also helped me a lot. You can\u2019t beat this alone!",

The jealousy over people who can just live their lives with food as an interruption instead of an obsession.  Not to offend anyone who has struggled with substance abuse, but it feels like being an alcoholic who has to drink a beer 3 times a day.   \n\nI don't have advice, but trust me, you're far from alone.  Let me know if you figure it out.  ",

      "body": "The advice I morally want to give: Read the book Intuitive Eating: you'll understand two things 1. how with restriction comes binging and cravings 2. your body is supposed to be larger than your eating disorder brain wants it to be, and you should get help in accepting your natural, optimal weight.\n\nThe advice, I will give, as someone who has an eating disorder, as someone who has tried the whole \"intuitive eating recovery journey,\" resulting in worse anxiety and depression, and as someone who gets you and knows what you need to hear right now, amid the panic: chances are you aren't going to gain permanent weight, and are experiencing a short period of time, whether it be one or two weeks, or even two months, where you crave sugar, and where you feel \"weak\", as far as self control goes. The cravings will end, your motivation to continue restricting will return, and you will again feel high off the self control you possess. \n\nIf you're ready to put the eating disorder to bed, and embark on a recovery journey, I applaud you, and truly advise you to study intuitive eating. Listen to Christy Harrison's podcast Food Psych. It will provide you with IMMEDIATE relief. You will literally sigh with relief that there is a world outside dieting, and that it's okay to have fat and be fat.\n\nBut if you're not ready to recover, don't beat yourself up about that. It's okay if you don't have enough support right now to let go of the eating disorder. It's okay if this is what you need right now. Don't worry about the future (gaining weight, or recovery.) Focus on the now: Enjoy your cravings, binge on donuts. And tell yourself \"Next week I'll diet.\" I may get some backlash with that, but it's what's worked for my sanity. It's easier for people to encourage recovery. It's so much easier said than done. The truth is eating disorders are much more complicated than that. ",
