  "selftext": "I tried to make a post. I m here because I don't have anyone I can talk to about this and this marriage is falling apart. I ll cut and paste what I wanted to post below\n\nI ve been married for 2 years and it hasn't been easy. My wife either doesn't eat or throws up if she does eat. When she hasn't kept anything down for a while she seems drunk. Becomes unreasonable and treats me like shit. I ve tried to help her. I don't pressure her to eat because she doesn't respond well to it. I just try and be there for her. She tells me when she feels like throwing up and expects me to monitor her. If I leave the room she sneaks off to throw up and blames me. Before the pandemic I ve had to cancel plans more often than not because of the person she becomes when she hasn't eaten. She becomes really nasty. Treats me like crap. Looks and acts like she drank a bottle of vodka.   Mental abuses me. When she eats she's a different person. She's the person I married. She's gone for in patient help before we were married and won't take any professional help now because she thinks it doesn't help. I can't take much more of this. I can't take anymore abuse. Please give me some advice.",

If you \"can't take any more abuse\", then don't. There's this whole cloud of mystery around ED's but really it's not much different from any other addiction. So if your wife was an abusive alcoholic who refused treatment what would you do? Do that. By the way, I didn't decide to recover until I lost everyone and everything for what it's worth.",

I don't think it's appropriate to simply walk away if your spouse has an addiction. You sit them down and discuss that you are not tolerating what they are doing. If you continue to let them do it, you're signaling that it's okay to continue. You can absolutely be gentle with them and tell them that you love them and care for them but cannot tolerate their abuse or behavior any more. In this case, it isn't simply just crappy behavioral choices being made by OP's wife, it's an illness that she needs professional intervention for.\n\nI've been married for eleven years and I have been in both spots as well (the one doing the ultimatum and the one receiving). I think we were both justified to tell the other person \"Hey, I love you but you need help. I can't keep living like this\". And my SO's ultimatum was because of my ED. He was trying to be supportive over the years but didn't know how to help me any more and he couldn't stand seeing me sick. I didn't expect him to stay if I continued, and I sought professional help knowing our marriage was on the line. Many years later we are doing great! I never saw his ultimatum as abuse, but rather the opposite and he had boundaries of what he could and could not deal with. If he would have just left me right then and there I don't know if I would have ever gotten the help I needed to recover.",
