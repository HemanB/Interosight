I\u2019m talking about if for example, you were looking at two people with similar weights and you had to figure out which one had an eating disorder and which one was just on a diet. What would you? Which would be the key factors that would help you figure out which person has which?\n\nI personally struggle with not feeling sick enough to ask for help, I invalidate myself and am in fear of people doing the same to me.",

A person whose just on a diet usually just wants to be healthy and feel better about themselves, they\u2019re not overly obsessive about it, and their not negative in a self destructive way when they make a mistake. There are many types of eating disorders and feeling invalid is very common feeling among them. You can\u2019t judge if a person has one based off weight and eating habits alone, its much more than that. It\u2019s the relationship the person has with food and their self image.",

      "body": "Oo, such a slippery slope. Like most mental disorders, eating disorders sit on a spectrum. On one end is a health, body-positive attitude and on the other is severely disordered. Those in the severely disordered side can\u2019t think about anything other than food/ED stuff. Their behaviors support this. Whichever form the ED takes, their ED behaviors prevent them from engaging actively in life. Work, school, relationships and of course the physical body are all impacted. Those on the other side, people with a healthy attitude towards food generally don\u2019t spend much time planning out meals/calories and if they do, there isn\u2019t baggage that comes with it. Food is nourishment, eating is a time to socialize and it\u2019s both a source of pleasure or not.\nMost people probably sit somewhere in the middle of this spectrum. At least within the US, there are so many mixed messages blasted all over the place about food. Good food vs bad food. Guilty pleasures. Sinfully decadent treats. Clean eating. Comfort food. Natural. We use food and diet as yet another way to compare ourselves to others and even as a source of identity. Not to say that the entirety of the US has an eating disorder, but that we have many weird hang ups with food that aren\u2019t as prevalent in other cultures. Maybe we\u2019re slightly further along the spectrum than say a native tribesman somewhere eating indigenous cuisine.\n\nSo what are signs that you\u2019re slipping closer towards the disordered side of things?\nBecoming obsessive about food. You think about food all the time. What to eat, what to make, what ingredients can you have/not have.\nYou focus on the data of food: calories, macros, micros, etc. \nYou calculate what you can eat based on how much exercise you got (or vice versa)\nWhat you eat affects how you feel about yourself\nWhat you eat forms part of your identity\nYou use food to fulfill needs other than hunger\nYou use food/lack of food/exercise to manage your emotions\nYour focus on food/body/exercise impacts your ability to take part in relationships\nYour focus on food/body/exercise impacts your ability to work/go to school\nYour food/exercise choices are having a negative impact on your body but you continue.\n\nI feel like some of these signs may fire up some people. I don\u2019t mean to say that if you do any of the above you have an eating disorder or even that you have disordered eating. We all know plenty of people who pursue health/nutrition goals and don\u2019t appear to have anything disordered going on. Athletes in particular could probably check off many of these without crossing into disordered territory, but there are plenty of athletes who have eating disorders and who are able to hide all the red flags.\nSo back to your original question - who has the eating disorder and who doesn\u2019t? I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a one size fits all answer to this. I\u2019ve seen student athletes push their bodies passed the breaking point but denied any body image concerns. I\u2019ve seen people obsessed with their body image and their food intake, but they were functioning, at a healthy weight and seemed happy. I\u2019ve seen people who wanted to gain weight, enjoyed their bodies, exercised appropriately, but were chronically underweight. ED diagnoses are a way to attempt to categorize symptomology, but most people are complex and don\u2019t fit into nice pretty boxes. There are certainly clear cases where someone is in the clinically disordered realm, but for those in the grey middle ground, I don\u2019t think there is a clear cut answer.",

The problem was once I got to my goal weight, I couldn't stop..I was in the middle of a divorce and I know that didn't help. I was obsessed, afraid of many foods, and couldn't enjoy eating. All I thought about was what I ate, fearing it was too much, etc. I got very thin, even underweight. After a few tears of that I snapped one day and binged, then freaked out and purged, and then that cycle set up shop for a few years. My therapist told me that for those who are already predisposed to developing an ED, dieting and stress can pull the trigger, so to speak, but the gun was already loaded. \n\n(Currently doing ok for me, minimal symptoms but really struggling to enjoy the holidays a bit without fearing a return to bulimia.

      "body": "I'd like to say that the biggest difference is their relationship with food as well as their relationship with themselves. A fear of food and a fear of gaining weight are tell tale signs that something more than a diet is going on. This also means that if the person has a poor self-esteem and a poor image of themself, they're at a higher risk of developing an eating disorder. A person who accepts themselves as they are but wants to improve themself for their health or enjoyment is the basis of a healthy diet, as well as knowing when to stop their diet. Some people who develop eating disorders believe that losing weight will make them loveable, beautiful, worthy and so on without realizing that they are already all of those things. Diet culture influences this a lot, whether directly or indirectly. Although, some people don't develop eating disorders because of their body image, or really even anything related. A good percentage of people with eating disorders are addicted to the false sense of control, not their body image. When the world around them is chaotic, they find comfort and control by limiting their intake, or practicing 'self-discipline' by exercising excessively. Personally, I believe that diet culture is extremely overrated because dieting is a slippery slope to unhealthy habits. While not everyone who diets will develop an eating disorder of some type, the culture that surrounds dieting really influences the idea that 'thin' means 'healthy and beautiful' when realistically, everyone's healthy range is different. Fat is not synonymous with bad or ugly, nor is thin synonymous with beautiful and worthy. It's something I'm still trying to learn, myself. To sum it up and answer your question, though, it all really boils down to their state of mind through it all. A healthy mind leads to a healthy diet, otherwise it's just a downward slope into dangerous territory.",

Yes both have destructive behaviors, but the difference is that the disordered eating worst case tragic end is it developing into an eating disorder. The worst case tragic end with an eating disorder is dying. \n\nSeeing as how there are multiple types of eating disorders, there are many different symptoms. An unhealthy relationship with food and unhealthy eating habits (eg. disordered eating) are a symptom of eating disorders. \n\nI personally believe dieting is a form of disordered eating. Because you\u2019re forcing your body to not listen to it\u2019s needs/cravings in order to meet some goal other than meeting nutritional needs and satisfying yourself.

For instance a \u201cnormal\u201d person who\u2019s on a diet may eat a piece of cake or a big meal and feel guilty because they broke their meal plan, but this guilt fades rather quickly. They can go about the rest of their day/week without interference. For me, someone with an eating disorder, when I would eats outside my \u201cmeal plan\u201d I would think about it constantly and I mean every second of the day for weeks.

Whether if it\u2019s with an eating disorder or disordered eating, both severely impact your quality of life.  Have you heard of intuitive eating?",

It\u2019s hard to fully differentiate between eating disorders and disordered eating because the latter has a high probability of turning into the former. \n\nDisordered eating is the term to describe unhealthy eating behaviors/unhealthy relationship with food. Eating disorders are a disease where an unhealthy relationship to food is a symptom.",

          "body": "I don\u2019t know how I can really explain any further how they\u2019re different. Eating disorders are a mental illness like depression, anxiety etc. They\u2019re in the DSM. Yes both have destructive behaviors, but the difference is that the disordered eating worst case tragic end is it developing into an eating disorder. The worst case tragic end with an eating disorder is dying. \n\nSeeing as how there are multiple types of eating disorders, there are many different symptoms. An unhealthy relationship with food and unhealthy eating habits (eg. disordered eating) are a symptom of eating disorders. \n\nI personally believe dieting is a form of disordered eating. Because you\u2019re forcing your body to not listen to it\u2019s needs/cravings in order to meet some goal other than meeting nutritional needs and satisfying yourself. That doesn\u2019t mean everyone who diets has an eating disorder. \n\nSomeone else mentioned how a key thing is impact and longevity. For instance a \u201cnormal\u201d person who\u2019s on a diet may eat a piece of cake or a big meal and feel guilty because they broke their meal plan, but this guilt fades rather quickly. They can go about the rest of their day/week without interference. For me, someone with an eating disorder, when I would eats outside my \u201cmeal plan\u201d I would think about it constantly and I mean every second of the day for weeks. For example, I ate mac and cheese on Monday for dinner and to this day it\u2019s *still* running through my mind every time i try to choose and eat a meal.",
