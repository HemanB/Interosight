  "selftext": " \n\nI feel like I\u2019m in the middle of developing an eating disorder. I\u2019m a healthy weight, but it\u2019s getting progressively harder to eat and easier to starve myself. Every time I see food with high calories I mentally gag and feel sick. I can\u2019t bring myself to eat them. My thoughts are getting more and more focused on eating and my body and how I can lose weight. I also eat only fruit for breakfast and skip dinner completely. How do I make these thoughts stop and return to my old eating habits?",

      "body": "Intuitive eating. I\u2019m recovering from anorexia, like I obsessively weighed my food, and counted all the calories, but I realized that our bodies actually know what they need. When I eat unhealthy stuff one day like chocolate (still can\u2019t believe I\u2019m eating chocolate again) I crave healthy stuff the next day, so it\u2019s all kinda even. Also I researched some stuff, and eating a lot one day won\u2019t do shit. Like if you eat a normal amount most of the time and then one day you eat twice the amount of calories, nothing will really happen. I never eat twice the amount, but it helps me relax about it, and just eat when I\u2019m hungry. What also helped me not wanna lose more weight, is the starvation mode your body enters once it\u2019s too thin, like then you have to eat such a small amount to not gain weight, and to get out of this, you\u2019d have to gain a bunch, to lose that again, and that just sounds unnecessarily stressful. I\u2019d recommend looking up the negative effects of anorexia, and how gaining weight isn\u2019t even that easy, that it just happens on accident, and wish you the best to get out before it gets really bad. I can for sure say, that even tho I wanted to be skinny for so long, it really wasn\u2019t worth it, and there was never once a point where I liked myself more cuz I lost a lot of weight. More like the opposite. Recovery is helping me to get along with myself more",

      "body": "When I was working high energy jobs I drank a lot of protein shakes. I couldn't always force myself to eat but at least I could force myself to drink them without making myself sick. Not just boring ones like ensure either, good stuff like bolthouse farms vanilla chai and mocha flavors, and other brands you find at like health food stores. It at least gave me the energy I needed to make it through shifts when I was in a bad place.",

I would recommend seeing a therapist and dietician that specifically treat people with EDs now so they can help you get back on track. The podcast Food Psych by Christy Harrison is also really great.",

      "body": "Do you know what brought them on? The restrictive eating patterns and thoughts you describe are an eating disorder. It's important to get help and advocate for the support you need to combat these thoughts as you've said and be able to eat in a more recovered way. Something usually triggers it developing, whether it's a life transition or stressful event (or trauma), heightened anxiety, lack of support etc. It may seem gradual (as you call it developing) but every second of it progressing is serious and the best time to get support and help and work toward recovery is always now. Do you see a therapist? When your thoughts are focused on your body, can you tell what's behind them? Can you tell those thoughts that your body isn't the problem, and that you deserve compassion, and then ask those thoughts what they really need from you?",

      "body": "Changing what you eat changes your body and cravings so your body craving different foods isn\u2019t necessarily bad, it\u2019s just what you\u2019re conditioning your body to expect/want which may be different from how you were before. But fear of food or food groups isn\u2019t healthy long term so Definitely talk to a professional about it to help you better understand what your body needs/is asking for vs. Other reasons certain foods may make you feel bad about yourself. \n \nif you\u2019re worried and can\u2019t get help quick, In the meantime don\u2019t punish yourself or panic thinking somethings wrong with you because it\u2019s not, anytime you have an intrusive thought like that just give it space to exist so you can try to examine it like a scientist and find the root cause instead of feeling bad for thinking it. If that\u2019s too much right now, at least try to eat with people who you feel comfortable with that don\u2019t have symptoms to help you reinforce and feel comfortable eating what you used to. If that\u2019s too much, up the quantity of foods you\u2019re comfortable with and use affirmations like \u201cI\u2019m putting gas in the car so it can run\u201d, \u201call food is fuel and by eating this I\u2019m giving myself the strength to kick ass and take names today\u201d, \u201cthere\u2019s no such thing as bad or good foods and by listening to my body\u2019s intuition I\u2019m being the healthiest I can be\u201d, \u201ceverything in moderation, even moderation\u201d and try to see what\u2019s causing you to feel this way now specifically. You aren\u2019t alone and you\u2019re already ahead of the game seeking advice so be very proud of yourself for that! But if you can talk to a professional do it ASAP to be proactive protecting yourself, and if not, keep reaching out here so you have people to talk to \u2665\ufe0f",
