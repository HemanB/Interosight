  "selftext": "Stopped tracking cals for the past 2 weeks I used the excuae of \"it's christmas\". I have been over eating and binging so bad having fast food every day and snacking constant in between. Feel so depressed today decided enough is enough and stepped on the scale i am almost a stone heavier than 2 weeks ago i knew it would be bad but not that much. I don't know why i do this to myself i wish i had control. Now i know the next few weeks will be me restricting myself to take away the guilt. I HATE THIS TIME OF YEAR! What are the chances a good chunk of the gain is water weight i really hope so",

      "body": "Hey! So when I get into the mindset of the holidays, I started to relax when I accepted there\u2019s going to be a lot more eating just because of meals. I stopped denying myself that third cookie or second plate of mashed potatoes because that\u2019s what I wanted to celebrate. This year I splurged on Christmas Eve all day and Christmas dinner. But when those expected arranged meals were over, I made sure to go right back to my standard well rounded meals because in the long run it\u2019s about consistency. If I had left overs, I\u2019d make them into meal preps with additional Whole Foods (so say ham, mashed potatoes, half an apple and raw bell pepper) to make a balance without food going to waste. \n\nThat said, that\u2019s what works for me. Find a routine for the holidays that helps you maintain healthy habits so you can splurge without the guilt, whether that\u2019s meal prepping in advance, meal prepping leftovers, or have a conversation with yourself about what the line is for indulging versus binging. \n\nThat said, please don\u2019t restrict after the holidays! Even if you gained weight, restricting will only cause harm to your body if it\u2019s being bounced back and forth between binging and restricting. It\u2019s okay to feel guilty, it\u2019s okay to be unhappy about weight gain. But it\u2019s not permanent and as long as you have a consistent meal/exercise schedule that *works for you* this is only blip.",

What\u2019s helped me is knowing that I won\u2019t be eating all these fun and festive foods forever, I\u2019ve lost the 5-10 lbs I\u2019ve put on before, and once the holidays are over I won\u2019t be as sedentary as I\u2019ve been. \n\nI had a minor freakout at the doctor yesterday when they weighed me. I was 8 pounds heavier than I was 2 weeks ago! But, I had to rationalize with myself: I was wearing clothes, shoes, my purse, and a winter jacket, I had my phone and smart watch on me, and it was the end of the day. Taking all this into account really talked me off the ledge. It might help you too!",

I caved today and weighed myself and practically threw up on the spot because I\u2019m almost 2kg heavier then I was before Christmas. \n\nFrom what everyone is telling me, the water weight/retention could last for about 2 weeks until your body goes back to its usual weight. We just have to wait it out while making sure we don\u2019t restrict or harm ourselves! And do know that ur not in this alone. January is gonna be a toughy",

And your body may be holding onto some weight but that\u2019s okay too, it\u2019s all part of healing from restriction. Your body is trying to protect you from starvation, it\u2019s trying to help you survive. \n\nThat being said, you have a choice now. You can restrict and go through this cycle again, maybe lose the weight, maintain control, but would you be happy? Breaking the cycle is hard and scary but it\u2019s the only way to heal. \n\nWishing you the best. You are doing great, even if it doesn\u2019t feel like it!",
