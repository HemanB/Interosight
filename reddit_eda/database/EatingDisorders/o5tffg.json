  "selftext": "My spouse is going to be going to an inpatient treatment center. We need to tell our kids she is going away. We had someone tell us that we shouldn't tell our kids about it. Right now we are using vague terminology but IMO our teenage daughters can figure it out. Are we doing more harm by not naming it? We obviously don't have to go into graphic details but we don't want to trigger them into copying, as this person told us it would.",

Especially since they are teenagers and probably already figured out that their parent is sick.\n\nI would just like to add that there is a genetic factor in anorexia. If one of your kids ends up developing it later in life (which I really hope it won't !) they might get upset at you for hiding this important fact to them. I know that I sometimes get upset that no one told me that my grandma has a disordered relationship with food because even if she's not diagnosed with anything and will deny it until she dies, she definitely has not an healthy relationship with weight and food and her comments affected my sister and I and are one of the reasons why we developed an ED. By telling them their parent has an eating disorder, you're breaking the taboo and teaching them that what this parent does isn't healthy, normal and that they shouldn't believe the same thing.",

She is recovered, but it led to me and my siblings all having disordered eating in different ways and created this huge stigma. She only recently talked about to me as an adult, and had no idea that *I always knew*. I knew when she'd say she wasn't hungry that she was. Or that she'd eat a lot when she was sad and then she'd be even more sad for weeks after. Speak to them. They need to know.",

      "body": "EDs are profoundly shaped - and reinforced - by secrecy and shame. Your daughters are of utmost concern, but so is thier mom, and she\u2019s the one that\u2019s suffering and needs immediate help. Sometimes this help begins with honest openness about your wife\u2019s illness. If you she had cancer, and you think your girls would be mature to know that she needed cancer treatment, then they are mature enough to know about their moms eating disorder - it\u2019s a chronic illness. Being honest with them about this isn\u2019t going to make them any more predisposed to struggling with an eating disorder than they already are. If anything, secrecy - omission and ignoring the family\u2019s shared trauma - is the higher risk factor for detrimentally impacting their health and wellness. \n\nMy story:\n\nBulimia started at 17 \nInpatient at 19 - Brief recovery \nRelapse went on for another 1.5 years \nRecovery stabilized at about 21 \n5 years recovery!\nRelapsed at 26 for many years \nBegan intensive outpatient \nRecovery at 30 - we welcomed our son \nPostpartum anxiety spurred intermittent relapses\nRecovery at 32 \nRelapse at  relapse at 33\nRecovery at 34 \nmy daughter is born \nPostpartum relapse at 35\nRecovery at 36\nGlobal pandemic \nRelapse at 37 \nI\u2019m 38.

I explained that everyone has fears, and our brain makes us scared of things to help protect us and keep us safe. For example, being afraid of heights keeps a person from falling, being afraid of snakes helps us not get bit, etc. But sometimes our brain sends the wrong signals and makes us afraid of something that won\u2019t hurt us. Like being afraid of grasshoppers, because grasshoppers aren\u2019t dangerous. I then explained that mom\u2019s brain tells her to be afraid of food, and it makes it hard to eat.
