  "selftext": "My mom is extremely critical of my weight. Even when I was a child and growing up my mom would always tell me \u201cyou need to stop eating before you gain weight\u201d or that \u201cyou can\u2019t let yourself get fat\u201d. One day I asked her if she would love me more if I was thinner and she replied \u201cI only want my children to be healthy\u201d and avoided the real answer. When I was 18 I became chronically ill due to my restrictive eating (in and out of hospitals) and I lost a lot of weight. My moms response was to tell me how jealous she was of me and that she \u201cloved that I lost weight, it just sucks it had to be this way\u201d. I\u2019m now 23 and obviously, no longer chronically ill, and have gained some weight back. But now I\u2019m back to believing that because I\u2019m not bone skinny, I can\u2019t be accepted... I keep having dreams of cutting out my stomach or getting a gastric bypass surgery just so I don\u2019t have to eat... I lay in bed all day and cry. I\u2019m in a spiraling cycle and I need help.",

      "body": "I know it\u2019s hard. I lost my Gallbladder due to starvation and then lost even more. It was the worst I had felt in my life. Like every day I was literally dying and wanted to eat and couldn\u2019t. \n\nMy mom would not stop gushing about it. I stayed with her overnight for 2 days after my gallbladder removal and she kept saying \u201coh my god. Look at you! You barely even have a tummy. \u201c or something of that nature about every 3 hours while there. If I\u2019m honest, her acting that way along with how I felt while sick, and my feelings about my body still being negative even after losing a ton is what made me seek recovery. \n\nI have gained a good portion of the weight back, but I\u2019m also much happier and freer now. More mental clarity and room for other thoughts, more time for myself, and less hating myself. It\u2019s extremely difficult but so worth it. \n\nI strongly recommend you seek help from a professional skilled with eating disorders and trauma.",

Horrible, just horrible.\n\nFind the strength block out her cruelty (ear plugs are fantastic!).. you can also try some behavior modification techniques- e.g. walking away the second she make comments like these (no matter where you are or what you\u2019re doing- straight up LEAVE, immediately). Explain later you will not tolerate backhanded or insensitive comments related to your weight and that it\u2019s a zero tolerance issue for you. She fucks up, you leave that second and disengage.\n\nBecause honestly, no matter how dumb she might play, she KNOWS what she\u2019s doing.\n\nAnd how fucking dare she.\n\n\nETA my dad is exactly like your mom so it\u2019s bit of a sore spot for me. Sorry for the forcefulness of my post, reading the things she said to you rang too familiar and \ud83e\udd2f ..",

My guy friends said they liked my booty, and when I bounced when I walked. \"You've lost too much weight. You're too skinny. I can see your ribs. It looks like you dropped two bra sizes. We (straight men) like curves, they're what makes a woman look appealing and cute and snuggly.\"\n\nI feel so crappy about my weight. Whenever a bf would gently grab my flank/hips and pull me into him or feel me up in a really cute way, it was embarrassing to feel fat. It made me cry because someone else liked my body for what it was even though I'm ashamed of it. But it was also really sweet and felt so... kind. How could anyone be so kind? \n\nAll I can say is, in terms of romantic love, it's hard to snuggle a bony twig without being scared of literally breaking them. Try to think of how nice it'd feel to have someone laying on your chest, snuggling their head into your boobs [*assuming you're female] and just enjoying your feminine curves and squishy softness. I know it feels so, so good to be wanted, to be appreciated. To feel worth something.\n\nTry watching some commentary videos on the effects of eating disorders. They can be pretty bad and totally fuck your body up for the rest of your life. The testimonials serve as a deterrent from letting things get out of hand with my ED.",

My whole life my parents have told me that I need to lose weight or that my butt is too big or that Im getting fat or that I am fat, etc. Its led to me hating my body and constantly obsessing over how and look and never being happy with my body. I even avoid mirrors and am currently eating once a day and really tiny portions so I can lose weight. It really sucks and parents do not realize that this really messes with us badly. No matter what you are loved and you are beautiful. Do not let your mother make you feel like you shouldnt be loved. I understand you when it comes to this....",
