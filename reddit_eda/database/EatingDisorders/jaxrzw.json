  "title": "Request: partner developing ED, need help supporting them",
  "selftext": "My partner and I both live with our parents (we are in college) and mine will not let me visit my partner, so it's been almost impossible to have any sort of contact since the pandemic started. \nRecently my partner has been showing signs of an eating disorder. For the past month or two, they have been complaining of stomachaches and the feeling of wanting to vomit during a normal activity (e.g. when we were on the phone). Occasionally they would go a day or two without eating but then revert back to normal habits. \nOver the past couple of weeks, however, my partner has been going days without eating and having extremely small meals only once in a while. They told me that they feel disgusted by food, not because of dysmorphia or anything (or so I think) just simply the feeling of being grossed out by the sight or thought of food. My partner also said that the rare time that they feel hungry, they have to eat almost immediately or the \"window\" will close and they just won't eat. These past few days I've come to realize that my partner has always struggled with fluctuating weight and irregular eating habits, but it's just really reached a peak lately and my partner is down almost 20 pounds. \nI googled this and it seems like my partner may have an avoidant style eating disorder. I am at a complete loss for what to do. They don't have insurance, works minimum wage, and parents don't support them financially so going to a therapist or nutritionist is basically impossible.\nI've been trying to encourage them to eat (not forcefully) and bring them food on the rare occasion that I am permitted to visit them at work, but there's only so much I can do when I don't live with them and the only way we can communicate is through a screen. \nMy partner is under a lot of stress right now with their own life coupled with everything else going on and they have no emotional support besides me. I just don't know what to do. Sorry for the long post, please help.",

It\u2019s very short only like 120 ish pages. But a fantastic read. \n\nI also did DBT group therapy which helped with learning new skills on regulating my emotions and more mindfulness skills, you can probably find worksheets online or videos on dbt. I learned very basic skills but I still use them today a year after treatment. \n\nI also was very afraid of cooking and planning meals and grocery shopping. It would have been very helpful if someone helped me try to come up with easy meals or snacks to eat when you aren\u2019t hungry, don\u2019t want to cook, etc. there are no good or bad foods, if they can only eat tubs of ice cream that\u2019s ok! If they can only eat loads of candy and chips that\u2019s also okay! The goal is to eat anything. Intuitive eating is also very helpful.",

      "body": "Hi there, I\u2019m sorry to hear your partner is going through this. To me this sounds similar to what my boyfriend has when he is under intense stress. He has no appetite, and then when he tries to eat food he can get maybe three bites in before feeling full or feeling sick. Once he loses the stress his eating slowly gets back to normal. Keep trying to make sure they eat something, even if it\u2019s something small but calorie dense. And talk to them to see when exactly this started happening versus when they felt the increase of stress. This should give a better idea of what is going on.",
