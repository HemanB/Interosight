  "title": "Request: How can I recover from an ED when nobody is on my side and I have no money",
  "selftext": " \n\nI (19f with autism) have had an eating disorder for about half a year- not sure how to label it, but I heavily restrict calories and am at a point where I no longer feel hungry and all food tastes bad to me\u2026 I can only manage a few bites of food I used to love because the taste is so sour in my mouth. I have also been finding whenever I eat I get bad stomach aches- not sure if that\u2019s anxiety or if my body can\u2019t handle food anymore.\n\nMy parents (who i still life with) are obsessive about food and have told me my whole life that I was too fat and need to eat less (I have never been overweight in my life, they just have an obsession with me being bone thin). Lately since I have lost a lot of weight they have been telling me I look good and are proud of me for losing weight. I have lightly tried to tell them that I have an eating disorder and it doesn\u2019t help when they encourage it but I am always met with \u201cwe are just trying to make sure you\u2019re healthy\u201d and end up yelling at me and sometimes crying.\n\nI am not in a position to get a job, so I cannot afford therapy, plus I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d get there since I don\u2019t have a car and my parents can\u2019t know I\u2019m going to therapy. I am scared I am going to cause irreversible damage on my body and I don\u2019t want to feel like this anymore. Does anyone know of free online Ed recovery or other tricks that helped them? I am desperate.\n\nThank you",

I don't know where youre from but they're located in Massachusetts and most of the people are from there as well but we didn't have a few people out of country. They meet every Tuesday at 7pm and Thursdays at 1pm (Massachusetts time) and all you have to do is sign up via your email and you'll get a zoom meeting invite through your email about an hour before it starts. They're a wonderful group of people and it should help you a lot.",
