  "selftext": " \n\nI suffered from bulimia and anorexia. It was very severe I was purging  breakfast/lunch/dinner and snacks or wouldn\u2019t eat for days on end. For  the last half a year things have been amazing! I\u2019m eating keto now which  is helping me slowly get back into the habits of eating properly,  having the right amount of meals and actually keeping them down.  I do still have bad thoughts and do still look in the mirror and cringe  but encourage (not force) myself to eat the next meal (and I make it my  fav keto treat which is steak and mushroom sauce \ud83d\ude0d).  Just wanted to post saying THERE IS HOPE. YOU CAN DO THIS. I\u2019m happy to  share more of my coping mechanisms. Also wanted to say, this journey I  did on my own. My family don\u2019t know (I\u2019m sure they guessed but I never  told them) my mum called me fat all through school (her fav phrase was  \u201cyou\u2019d be beautiful if you just lost a little more\u201d and I was already at  fainting point. Other people don\u2019t dictate your version of beauty and  perfection. Being beautiful is being kind and being a good person and  perfection dosnt exist. So enjoy the moments of life - have the courage  to feed your body and if not that, feed your mind with nutrition so you  can focous and get what you want outta life. Everyone stay strong \u2764\ufe0f you  got this.",

Not purging alone is such a big step and your body will be so grateful. It\u2019s such a stress on our poor digestive systems not to mention our teeth! \nI stopped purging ten years ago but still restricted for a long time in various ways. About a year ago I discovered Kayla Rose Kotecki on YouTube and she talks about letting go of all restriction. Even keto or Atkins or raw til 4 or whatever diet\u2019s got you. I\u2019d highly recommend watching her videos, even if you don\u2019t feel inspired to go \u201call-in\u201d yet. She speaks a lot of sense and there\u2019s a lot of support on her channel. As does Elisa Oras. And I totally recommend following body-positive queeeeeens such as Iskra Lawrence and Ashley Graham who radiate beauty.\nYou deserve total nourishment and total health. I know how much work it takes to get from where you\u2019ve been to where you\u2019ve got to and I admire your strength and courage. That\u2019s why I thought it worth mentioning this here, you can get even further when you feel ready. You\u2019ve proved you have it in you to fight and I hope for you that you\u2019ll keep going and keep expanding your comfort zone little by little. It\u2019s really rough that your mum has brought you into her world of insecurities. But that\u2019s her problem and by making yourself healthy and well you\u2019re saying a massive FUCK YOU to her insecurities. Maybe one day she\u2019ll have the courage to fight them too. I love you, you\u2019ve got this. Keep fighting! X",
