  "selftext": "2 years ago I on August 6th at 8:00pm I was in a typical psych ward bedroom. I was crying feeling like a complete failure. My eating disorder was out of control and I was very litterally dying. I cried myself to sleep that night feeling the task before me was unachievable. The dr told me I could leave when I had 100% on most meals and at the time  it felt like he might as well have told me to summit Everest. Today on August 6th I ate a fucking cake. It was great. I didn\u2019t think about the calories. I didn\u2019t calculate how much I\u2019d eaten before that day. I just enjoyed eating food and being with my wife. For those new to recovery please be aware. This is a war. Your vice wants you dead. It will never stop trying to kill you. Never take your boot off its neck. Don\u2019t give the disorder or addiction or whatever a single moment to breath. The moment you do your life is in danger. Fight well my friends. And for those whose tonight is day one I say this. Day one feels like forever, but it isn\u2019t, the sun will rise on day two. The first step in taking back your life. Fight well my friends. ",

I had zero internal motivation. But my girlfriend (now wife) told me we would have to break off if I didn\u2019t seek recovery. I didn\u2019t want to lose her.",
