  "selftext": "My girlfriend was going to kill herself today because her healthcare won\u2019t cover eating disorder rehab and I don\u2019t know what to do\n\nShe wasn\u2019t answering her phone so I went over and let myself in.  She was asleep in bed so I woke her up and she told me she took 5mg of ativan and 4 beers and was just going to sleep all day.  I found a 5 page suicide note detailing her struggle to get into a bulimia program and hoping her death would change the system.  She has been trying for over a year to get into a residential program on Medicare and nobody will take her without like 10k to 30k up front.  I snooped around a little and found all her blankets and pillows in an empty closet with a noose hanging from the door.  She is breathing fine and just sleeping over the pills right now.  I\u2019m probably going to take her to the hospital later but this has happened before and they\u2019ll hold her for a week then let her go and say they can\u2019t help with getting her eating disorder treatment.  I have no idea what to do.  Healthcare is fucked.  I\u2019m in Massachusetts.  I tried to contact Elizabeth Warren directly to no avail.  I am at a loss.  I can be with her until Tuesday to make sure she doesn\u2019t make an attempt but after that I have to go back to work.  I don\u2019t know.",

Her death won\u2019t change the system but if she lives to tell her story of suffering- that will change the system. \n\nTell her that I love her for exactly who she is. I am a fellow ED sufferer who spent a lot of my life being invalidated because I didn\u2019t nearly fit into a diagnosis box for the doctors to check off. \n\nYou matter. She matters. Life gets better once our brains stop trying to kill us.",

      "body": "May I ask what kind of eating disorder she has? That is important when it comes to treating it.\nFor now, try the following \n1. Keep an eye on her and offer any support you can.\n2. There are suicide prevention hotlines - they may know more about possible treatments, it might be worth calling them.\n3. There are self-helping groups, that can help a lot! If there aren't any in your area, there will be some online.\n4. For eating disorders what might help is DBT - dialectic behavioral therapy. Look for books by Marsha Linehan. There are worksheets as well as explanations. \n5. Consider asking friends and relatives for helping with covering the costs. Another option is to directly contact psychologists in your area, ask for a discount or alternatives. They are people as well, and I'm sure you'll find someone willing to help a dying girl! I know it's a terrible feeling, but surely preferable to suicide.\n6. PM me, if there's anything I can do to help.\n\nBest of wishes to you, much love and strength to both you as well as your girlfriend!",

I am extremely concerned about your girlfriend's safety. She really needs inpatient level of care because she is suicidal and making preparations to act (e.g. suicide note, noose in closet) AND taking action (5mg Ativan and 4 beers could be a lethal combo, keep monitoring her breathing). \n\nAt this point, residential treatment is not the best for your girlfriend. Please take her to an ER or call 911. Walden Behavioral Care in Waltham has an inpatient eating disorder unit as well as an inpatient psychiatric unit. The ER can help coordinate transfer to Walden. [https://www.waldeneatingdisorders.com/locations/massachusetts-locations/inpatient/](https://www.waldeneatingdisorders.com/locations/massachusetts-locations/inpatient/)\n\nAll the best to you and your girlfriend.\n\nEdit: grammar",

They have a house where she can live while she goes through treatment. It\u2019s called ACED, or A Center for Eating Disorders. It\u2019s definitely worth looking into, they really helped me. I can\u2019t really say how much it is because I didn\u2019t pay for it so I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m so sorry your girlfriend is going through such a terrible time. I really hope she can get the help she needs.",
