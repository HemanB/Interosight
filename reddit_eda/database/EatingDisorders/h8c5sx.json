  "selftext": "\nevery other day for the past couple of days i\u2019ve gone over my calorie limit and it\u2019s probably gonna happen today as well :/ i was doing much better when i first started cico but i feel like my increased awareness of my bad eating habits is somehow making me even less in control of myself.\n\ni really don\u2019t know what it will take to sort this, i tried not calorie counting at all and ended up eating mindlessly for the entire day (although ironically i didn\u2019t end up going over my limit). i\u2019m supposed to be getting referred to mental health services for another reason and will probably bring this up as well, but i have no idea when it will be. i wish i could just get a new brain or something so i could refresh my entire mindset on food :/\n\ni somewhat feel like even if i could control my eating habits, i sort of feel like i don\u2019t want to? like i could just not go and eat more food, but i\u2019m also not trying that hard to stop myself. i hope that makes sense and doesn\u2019t sound like i\u2019m not being serious\n\ni\u2019ve not been diagnosed with any eating disorder as i\u2019ve not yet properly discussed it with a professional but i really don\u2019t think i have a great relationship with food regardless, i\u2019m lost on where to go from here",
