He just meant her form was good, but for me, I already had noticed how super super super thin she was, and I internalized that as needing to lose lots of weight, and that night after practice \u2014 I skipped dinner. \n\nAnd then I\u2019d go on 3 or 4 hours jogging every single day, even after practice, even late at night or early morning whenever my parents wouldn\u2019t see. And only eating apples and getting really angry if I was expected to eat dinner with the whole family at the table. Totally fasting, and then right before track practice I would eat just a handful of trail mix so I wouldn\u2019t pass out. Soon after the school blood drives, which I always did, began turning me away because of my weight. And that\u2019s how it started for me.",

We found out he had cheated on my mom and it just broke us but we were a good Christian family and we're supposed to put smiles on our face and be happy but I couldn't and I had nowhere for my hurt to go because we were to forgive automatically and whatnot and weren't to speak about it. \nBeing homeschooled, we had no guidance counselors or someone outside of the family to talk to. My eleven year old brain looked at my mom and my family and I noticed a couple of things. My mom was overweight and had been for years and we had no money, it was all food banks, church handouts and whatnot. I realized two things: I needed to be thin and I needed to have money and maybe I would never be cheated on and hurt as bad as I saw my mom struggling. My mom had to stay and couldn't leave because she was a stay at home mom with no resources. She never said this, I overheard a phone conversation. I started restricting then and switched to binge/purge when it became too obvious I wasn't eating. I got praised for eating and I figured, good, I had figured it out \nI put myself through nursing school and made money and was thin, most importantly of course. Unfortunately, I was cheated on and realized it was devastating but it's hard to kick old beliefs that you've lived your life by and built your goals around. I've been with my husband for 15 years now and have had my ED for 24 years. He was the one who cheated on me and while I would never recommend staying in a relationship like that to anyone else, I stayed because I truly didn't know that I deserved better. I still thought there was something wrong with me. Of course I am the way I'm meant to be and no one's actions can determine my worth. I know that now and demand the respect I deserve and give the respect that other people deserve. I realized my dad was a human who made a hurtful mistake, I have also made mistakes and hurt other people. We are all doing our best to learn how to love each other and meet the person across from me where they are at because we all have our secrets and mine made me very sick and vulnerable in an unhealthy relationship in the beginning. Me and my husband have grown up together and he is now my best friend and we can talk about anything while also seeing our separate therapists to talk about trauma and healing. I had significant trauma involving my twin sister that devastated my entire being. We have no kids and want to keep it that way, we spent years fighting to be healthy together and we finally have it and it's the most beautiful thing in the world.",

It's such a blurry memory, like I can't remember when it escalated into the worst but it started by my father dying, as well as a undiagnosed autism disorder.(got diagnosed years later after recovery which explains a lot)\n\nMy father was absent and an alcoholic. Prior to him passing I had made a decision to stick to a harmless diet, and it just went downhill from there after his death, getting more and more obsessive and destructive. Dwelling deep into depression and self hatred. I remember thinking I deserved punishment and was using my ED as a form of self harm and discipline. It turned into some sort of philosophy, like a detox or spiritual cleansing. It was insane. \n\nThen one day I just remember deeply hating my reflection when I no longer could recognize the person In the mirror. I started to avoid looking in the mirror. I felt disgusted by myself, like it was not fun anymore. Like the idea I had of being smaller and how perfect my life would be was far from reality.\n\n I thought I would finally get the confidence to wear pretty tight fitting clothes and dresses when I achieved my goal weight and desired physique. But I never gained any body confidence, and would continue to cover myself up in my old oversized boyish clothes. It was very disappointing and probably the reason I continued to thrive for that promise, that one day I'd feel beautiful and good enough. \n\nMy illness had become visible for all to see and judge. I've never felt so empty and shameful in my entire life. Whenever I would meet people they'd give me concerned and saddened looks, it made me want to hide away from the world. \n\nI constantly made people cry and having them distancing themselves. It was incredibly lonely. \n\nI felt like the only thing I had left that made me feel secure and accomplished was my ED even though it made me feel horrible and ugly looking. It was a distraction from all the pain and hurt I was feeling inside. I remember losing my ability to feel emotions which was a weird experience. I remember trying everything in my power just to feel something again. \n\nIt was a complete heartbreak of a life, Feeling myself turn into a disease and not knowing how to get out or how to stop hurting people.\n\n\nLife is wayy better now. I am happy and grateful to be alive. My grief has been processed and my autism is getting the care it needed after years of battling mental illness. Finally letting myself wear pretty clothes and taking care of myself. Eating guilt free and feeling healthy. Been recovered for 7+ years.",

I wouldn't say i went off the deep end, I've always been quite \"chill\" about it, but i definitely did develop a decently active eating disorder at that point. \n\nIt's kinda come and gone since, but truth be told it's never completely dissapeared. Mostly, again, because i kinda just associate food with feeling bad due to being intolerant to such common ingredients. I'm not even like, thin, just kinda average size. I do think i am not doing very well this very moment, but even now i don't quite regret it even though it has had certain quite clear negatives. I just never did enough to feel like I deserve pity or that it was actually bad. Most of my issues are mental, not physical, yk? And i have always had mental issues, this is not the first, just the only \"actionable\" one. Idk. I know it's bad. Please don't think like i do.",

      "body": "I remember having to clean my plate as a little kid. I couldn't go outside and play until I did. I wanted to play outside so bad that I would force down the food even though I wasn't hungry. The portions became more adult sized and I became a fat kid which lead to being bullied. I stopped eating at school. I started skipping meals at home. I started playing a game with myself of how long could I go without eating and would try to break my own records. I had a fear of public vomit as I had seen quite a few in school, and people would comment on the amount. I had a fear of throwing up, and if I did, I wanted to make sure the amount would be small, so I made sure the amount I would consume in one go was really small in case I ever threw up. I never did. This extreme hunger eventually started the binging. Sometimes, at home, especially with a family that likes to eat large amounts, sometimes I was so hungry I couldn't stop eating until I was sick full. I could never purge, I tried, but couldn't. When I became normal sized and not fat, people treated me so different, they were so nice to me. Its sad. After school was over, and the peer pressure of school was over, the binging happened more often and it was harder to restrict. Its been a lifelong adult battle for a few decades now. Its not fun. Its awful. I got more control over binging now, because of passing out cold one time from binging too hard. It put fear in me, so I never go past a certain limit anymore. Its so much harder to restrict now, its harder to binge now too. Everything is harder now. Getting older is hard, but its a priveledge to age, so I take it one day at a time and try to age with grace.",

It started small, I was eating less and running more it was healthy at first but slowly got worse until I was eating nothing, I started overcompensating and eventually it grew into me eating a little bit and feeling so disgusted with myself that I would throw up everytime I ate or drank anything and continuously got worse.\n\nWhen I realized/start of my recovery \nI saw brye live at a Leanna Firestone concert and everything changed.
