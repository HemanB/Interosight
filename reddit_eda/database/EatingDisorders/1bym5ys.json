I just wish I could live with my eating disorder without the physical repercussions that come along or feeling like I am letting people around me down when I start to relapse. I think if I have a full blown relapse nobody will be there for me this time. My dietitian gave me the ultimatum of hloc or she would terminate and now I\u2019m in a hloc and I can\u2019t do it. I don\u2019t know how to stop this internal feeling of panic. ",
