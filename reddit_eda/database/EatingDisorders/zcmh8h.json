  "title": "I'm tempted to ignore a medical problem because it's making me lose weight",
  "selftext": "For several weeks, I have been frequently nauseous and have no appetite for most of the day. The only thing I found to help was to smoke a bit of weed, which made me think it was partially anxiety-related. But I can't be high all day, so I basically stopped eating during the day and only eat dinner. Not eating after a certain point makes me dizzy and I've fallen down a few times from standing up too quickly. I have also become super susceptible to motion sickness, even from elevators. I switched to a vegan diet a few months ago for ethical reasons, which might have something to do with this, in addition to anxiety. But I am worried something else could also be going on.\n\nLast week, I decided I would make an appointment to see a doctor. But then yesterday, one of my best friends told me that I looked good because I'd lost weight. Now I'm scared to gain it back because I know she'll notice. This friend is older and like a big sister to me and I value her opinion. She also has ED history, and is significantly underweight now. She restricts to stay at what she feels is a \"safe\" weight, and it's sometimes hard to listen to her describe her strategies and encourage me to try them. For example, staving off hunger after a workout by eating an apple.\n\nI am at a healthy/athletic weight now, but I have a long history of anorexia/extreme restriction, and used to be dangerously thin (didn't have a period for years, developed stomach ulcers, overall unhealthy). It's always difficult not to compare myself to how thin I've been in the past, especially when weight loss is encouraged by someone I love. So much so that I am considering leaving these symptoms untreated. I know that I would never stand to let someone I love do this, but obviously it's different when it's myself. I guess I need to hear some objective, sensical opinions.",

I\u2019m still in denial about having an ED because it\u2019s mostly due to being too anxious, over stimulated, or hyper focused to eat and anything non liquid makes me gag. But\u2026I can\u2019t lie, I\u2019ve lost about 30 pounds and want to lose more and know this can be my \u201cexcuse\u201d. I met up with a really good friend the other day to walk (again, something I genuinely do because I enjoy it not to burn calories) who I hadn\u2019t seen in about a year and she went on about \u201ctiny\u201d I\u2019d gotten. It made me really happy because I feel like I look the same unless I see an old picture. \n\nI feel like if this were to get worse it\u2019ll still take people a while to notice something\u2019s up, because I\u2019m only 5ft so I just look more proportionate now. \n\nI\u2019m vegan for ethical reasons as well (2 years for me, and I\u2019ve had this issue a couple years ago when I was still omni so I don\u2019t think it has anything to do with my diet) which also can make it harder to detect because people just assume if you\u2019re not eating in public it\u2019s because there\u2019s nothing to eat or you could say people say rude things about your food so you prefer to only eat at home or something. \n\nThe last couple days I\u2019ve only gotten down a couple Luna bars and pea protein shakes, and some Brussels sprouts from work, and just had a little of Whole Foods vegan mac. I was really dizzy today but I\u2019ve just been so anxious lately. I don\u2019t know why. \n\nDid you ever figure out if it\u2019s a physical medical problem I should look into or just anxiety and adrenaline?",
