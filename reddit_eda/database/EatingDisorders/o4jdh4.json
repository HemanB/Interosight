  "title": "Request: What can I do about my Binge eating?",
  "selftext": " \n\nHi, long story. I was always big, over the course of a year or so i lost a massive amount of weight, made bad choices in the way i lost it etc. I've maintained my love for fitness and not just for looks but also performance. I occasionally binged, once a month to maybe once a week etc etc. Now I'm lucky if i can go 2 days without binging. I've tried everything - stopped and started calorie counting countless times, read and tried to utilise books, researched online etc. I've lost hope. I haven't regained all the weight, only about a quarter of it so far. But it's killing me seeing myself undo the one good thing i was proud of. The depression is coming back and I feel completely and utterly helpless. This is my first time making a post on here - reddit has helped with any other questions I have. Can it help here? Anything appreciated. Thank you",

      "body": "What worked for me was letting go of trying to \u201csolve\u201d my binge eating problem, and letting go of trying to identify my triggers in the hope of being able to expertly avoid them. \n\nI treated it as a deep-rooted pattern in my brain that would always be there. If I deprived myself or tried dieting, the binge frequency would increase. So I stopped dieting, stopped calorie counting, threw out my scale, and just ate what I wanted to make sure I never felt deprived.\n\nIt started off with me eating whatever I wanted with unhealthy choices, but eventually morphed into eating whatever I wanted with healthier choices. It was a razor\u2019s edge though. If I forced myself too soon to eat healthy, that sense of deprivation came up and I binged. It took about 6 months to end all desire to ever binge again.\n\nI still eat emotionally sometimes. That will always be there and I\u2019m okay with it. But when binging stopped, I eventually (took a year) stabilized at a healthy weight.\n\nI know you said you\u2019ve read books, but just in case you haven\u2019t yet, try looking for books that use this approach I\u2019ve described.",

      "body": "the only thing that ever helped me with binge eating was eating multiple times a day like meal, snack, meal, snack, meal snack and also allowing myself to eat any foods i wanted. and like normal portions. it took a long time. it\u2019s not like after one day the binge eating stopped, it took a while for my brain to be like okay i\u2019m getting enough food and all the foods i want everyday.  it\u2019s hard to force yourself to eat like that because it can feel like you\u2019re eating a lot or if you\u2019re still binging at first that you shouldn\u2019t continue eating like normal because you need to somehow make up for the binge eating but it gets easier. then eventually you can eat more intuitively and stuff. idk if you\u2019ve tried this but it definitely helped me in the past! i hope things get better for you \u2665\ufe0f",

There\u2019s this YouTube channel-Linda Sun, her videos helped too. Hope this helps!",

      "body": "So I\u2019m not at all a professional. At all. And I\u2019ve suffered with both binging and restricting so I\u2019m not the worlds best. But, for me personally, my binging is rooted in the fact I grew up poor with locks on the fridge. I became an emotional eater. When I\u2019m financially stable and able to buy 3-4 of every item, multiple bags of granola or multiple boxes of ice cream etc, I stopped. This may not work for someone who binges for different reasons as it may be enabling that, but for me having access to a ton of food made eating less way easier. And I have to slow down over time. I went from gigantic plates full of heavy food to slightly smaller meals, and I mean SLIGHTLY. I had to do it slowly so my stomach stopped wanting so much, and now if I look at a plate of what I ate in December I\u2019d probably be able to only touch a quarter of it. It took telling myself I\u2019m allowed to buy more food and that food wasn\u2019t a finite resource to stop me from filling myself with literally all the food I saw. I also remind myself that my body is beautiful. It survived a pandemic. I remind myself of the things I learned in therapy and with my dietitian, and I don\u2019t restrict so much it triggers a huge binge. It helped so much.",
