  "selftext": " Am I experiencing extreme hunger?\n\nHello, I may not have an ed as long as some others does, but when I realized I been dealing with anorexia and orthorexia for a couple months I decided to start recovery. But I am very scared and honesty confused about what is happening, the urge to eat more and feeling not satisfied, although i am full and already ate a meal. This been happening since like the first day I started recovery which is like a few months ago and I am already weight restored. it feels like binging.\n\nIs this normal? Does anyone have advice?",

As you put more food in, your body needs more as your metabolism is kicking back on. Be sure to stay hydrated. You should seek help as refeeding is extremely difficult alone.",

      "body": "Extreme hunger. It doesn't matter what your weight is. If you have been in a negative energy balance for a prolonged period of time and/or restricting calories and/or certain foods, extreme hunger can occur during recovery. \n\nEvery resource I have seen has always said to give in and eat completely unrestricted. You might gain some weight, but that could be temporary and just there while your body heals. Also, bloating during this time can make you look like you gained weight, but it might just be water.\n\nI certainly had extreme hunger when recovering from my relapse with anorexia, and I would eat a meal, and feel like I didn't eat anything. I fought that feeling hard and just developed new weird eating habits, and therefore my extreme hunger lasted years. If you lean into it and just accept this phase of recovery, it will not last nearly as long",

I got over my extreme hunger by following a regular and scheduled diet planned by professional therapists who are specialized in treating ED's.",

      "body": "When I recovered I did spiral down into binging SO keep an eye on it BUT ALSO your body needs more than just weight. You\u2019re also missing lots of other good things that your body needs. Try to figure out what those things are based on your cravings. Sweets? Maybe you need more protein or maybe your pancreas is still catching up to your glucose levels. Salty? Maybe your electrolytes are still learning to manage. Carbs? Maybe you need more healthy starches. If you can adjust WHAT you are eating to satisfy the needs of your body then you won\u2019t intake too much volume and feel like you\u2019ve binged. You\u2019ll feel a normal satiated state and it really will help you maintain your health. \n\nAlso, a dietician is a wonderful thing to have. They can give you more specific ideas of what your body is trying to tell you.",

      "body": "If you are not seeing a dietician then you should. Congrats for making progress. It\u2019s a big deal and your body will need time to adjust, but something that was important to me was learning that being at a \u201cnormal/healthy\u201d bmi does not mean you are weight restored. Weight restoration is not a cut and dry journey of getting to a \u201chealthy\u201d bmi especially if you are young. My bmi never left the healthy range, but I was diagnosed with anorexia (age 17) because of how quickly I lost weight and how much it deviated from what was expected based on my growth chart. When they told me they wanted me to gain weight after a bit of time in treatment, my mom told me I could leave if I wanted. Even people who are not disordered were so confused by this and thought it was absurd. Society has convinced a lot of people that weighing less is worth being mentally ill and/or suffering. It\u2019s not about being in the average healthy range for someone of you height and age, it\u2019s about being in the healthy range for your own body. \n\nThere is also something called \u201covershooting\u201d which suggests that your body is going to demand more resources(weight) for awhile to repair any damage and get prepared for another famine since biologically that is what your body thinks has happened, and then your weight will settle back down to its own happy place after it\u2019s gone awhile without any disruptions to the food supply. If you don\u2019t show it that there is in fact plenty of food then it might not let go of this extra hunger. \n\nIt\u2019s really hard to navigate even with an entire treatment team. I hope you can keep up the good work towards being mentally and physically healthy. \u2764\ufe0f",

I wake up with deadly hunger pangs that make my stomach sick to the point I cant eat anything and it becomes a crippling cycle. Casein lets my body have protein in the reserves for the next 8 hours so my brain doesnt send the pain signal to my stomach. Now I have been able to eat breakfast in the mornings, lunch and dinner. My portions are still too small for a guy who should be over 200lbs but im making progress. Im hoping I can start eating big and lifting big weights by the summer next year. Just dont give up on recovery.",
