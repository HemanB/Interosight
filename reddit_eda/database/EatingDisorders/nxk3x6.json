  "title": "Request: How can I help my 13 year old daughter",
  "selftext": " \n\nI have recently found out that my daughter (13) has been avoiding eating, and purging if she does eat. Her mom and I have had a talk with her, and she seems like she wants to recover. We have already helped her find a therapist, and have her first appointment scheduled. I'm hoping to find information on how to make this as easy as possible on her. How could I cook for her? Should I push her to tell me what she wants from the grocery store, or just stock the house with food I know she likes? How can I keep up with what's going on with her without making it feel like I'm invading her privacy constantly? Are there any podcasts/reading/any other information for not only her, but her mom and I, too? I have already started listening to Food Psych, which has a lot of useful information. Thank you.",

Thank you.\n\nHaving been the girl with eating disorders and now the person who loves helping parents navigate the waters, my #1 piece of advice from both sides of the coin is ask your daughter what works best for her. There's no way to know what will help her unless you ask the one who's needing the help.\n\n\\#1A piece of advice is always speak your truth with love and respect to your daughter. Tell her EVERYTHING about what you're experiencing, but do it using \"I\" statements: \"I love you so much, and I want to do everything I can to help. You know what though? I have no idea what I'm doing. Can we make a deal that we talk about this so we can work through it together? We might have to have some tough conversations, but I'm willing to stick it out because I don't want you to go through this feeling alone. We might get frustrated with each other along the way, but again, it's only because I want to understand and don't at the time. So I'll need you to help me and let me know when I've crossed the line or said something that I probably shouldn't have. I can't know what I don't know till I know it, so please help me know what I need to know, yeah?\"\n\nPlus there's no way to plan ahead for next month or next week for that matter. Your daughter will be a different person as she goes through recovery, and you'll get to be learning her all over again. The beauty is you'll get to spend time with, support, and encourage her authentic self, so you'll be doing some growing through this as well.\n\nNone of you will come out on the other side of this the same. That's why communication is NON-NEGOTIABLE. It's your superpower as well as your weapon of warfare. Over use it!",

I guess how I think of the word is that it means that there\u2019s nothing wrong with the way I look, that healthy means whatever shape or size I am that it\u2019s my natural body. I\u2019m not starving myself or overeating but rather I\u2019m taking care of my body and I guess that word just made sense to me",

I would recommend stocking the fridge with food she likes as well as healthy snacks! She\u2019ll be less likely to want to purge if she\u2019s eating \u2018low calorie\u2019 healthy snacks. Hopefully this will encourage her to like eating again. When you see she\u2019s getting comfortable with the thought of having a consistent eating habit she\u2019ll hopefully start to lose the hate for food and this idea she needs to look a certain way.
