So proud of you. Each victory is some more territory gained and it will get easier if you keep pushing yourself. You've got this!",

Sometimes it hurts to hear people's stories who are still so deep in the disease. But man I love to celebrate people's victories. Congratulations stranger! Keep up the hard work. It may be the pregnancy hormones but I have some happy tears for you today!!!",
