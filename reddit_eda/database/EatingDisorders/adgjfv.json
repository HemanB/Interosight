  "selftext": "I was doing so well with recovery. I felt myself bearing relapse though. Now Im staying with my boyfriend and his family at their house for a week and I can\u2019t bring myself to eat. It\u2019s been 2 days so far and the most I\u2019ve had was a bite of the dinner on my plate last night.\n\nI\u2019m too embarrassed to admit I\u2019m hungry. I tried eating the food on my plate last night for dinner but each time I put food on my fork, I felt like I could throw up. I can\u2019t get over this anxiety I get around eating. Food feels like the enemy.\n\nI want so desperately to be on track with my recovery, but I\u2019m losing right now. My boyfriend doesn\u2019t know about my problem. I have no one to talk to about this. How can I get over this feeling for now? I can\u2019t do this for a week. I really don\u2019t want to blackout from hunger here.",

Could you snack on some nuts or something like that? If you can find a window of time alone, would you be able to eat something small? Hang in there OP, it will get easier I promise, but for now you just need fuel, somehow.",

Rest. Keep up your daily routine and hygiene. If eating is hard, make sure you\u2019re very hydrated and supplement with electrolytes if needed. ",

I start feeling like I will be sick even before I see the food...only the smell makes me want to throw up...and then I pass all the sweating, being really warm and suddenly shivering and being very cold and most of the times I try to force myself to have some food and I end up getting sick)...\n\n\nI do not have a solution but to avoid blacking out for hunger I always have some chocolate/sweets I can put in my mouth to keep myself going.... usually after all the anxiety and the feeling sick has gone I find a really quiet place to eat alone (in my car, in a pub with litterally no one else, in a remote location in a park where I can't see other people)...\n\nI also try to get food I can eat a little and then pack to keep eating after 2 - 3 hours (wraps, sandwiches, soups)...\n\n\n",

It doesn't feel like 'eating', it doesn't make you feel full, but it will give you some basic calories for your body to run on. \n\nGood luck. ",

Does he know you have already gotten treatment? You obviously mean a great deal to him or you wouldn't be spending a week with his family. I think the suggestions listed are really good so to add to it, maybe you can \"come down with something\" which will give you time to regroup and your bf can bring you broth or jello or whatever it is that can fuel you. It's okay to ask for help. Best of luck to you. Our hearts are with you.",

      "body": "What works best for me is eating a small healthy snack that I enjoy eating around 2 to 300 calories or so. A piece of fruit with some peanut butter or a slice of whole wheat toast with some cheese or something. That way I can tell myself that I am eating this to fuel my body. If at all possible, take a multivitamin along with this small snack/meal (be sure to add some sort of fat source, as some vitamins are fat-soluble). \n\nIt's as others have pointed out, food is fuel and you need fuel to keep going. Just try to make sure that this food source right now is as nutrient rich as possible so you're getting the most out of it, which is not only physically better for you right now, but should also 'feel' better as well, because you're actually feeding your body some proper fuel.

I've been with the same person for a decade and he's always really sensitive about how hard it is for me to eat in front of people. Also that I never really think about eating so I often need reminding if we're busy. And that I have a lot of GI issues so I get afraid to eat and can't eat all kinds of stuff to begin with. \n\nHe does make fun of me about my food allergies and sensitivities, but that's just how he is, it makes me laugh so I guess it's ok. He also thinks I'm crazy and that no one is watching me eat too, but he's been humoring me and being generally a good sport about it for a really long time now. Including doing stuff like stopping somewhere after we go out with friends to get takeout for me to eat at home because I can't always eat even with people I've known for more than a decade. ",

      "body": "Hi this was my post. I meant to come back and update sooner. Thank you everyone for your advice and support. You all know as well as I do how hard it can be to deal with an ED, especially in social contexts. All the advice offered to me here helped so much. After the first few days of living off coffee and some chocolate that I could easily eat unseen, I was able to get myself to eat a little to stop from feeling sick. It was a lot easier to eat when I was just with my boyfriend, so I tried to eat a bit more while with him and eat at least a little at family meals.\nI thankfully made it through the week eating enough to feel good. I\u2019m starting to feel a bit more comfortable about eating around his family as long as no attention is brought to me. Thank you all so so much for your help and care. To all you struggling too, my hope is with you for your recovery. ",
