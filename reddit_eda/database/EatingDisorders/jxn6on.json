  "title": "Request: (post request) finally admitted I needed help",
  "selftext": "after years of struggling with my eating (I am unsure what a crippling fear of gaining weight, skipping meals/cutting down on my food intake, and avoiding certain foods would be classified as, but hopefully I'll receive a diagnosis), I finally got honest with my parents and therapists. I still dont feel like my parents fully care or believe that I'm struggling, but thankfully they go along with whatever my therapists and I agree upon.\n\nI have an intake for an IOP program next Wednesday. reading these posts have honestly helped a lot and gave me a sense of community and a place where I felt like I belonged. thank you :')",

Just know that people don't understand. Some try their very best and still don't get it. It's a learning process and one that has no deadline. Best of luck to you. IOP was the best thing I ever did for myself.",
