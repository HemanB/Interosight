  "selftext": " \n\nI\u2019m having a really hard time not giving in to my urges. I wanted to post this to see if anybody had some advice.\n\nI\u2019ve  been in recovery for a bit over three years. Only reason I stopped was  because I got pregnant. I gained a lot of weight during pregnancy, still have a  lot of it. I\u2019m struggling not to give back in and start up again. I\u2019m  falling back into more restrictive eating patterns and every time I  loose a little bit of weight, it gets worse. I can\u2019t lose weight without  triggering myself but I can\u2019t stay the same either. Any advice or words  of comfort? \u2639\ufe0f",

My advice is to do things that you enjoy, and would do even if it had no effect on weight loss or weight gain. I learned how to cook plant-based meals. I took up weight lifting before the pandemic started. I do yoga. Some days are easier than others.",

I'm no expert and still struggle a lot but these are things I know help me: \n\n- Try to be good to your body and respect it. Feed it foods that make it happy rather than things that you personally tell yourself is acceptable. I.e telling yourself NO CARBS ALLOWED just have things in moderation like your body actually wants. If you don't know too much about it there's lots of information online about what you should eat in a day. Your mood will probably improve naturally too which will help the way you think about things! \n\n- Stay away from checking yourself in the mirror to look for body changes. I know it's easier said than done but really try, it takes some pressure off. Then anything positive that comes will be a nice surprise rather than waiting and punishing yourself to try and get to a certain point. \n\n- Try to find some healthy recipes or exercises that you actually enjoy. Overall you want to try and look at the whole weight loss thing in a more positive, fun and rewarding way. \n\nWith eating disorders you put an enormous amount of pressure on yourself and it's so draining and tiring. Love yourself as best you can because you have one life, fuck what anyone thinks. We don't realise that actually people don't look at us half as much as we think they do, it's sort of one of those things our eating disorders tell us to keep us under. \n\nGood luck I wish you all the very best x",

      "body": "I know this isn\u2019t what you want to hear, but there isn\u2019t a way to intentionally lose weight without triggering yourself. Any attempt at intentionally losing weight will be triggering to someone with an eating disorder. \n\nSo what to do? Like you said, you have pregnancy weight you\u2019re hoping to lose. What I would recommend is getting rid of the weight loss goals entirely and focus on eating intuitively, making decisions to engage in healthy habits, and work on losing any preoccupation with regaining your pre-baby body. Your body is never going to look like it did before you were pregnant, and that is NORMAL. Bodies change. Anyone who tells you differently is selling something. \n\nYou can read more about intuitive eating, it\u2019s the best method of eating disorder recovery. It takes a lot of practice, and it can be scary and uncomfortable in the beginning, but it\u2019s a small price to pay for true recovery from eating disorders. It requires giving up goals of weight loss, giving up categorizing foods as \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d, and giving up guilt about how much or what you eat. \n\nHow is this healthy? Because once you stop restricting yourself from certain foods, they lose their appeal. Yes, when you first start intuitive eating, you\u2019ll probably eat more desserts (or just eat more). This is a necessary part of the process. Your body has to learn that it\u2019s *allowed* to eat what it wants. You have to learn not to feel guilty for what you eat. You have to learn to listen to your body. It sounds too good to be true, but it works.\n\nInstead of making weight loss your goal, why not make health a goal? Instead of making choices with weight loss in mind, make choices with your health in mind. Get in exercise because it makes your body feel good and it\u2019s good for your heart instead of because you want to lose weight. You might lose weight anyway, but it\u2019s not guaranteed. (It\u2019s never guaranteed, even when weight loss is your goal.) But if weight loss isn\u2019t your goal, just health, you vastly reduce your risk of triggering yourself.",

      "body": "If you have an eating disorder there is absolutely no way to simultaneously restrict and not fall back into old behaviors. You must give up this idea. And to be clear, the disordered eating will always come back when you invite it in. \n\nAn alternative approach may be to think of a \"diet\" more as the typical foods you regularly consume, and not so much as a set of restrictions, rules, or planning meals with a certain portion size or number of calories. \n\nEspecially when we are with our families, I think it is easy to repeatedly eat foods which tend to lack nutrients. If you're making sure you get the foundation foods that really feed your body well, you're going to feel better and probably notice your body function more efficiently. But again, in my mind this is not based at all on restriction. I still eat whatever, but I always try to get several servings of fresh fruit, veggies, and protein. If I want more and can still get those things I don't worry about it.\n\nWhat we are is what we do repeatedly. If you make it a habit to get more nutrient rich foods (vitamins and minerals) as the core of what you eat, whatever else you may enjoy won't be as impactful and you may even feel less need for restriction or binging, and less stressed about it.\n\nDon't \"diet.\" Don't weigh yourself. Those things just invite bad habits. Think of all the positive changes you have made. Know that your body, that has gotten you this far and given you your child. It is strong and good and deserves to be loved on. Eating well is an act of love for yourself and your family. Moving your body in ways that you *enjoy* and *feel good* is also an act of love. Taking care of your mental/emotional health is an act of love. It won't change your body shape, or mood, or make you wealthy and able to leape tall buildings in a single bound, but doing these things repeatedly most of the time will make you feel better and better most of the time. \n\nWhenever in doubt, talk to your trusted therapist or medical professional. Lots of love to you!",

All food is good for you.\n\nHope this helps. If you ever find that you are going down the path again, stop. Stop doing everything and wait until your ready. Every body size can be healthy.",

I find that super helpful because he shows how your weight can spike and \"woosh\" downward and that is the process.) He is very no bs. I like him a lot.",
