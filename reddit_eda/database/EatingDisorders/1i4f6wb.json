  "selftext": "Many times you have probably told yourself or others have told you,\u201cI did this to myself. Why can't I stop?!\u201d \u201cYou are only hurting yourself. Why are you choosing to hurt yourself?\u201d \n\nThese thoughts only increase the shame, guilt, hopelessness, and overwhelm that comes with dealing with ED behaviors. It only strengthens the ED voice, keeping you in the vicious cycle.\n\nBut the truth is. IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT. \n\nIn my recovery journey, I had to understand the purpose the ED was serving in my life. Your ED has become a coping mechanism. It is how your brain thinks is the only way to keep you safe. This is why many of us have such a hard time letting go of our ED. \n\nHow do you think changing the way you see your ED can help you in recovery?",

Why can\u2019t I stop!?\u201d Many people are told, \u201cJust try harder not to b/p.

At the end of the day, we can only control ourselves and true recovery only starts when WE say-we want out and actively work towards it. You are not alone <3",

I have days where I don't think about my issues with it at all, and that's what its about for me. One day you will wake up and realise that you haven't wanted to restrict for a while, and hopefully when that day comes you won't want to start again.\n\nI still have bouts of it, last year I relapsed badly for months on end which only ended when I went onto different (but not better) coping mechanisms. The urge has come back sometimes in the last few months but it has only had power over me for weeks rather than months or years. I'm not scared of food anymore, I'm mostly just very neutral on it nowadays not particularly enjoying food, but not having a breakdown when I know I've had over x amount of calories in a day. I guess I stopped judging myself as harshly.\n\nHow's recovery treating you?",

      "body": "Thank you for sharing! Recovery might look different for some ppl and that is okay, b/c our lives are so different and what DOES matter is that you keep trying! You CAN beat this!\u00a0\n\nI know in my experience, when I was struggling the most with mental health-that is when the binging and purging was BAD. I started the bulimic behaviors when I was 15 until I was 27 yrs old-2 yrs ago. Throughout those yrs my ED would fluctuate with how loud it was and the behaviors. I am happy to say I am recovered and have not purged for over 2 yrs!\n\nCongrats on your progress! That is powerful that if it does come back, it is not for long and you can pull yourself out of it. On days when you don\u2019t think about food much- what do you do to not be so judgmental and help give you peace of mind?",

That's why for many of us it is a coping tool. \n\nIt is powerful you have overcame those behaviors! What did recovery look like for you? <3",

          "body": "I wouldn't say I'm fully recovered but I don't think anyone ever will be if they have restricted on and off for a decade like I have. That brainworm has dug deep in my brain. I'd say its more to do with how often it feels like I'm thinking about food, especially if those thoughts are self judgemental. I have days where I don't think about my issues with it at all, and that's what its about for me. One day you will wake up and realise that you haven't wanted to restrict for a while, and hopefully when that day comes you won't want to start again.\n\nI still have bouts of it, last year I relapsed badly for months on end which only ended when I went onto different (but not better) coping mechanisms. The urge has come back sometimes in the last few months but it has only had power over me for weeks rather than months or years. I'm not scared of food anymore, I'm mostly just very neutral on it nowadays not particularly enjoying food, but not having a breakdown when I know I've had over x amount of calories in a day. I guess I stopped judging myself as harshly.\n\nHow's recovery treating you?",

With the post, I wanted to speak to the ppl who have been invalidated-maybe they are facing relapse, having a hard time wanting to recover, or maybe they are holding on to their ED. There is a reason why- (from my experience) I used to think b/p were THE ONLY THINGS that could give me true relief from the overwhelming feelings I was experiencing. It was my coping mechanism-when I started to look at it like this, it allowed me to validate myself with, \"okay, I can work on building the healthy skills to eventually let this go.\"\n\nWhat has been your experience with a recovery journey? <3",
