  "selftext": " \n\nThis is a big deal for me. I am a chronic binge/restrict dieter and today I was still \"hungry\" and having cravings after dinner. I went into the cabinet and actually ate one serving of candy. I know this sounds crazy and unimportant but it's a milestone for me. I'm not eating all the candy in the cupboard.\n\nMost importantly, I'm not hating myself for eating a couple pieces. It was within my calorie/macros for the day. This will be okay! I can do this!",
