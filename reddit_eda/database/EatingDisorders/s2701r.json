  "title": "Request: my girlfriend is recovering from an eating disorder and I\u2019m kind of scared",
  "selftext": " \n\nSo I recently started dating this girl who confessed to me that she used to have an eating disorder, that she would count the calories of every single thing she ate and even induced herself to vomit. I felt horrible when she confessed this to me and I tried to be as understanding as possible, and it seems I\u2019ve done a good job, but I\u2019m still not sure. She has expressed concerns about her looks, she has told me she is fat when she really isn\u2019t, perhaps not skinny, but not fat at all. Also saying she has no boobs, things like that. I have told her many, many times that her body is beautiful in every way and that I think she is perfect no matter what she looks like. She has seemed to make a lot of progress, especially because she hasn\u2019t made those kind of comments in a while. Still, I am scared to talk with her about topics like diets, calories, anything that could make her start thinking about those things again.\n\nI guess my question is: what are the things I absolutely should NOT do/say to her, and what should I do/say to her?",

      "body": "One thing I think people misunderstand is the idea that it is helpful to tell people with ED that they look good/not fat/etc etc. or to try to convince them to change their mind on their opinion of their own body. One of the healthiest things you can do for someone with ED is stop talking about bodies at all. Even yours, or other peoples. Even good things. Body talk- both good and bad- has become such a constant part of our culture and it plays a big role in ED. When you comment on anyones body in any way, it reflects the notion that body appearances matter to you. People with ED hear that, and it has an impact on them.\n\nSo start teaching yourself to stop that. Grab a journal and jot down ways to compliment or talk about your gf, yourself, and others, in ways that have nothing to do with bodies. Think about those things, and practice it. This stuff will go a long way to helping your gf feel safe around you, and it\u2019s something that is helpful to everyone around you. Think of things people had control over- commenting on peoples body is making a judgement call on something they had no choice in. \n\nExample: \u2018that dress makes you look fierce!\u2019 \n                \u2018I dig your new piercing!\n                \u2018she looks stylish as hell.\u2019 \n\u2018Did you see that dudes haircut?

I think it may actually be in the \u201cparent toolkit\u201d(looks like page 12 of the pdf).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFrom my perspective as someone with an ED: don\u2019t talk about dieting, calories, weight, other people\u2019s bodies, etc. My ED is triggered by numbers and high stress, especially together. I relapsed when I experienced 2 back to back deaths in the middle of a stressful semester at college, and then my bf bought a scale after I\u2019d requested he not(it took me 15-16 years to let go of my scale- I happily smashed it and had a few years of health lol). I knew I couldn\u2019t have it in the house especially during a relapse. I think I may have gotten out of it easier had I not known my weight. I saw how much I\u2019d lost out of depression, and became obsessed with seeing how far it could drop. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI feel very uncomfortable when he and others talk about dieting, weight loss, or even do exactly what I do and criticize their bodies. \nI agree to not tell her she\u2019s \u201cnot skinny but not fat\u201d. My bf said something like that to me when I was underweight(I am very short so I guess I didn\u2019t look as thin as I was, but still). He unknowingly did and said a lot of things that ended up sticking with me.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen you compliment your gf(and others even), it might also be good to compliment her on non-weight aspects of herself. If she says she looks fat \u201cI don\u2019t think so\u201d should be sufficient. Of course, it may be best to ask her the question you posted here.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn the end, even if you said she looked skinny it wouldn\u2019t be helpful. When my bf did say I looked very thin, I found it motivating, or my mind would twist things to think he was lying. When I clearly wasn\u2019t thin and he\u2019d say that, I started suspecting that he was just lying. At some points I thought I looked awful; my butt went concave at my LW and I complained about it and he said it looked fine. That made me think maybe I was delusional and looked healthy but thought I looked thinner. He later said he was worried but didn\u2019t know what to say. I can imagine that position must be very difficult. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI don\u2019t blame him in any of those incidents, the situation is complex. It was a mess. I try not to complain about my body as much right now, but of course it\u2019s very hard not to.",

Those things are particularly triggering to people with eating disorders.\n\nKeep encouraging her, if she needs to talk about it be there for her but don't 'over' control her either - it doesn't help if someone is constantly watching what you eat.

It shows that you\u2019re a caring person who wants to learn. \n\nEveryone has different \u201ctriggers\u201d but in general, I would NOT comment on anybody\u2019s body size/weight. Many people, even people without eating disorders could do without these topics of discussion. Same with talk about \u201cgood\u201d vs. \u201cbad\u201d foods/food judgements, portion sizes, etc. Attaching judgement to food and/or the body can affect different people in harmful ways. For example, I have an eating disorder, my mom does not. However, my dad made a comment about my mom\u2019s portion size and it was hurtful to her even though she doesn\u2019t have an eating disorder. \n\nGood things to do are to maybe ask your girlfriend if she has any triggers you should avoid or that she wants you to know about, ask how you can support her. Don\u2019t be afraid to be honest about your own concerns, worries and needs. Beyond that, I think just talking about normal things helps. I had a boyfriend who I didn\u2019t tell about my eating disorder early on, but he still supported me by picking up on the fact that I was anxious after eating (even if he didn\u2019t know why) and bringing up a subject that he knew I loved. We talked about that and the distraction really helped me feel calmer.",

As a rule, conversations about weight, calories, healthy/unhealthy food or habits orbody appearance is not particularly helpful (for anyone really!) and it doesn't matter if it's a comment in relation to her or someone else. \n\nSometimes I find that I can becomes preoccupied with food and at those times struggle to eat, so one of my friends has helped me to learn to cook and prepare tasty meals. It's a fun thing to do together and might take away some fear with food (this is my personal experience, so definitely worth a conversation first!) \n\nI think for me the important thing is being there for her, listening non-judgementally and compassionately. It's not a choice and is exhausting, and when you have an ED you can feel judged all the time by yourself yourself well-meaning others. Sometimes if I'm struggling my friends will ask me \"solution or strop\" where they will either help me problem solve or let me rant and they listen and agree with my moaning! \n\nYou're in a tough position, but clearly care enough to reach out to support her. Keep the lines of communication open, if you notice signs of relapse, talk to her about her feelings (not food/eating habits) and reiterate that you want to help. You'll probably make a few mistakes along the way, but she will feel better for the fact that you are keen to support her.\n\nGood luck to the both of you \ud83d\ude0a",

When you comment on anyones body in any way, it reflects the notion that body appearances matter to you.

          "body": "as someone that struggles with disordered eating and has a very caring fianc\u00e9. i could share some things my fianc\u00e9 does with me. so my fianc\u00e9 was in the room when my weight was mentioned through drs of them expressing concern so she became latched onto the idea of helping me get better. she\u2019s had friends that have struggled with eds so i guess it was much easier for her to handle me. the biggest thing she did was help me with meal plans. which consisted of smaller meals and also bringing protein smoothies into the mix of things. if i ever appeared to be getting fixated on anything, she would usually catch on and actually not even mention it. her thing she likes to do is talk to me about something interesting. something she knows i\u2019ll pay attention to instead of overthinking. then with any form of fear foods, she would help me through them by eating with me. no matter how long it took. she has always been patient with me. when i started putting on weight, she wouldn\u2019t acknowledge it unless if i said something myself. there was points where i would literally stare at myself and find things to nitpick at myself about but she prevented that. she caught on to me living in baggy clothes would help so she would sometimes just put me in one of her hoodies and sweatpants. which would definitely be big on me with her being taller than me but it took my mind off of that. as i\u2019ve gotten mentally better, she did eventually start to acknowledge it but as \u201chappy weight\u201d since my mental health was obviously improving itself. she would be there for me through my therapy sessions and everything too. for me, i sort of had to stay in supervision with drs. like i was able to be at home with her but like there was constant dr appointments mostly because she wanted to just make sure everything is okay internally. which helped me a lot since i do battle with health anxiety also. another thing that really helped me that she did was that she would allow \u201cbad days\u201d with food but she would make sure i didn\u2019t make it a habit. basically that i wasn\u2019t falling backwards. which is something she honestly has remained passive aggressive about but i know i understand where it\u2019s coming from. only wouldn\u2019t recommend that since your girlfriend appears a little fragile at the moment. it\u2019s been a little over 4 months of me taking recovery seriously and it\u2019s actually been somewhat good. i tend to feel a lot more confident in it alone from being in her care bc i know she will catch me if i fall backwards. so the best thing i could say about this, just be a safe space for her. communication can really help through this part. learning what she\u2019s sensitive about and what is okay to talk about can really help. if she ever does come off as \u201cstubborn\u201d don\u2019t take it personally. it is usually the guilt trip that comes with it, especially if she is very self aware that something isn\u2019t right. just simply being there can help. \n\ni wish you guys the best! \u2764\ufe0f",

          "body": "not exactly, that\u2019s only because me and her always been extremely transparent. like that was always apart of us. when it came down to my eating disorder, there wasn\u2019t really much said, it was just the whole \u201cyou need to get better and i\u2019m here for you\u201d because her thing was for me to understand i\u2019m not about to go through it alone. there was only like one time she triggered me, unintentionally, she was trying to be happy about weight i put on. i spoke to her about it and haven\u2019t had a problem since, she learned to express happiness about it without being too direct with what\u2019s going on. i also had a journey of kind of figuring out what even caused my eating disorder to get so bad, pinpointing triggers basically. a lot of it had to do with the environment i was in during high school so there\u2019s not really a way that will happen again. there wasn\u2019t much for her to say, other than getting the help that i need to fully recover. there are some points where she\u2019s learned to dial back the passive aggressive thing, usually on my not so great days, she\u2019s learned to become comforting in that manner. i\u2019ve been slowly not having to be fully dependent on her, if that makes sense? for me in the beginning i had zero hunger signals so i used to have to depend on her to remind me to eat something small basically every hour. now i\u2019m starting to get more into intuitive eating instead of having to plan all the time. \n\ndefinitely talk to them about everything, if you can. it\u2019s important to understand the person specifically instead of a bigger base because everyone is different. some people are more sensitive, some are not. i know for me and my wife, we\u2019ve just always had transparency and deep conversations apart of our friendship that eventually led into the romantic relationship we started. \n\nsome of the basic things are usually to not mention weight, how their body physically looks, how much they\u2019re eating, those kind of things. i know you may not mean any harm, because my wife used to do the same, but in the brain of a person with an ed, it triggers the little voice in our heads to just completely stop. we are usually overwhelmed with the thought of food, which is why my wife specifically has actually taught me how to just mindlessly eat by having me engaged in conversations with her. it\u2019s not going to be perfect but it\u2019s definitely something to try. those are just usually some of the normal off limit kind of things that tend to be more universal but definitely talk to them so you can know what harms them personally.",

I brought it up previously in a \u201cI\u2019m concerned and I love you\u201d kind of way, he basically said he already knew he had a problem before I brought it up and has already \u201csolved it\u201d which was not true he just became (what he thought was) better at concealing it. Now it has gone much farther and I want to help if he\u2019ll let me. \n\nThank you again for responding, wishing you and your wife the best!",

          "body": "you\u2019re welcome :) i\u2019m sure you simply caring is enough itself. i did figure out my wife did have her suspensions about my eating habits but basically had no clue how to approach it. so the irony of me seeing drs for other things and having my GP at the time push recovery, it sort of helped her figure out how to go about it. i was personally given the chance to recover on my own since they could tell my wife would keep me on top of it. there are days i\u2019ll get upset with her but she knows to not take it personally. it\u2019s usually just me being frustrated with myself. it did eventually get to the point where i\u2019d need some guidance from people like dietitians and people in that realm. along with my therapist i\u2019ve already had for the last couple years, really helped guide my wife as a supportive s/o. so if it ever gets to that point, those drs can definitely help with guidance as a support system. \n\nin the meantime, could possibly just help slowly gear them onto the path of recovery. see if they could possibly try it on their own, it\u2019s completely okay if they can\u2019t. that\u2019s why we have drs that specialize in eating disorders. just remember tho, they have to want it for themselves. so possibly help them find reasons to recover and have them remember those things in the back of their mind. definitely just try to focus on the mental part because i\u2019ve realized once you have that motivation mentally, it can keep you pushing through any physical things. since eating disorders are a mental disorder that causes physically effects to the body. \n\nthank you! i wish you and your s/o the best too! \u2764\ufe0f",
