  "selftext": "He used to be anorexic until his family put him in rehab. This was like 5 years ago or something. I feel like he\u2019s just moved to another form of the eating disorder. \n\nHe recently mentioned that he\u2019s the lightest he\u2019s been in a while. He works out for 2 hours a day - every day. He\u2019s vegan but also refuses to eat sugar or any carbs. He does eat but it\u2019s literally only fruits and vegetables, some vegan protein powder, and a bunch of supplemental pills. He\u2019s gotten so bony. I\u2019ve asked if he could consult a nutritionist but he said he doesn\u2019t want to spend the money. He says he just wants to be in peak physical shape. If you think this sounds fine, I\u2019ll believe you. If not, I feel like I need to do this gently because of his history. I\u2019m worried about him. How can I do this the right way?",

Having said that I find my eating disorder comes and goes in waves, particularly if I\u2019m stressed out. What else is going on in his life? I think it\u2019s important that you talk to him and see how he\u2019s feeling about himself and how he\u2019s thinking, I would avoid commenting on his actual weight though as this can often backfire and either make him think he\u2019s doing the right thing or could make him not talk to you about it. I would just ask about his general well being and mental health and let him know you are always there for him. It\u2019s such a hard conversation to have. I wish you both all the best",
