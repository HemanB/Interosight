  "selftext": "I recently started a partial hospitalization program for my eating disorder. This is the first time I\u2019ve ever had treatment for my eating disorder although it\u2019s been there since I was around 8 years old and I\u2019m 24 now. Everyone in this program is smaller than me and that can be so triggering, difficult and very much so makes me feel invalid in my eating disorder. It\u2019s been really hard to not compare myself to others and to accept that the goal of recovery does not include losing weight and in fact may cause me to gain wait as an already \u201cobese\u201d person. I was wondering what anyone\u2019s experience or advice is for someone in eating disorder treatment and trying to recover as a plus size person? Any advice, words of encouragement or suggestions are greatly appreciated!\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc",

While I knew I was super sick and desperately needed help, I had this panging feeling in me. One night I expressed this to my favorite therapist at the treatment center, I was bawling and crying on this conflict. She told me point blank that the doctors who evaluated me clearly believed I needed residential  treatment, or I wouldn\u2019t be there. She stayed there with me during my whole breakdown, embracing my pain that I had on this very topic. That really changed my perspective on my \u201cworthiness\u201d with needing treatment. ED treatment doesn\u2019t have a size requirement, it\u2019s for anyone who needs it. I am sending love and light to you and would really encourage you to express this fear to your treatment team.

Especially since comparing yourself is triggering. \n\nEating disorders can happen at any size, it's like a spectrum. And even though low weight is the common symptom most people think of in relation to an ED, there are tons of \"normal/average\" weight, and plus sized people who suffer from them too. It's like, even though extreme weight loss is the goal for most, that's the point you want to avoid getting too bc it's alot harder to bounce back from. \n\nI'm 24, too. And although I've never been plus sized, I've compared my weight to others a ton during hospitalizations. I even got diagnosed with anorexia when I was still at an average bmi for my age at the time (19). And even though being in support groups or around others with EDs was kind of toxic sometimes, it really helped me see that not everyone wirh an ED had to be petite, small or skinny. I've met plus-sized, underweight, normal weight people, males, all kinds of people. \n\nAnd once you're recovered, you can work with doctors or nutritionists to still loss weight, just in a healthy way. But the goal for rn is to get better\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9b\n\nIf you ever need to talk, feel free to dm me any time. I wish you the best of luck <3",

I finally have a doctor who looked at my loss this past 6 months and was like \u201clook me in the eye and tell me you did this in a healthy manner\u201d and I started crying and she got me in intense outpatient. Fatphobia lends doctors to wait historically for people who start obese to get sick before stepping in, say it\u2019s a big adjustment for many to feel seen.

Except if you start big, you\u2019re not going to be thin immediately. People are thin because they started medium or thin. But starvation shuts our organs all down the same. I finally have a doctor who looked at my loss this past 6 months and was like \u201clook me in the eye and tell me you did this in a healthy manner\u201d and I started crying and she got me in intense outpatient. Fatphobia lends doctors to wait historically for people who start obese to get sick before stepping in, say it\u2019s a big adjustment for many to feel seen. Better to treat it now before you continue harm and I may not know you but I\u2019m proud of you for putting yourself first even if you don\u2019t feel worthy yet \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc",
