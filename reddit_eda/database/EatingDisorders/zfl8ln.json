  "selftext": "I started out my Anorexia thinking I was just being healthy and I was on these groups/forums and people encouraged me. A lot of my restriction was only eating one meal a day and people who do these types of diets do really similar things. They also often body check and stuff. I know the psychology isn\u2019t exactly the same and I\u2019m not trying to upset anyone, but I\u2019m trying to understand how exactly these things are different. And like people on the groups talk about how good they feel, but I know I always feel really crappy when I don\u2019t eat for a day.",

Its praised because of societal norms that are praised in the media. \n\nIt's only when you go 'too far' and it is clearly anorexia (I.e. skeleta, can see every bone etc.) That it stops being \"pretty or beautiful\" to the media. \n\nWhen you stop eating and you seem to evaporate and you weren't already thin or fitting into a more \"acceptable \" body shape your praised. \n\nHow can that not be desired? \n\nTo be liked and complimented? \nThe media fuels eating disorders \nAnd \"diets\" are just a glamorised gateway into one. \nAs is fitness and people who are gym obsessed (who count calories to the gram and restrict types oc foods because its \"bad\" for the body or for the gains etc.) \n\nDieting and working out obsessively is normalised now. \n\n\nAnd most medical services only treat the issue of either weight gain or loss depending on the type of ED. \nThey don't actually treat the disordered thinking or mindset around food thus resulting in relapses and minimal \"complete\" recovery. \n\nIt sucks.",

That\u2019s considered \u201cnormal\u201d. If you can\u2019t accept your set weight or stop dieting once you reach your goal? Akin to an addictions, you just keep going because it\u2019s never enough. That\u2019s a disorder. \n\nLike others have mentioned it\u2019s heavily societally bound - as many diagnoses are. I think it\u2019s on a spectrum, with healthy mindful eating on one end, and a full blown eating disorder on the other. Dieting would be in the middle. \n\nIMHO the dsm has been far behind on making needed changes to diagnose eating disorders, so you aren\u2019t the only person to have this question. It\u2019s been dad to see \u201cdetoxing\u201d, \u201cclean eating\u201d and fasting become such big trends with so little awareness of EDs to counteract such. \n\nThere\u2019s also a large conversation to be had about the combination of exposure and genetics with EDs but that\u2019s another long rant. I can gladly expand if we\u2019re getting into that convo though. :)",
