  "title": "Request: Chew/Spit",
  "selftext": "Hi --\n\nI've never been diagnosed with an eating disorder, but I've always used food and exercise as a means for control in my life.\n\nTwo years ago, I started chewing and spitting on occasion. This past year, full of stresses, I now chew and spit everyday. I keep saying I'll stop and I specifically avoid buying indulgent foods, but I end up just chewing and spitting the foods I have. I'm 34 and it's difficult to believe that I may have developed an eating disorder, well into adulthood. I also feel tremendous guilt about the wasting food and the long-term health effects this may have on my body.\n\nThere's not a lot of information on the internet about this as an eating disorder, although I strongly believe it is. \n\nDoes anyone else have experience with this? I know stress and the felt need for indulgence while being restrictive is at play, but are there other motives that you've experienced? Have you been able to successfully quit? And if so, how?\n\nThank you for being here!",

      "body": "Youre not alone. Ed has lots of faces. It can be restricting, chewing spitting, binging and pruging and so on and on. Basically it is the fear of consumimg lots of calories without any expenditure. It can be physical activity, vomiting and so on. Though this may sound horrible, in the mind of a disordered person, it is just lifestyle. This is the way to be. But, that doesnt mean you cant fight it. I think it all can come from you. And the first thing that could help is realizing the consequences. For example, osteoporosis. Pls do yourself a favor, dont drag yourself there. This is a nightmare. Believe me. Any other support and motivation, feel free to contact me any time. \u2764",

If that's the case for you, maybe there are other ways you can soothe yourself. I would also encourage you to find a professional who specializes in eating disorders who can help you with this issue, which is something my mom never did.",

After all, you're buying all this delicious food and not even swallowing it! For me, if I really feel the need to \"binge\" I'll force myself to wait 30min and if I still want to, I will. But usually, the urges come and go. It is a type of eating disorder (I would normally class it under EDNOS) but there's so little information online about it. Good luck, and I hope your relationship with food gets better.",

      "body": "Chewing and spitting is valid type of eating disorder. \n\nIt was very difficult to break because like you, I hate wasting food, and of course, restrictive EDs ads very controlling. \n\nI have finally broke free from chewing and spitting through residential treatment and forcing myself to swallow. Learning \u201cmindful eating\u201d tips are very helpful such as, acknowledging the taste, the benefits of the particular food, the memories you have with this food before your ED, etc. \n\nNot taking as long to chew and swallow quickens the process, and eventually becomes second nature after enough practice. Before, I hated getting caught chewing and spitting, so I hope you can feel the relief soon as well.\n\nI am lapsing a bit, but I very rarely engage in this behavior and always correct myself. I wish you so much luck!",

There are many adults with eating disorders so you're definitely not alone.\n\nIt sounds very likely that you have a form of bulimia nervosa, the only way to know for sure is to get diagnosed by a psychiatrist specializing in eating disorders. They'll also referr you to the appropriate treatment. I wish you the best of luck in your new journey :)",

      "body": "Ive too have had an obsessive relationship w food. With everything. \nIm a 25 yr bodybuilder. I\u2019ve been struggling w body dysmorphia and ED for what seems like forever. My younger sister actually was diagnosed w anorexia nervosa a few yrs back in which she got treatment for. She now luckily has an amazing relationship w food. Seeing her struggle made me stop but now that we\u2019re very independent i kinda slowly spiraled down. \n\nI too would do this occasionally. But recently it\u2019s been an every day thing. I\u2019d do this thing where I\u2019d ensure i had calories left to compensate for any of the calories that weren\u2019t spitted out. I\u2019ll stop some days other days i find my self doing boxes of poptarts (which in my case is my drug of choice). \n\nI was in denial for quite some time. Some say that lifting and having a gym routine saved their lives, helped their self esteem, made them healthier etc. However ppl don\u2019t really talk about the negative aspects of bodybuilding. Sure it\u2019s a source of therapy however it has made me so much more critical of my body. Constantly chasing for something unobtainable w out the use of enhancing drugs. This constant comparison. The not enough. Yup definitely hasn\u2019t helped. \n\nIt\u2019s nice to know that I\u2019m not alone. Although that it\u2019s also at the expensive of your mental health :/ \nIm sorry and i hope we find recovery soon",
