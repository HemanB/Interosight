  "title": "is it harmful to call my gf with anorexia pretty?",
  "selftext": "Me and my gf have been going out for two months now and she doesn't know that I know about her ED. I have been trying to educate myself a lot on eating disorders so I can do whatever I can do help her from the outside, but I recently have been reading up that I shouldn't make comments about her appearance and now i'm scared that I have done damage to her because I call her pretty, perfect beautiful etc, daily. I don't know if its evoking her habits or making it worse but now i'm worried that I'm contributing, can someone who is struggling with anorexia please let me know if I am doing harm by calling her pretty? even though my compliments aren\u2019t at all directed towards her body, rather her face and personality im scared she will take it as me commenting on her weight, which isn\u2019t what i\u2019m doing when i compliment her.\n\nUPDATE: its been over a year now and i couldn't be happier and more in love, we are perfect, no exaggeration. we have been working through our shit together and I can tell her relationship with food has improved so much and she seems to be so much more confident in herself, i could not be more proud of my girl, she is fucking incredible and i'm so grateful to be hers <3 my girlfriend is fucking amazing what did i do to deserve someone with a heart and soul so beautiful, not to mention every atom that makes her, she deserves the world and i would do anything to give that to her.",
