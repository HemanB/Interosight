Date around if you want, spend time with your loved ones friends, just get interested in something that isn\u2019t your eating disorder and if you have an interest throw yourself into it. I\u2019ve found it hard to quit something destructive without a replacement. Take that for what you will. Look into a thing that I guess could still be not the greatest for you (as in any indulgence of some kind) try to make it as non risky as possible (stay away from alcohol or nicotine or generally bad and addictive drugs or risky ssx)",

I\u2019ve had all the eating disorders in the past. BED being one of them but looking back, I always tried to restrict my intake when I wasn\u2019t binging. When I recovered from it, I let myself eat literally anything and everything with no restrictions when I wasn\u2019t binging and it happened to be more than normal, but eventually, you naturally eat at a normal amount. \n\nIf it\u2019s purely emotions that makes you binge and not restricting at all, sometimes it\u2019s a good idea to try change your environment a little temporarily, or your lifestyle schedule. It disrupts your binging routine and hours and could help.",

I give myself a set amount for groceries every month and if i go over (usually from buying binge food) feels bad to have to move money from my vacation or even medical fund to have to cover that. it really puts it onto perspective for me.",
