  "title": "Request: How do you deal with shame in anorexia recovery?",
  "selftext": "After a few months of weight restoration, I\u2019m still unequipped to deal with the different moments of intense shame that seem to happen all of the time in recovery. I\u2019ve felt ashamed when I  \u201cyou look healthier\u201d, or realise I outgrew my favourite clothes. I\u2019ve felt ashamed when people have seen even a sliver of your body; I don\u2019t think I wear anything besides hoodies and sweatpants nowadays. I hate that I have to eat in front of people.  I hate the thought they\u2019re seeing me eat. It feels as though my embarrassment is so great these days, I can barely go on.\n\nAs a result of this chronic shame, I am resentful of recovery. I don\u2019t want to keep going; I want to go back so that I undo all of my new habits. Obviously, this isn\u2019t sustainable long term, so does anyone know some healthier ways of dealing with shame?",

      "body": "I relate to this so well. I have come across a few experiences that didn't bring up that shame that might help you. I find focusing on other parts of myself when I look in the mirror helps a lot. I will look at how beautiful other aspects of my human body are, not just the size of it. Also, if you can, save up some money and go buy some new favorite clothes. Put away the clothes that only fit you when you're harming your body. They're not worth it and there are tons of beautiful clothes out there that will help you regain the confidence in your body. I know for me I didnt want to go up a size. I felt so much shame in that. I feel like my way around that was instead of going back to the same stores and feeling the shame of buying the \"next size up\" I just started shopping at new stores. I found stores where I had never been so I got to try on multiple sizes at once to see what felt best. Most of all, try and remind yourself that numbers and letters don't define you! That's all weight and size is, letters and numbers. We are so much more than that. We deserves lives free of this shame, and together we can continue to share and find our ways through it. I promise you don't need to carry shame in healing your body, and if anyone does actively try and shame you, including yourself, they are dead wrong! Just keep focusing on your physical health, you'll get through this <3",

      "body": "Recovery is sometimes truly bummer city ..and everything in us screams to retreat to the shells of humans we were. Totally valid. There are some urges, thoughts and feelings that never fully disappear, but they become more like weak whispers and echoes than shouts eventually. It\u2019s all about building a life aligned with your values and a future filled with all the things you deserve and that will feel meaningful and fulfilling to you. Those things will matter more to you than your eating disorder, but you\u2019ll have to decide that and choose them over and over before it all feels natural and true. Every time I get the \u201chealthier\u201d comment, I rephrase it in my head. It\u2019s a way for people to say, \u201chey I was really concerned about you and I care about you\u201d in the only way they know how. They are probably relieved, and want you to feel validated\u2014 like they want you to know that they notice whether you seem well, as well as notice the hard work you\u2019ve put into recovery. It wouldn\u2019t be super normal to just flat out ignore somebody who has a life threatening illness when they seem to be in remission, right? That might help shift the perspective. I really appreciate how my therapist addresses slips and more solid recovery. When I\u2019m doing well, she says, \u201chey, it\u2019s really nice to see this side of you! You\u2019re getting excited and smiling and feeling things and we\u2019re talking about things that aren\u2019t 100% focused on eating disorders!\u201d It\u2019s like I\u2019ve returned from a vacation or something and she\u2019s pumped to see me again! And when I\u2019m struggling and totally numbed out, she\u2019ll say, \u201cThere\u2019s not much of you for me to connect with right now. I get worried when you\u2019re blank like this. You\u2019re using behaviors because you want people to express care and concern, but you\u2019re not receptive to their love when you\u2019re numb anyway.\u201d \nIt makes me feel like \n1. My actual personality and spirit is dull or vacant when I\u2019m in the disorder. This makes me less present, less able to touch the world, and harder to connect with/love. \nAnd\n2. She likes me. Especially when I\u2019m vibrant and healthy, because otherwise I\u2019m barely there with her anyway. She doesn\u2019t give a shit about my clothes, she just wants the real me out and shining.\n\nI will say that relapse is filled with regret and conflicted shame too. Now that you know you\u2019re capable of recovery (to any extent you\u2019ve achieved), and aware of all the reasons eating disorders are dysfunctional, don\u2019t work and actually cause huge harm to you and those around you... it won\u2019t feel as satisfying to fall back into old patterns. I\u2019ve been there, and it feels like failure and giving up. You know what\u2019s down the eating disorder path\u2014 you\u2019ve been there and done that. You can go back down it however many times you need to, but it will never change. It will also always be there lurking if you want it, so why not try something new and look around and see how life could be different before you throw in the towel. No need to commit to recovery for life, just for right now, just for today. You\u2019re allowed to exist in a bigger body, to take up space, to adorn that body with respect and admiration and clothes you love. Your body lets you feel joy and bliss, frees you to adventure to mountaintops, gives you the opportunity to taste new ice cream flavors and kiss people sloppily and dance as goofy as you please and hug those you love tightly. Your toes can feel the warmth of sand, your arms can cradle your baby cousins, your eyes can make suggestive winks and crinkle up with laughter all day long. Your mind, nourished, can protest, imagine, pretend, think elaborately and extensively and reason with wit. It can calculate so many things that aren\u2019t calories and carbs, especially when it\u2019s not starved for them and playing the same obsessive, hungry loop all day. Your mind is capable of so much. \nThe root of the word shame means \u201cto cover,\u201d or \u201cto shroud,\u201d so it alludes to hiding and to fear. It makes sense that you are literally covering your body more because you don\u2019t want to feel exposed and scrutinized. I\u2019m rambling now, but I feel for you, dude",

      "body": "This is so so hard to deal with. Some people may not understand, and there\u2019s not a lot you can do to change that. I suggest looking into DBT, CBT, RODBT, and ACT. Specifically self help worksheets if you can\u2019t access a therapist. Remember what you went through, agonize the body you had, and try to come to acceptance. This may not be the body you wanted, but this the body that is healthy. This is the body that will allow you to do so many things. They don\u2019t understand what you went through. Call them out if you need to, it\u2019s helpful for everyone else with EDs! \nThere are so many worksheet activities, like making lists of thought distortions, and going back and making them dialectics. Making a pros and cons lists of the ED. Making a timeline of what would happen if you kept using behaviors. Making a dream board of all the things you can do now, that you couldn\u2019t before, and the feelings you feel. You are strong, you\u2019ve got this \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc now comes the mind work \u2665\ufe0f",
