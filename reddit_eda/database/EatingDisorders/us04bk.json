  "selftext": "Hi beautiful people I need to vent and would love advice and support. Im currently a 19 y/o female and finally fully recovered from my ED after 3-4 years of battling it. (although i do still struggle with body dysmorphia) I take care of myself and my body and love to lift weights! I have also been healing my relationship with food and finally feel like im in a great place. Today my mom said I should stop eating certain foods for breakfast (not going into detail to trigger anyone!) because they are \u201cunhealthy and making me fat\u201d. She also makes rude comments when i wear tight clothes and my gym attire even though im finally confident enough to wear them. After she made this comment out of seemingly no where, im honestly so hurt and i feel regretful for eating for the first time in almost a year from her comment. She treated me better when I was ill and I feel broken. I usually never let the words of others hurt me, but coming from my own mom\u2026. :( she watched me almost die and this is what i get in return. I also can\u2019t move out quite yet for many reasons i don\u2019t feel like explaining right now lol but im planning to get out of here after i graduate from college. I mostly stay in my room and out of the house for obvious reasons. I also have spoke up about my feeling multiple times when she brings up my diet and still never seems to get it. lol plz send help:(\n\nedit: to touch on how she treated me better with my illness, she would often compliment my body and looks and now it\u2019s like she wants me to hide myself more than ever before and anytime she comments on my appearance it\u2019s an insult or backhanded comment. I also wanted to mention that i am at a healthy weight not over or under by any means so it\u2019s not like she\u2019s making these comments out of a concern for my health. she grew up in the generation of low waist jeans and vs models, if that gives you anymore explanation iykyk",

With negative influences around you, you have to take a step back and break down all of the information/comments your receiving and ask yourself what holds value for you. Do you feel better with your freedom of eating what you want/need and lifting weights, or do you feel better on your old restrictive diet where your body is wasting away? \nI hope you have other good friends and leaders in your life to help guide you in the right direction even if your mom is pushing you down.

Other people\u2019s comments don\u2019t bother too much either, but those negative thoughts do come back sometimes and they can start to influence habits again. \nYou really have to be your own role model because you\u2019ve been through it with having an ED and making it to the other side of recovery. With negative influences around you, you have to take a step back and break down all of the information/comments your receiving and ask yourself what holds value for you. Do you feel better with your freedom of eating what you want/need and lifting weights, or do you feel better on your old restrictive diet where your body is wasting away? \nI hope you have other good friends and leaders in your life to help guide you in the right direction even if your mom is pushing you down. You\u2019ve got this! Keep your head held high and don\u2019t look back",

You wear what you\u2019re happy and comfortable in.

You deserve to eat and have a happy relationship with food, and without having to dodge these cruel comments.\n\nAnd you deserve to be loved and supported unconditionally. \n\nthe confidence that you have worked for is not something she may try to take away from you, and I know it\u2019s hard not to listen to mom and her insensitivity, but clearly has never been in the pain that is your place. \n\nI just hope you know that we are proud of you and that you are loved here and that again I am so sorry she would say these things to you. \n\nWords hurt so much especially when you struggle with the ailments that you have. and I can\u2019t even imagine the strength it takes to stand there and take those things. \n\n\nyou have come so far and that best is coming.
