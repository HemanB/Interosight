      "body": "If you are after a list of symptoms of eating disorders you can probably get a lot of those from others or just Googling it..\n BUT my advice would be to please go and see a doctor or specialist about this. Symptoms can be very different between people and interpreting what means what is a medical science. The metaphor of the body shutting down is not a particularly good one because it assumes that things are going to go slowly. But the reality is that things can happen very quickly such as cardiac arrests and you might not get any warnings. \nSo please talk to someone who can give you advice that is specific to your body/circumstances",

For me I knew it was getting serious when I started passing out. Depending on how quickly you lost weight, yes, you can still be seriously sick even with a healthy weight. Heart problems are a major issue with ED.",

This is why we say that EDs don\u2019t discriminate by weight. This is also why medical monitoring in treatment is a thing. If you are concerned about symptoms you are having, please reach out to a doctor if you can.",
