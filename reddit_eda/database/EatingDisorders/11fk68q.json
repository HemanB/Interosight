  "title": "I need desperate advice on how to help with my sister's eating disorder",
  "selftext": "I (22M) am in desperate need for help with a situation that is destroying my family. My sister (19F) has been struggling with a devastating eating disorder for a year now. We have tried everything we can think of to support her, but nothing seems to be working, and we are near our breaking point.\n\nInitially, my sister started off with what seemed like a desire to lose a few pounds. However, it quickly escalated into a full-blown disorder, with her spending hours on the treadmill every day and not eating anything. From the very beginning, my mother knew that things were not looking good. She constantly warned my sister of the dangers of the path that she is on.\n\nMy mom would try to help her and offered to see a therapist or nutritionist with her, but she viciously refused, saying that she knows what she's doing and that my mother doesn't know what she's talking about. She was constantly exercising and never eating, and my mom would try to explain to her the dangers of this and share her support for her. But my sister is extremely stubborn by nature, and would always just brush her off, attack her, yell at her. This continued for many months, my sister refusing any form of help, my mother worried sick for her, until she became dangerously underweight.\n\nWe were all extremely scared for her. My mother and I would cry almost every day, desperately trying to support her and save her, worried sick for her life. But she would always dismiss us. She was so malnourished that doctors said she needed treatment ASAP because she was at risk of organ failure, but she refused, and we cannot force treatment on her because she is an adult. If she lost any more weight she probably would have died.\n\nAt this time, my sister also wanted to get a nose job, but my mother explained to her that no doctor would put her under general anesthesia and operate on her in her condition. She explained to her that she needs to recover if she wants to be able to do the things she wants and live the life she wants, like go to college.\n\nOne day, after months of my mother and I crying for her and pleading with her, it seemed like she finally had a breakthrough. She seemed determined to get better and started forcing herself to eat. We were all so happy. We constantly supported her throughout the way. We thought she was on the road to recovery.\n\nBut now she recently got the nose job that she wanted, and she is slipping back to her old habits. Not eating, lying, gaslighting us, attacking us when we try to support her. Over the past month she has lost a dangerous amount of weight, and it seems like all of the progress she made is rapidly being lost. She is quickly entering a dangerous state again, but she is again refusing help.\n\nShe won't see a therapist or accept any treatment. She says that she can handle this on her own and nobody can help her. We have tried to talk to her gently, support her, and show our concern, but she just attacks us every time. It's like we're all held hostage by this eating disorder, a never ending nightmare that we cannot escape.\n\nThe situation is taking a massive toll on my mother. She looks depressed, exhausted, and stressed all the time. I am so worried for her health. She has a history of heart problems and high blood pressure, and I fear that all of this stress will be the end of her. I can't bear the thought of losing both my sister and my mother.\n\nI feel so terrible for my mother. She lives for her children and the only thing that matters to her is for her children to be happy and healthy. This whole situation has been destroying her. I am depressed not only for my sister, but also my mother. My mother means the world to me, and it is devastating to watch my mother breakdown while my sister withers away no matter how much she tries to help her. It seems like this battle will never end and will eventually kill them both.\n\nWe all live in the same house, and I see my mother trying to gently support my sister only to get attacked. I hear my sister yelling at my mother for trying to help her and prevent her from dying. My sister has said such terrible things to my mother despite all she's done for her. Things like she's a shit mother, saying that she's never done anything for her, that she doesn't love her, that she doesn't care about her, when my mother literally devotes her life to her kids' happiness.\n\nMy sister even blamed my mother for her eating disorder, saying it's her fault that she didn't save her before it turned into this, when my mom has literally tried everything she could from the very beginning to help her. My sister has tremendous anger issues now and makes everyday hell with her terrible attitude, throwing things, slamming things, screaming at us for trying to help her, blowing up over everything, refusing to see a therapist.\n\nI recently got laid off and have been struggling to find a job in this economy, and my father is worried about losing his job. If something happens to my sister and she needs to be hospitalized or needs medical care, we would go broke. This is such a nightmare.\n\nI'm writing this post in the hope that someone out there can help us. If you have any advice or suggestions, please share them with me. I don't know what to do, and we are all at our breaking point. We just want our sister back, and we want our family to be happy and healthy again.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this.",

I would have full blown episodes being psychotic because I felt so out of control of myself. I was horrible to my family. Just do the best you can. Try to not take what she\u2019s saying personally, try to seal out any medical help if u can, and try to be a shooter for your sister to lean on if u can\u2019t force her because of her age. I definitely needed to be forced or I probably would have died. But with her age u may need to find a way to break through to her to want help",

She's not doing it to spite or hurt you. Everything she's doing, she's doing it to herself.\n\nShe's dealing with a mental illness. It's not going to make sense, because it's a mental illness.\n\nYou can't force her to get better. Telling her the health risks won't change her behaviours, she's probably more aware of them than any of you.\nShe has to decide to get better for herself.\n\n\nWhat you can do as her family though, is support her. Focus on everything else about her. If she has any hobbies, talk about them. If she doesn't, invite her to join something with you.\nDon't focus on the food or exercise. Focus on finding things that might end up more important than her eating disorder. \n\nMeet her half way with the eating as well. If she's open to drinking protein shakes, it's better than nothing. If all she'll eat is her safe foods, at least she's having something.",

My mom is a nurse and they really did not know what to do to support me. I am the youngest of four children. They are older Looking back I always said that I wish you admitted me against my will when you could have before I was 18 I do live in Canada so may be different but I really feel for you and your family and I am sorry for some people on here, blaming your parents, I don\u2019t think an eating disorder is anybody\u2019s fault, and I wouldn\u2019t wish it on my worst enemy. I have asked my mom to go to counselling with me and I still do to this day and she will not. I do believe that counselling for your parents and your family would be very beneficial and I feel it is likely very hurtful for your sister that your mom is not willing to go to counseling, this is not her problem. It should be about you and your whole family what we can do how we can support each other and you together how can we recover as a family don\u2019t make it about her make it about everyone we are in this together family counseling, family therapy, but make sure it\u2019s an eating disorder Competent counselor. I still struggle with intrusive thoughts, and I have hard days and hard weeks and hard months. I am married. I have a dog. I have a great career. I think this is some thing I will struggle with my whole life and maybe if there is prevention earlier I would be able to get rid of it completely. My family is very supportive but they are a medical background. They are also British mental health has never really been an open conversation. I know that your sister\u2019s behaviours are not likeable and not loveable even right now, but don\u2019t give up on her.",

It\u2019s gonna sound harsh but your mom should set a boundary that if she doesn\u2019t enter treatment she\u2019s kicking her out of the house and taking her off her health insurance. If she threatens to kill herself then call 911 for emergency evaluation. It will seem harsh and cruel but you\u2019ve exhausted all other options. You have to tell her you will do anything to help her and nothing to enable the eating disorder. And as long as your not setting these consequences then you\u2019re just creating co-dependency. \n\nSecondly and just as important, both you and your mom need to be in therapy. This is an equally as traumatic an experience for both of you and you both need support to be there for your sister. The therapist may have other ideas to compel your sister into treatment.",

      "body": "I am so sorry you\u2019re all going through this. My best advice is, do all the research you can on how to get her into a treatment center. If that isn\u2019t possible, or if that\u2019s months away, there are things you can do in the meantime. Number one, I agree with other comments that you and your mom should be in therapy. Until your mom starts therapy, there\u2019s no point in telling your sister to go. If you guys make it more of a family thing, she might feel less singled out. For example, go to family therapy as a group, or each have your own sessions (or both), anything to not make her feel like \u201cyou\u2019re not normal and we are and you need to get your act together.\u201d As someone who has had disordered eating on and off for 15 years, I can tell you that she does not want to talk about \u201cdeep\u201d topics with her family. To this day there are certain things I tell my therapist that I will never tell my family. You and your mom starting therapy, and then gently suggesting she do the same, might be the best approach. She feels comfortable snapping at you guys because she knows your love is unconditional. (and because her brain isn\u2019t functioning properly; that\u2019s why she\u2019s so quick to anger.) Maybe you can get a therapist on the phone and hand your sister the phone, and have the therapist ask her to come in for an appointment. She\u2019s more likely to say yes to someone who is not you or your mom. When you\u2019re so deep into the eating disorder, you don\u2019t account for the fact that once you start eating again, your brain will function better, and you\u2019ll be able to see logic more clearly. Your sister probably thinks of gaining weight as going back to the life she had before, a life that felt out of control. That\u2019s why therapy is so crucial to help your sister figure out the factors that manifested in an eating disorder. \n\nBasically, try having a therapist talk to her on the phone, because that\u2019s more likely to convince her to go to an appointment. And any therapists the 3 of you see should specialize in eating disorders. There are too many therapists out there who don\u2019t know how to talk to people with eating disorders and end up triggering them, so be mindful of that too. Also, just a reminder, your sister loves you guys very much, and the way she\u2019s acting now is not her real personality. When she\u2019s recovered (manifesting that), she\u2019ll look back and be horrified at the way she talked to you. Good luck with everything, and just know you\u2019re not alone.",
