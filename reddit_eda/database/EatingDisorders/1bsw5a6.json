      "body": "Hiya :) I have experienced this too. At the height of my ED I was baking and cooking multiple times a day but I would never ever eat any of it - I'd just feed it all to my parents. I think its the EDs way of eating but through other people, eating with your eyes and hands but not your mouth if that makes sense. By preparing the food and making it and then having others eat it your ED gets to be around food but control every single part of it. It could also be a way of the ED trying to compare your food intake with others by making the people around you 'eat more' than you. I'm not an expert, this is just my own experience with this and this is what it was like for me. Hope this helps, stay safe xx",

If you\u2019re making the food for other people it can be a subconscious way to make sure the people you love are getting enough food because you know how much it sucks to not eat enough and also can be a way to enjoy the social/communal aspect of food without having to actually eat it.",

I also thought it might be a little sneaky, as in, if I\u2019m always in the kitchen, people might not notice that I\u2019m not eating enough because they associate me with cooking. \n\nI think biologically, no matter how sick someone is, humans want to prepare food and have that sensory experience any way they\u2019re able to. \n\nI\u2019ve been in recovery for almost ten years, and I still catch myself getting into really elaborate meal prep for friends/family/parties and then feeling some kind of aversion to eating the meal. This is despite the fact that I don\u2019t restrict anymore, and have very minimal residual behavioral symptoms.",
