  "title": "Request: My fianc\u00e9 said I look 'big boned' and have gained weight :(",
  "selftext": "My fianc\u00e8 is the type of person who says things without thinking first, which means he sometimes says something he doesn't really mean and meant to say another thing. \nToday we were chilling watching TV and I felt really unwell. He asked me if I could be pregnant again (we have a 2 month old baby already) as he had been noticing signs, but refused to tell me what signs as it would upset me. My heart immediately sank as I knew what that meant, and asked if I had gained weight. He told me that I had, and that I looked 'big boned'.\n\nHe knew from my face how incredibly hurt I was to hear that, especially as I have only recently started eating again after starving myself for a while after having a baby. He did feel really guilty and apologised many times, and said that it came out wrong and he didn't mean to say that. He really did feel awful about it and said he realised that it was something you shouldn't say to someone with a long history of eating disorders. But now I can't get it out of my head... Big boned. Gained weight. I mean, I've just had a baby, and I've been told many times how lucky I am that my body has slimmed down again so soon after. But obviously my fiance doesn't see that :(\n\nI'm a big coffee drinker but today I haven't been able to eat or drink a thing since he said that. I don't want to eat ever again. I'm hiding my body in baggy clothes even though it's boiling outside. I can't stop thinking about what he said :(",

      "body": "Men are stupid and I\u2019m sorry he said that to you. \nI honestly doubt he meant to hurt you, he was probably just being dumb. Most men don\u2019t realize they\u2019re saying something offensive until they already said it. \n\n\nFirst off, I know it\u2019s easier said than done, but you\u2019ve got to start eating. Having a newborn is rough... you NEED to eat for energy. \n\nSecond, you are still healing. Your body doesn\u2019t completely recover from childbirth until 12-18 months. Your hormones can still be out of whack up until that point. Doctors will give the okay at 6 weeks if you\u2019re healing properly to start doing LIGHT activity such as walking or lifting light weights in order to ease back into a fitness routine, but most doctors won\u2019t even suggest dieting to lose weight until 6 months post partum. (Obviously special circumstances apply, if someone is severely overweight they might suggest it sooner)\n\nThird, do you realize what your body just did? Does he realize it? You literally grew a human inside of you for 9 months, had your uterus grow to the size of a watermelon (which has NOTHING to do with being fat or eating too much, your uterus MUST grow in order for your baby to grow) and at 2 months post partum, it is probably still shrinking. You then either pushed a baby out of you, or were cut open and had the baby removed from you. \nThat is not something you recover from quickly. This idea that women need to hurry up and get back to their pre pregnant size in a month is ridiculous. Give it time. Be patient with yourself.\n\n\nLastly, if you haven\u2019t done so already, please check in with your OBGYN or even your pcp, and ask them to screen you for post partum depression.  I\u2019m not saying you have it, I\u2019m just concerned you\u2019re at risk for developing it given the circumstances. \n\nI struggled with post partum depression and anxiety for 6 months before I finally broke down to my pcp. I was put on a low dose of an antidepressant and slowly started feeling like myself again. I don\u2019t want other women to go through what I did, that is why I\u2019m commenting. \n\nI\u2019m sure your fianc\u00e9 didn\u2019t mean anything hurtful by it, like I said, guys don\u2019t always think before they speak. You have my permission to sit him down and explain why he shouldn\u2019t have said that, and how it could seriously affect you. \nJust show him this comment if you don\u2019t want to talk about it.\nPlease take care. I wish you the best.",

Many people say these things because to them it maybe wouldnt affect them how it does to  someone who has ever had or still had a eating disorder. They have no idea the impact itl have or the spiral itl send someone with hostory of ED into too. It was insensitive him to say but im sure he has no idea how bad itl effect you. \n\nIm not sure what to advise because i was going to ask for similar advice on how to forget those kind of comments and not let them effect me. \n\nYouve just had a baby. They take toll on the female body then once born your tired and emotional its hard to eat well, find time to exercise ect. You dont have be back to your before shape straight away and most women dont ever get back to their before shape anyway and end up being happy with a mummys body. \n\nAnyway.

Involving a counselor for both your own healing and in helping to convey this to him might also be an important step. \n\nI also agree with the others who say having a baby is physically really intense for quite a long time. I also suffered from PPD both times (once within 6 weeks the other time after 6 months) and it definitely triggered my ED both times. \n\nBy your description, he doesn\u2019t sound malicious, but ignorant. Either way, it\u2019s dangerous for your healing both form the ED and postpartum recovery. Luckily, ignorance is usually more easily and effectively treated.\n\nPlease take care of yourself. \u2665\ufe0f you may be a mama now, and yes that means added responsibility, but you still matter very much and deserve a healthy body and mind as well.\n\nEdited- typo",

      "body": "So, after the baby you say you slimmed down by restricting...and he did nothing? Because you know that was noticeable. If you were breastfeeding, it was most likely more difficult because you weren\u2019t taking in enough nutrients. You may have switched your baby to formula early for this very reason, I know a few women working through their EDs that went this route because they relapsed as soon as the baby was born. You had a baby just 2 MONTHS ago, friend. Weight loss can\u2019t be the goal. Your husband said a stupid and thoughtless comment here, absolutely, but that\u2019s not the issue here.\n\nIt\u2019s an insane premise for someone with an eating disorder to follow, since we crave control over our bodies, but when women have children our bodies are suddenly not our own. Mistreating ourselves is mistreating our children, who are depending on our bodies to survive for the first portion of their lives (and beyond). \n\nI hope you have someone outside of the family, like a therapist, who you are talking to to work through your ED after having children. ED mixed with postpartum depression is one hell of a combo and very hard to cope with on your own. Not saying you have PPD, but your ED can certainly swing you into this territory and it is a dangerous place to be as a new mom. \n\nPlease take care of yourself. As a new mom, you\u2019re sleep deprived, and firing on all cylinders to adjust to your new life as a mother. This all must add so much pressure and stress to the situation, and I hope you are finding ways to still feel strong.",

Personally, I have been trying not to let my eating disorder to get in the way of my life, but it has taken a lot for me to get here. So I really understand how devastating it must be to hear, and I think if I was in OP's place I would be in a really rough spot. I feel like with ed brain you use so many things that happen that you have no control over to keep justifying the punishment you inflict on your own body, which makes it hard to see who is abusing you. Part of me wants to have hope, and think of op's fiance to be acting in good faith, but you're also right, and if this is a pattern of behavior, op needs to get out.",
