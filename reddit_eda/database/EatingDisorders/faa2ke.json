  "title": "Request: Is something wrong with me? Do men get eating disorders?",
  "selftext": "My mother and my female friend are concerned about me but i think I'm improving my life, I'm just trying to lose weight. I know it is maybe a little extreme but I am finally motivated to change.\n\nI am a straight male in my 20s... never heard of someone like me getting an eating disorder ever, so it must be extremely rare and I probably don't have one.\n\nI hate my body due to my weight (I'm obese) and 3 months ago I started a vegetable diet of a few hundred calories a day. I've now lost 60 pounds in 3 months but I'm still fat. I also did water fasting. I have developed a fear of food and I am mostly very happy about that. Mostly all I eat is fruit and vegetables and I never ever eat carbs. I tried to train myself to not want food by self harming every time I got hungry. I know that's weird but it was a good distraction. I stopped because of the comments (my arms are already scarred due to suicide attempts but new ones got questions). I exercise a lot and if i eat too much I make up for it with exercise. I exercise until I want to die for hours every day. I'm getting so much healthier and fitter even if I am overworking my muscles a bit. \n\nI struggle sometimes because I know I don't actually *need* to eat, it's just hunger signals/greed/habit. My body has over a hundred pounds of excess fat. As long as I get vitamins, I don't actually need food. That's why I feel guilty when I eat, I don't need it.\n\nI'm taking amphetamine drugs to reduce hunger, I started that on the advice of a friend and I think it'll be difficult to stop them now. Happy I did it though. Looking in the mirror makes me want to die, it is so disgusting seeing all the rolls of fat and my huge stomach. I don't care what methods or how extreme it is, I just want to lose weight as quick as possible. Is that really so bad..?\n\nI used to be thin and good looking, I dated a lot, then somehow I became an obese food addicted alcoholic shut in. I invited one of my female friends over a couple of months ago. She was shocked at my weight gain and it was incredibly embarrassing. I got drunk and tried to kiss her and she said she wasn't interested because I was so fat. The disgust in her eyes was the worst feeling.. to go from women looking at you seductively to looking at you like you're a piece of dog shit is the worst i have ever felt. I didn't eat for 3 weeks after that (water fasting). I wanted to carry on but I'm too weak and just gave in. I want to try for 6 weeks. I won't be happy until all this disgusting fat is gone from my body. \n\nI know my thought patterns are quite negative but overall I think it's very good that I lost weight and I'm happy with my progress. I don't think I have an eating disorder but if I do then it's a good thing. Is there anything concerning here?",

Getting sober allowed me to see that i looked like shit, my clothes were shit, and i started to care way to much about how i looked. I didnt even notice how underweight i was and probably still dont. It was all too much for me to handle at once. I got kicked out of rehab because I stopped eating completely and I was considered a liability. Luckily they didnt find out about the self harm. Had to go do a month of inpatient and then 2 months of residential to get functional again. I've relapsed quite a few times since than a d always lose weight from it.

And neither ever got treatment so they aren\u2019t part of that 1 in 4 statistic. \n\nThere are lots of different reasons that can cause hospitalization or death - it can be liver failure due to the rapid weight loss, it can be organ breakdown from protein deficiency, or electrolyte imbalances leading to cardiac failure. I know it doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019ll have trouble stopping now, but obsession with food is a byproduct of starvation. \n\nThere\u2019s a study known as the Minnesota Starvation Experiment where they took healthy men (screened for both physical and psychological health) and put them on a calorie restricted diet (I think 1500 calories). They all started showing a lot of the physical and psychological symptoms we see in EDs - obsession with food, food hiding, recipe hoarding, irritability, poor judgement and poor concentration,,\n depression, decreased energy, poor temperature regulation. And this is only 1500 calories! I don\u2019t know any of my clients who come to me eating even that much. \n\nThere\u2019s this phenomena I see with my clients where after they are eating enough or once they hit a certain weight it\u2019s like their brain just \u201cclicks\u201d out of the obsession. And it\u2019s a pretty stark difference. I\u2019ve heard so many people say that they\u2019ll stop at a certain weight/size/whatever but it never ends up being enough. I was one of those people - just didn\u2019t want to be fat anymore and ended up with a 10 year eating disorder (that still pops up in my brain sometimes after almost 10 years of recovery).\n\nAnother study you might find of interest is the biggest loser study - they followed participants after the show and not only did most (if not all?) of them regain the weight, but despite weight regain they continued to have metabolic suppression of 500 calories a day. Despite being fat again, their metabolism was burning 500 fewer calories than it was before. And their fat mass / lean mass ratio ended up significantly worse. \n\nI know it is so hard when weight loss is supposed to be this magic cure everybody should be pursuing, but I don\u2019t know that this approach is going to get you where you want to be. I hope you\u2019ll consider talking to someone, or if nothing else at least eating a bit more. Because I hate for this to be the next 20 years of your life. (If you do decide to talk to someone at any point you can PM me and I\u2019d be happy to help you find someone in your area)",

And neither ever got treatment so they aren\u2019t part of that 1 in 4 statistic. \n\nThere are lots of different reasons that can cause hospitalization or death - it can be liver failure due to the rapid weight loss, it can be organ breakdown from protein deficiency, or electrolyte imbalances leading to cardiac failure. I know it doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019ll have trouble stopping now, but obsession with food is a byproduct of starvation. \n\nThere\u2019s a study known as the Minnesota Starvation Experiment where they took healthy men (screened for both physical and psychological health) and put them on a calorie restricted diet (I think 1500 calories). They all started showing a lot of the physical and psychological symptoms we see in EDs - obsession with food, food hiding, recipe hoarding, irritability, poor judgement and poor concentration,,\n depression, decreased energy, poor temperature regulation. And this is only 1500 calories! I don\u2019t know any of my clients who come to me eating even that much. \n\nThere\u2019s this phenomena I see with my clients where after they are eating enough or once they hit a certain weight it\u2019s like their brain just \u201cclicks\u201d out of the obsession. And it\u2019s a pretty stark difference. I\u2019ve heard so many people say that they\u2019ll stop at a certain weight/size/whatever but it never ends up being enough. I was one of those people - just didn\u2019t want to be fat anymore and ended up with a 10 year eating disorder (that still pops up in my brain sometimes after almost 10 years of recovery).\n\nAnother study you might find of interest is the biggest loser study - they followed participants after the show and not only did most (if not all?) of them regain the weight, but despite weight regain they continued to have metabolic suppression of 500 calories a day. Despite being fat again, their metabolism was burning 500 fewer calories than it was before. And their fat mass / lean mass ratio ended up significantly worse. \n\nI know it is so hard when weight loss is supposed to be this magic cure everybody should be pursuing, but I don\u2019t know that this approach is going to get you where you want to be. I hope you\u2019ll consider talking to someone, or if nothing else at least eating a bit more. Because I hate for this to be the next 20 years of your life. (If you do decide to talk to someone at any point you can PM me and I\u2019d be happy to help you find someone in your area)",

      "body": "Hi, I'm a 17 year old girl (pretty much one of the most statistically likely person to have an eating disorder lol) from the UK as well. I just wanted to tell you that going to your gp is genuinely the best advice I could give you. My anorexia started when I was 11 years old, quite overweight and very shy. When I'd talk to a friend about it, they would say that it's good because I was so fat anyway, so I believed them and simply stopped eating and didn't even think there was a problem with it. My family forced me to to the gp, who did not focus on the fact that I was overweight and that losing the weight would probably \"do me some good\". She focused on WHY I wanted to lose weight, and a lot of my reasons were the exact same as yours. But I wasn't able to stop  myself because I was so obsessed with the idea of 'I'll stop once I get to a healthy weight'. Skip to a few months later, and I was still overweight (less so, but still overweight) so I still wasn't eating causing me to end up in the hospital for 4 months because of my ED, self harm and suicidal thoughts. Please, please do not think that your struggles aren't valid or don't mean anything because that's the same reasoning that lost me my entire childhood. Thin does NOT equal healthy, and neither is starving yourself. Please seek help and don't stop until you find a medical professional willing to give you it, I promise it will be the best thing you ever do",

          "body": "Honestly this is all extremely concerning and it sounds like you have a pretty severe eating disorder. I\u2019m an ED clinician and I do work with men - I think the statistics are 1 in 4 people with EDs are males, however that\u2019s only diagnosed and my guess is that there are more that are not diagnosed due to stigma. Very few of my clients fit the stereotypical \u201clook\u201d of an eating disorder. \n\nI know you hate your body right now and it might not seem like a concern, but restrictive eating disorders can have the same life-threatening effects on your organs regardless of weight. There are people who end up hospitalized with organ failure despite remaining in an \u201coverweight\u201d or \u201cobese\u201d body - all because they are eating so little. I would really encourage you to talk with a professional about what\u2019s going on because it\u2019s not going to be so simple to stop once your body is smaller. \n\nI have a male client right now with a similar story - at least similar in that he started restricting in a larger body. Despite being currently underweight he still views himself the same way he did when he was larger and it is an every day battle to eat. You deserve more than that. And the sooner you get help the easier recovery will be.",
