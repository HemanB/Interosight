  "selftext": "Hey everyone!\nWell, here I am, almost two years since my ED started. First I was just ortorexic, than the things escalated and I became an anorexic. I had a lot of physical problems, but I was happy with my skinny body. Now I am no more underweight and I\u2019m a binge eater- I feel like I\u2019m the biggest failure in this world.\nOh God, I know it is wrong, but I miss the times, when I was underweight. It is not okay, I know, but I can\u2019t control my brains and my body. That was the only period of my life, when I was not ashamed of my body. Now I feel fat, I have an acne because of the large amount of stress, I cry every single day and I do no believe that this nightmare will end.\n\nDoes anyone have or had similar problems?\nHow do/did you deal with them?",

I am on the treadmill for hours every day trying to get back there but I can't stop binge eating which makes the exercise irrelevant :(",

Then eat everything on a plate that someone makes for you. Remind yourself that you had no freedom in your disorder at all. You were imprisoned by your thoughts and it consumed your life. \n\nWant to weigh yourself? Throw out your scale. \n\nIt takes many years to create new patterns in the brain. It didn't happen overnight, so don't expect it to fix itself overnight. Most ED people have underlying trauma, I would highly recommend getting that worked out the sooner the better.",
