  "title": "Am I being ungrateful for being upset at my mum for only feeding me once a day?",
  "selftext": "I'm 14 and I don't know if I'm being entitled or anything, but my mum doesn't give me breakfast or lunch and only feeds me dinner. She doesn't cook properly either and mostly makes frozen food or just pasta which makes my stomach hurt and I'm sick of it. Or if she's too lazy, she buys takeaways, and she does often and blames it on me. \n\nWhen she goes shopping, she gets a lot of junk food, chocolate and crisps. My body is getting fat and I hate it. My mum has type 2 diabetes and is fat, and I'm scared that I'm going to end up like her, because my older sister ended up fat too. \n\nMost of the day my mum ignores me and is in her own world on her phone. When I tell my mum I'm hungry later on in the day, she gets angry at me for it and says I'm being ungrateful and she already fed me, and she complains and texts the whole family that I'm being difficult and ungrateful and that she's sick of me, and most of the time she ends up ordering a takeaway which makes me feel horrible and fat. I hate my body so much. \n\nI also have depression (yes, I have been diagnosed), and whenever I'm upset or crying, my mum doesn't know what to do and just shouts at me for it for \"causing trouble\" and orders a takeaway to try and shut me up, and it does. I keep eating to comfort myself when I'm upset but it's making me feel fat and my face is getting fatter. Every single day I'm crying and there's multiple reasons why, and I don't know what to do. Only food makes me feel better, but it makes me feel disgust at the same time. \n\nI also have autism and sensory issues so I struggle with a lot of foods texture, taste, smell ect so that makes it even more difficult. She complains about it and says she's sick of my autism. I fucking hate when I get hungry because it just causes trouble in the house. \n\nI'm not allowed to cook things myself and my mum is possessive and overprotective so she'd think I'd end up burning or hurting myself by accident. And I have no idea how to cook and planning things and doing all that myself will overwhelm me alot, I have no skills at all. And because of my autism, I can't handle being in supermarkets at all and get overwhelmed, and she said she can't afford my \"luxuries\". \n\nWhat am I supposed to do? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "body": "Wow, she sounds very immature and neglectful and like she has a lot of her own issues that need addressing and is possibly taking it out on you (and your sister?) as a distraction\u2026whether she realises that or not. \nI\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re in this situation hun and that she\u2019s been embarrassing you, very uncool. Seems like you\u2019re the collateral damage to a much bigger situation which is totally unfair on you, especially being so young. \nGood on you for being proactive and having the maturity and awareness to start asking for help, I think it\u2019s really brave and I\u2019m proud of you \u2764\ufe0f\n\nIn terms of getting some help, I would suggest talking to an adult in close proximity. They\u2019d probably have the best chance of helping you as there are different services and pathways depending on where you live. \nDo you go to a school? Could you go to the office even in a lunch break and ask to talk to a school councillor or carea adviser or just any adult that would have some time to talk to you? \nI think you should do that as it\u2019s crucial that you put a stop to this and not let it go on for a long time. \nTry to stay calm when you\u2019re talking if you can so you can speak clearly and communicate how important it is and that you really need to talk to someone as you need help. \nPrepare yourself that everyone might be busy and not have time in that moment to talk to you, but try not to be be disheartened and don\u2019t leave until you\u2019ve arranged a time to talk to someone ok. If it\u2019s not a good time in that moment, then you ask to find a time that works for them asap because it\u2019s urgent. Stand your ground but of course be respectful so they don\u2019t push you away. \n\nWrite down a list of the things you need to address so you don\u2019t forget anything. What you\u2019ve written on this post is really good, I think you should put that into some dot points so you\u2019re prepared.\n\nIf you can\u2019t talk to a teacher, maybe go down to a police station (subtly) or if you can\u2019t do that, even go to a shop or supermarket near you and ask an adult at the front desk if they could help you and that you need to talk to the police or child services etc. they might let you use their phone and/or know some numbers to call. \n\nYou are so important and deserve better and the fact that you recognise the problems is already a great step forward. \n\nI\u2019m a chronic depression sufferer and my parents were emotionally neglectedful as well so I can empathise with you. You can love and care about them but it absolutely does not mean you have to put up with being treated like you don\u2019t matter, because you do. I wish I had\u2019ve been as brave as you when I was 14. \nStay strong hun, know your worth and persist until you\u2019re in a better and safer situation, even if that means not being with your mum (for the time being anyway). \nYou can absolutely turn things around and have a good life and prevent having life long damage to your body because you\u2019re still young and really smart. \nPower through darling, you\u2019re stronger than you know!",

At 14 you should be able to grab at least breakfast and lunch yourself (parents make sure that fridge and pantry have food). \n\nI suggest that you join the autistic subs here on reddit and maybe contact a local support group in your area. You need support from others to empower you. Maybe authorities should be involved, but as soon as that's put into motion, it can go from bad to worse, so be cautious with that. \n\nAlso, start learning as many skills as possible to become independent, if the situation doesn't change a lot very soon, you have to be able to leave ASAP.",

One thing you can do is to call your council and make a social work referral yourself. It will be confidential so your mom won't know who it was that made the referral. That way a social worker can get involved and help keep your mom accountable. You can tell a school counselor too. Don't worry about them removing you from the home, that is only done in extreme circumstances and by a court order. A social worker will come to your house and assess the situation. You can speak with them in private and tell them everything you wrote here. Then they might have your mom take classes or privately work with your family ensuring your mom feeds and properly and treats you better. Also you can have someone to talk to about your food issues with. It's often a long wait for mental health services but see if you click with the counselor at school share this with them too. \n\nYou're not ungrateful, these are real needs of yours. You're growing and developing and deserve all the love and support you can get! Your mom chose to have you so she has certain responsibilities to fulfill. She is there to fulfill your needs, you are not there to fulfill hers. \n\nYou are already great at advocating for yourself because you were able to so well articulate your issues here on Reddit.
