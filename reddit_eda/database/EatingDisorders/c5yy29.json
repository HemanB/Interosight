  "selftext": "Hi, everyone. I just wanted to share with you how much I appreciate this sub. Today it's been 72 days since my last purge. I can't remember last time I felt that good. It's the longest I didn't purge in 6 years. \nI mean I still have these intrusive thoughts and sometimes it's not easy to eat my dinner. I gained a couple of kilos and that also makes me a bit sad. But I am NOT relapsing, can you beleive that???\nThis sub and my therapist saved me, I am sure. I feel almost healthy. I feel like I can make it to 90, 100, 1000 days. I'm typing this post and crying. I feel sorry for myself, for who I was. But I am hopeful, I enjoy my food and I finally felt full and liked it. \nI got a part time job so I could embrace my hobbies.\nI love my bullet journal. I love my ceramics. I love taking a nap during the day. And I love my breakfast, my lunch, my snacks and my dinner. \nThere is hope! Please enjoy life. There is a way to recover and thank you for showing it to me!",

Your body has been through hell and worrying about weight is what has gotten most of us into ED. Do your body, mind, and soul a favor by giving the finger to the scale. Healthy people are at all sizes.",
