  "title": "Request: My family often jokes about me eating a lot",
  "selftext": "I\u2019m a 17 year old female and my family jokes about me eating a lot. I have started to not eat as much and I\u2019m worried that I\u2019ll start not eating at all. My sister even went through the same thing but she\u2019s joining in on the jokes too. Every Wednesday my sister and I order food for lunch and on Tuesday night she asked me what I wanted to get, and I told her. I was smiling cause I asked to get food from one of my favorite restaurants, but then my mom said \u201coh Megan always smiles when it comes to food\u201d. Should I feel bad about what they\u2019re saying or am I just being sensitive?",

And like you're a teenager still growing and developing so it's normal for u to feel hungrier than others totally NORMAL.",

My mom has been commenting about my eating habits since I was young and even now that I lost a lot of weight she still pesters me and tells me I eat too much when I\u2019m barely eating anything anymore. It\u2019s kinda tiring and even if I tell her to stop she will for only a few days and start again.",
