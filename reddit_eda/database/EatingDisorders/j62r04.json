  "selftext": "Recently, I have been not happy to eat. I see it as just something I need to do in order to survive and not pass out. I try to postpone eating as much as possible until I absolutely have to eat because I feel so sick. However, I always feel gross eating and like I\u2019m going to throw up or when I think of food I also get nauseous. I don\u2019t know what is happening or if I should seek help.",

      "body": "This is more or less how I described what it\u2019s like eating; I don\u2019t enjoy it that much and see it as a chore. I was eventually diagnosed with ARFID, Avoidant-Restrictive Food Intake Disorder. Of course I\u2019m not diagnosing you, but it sounds like something you should look into. It can be described as being very picky, having little pleasure eating, being afraid to choke/vomit. It\u2019s a relatively newer ED but still mentioned in the DSM-V. Hope this was helpful",
