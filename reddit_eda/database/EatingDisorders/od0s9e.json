  "selftext": " \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m a therapist and starting to learn about treating eating  disorders. As I work with my supervisor before working with people on my  own, I\u2019m also curious to get feedback from people who struggle with ED.  What are some basic dos or don\u2019ts for therapists working ED? For  example: is it a big no-no to have someone keep a food log? Or is it  helpful under certain circumstances? What was helpful when seeing a  therapist? Or what was something cringeworthy during therapy?\n\nThank you for taking the time to enlighten me. I don\u2019t work with  clients with ED yet but have found many young teen clients that seem to  be skirting around the potential (hence my process for professional  growth as a therapist).",

I know so many people, including me, that have given up on therapy/recovery because of things like that. It's almost guaranteed to make them feel \"not sick enough\" and go back to their disorder or even actively make it worse as a result.\n\nI agree that keeping a log is only good for a few days to get a feel for their eating habits and establish concrete goals but I'd only do it between two sessions and then stop so the focus is taken away from the numbers, they'll do that by themselves anyway. What's helped me is reassurance that what I'm doing is good and right when I manage to eat but not being pressured to do things I'm not comfortable with and see every meal as my decision and if I can't do it I can try again next time without feeling like I'm disappointing my therapist.",

      "body": "1. Trust between client and therapist. I refuse to work with ED treatment professionals anymore. I\u2019m not manipulative, I try really hard to be honest, and I fight really hard to gain the trust of the people around me. Yet, I find that the narrative around eating disorder clients is that they can\u2019t be trusted. As a result, I put in tons of effort to prove I\u2019m honest, but treatment professionals have already put on the label before they\u2019ve even met me and their opinion never changes. It\u2019s created a lot of situations where I genuinely needed to be trusted and believed, and instead my feelings/emotions/and genuine needs were ignored and dismissed. Eventually, you stop advocating for yourself, because speaking up and being ignored hurts more than never speaking in the first place. It only reaffirms it that I\u2019m only seen as a mental illness and not a person. \n\n2. Inpatient/ residential treatment has a lot of flaws. It saves lives and helps many. But there are also many others who are traumatized by the experience, and feel the experience was harmful/ detrimental to their long term recovery. Trust issues with professionals after this becomes a big issue even when clients really want help. Use higher levels of care judiciously, and understand that it isn\u2019t this glorified solution that only leads to positive gains for everyone who steps through their care.\n\n3. Treat your adults like adults and not like children.\n\n4. ED treatment is often coercive, that\u2019s absolutely not going to fly with your clients who have trauma histories. Make sure you have a firm understanding of trauma informed care. Not all ED patients have trauma, but statistically speaking many of us do. \n\n5. I\u2019ve found that the whole, \u201cYou can\u2019t get anything out of therapy if you aren\u2019t well nourished\u201d to be inaccurate. At a certain weight/ daily calorie intake, this may be true, but don\u2019t underestimate what your clients are capable of accomplishing. If they can get straight A\u2019s in class, they can get something out of your therapy too. \n\n6. The idea that the eating disorder needs to be fully addressed and treated before dealing with any other mental health issue is one I struggle with greatly. My ED is a way to cope with PTSD symptoms. Learning to cope with the ptsd symptoms and process trauma decreased my need to depend on my ED to function. It was the greatest factor in my recovery process. When I went to residential, they took the approach of only treating the ED, and it was horribly ineffective and retraumatizing. It\u2019s taken an additional two years of trauma therapy and EMDR because residential treatment itself was so traumatic\u2026..outside of temporary weight restoration, it made every aspect of recovery much more difficult. Try recovering from an eating disorder when anything and everything that even remotely reminds you of treatment/ recovery triggers flashbacks.",

      "body": "Stay in your lane - you should be very careful with things like food logs and meal plans unless you are tag teaming with an RD that specializes in ED's. Depending how you use the information, you could wind up inadvertently putting something in the person's head that could lead to exacerbated ED behaviors. Don't make your patients keep a food log unless you damn well know what you plan to do with that information. And unless you have formal dietetics training, you should not be doing ANYTHING that looks like suggesting foods or meal plans, etc (if you're in the U.S., this could put you on the path to be sued). \n\nI feel like there should be some professional development classes, etc that your supervisor should work with you on to get a base knowledge of all eating disorders. \n\nOne thing I will say, that I wish all up-and-coming therapists understand: Not everyone in the ED community is comfortable with HAES or Body Positivity for a lot of reasons. Not everyone's eating disorder is rooted in some sort of systematic fat-phobia. (ie - don't make a patient feel guilty for not wanting their body to be a certain size -- examine the hell of out it to find the why, but a lot of HAES-recovery teams use this guilt tactic).  Educate yourself on what HAES and Body Positivity are,  but understand that many sufferers (especially those who've had a few therapists, hospital stays, etc), will be very resistant due to previous exposure.",

I already work with a variety of MH areas and I find this happens in many areas, unfortunately. I will definitely keep this in mind with ED as well, no 2 people are the same and no 2 presentations of ED is going to be the same. And you are not your mental illness. You\u2019re a person, with complexities, like anyone else. \n\n2. Holy guacamole, this is definitely true for all inpatient/residential placements. I\u2019ve worked in so many environments and have seen the best and the worst, even in one facility. Like you said, for some it\u2019s life saving, others it\u2019s traumatic. \n\n3. Does this really happen?! Don\u2019t answer that, it does. I\u2019ve seen it. I want to slap those people. \n\n4. Excellent point!! I am trauma informed care trained. For many years at this point and this is something I\u2019ve been able to adopt into my practice. An excellent reminder though and what people with ED may experience with other therapists. \n\n5. Oof. A lot to unpack there. And not in regards to you, but that statement in general. Even with in the learning stages of treating ED, that statement triggers me on many levels. Therapists need to give people more credit than that. \n\n6. I may be in the learning stages, but I\u2019m general, co-morbidities are so common in MH. Sometimes a certain area needs to be focused on and sometimes it\u2019s working on everything at one time as they all become intertwined. For example, ADHD can often create depression and anxiety in those who are struggling with symptoms, understandable the connection between them is important. And some days depression may be the primary focus, other days time management. I\u2019m so sorry your recovery process creates additional things to work on. I\u2019m glad EMDR was helpful for trauma, it\u2019s such an amazing therapeutic approach!! That may be my next endeavor, but one thing at a time. I tend to overextend myself and want to do it all (something I talk to my own therapist about as it\u2019s often to my own detriment). \n\nHope you\u2019re doing well in your recovery! And thank you for so much valuable information!!",

The RD suggestion is something I\u2019m going to look into more as it\u2019s been recommended by others as well. And I do want to clarify, I haven\u2019t suggested food logs to anyone, ever. It\u2019s definitely something that even someone who doesn\u2019t have ED could cause problems or even send down a path of ED, the complete opposite of what I\u2019d want. I really just wanted to give an example of something that really could be problematic and if it\u2019s a full stop. \n\nAs for body positivity, there\u2019s also toxic body positivity in that sometimes when someone is trying to be supportive and kind, it invalidates the person\u2019s feelings and experiences. When someone feels uncomfortable about a body feature and all they hear is \u201cyou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d sure, great, but that doesn\u2019t change that someone still may not like their nose, legs, whatever. And trying to convince someone otherwise, just isn\u2019t helpful. And HAES, it can have its place, but as with anything else, it\u2019s so individualized with a variety of factors that could be contributing to someone\u2019s perspective or experience (culture, religion, socioeconomic status, underlying medical conditions, etc.). \n\nSorry, went on a bit of a tangent there. Just kind of have some issues with the body positivity movement and how it can actually be toxic and invalidating. I\u2019ve worked in MH a long time and have seen some pretty toxic things that just make me cringe, and that being one of them.\n\nAnyway, thank you so much for your response!!",

But we\u2019re going to talk about it *together* before anything is done.\u201d And I\u2019ve had that happen, and instead of freaking out (like many newer therapist may) we talk, I obviously assess for plan, means, intent (the usual) and in the end the client and I often call together or if the parent is in the waiting room we\u2019ll invite them to join the session. Sometimes they want me to talk and sometimes they take the lead. Sometimes they text instead of call. It depends on the situation, but I find having a conversation rather than becoming an alarmist not only keeps the rapport, it also helps the teen begin to have more dialogue with their parents. If parents are not supportive, then we may do a contract for safety, create a safety plan together, or contact crisis together if they can\u2019t contract for safety.

Fact remains I was still a woman in my early 20s entitled to feelings around my body just like everyone else. Recovery came with the expectation that I would now accept my body in a way that isn\u2019t expected of anyone else, otherwise I \u2018wasn\u2019t really recovering\u2019. In reality everyone carries body and image issues, it\u2019s an unfair expectation to place on someone to \u2018get over\u2019 that and be perfectly accepting of themselves 100% of the time and I believe pushing this really just forces those in recovery to shut up about it. \n\nI think that\u2019s important to note.",

Thank you for that perspective so I can keep it in my for keeping goals realistic. \n\nOn a side note and unrelated to ED, it reminds me of how adults expect kids to never get angry, upset, or fidgety, etc. they\u2019ll get in trouble for getting angry but we as adults feel all those things and express ourselves. It\u2019s all about how it\u2019s expressed that becomes important. So if I try to tie this back to ED, we all experience body image issues, but it\u2019s how we address those issues that determines if it\u2019s problematic and possible ED related?",

But we\u2019re going to talk about it *together* before anything is done.\u201d And I\u2019ve had that happen, and instead of freaking out (like many newer therapist may) we talk, I obviously assess for plan, means, intent (the usual) and in the end the client and I often call together or if the parent is in the waiting room we\u2019ll invite them to join the session. Sometimes they want me to talk and sometimes they take the lead. Sometimes they text instead of call. It depends on the situation, but I find having a conversation rather than becoming an alarmist not only keeps the rapport, it also helps the teen begin to have more dialogue with their parents. If parents are not supportive, then we may do a contract for safety, create a safety plan together, or contact crisis together if they can\u2019t contract for safety. Panicking doesn\u2019t help anything. And I\u2019d hope that for ED, I\u2019d be taking a similar approach that I used for self-harm.",

This was the first day I've spoken to this woman. Rlly put me off of sharing stuff and gave me trust issues",

          "body": "Omg! That\u2019s awful! I work with teens who self-harm through cutting and they ask me if I\u2019m going to tell their parents. And especially if they\u2019re age of consent in MH (14 in my state) the answer is \u201cI will only breach confidentiality if you\u2019re suicidal or homicidal and I believe there\u2019s immediate risk. But we\u2019re going to talk about it *together* before anything is done.\u201d And I\u2019ve had that happen, and instead of freaking out (like many newer therapist may) we talk, I obviously assess for plan, means, intent (the usual) and in the end the client and I often call together or if the parent is in the waiting room we\u2019ll invite them to join the session. Sometimes they want me to talk and sometimes they take the lead. Sometimes they text instead of call. It depends on the situation, but I find having a conversation rather than becoming an alarmist not only keeps the rapport, it also helps the teen begin to have more dialogue with their parents. If parents are not supportive, then we may do a contract for safety, create a safety plan together, or contact crisis together if they can\u2019t contract for safety. Panicking doesn\u2019t help anything. And I\u2019d hope that for ED, I\u2019d be taking a similar approach that I used for self-harm.",

When I thought the session was over (this was through an online service, it was a rlly reputable and trusted company that everybody pointed to as \"the perfect service\") and put my phone down, theyd blow it up every 5 minutes and threaten to call the cops if I didn't reply within 15. This gave me so much anxiety that every notification physically stopped my breath and made me shake.",

It may depend on state and licensing boards, but in general SI/HI with plan, means, and intent are the grounds for breaking confidentiality (and child/elder abuse/neglect). I have clients who have chronic SI, they have plans and means, but will deny intent. We come up with safety plans, I make sure they have the crisis #, and get a contract for safety.",
