  "selftext": "I am well into adulthood and can\u2019t seem to stop eating bad food excessively when I\u2019m stressed/depressed/tired. For my health, I need to stop, but I can\u2019t seem to last more than a day or two. The harder I try to stop, the more I eat. I feel mentally and physically awful, but I can\u2019t break the cycle. How do I do this? Help!",

I have a friend who paints her nails. She has like 200 nail polishes, paints them, and then listens to books on tape while she's letting them dry.",

( not in a starving myself sense ) \nI still ask myself every once and awhile when I\u2019m upset if I\u2019m just wanting to eat out of sadness. \n\nI do something healthy to take my mind off of that sad thing. Whether it be writing my issues on paper instead of self destruction or instead of getting angry at others, mediating, doing something spiritual, taking a bath, listening to music, going for a walk in a field, or even just hanging out w/ my dog or sitting outback to get fresh air. \n\nIf I\u2019m hungry then I\u2019ll eat, if it\u2019s just something that\u2019ll make me feel worse later then I wait until I\u2019m actually hungry.",

I get what you\u2019re saying about finding something to replace the habit, but I\u2019m just not sure what can compete with food. The taste, texture, and instant gratification are intoxicating. I have young kids so I don\u2019t have much time to develop new interests. Even finding a few minutes to out on makeup is often a challenge. But food is always right there. I guess I need to explore more, but I\u2019m just so exhausted and discouraged that it sounds daunting.",
