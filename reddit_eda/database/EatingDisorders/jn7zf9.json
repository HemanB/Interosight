The only way to stop bingeing is to stop restricting which of course is easier said. The help of someone trained in this field is what you need! And I just wanted to say that you can and will overcome this! I went through binge-restrict anorexia as well and am in recovery! I recommend looking for a cbt oriented therapist along with a dietitian.",

      "body": "This has always been my frustration with labels. No one fits perfectly into them. I was first diagnosed with bulimia, then anorexia-b/p subtype, then anorexia-R subtype. At the point of those diagnosis, I had never binged, but I did purge regularly. It made me feel super gross and invalidated (which is a garbage mindset I have since moved on from!).\nI guess they kinda just try to shove you into the box that fits \"best\". Realistically almost everyone should probably be under OSFED as eating disorders really are a spectrum, but they use diagnostic labels to help with treatment and insurance. \n\nBut yes, I have known many people with anorexia who regularly binged, with or without purging (people diagnosed with both anorexia-R and anorexia-b/p). I've actually pretty rarely met someone who's struggled with an ED for any considerable amount of time who hasn't experienced binging. I think it's more common than people are willing to admit. After the point of those diagnoses, I have also experienced a few binges (I'm not sure whether it would meet the medical definition or not, but they were terrifying). It's a really natural response to restriction, especially severe restriction or fasting. However, they are dangerous :c but I'm sure I'm preaching to the choir. EDs are dangerous. \n\nThe best way to avoid binges is, frustratingly, to eat the amount you need to satisfy your physical and emotional needs. It also definitely takes time :c",

Eat every 4 hours so your body trusts you that food is available. When you restrict your body thinks its in a famine and then you binge because it thinks its the last time food is available. You have to teach it that food is abundant. You can't do that if you aren't regularly eating.",
