  "selftext": "I've been binging for such a lot time and everytime I try to find help I end up getting the same advice. I'm not restricting myself before or after, I just get super strong urges whenever there's food. I also suffer from severe body dysmorphia and now I'm at the heaviest I've ever been, it's driving me crazy. For people who have gone/going through binging disorders, how did you stop it? ",

      "body": "I've had the same issue and I've done something that (kinda?) worked for me. I started bringing food into my own room (since I am always in my room) as a way to try and start not eating something every time I'm near it. I also go for other things like distracting myself, or just sticking to one bowl/plate of food and not getting seconds. Another thing I did was take a sip or a few sips of water between each 3 bites of food.",
