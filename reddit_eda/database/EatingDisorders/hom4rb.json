I've been on and off with starving myself which might have something to do with it idk. \nSomeone just help me please.",

      "body": "With respect, this may not just pass as someone suggested below. People can starve themselves for many years until they die or get into binge/purge cycles until they die or need medical attention. Some things don't just go away on their own. \n\nI don't feel you've really given us enough information for us to be able to give a meaningful response. I will say that when I was first unwell, I told everyone that I wasn't eating because eating made me feel sick. It was not exactly the truth... I knew there was nothing physically wrong with me, but eating did make me feel so much anxiety and terror, and that was a simple way to say it. I used to always complain that my stomach hurt, though I didn't really have a stomach ache. Again, I had anxiety.\n\nIs your feeling physically sick related to anxiety? If so, it may be time to reach out for help. For me, I was hospitalized for a few months and put on some anxiety medication short-term (a year or two). Both of those things just unlocked my life and freed me and made me feel like myself again. It wasn't perfect. I relapsed a few times, sadly, but at least I got a break from the dreary life that starvation had created.\n\nIf any of this rings true, don't just wait and see if it blows over. Don't just take a vitamin. Ask yourself some questions about what is really happening here and seek help.",

      "body": "That sounds really difficult, i get myself into similar situations! If you\u2019re starving yourself it makes it very hard when you actually come to sit down and eat a meal, I find I get so nauseous and my appetite is gone! To help this I make sure to snack on fruits, hummus and veg dips, things that aren\u2019t so heavy on the stomach so that when it\u2019s meal time I don\u2019t feel totally destroyed! \n\nIf you haven\u2019t already, and you feel comfortable enough, have a chat with your boyfriend. It\u2019s hard to think about what to eat when you don\u2019t want to think about it at all! He may be able to take some pressure away and cater to your needs, remember; the people around you can help, it\u2019s hard to communicate such a complex thing and it can hurt to do so, but you will be building up a positive and safe environment by establishing what you need! You\u2019re allowed to struggle and you don\u2019t need to hide that from the people around you. <3",

I\u2019m sorry this is causing you lots of anxiety. Maybe let you parents know what is going on and see if they can get you in with a counselor or a dietitian. It\u2019ll all be okay!",
