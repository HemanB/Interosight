  "selftext": "For a couple months now I've been obsessing over it. I know it's wrong and unhealthy but I can't help but think that how I am right now is unhealthy, and everyone seems to be eating less than me or exercising more. I scroll endlessly on my phone watching skinny people eating skinny foods and cutting calories and before and after photos. They never leave my brain. I have been thinking about it a lot more for the past 2 weeks and i have been eating on/off. If I am eating, I completely binge and then try and throw it all up. I'm worried about what my family will think. I'm worried about what I'm going to do to myself if I don't stop.",

I loved it when people at work asked me if i was okay because I looked sick. I loved it when i saw others eating and I wasn\u2019t. I loved it when I felt so hungry going to bed every night. I told myself i was disciplined and I had self control. I loved it so much. This went on for a month. After, my binge eating started. I couldn\u2019t stop eating. It was like I lose all my hunger and fullness cues. I tried to stop eating when until satiated, but i just ended up eating until my stomach ached so much I couldn\u2019t move. I gained all the weight back, and a bit more. \n\nhonestly, as much as i would like to eat normally again, id be lying if i said I didn\u2019t want to starve myself again like how I did before.

      "body": "I can really understand what your going thru, and how your mind is consumed 24/7 with what to eat or not eat and what diet is going to fix you. I remember bouncing from one thought to the next, and one solution that would help to the next. Nothing worked! I was stuck in an endless cycle of restricting, binge eating and compulsive exercise. I couldn't stop! Sometimes I could last a day or so on a meal plan, only to blow it later on, and end up in the food or body obsession all over again! Then I obsessed about how I looked compared to everyone else, and I just felt so miserable and depressed and isolated. Nobody understood me, and I wanted to stop but didn't know is how to stop and stay stopped. After years of struggling and trying ti solve the problem myself, I was able to accept that I couldn't figure out how to stop, and I was so tired of being sick and tired. I was so desperate to try something new and that promised to make me feel normal around food and in my body again, and I thought it sounded to good to be true, but I'm so grateful to be able to say this solution works. I am free and neutral around my compulsive food behaviors and thoughts. I can go anywhere and be around any food and not be tempted! So, if you have tried everything you can think of, and you can't stop from starting, and can't stop when you start, you may be like me, and perhaps need a new solution. I'm happy to help answer any questions or share my experience anytime. Please reach out if I can help! :) \n\nhttps://www.cceabbsg.org/",

Just take care of yourself and make sure your feeling happy. Change your bad habits like scrolling on soical media. Find good habits that make you feel good and happy. I think the reason you binge is because the presure your putting on yourself is too big. It gets so much you cant controll it. So as I said seek help if you feel like you need it.

I had so much physical pain all through my body that I couldn't stand up. I fainted and collapsed daily. I have no friends because a life dedicated to starving doesn't leave any time for friends. I failed at school and lost jobs because I was too sick to work or in hospital. My family were mad and terrified and I was too. It is the most horrible thing I've ever dealt with. I've got osteoporosis in my 20s. I probably can't have kids. My hair was falling out and I basically had fur over my body just to keep warm. I was cold even in the heat of summer. I've had my control taken from me multiple times just to keep me alive. It is not glamorous or fun. It's torture. I cried myself to sleep and woke up feeling sick from anxiety every night for years. \n\nI'm finally working towards recovery after a near death experience a few months ago and am once again inpatient.

The best thing to do is take a break from social media and focus more on yourself, prioritizing self care. There are many ways to lose weight without having an ED.

I\u2019ve been thinking about it and honestly I\u2019d rather have these thoughts and feelings and be skinny then have them and still be fat. It\u2019s a willpower I envy, but I do understand people\u2019s pain and struggles with their ed. But I\u2019m so sick of being fat to the point where I don\u2019t even like food cause of how much it hurts me. But I think about it all the freaking time. The food noises never leaves me alone.",
