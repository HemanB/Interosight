  "selftext": "I have an eating disorder, anorexia nervosa. I\u2019m in the recovery process now and I have appointments at the hospital every two weeks. The doctors keep telling me that if I don\u2019t put on weight by the next appointment, I will be admitted to the hospital against my will. There\u2019s nothing that I fear most. So I\u2019ve been giving myself permission to eat because it seems like I have an excuse to do it. The problem is that now food is all I can think about. I just want to eat. Everything and anything. And my stomach never seems to get full. I even wake up in the middle of night craving food. What is wrong with me? How do I overcome this? Nutritionists, psychiatrists and therapists are not helping. I already feel fat and I will get fatter if I keep going down this path. I\u2019m going from one extreme to the other. HELP",

There\u2019s this terrible shame that came from it, and it made me guilty for eating anything, the way I was eating, everything. But when you\u2019ve been deprived of something for so long it\u2019s hard not to do that, because you\u2019re not eating like a pig, you\u2019re eating like you\u2019re starving, because you are\u2026\u00a0\nIt\u2019s really hard to eat with this disease. At one point, I was almost entirely mentally recovered, but eating was just entirely exhausting to me, just because the thoughts still lurked and it was just extremely hard to do it, around Spring 2016. I was complaining to someone about not being able to eat just because of that fear and it just was so exhausting, I had already had broken away from habits that induced my body dysmorphia like measurements, looking in the mirror, etc. I just was extremely tired. He told me that even though I had broken so many of my rituals related to body dysmorphia, I still had specific rituals regarding eating food such as lining things up, and thinking about what I want to avoid, even though I knew I shouldn\u2019t and needed to think differently. He told me that I needed to break these other rituals by finding a new strategy to replace the way I currently ritualistically, and I\u2019m telling you this not because you\u2019re in any way ready to attempt this, this is like my last step in recovery, and I don\u2019t recommend it all until you\u2019ve totally practiced recovery so you don\u2019t do it wrong. I\u2019m telling you this, because I was still a growing child and having trouble keeping up with the growth milestones that the doctor would set for me, even thought it was totally exhausting to eat.

People around me keep telling me that I\u2019m not making an effort following doctors\u2019 instructions, but that\u2019s not true. People can\u2019t expect to change habits and routines you\u2019ve had for 15 years just like that\u2026 \nIt\u2019s hard when you see your body changing and you know you aren\u2019t even doing it the right way. I\u2019m following my nutritionist\u2019s plan and still get hungry and cravings all the time.",
