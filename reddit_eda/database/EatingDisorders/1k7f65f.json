  "title": "I used to love fashion until I gained weight from recovery (need advice?)",
  "selftext": "So i have never officially been diagnosed with anything but ive had disordered/restrictive eating all my life due to a desire to be thin and beautiful. I would just simply not eat. \n\nWhen i was at my lowest weight, i loved wearing things that made me look \"sexy\" For reference, I dressed in a very y2k/mcbling style. (Micro skirts, cheetah prints, metallics, low waist/crop tops, just revealing clothes in general) \n\nIf im being honest, i was actually quite happy during my \"eating disorder\" but the physical and mental exhaustion (along with a whole list of symptoms im sure you're all aware of) from the malnutrition was really affecting my studies and so my parents ( im a uni student who commutes) have started to \"force\" me to eat three regular meals a day. I say \"force\" on quotations because I wasn't really that opposed to the idea since I could barely function back then. \n\nSo far my \"recovery\" has been okay-ish, like I'm feeling a lot better which is a natural consequence of nourishing your body, so like I'm not constantly freezing, I have a lot of energy (I'm able to take the stairs now if I want to) and most importantly, I'm able to focus on my studies. \n\nHowever,,, my biggest passion/hobby was fashion. And since I've gained weight, barely any of my clothes fit me anymore. For now, since I don't know what my \"full recovery\" weight will be, I've put off buying any new clothes, I've just been wearing anything oversized/baggy or borrowing from my mom's wardrobe. If I'm going to be honest, this is making me really really depressed. I thought recovery was supposed to make me feel better, like technically I'm physically better but I don't even bother with clothes anymore, I just wake up and slap on some random sweatpants/sweatshirts. All my friends and family keep asking why I'm not dressing up anymore but it just makes me so depressed because it's not like I can just walk into an old navy and get the same clothes in a bigger size. A lot of my clothes were one-of-a-kind/vintage or discontinued. \n\n\nMy friends keep encouraging me to continue collecting, but to just restart my wardrobe with my \"recovery size\" but it's like that feeling when you've been playing a video game for so long and you collected all these event-exclusive items, but suddenly your account got deleted. So you make a new account for the game and start fresh, but your passion for it just dies and you just don't play the game anymore. \n\nI keep scrolling on Pinterest boards in sadness and I just don't know how to stop feeling so depressed about this. I guess tldr is that I miss feeling sexy lolll. ",

      "body": "I feel you. It\u2019s especially tough when you\u2019ve got so many beautiful items. I\u2019m sure it was a lot of work to have collected those. That said, in time, you would\u2019ve wanted to change your style anyway. No? Would you consider starting to go back into some vintage places and looking for new items in new sizes? One item at a time. It takes time to rebuild.\n\nListen, we are all (likely all of us in this sub-Reddit) inappropriately raised, trained or groomed to believe that only a certain body type is allowed to look a certain way. That is utter bullshit, incorrect, and quite frankly a lot of the problem that starts many - of the more vulnerable of us - on the path towards disordered eating, which leads to eating disorders. \n\nMy favourite quote from the last decade was from a little girl who was in a change room while out shopping with her mama. Her mama posted to Socials what she heard from the dressing room about the pants that her daughter was trying on\u2026. The little girl said, \u201cMama, my thighs are too powerful for these pants.\u201d\n\nIt warmed my heart. It made me realize that maybe, just maybe, there\u2019s a way to educate more children to understand (like her) that it\u2019s not your thighs that are the problem, it\u2019s the pants. Fuck the old pants. Find better ones.\n\nWarm hug.",

I had a similar experience, it was a friend's birthday party and the theme was just \"your best outfit\" and I had such a hard time because I practically gave up making myself look pretty after the weight gain from recovery. I tried wearing some of my bigger/loose clothes but even at that point, it didn't even fit the theme. I remember a couple of my friends being a little disappointed because I didn't dress up but I just didn't have the confidence to wear my usual style of crop tops and mini skirts. \n\nI definitely think it's easier to look for people on Pinterest or TikTok with a more realistic body type (a body type similar to yourself), and see how certain clothes look on them before buying the clothes yourself so you can save yourself the frustration of trying it on, hating it, and reselling it \ud83d\ude2a \n\nI've been following curvier fashion influencers to see how certain outfits look and I think it kind of helps as unconscipis exposure therapy almost? Like I'm getting a little more used to my thicker body after seeing beautiful fashionable who are just as thick as I am whereas before I would look at super skinny models in runway shows & I think that's where I got this idea in my head that I needed to be as skinny as them to \"pull off\" wearing certain things.
