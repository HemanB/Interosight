  "selftext": "I gained back the weight i lost during my ED. And I\u2019m fine about that. Because when I lost weight during my ED I lost more than just the pounds. I lost trust in my body. I lost all my strength. I lost a healthy immune system. I lost my fertility. I lost joy in what I ate. Now im eating full; delicious meals every day. I powerlift and do yoga: exercise to make me strong and feel good, not solely to match a number. I\u2019m at a healthy weight and an athletic body fat percentage. I eat salads and smoothies regularly, I also have ice cream and mashed potatoes with butter regularly. Both types of food make me feel good and make my body strong and nourished. I\u2019ve gained weight, muscle, and joy. It\u2019s taken a long time, and every days not perfect but I feel beautiful and empowered in my body. If you\u2019re struggling, I feel for you and I promise you that realizing you\u2019re struggling is the first step to healing. Sending love and light\u2764\ufe0f",
