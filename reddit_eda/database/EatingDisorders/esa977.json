  "selftext": " So, I was very underweight a while ago. Before today, the last time I weighed myself was threeish? months ago. I had barely entered a healthy BMI. I assumed a general linear trend upwards, so I thought I was probably 10 - 15 pounds above that weight by now, having followed semi-normalish? by my previous standards eating habits. I couldn't resist any more. It was calling to me. I stepped on the scale. My weight actually didn't change at all. And I realized how incredibly fucked up my estimations were. Like, I was genuinely terrified that I weighed 20 pounds more than this. (Which would have still been perfectly fine, but that's a whole 'nother issue.) Eating disorder brain couldn't see the difference in 20 pounds. I don't know what my point was, or if I even ever had a point. I guess just don't listen to that little voice - it's a fucking liar. \n\nDoes anyone have advice for me?",

I used to ruin holidays by getting more and more anxious about my weight with every passing day and I'd end up having to go into pharmacies to use their scales, in public. \n\nThank fuck I found some portable travel scales online which now travel everywhere with me and save me from the immense, ratcheting anxiety.",

I stayed there (give or take a few fluctuations depending on hydration).\n\nYou begin to realise that gaining weight isn't such a huge deal. Your body works properly, you have energy, you can eat without caring that much, you can laugh with friends, you can exercise freely. It's life changing and liberating, and at the other end you realise it wasn't *that* awful.",

      "body": "That happens to me a lot. My lowest and highest weight as an adult were only about 20-25 lbs apart and I literally could not tell the difference. I would be convinced I gained a ton of weight, or lost a ton, and step on the scale to see no change.\n\nI stopped weighing myself completely. I've got enough clothes now that I know become tight or loose on me when I'm at different weights, so I figure I'll notice the change in fit if my weight changes a huge amount. Otherwise, it's not worth knowing.",

And then all of a sudden I feel proud? When two seconds ago I was ashamed. It\u2019s all linked to (at least for me) my brain coping with its need for acceptance. If I don\u2019t feel accepted it must be because I don\u2019t look good enough or I weigh too much so that\u2019s what I perceive in the mirror. My perception of my own weight will never be accurate and I\u2019ve learned to just not shame myself no matter what I see. It\u2019s the only way to stay away from that damn scale.",

When I ate the 3 meals with two snacks like the recommended, I found I could portion better because I wasn\u2019t overwhelmed with hunger and the binge prevention was astounding. It truly changed my life. One of the crazy things about your weight is that because we\u2019ve messed up our metabolisms so massively, yes you might initially experience weight gain in recovery but eventually your metabolism will fire up again and even out. Our bodies are amazing!",
