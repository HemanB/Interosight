  "title": "Request: Should I let my recovering daughter buy a scale?",
  "selftext": "This may seem obvious to some but allow me to explain. For the last two months, my adult daughter has been trying to adhere to a weight-restoration diet as well as seeing a doctor via telehealth once every two weeks in order to treat her anorexia. She seems very unhappy, but she still adheres to her meal-plan for the most part. The days of her appointments, she is supposed to weigh herself, so I\u2019ve reluctantly agreed to let her keep a scale in her bathroom. \n\nWell, today our scale broke, and I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to buy a new one for the doctor\u2019s measurements if I didn\u2019t feel like my daughter gave me so many reasons to pause. For example, how did she realise the scale was broken on a day she isn\u2019t allowed to weigh herself? Furthermore, when I said I would \u201cwait and see\u201d about buying another one, she started crying, begging me to understand how much she \u201cneeds\u201d a scale. She\u2019s also been losing a little bit of weight over the last two weeks, so I\u2019m concerned she\u2019s measuring her weight then compensating for her diet in some way. After all, she admitted a few days ago that she was hoping the target weight set by the doctor would turn out to be an \u201coverestimation\u201d \n\nI don\u2019t know, should I replace the broken scale if she\u2019s this upset about it? Do you think there\u2019s a way for an anorexic to own a scale and not reinforce their disease?",

Based on what you've shared, it sounds like your daughter's ED may be trying to get a scale to fight weight restoration. If you do get another scale, it might be a good idea to keep the scale in your control and not your daughter's as it sounds like her ED is still strong and trying to call the shots for her. I think her doctor would best be able to determine whether her having a scale to track weight restoration outweighs the risk of the scale fueling her ED.",

Personally, I find the idea of a recovering anorexic weighing themselves on their own rather strange and counterproductive, but perhaps it's a necessity due to the pandemic. I used to be anorexic and I still can't own a scale and prefer not to know my weight at all. The simplest thing to do is to take away the possibility of being tempted by the scale, because it just doesn't need to be there.",

My dad used to weigh me between appointments to make sure I was staying on track (honestly very necessary) and he would not let me look at the scale. I was a kid at the time so maybe that's easier said than done, but maybe at a time that she is feeling better, you could discuss the idea and see if she agrees that it is not helpful for her to see the number and maybe she will agree that the number should be hidden from her. \n\nIf she has a bad day and begs to see the number, you can go back to the fact that it was her decision to not look. \n\nIf she do a not agree with the idea to have you weigh her and you hide the number, maybe she will come around to that idea in time if you don't push it and trust that she will take steps to improve when she is ready if she feels safe to do so",

At first I was panicking badly but flash forward a few years and I'm fully recovered and maintain a healthy size but I've not weighed myself in years and don't plan on doing so as I find using my clothes as an indicator is all I need.

Your house shouldn't be a place where she weights herself as it is a really anxious process. She may be really frustrated about you not buying a scale but believe me it's the best thing to do !!

I'm in outpatient therapy, and the scale is a major part of my recovery. It's a reassurance checking that I'm okay, not gaining weight, feel secure and in control, and a major head trip. Just the idea of giving over that control still messes with my head.\n\n I went from weighing myself constantly every day to once a week. Now I'm at twice a week. She (and maybe you together) should talk to her doctor. Maybe she has started weighing more. Or maybe the idea of not having a scale is scaring her. Maybe she has been following the plan. It's hard to say. But a good tool may also be that she weighs herself with you. That way another person is aware of her weight and when she weighs herself. I'm also not supposed to keep my scale out where I can see it or easily step on it to reduce the urge. If you have any other questions, we are here!",
