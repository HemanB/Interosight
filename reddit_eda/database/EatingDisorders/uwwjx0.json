  "selftext": "I stepped on the weighing scale today at the hospital since it was a requirement for my medications. I haven't weighed in a long time since September and I gained weight thanks to my anti-depressants. When I saw my weight today, I can't deny I got major anxiety over it and it was triggering. \n\nBut after reflecting some thought, I also realized I regained the weight I had when my eating habits were at least still healthy and not disordered. I also realized I wasted those 4 years of restricting, exercising too much, and obsession on body image just to look super tiny. It took a huge toll both on my physical and mental health.\n\nI am not 100% mentally or physically recovered BUT I am so glad my period has been consistent since last year ever since I started eating properly. I can't help but to eat more than during my disordered eating years since my hunger levels increased as my anxiety and depression have been improving.",
