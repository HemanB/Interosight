  "selftext": "I need to express something that\u2019s been on my mind for a while. It frustrates me that people always feel the need to comment on my body\u2014whether it\u2019s my parent, grandparent, acquaintances, or even the person I was intimate with. Each of them, in their own way, has negatively impacted how I feel about my body.\n\nOnce, I went out with someone who placed their hands around my waist and said they loved how thin I was. Initially, I appreciated the compliment, but soon after, I became obsessed with staying the same and never changing. I started feeling distressed even when I was just bloated because I wanted to look perfect and feel good in my body. But eventually, it felt like everything was an illusion, and I wanted to change everything about myself, from my nails to my skin, my blood to my hair.\n\nSometimes people tell me I look \u201cfuller\u201d and seem pleased about it. In those moments, I just want to disappear. But I also dislike it when they say I look thinner, as now they say it with worry. I no longer have a clear image of what my body really looks like, and I believe this confusion comes from listening to so many conflicting comments about the same body I\u2019ve had all my life and taking them to heart.\n\nI wish I could simply enjoy being myself.",

Does a lot more harm than they realize. Sorry you\u2019re dealing with this, I feel you 100%. The best you can do is ask people not to comment on your body in any way or just change the topic or leave the conversation and distract yourself in something else.",

He'd been stalking me online through the library website. I had to transfer to another branch for awhile. Then I came back and he saw me. He came right up to the reference desk and yelled. \"You've put on a tremendous amount of weight.\" Then he laughed and left. My coworker came out to gloat over what he said because she was jealous when I was cute and skinny. That's something that's been burned into my brain. But he stopped sending me rape threats through email and the reference ask a librarian website. \n\nI'm naturally fat. Getting thin takes monumental effort. Fat is my protection against men being sexually interested in me. Fat is also how they bully, shame, and insult me too.",

      "body": "Last year I asked my friends to not give me compliments or comments based on my body, after a friend (meaning well) told me I was \"scary skinny with a good ass\" (a real double edged sword of a comment for my ED). My bf is an exception because he knows what to say most of the time, and we've been together for two years so I can normally laugh about it if he says something accidentally triggering now, though when we started dating he would often be a source of my ED thoughts. My family MOSTLY doesn't comment anymore, though a few people I've not seen much since I was really sick will sometimes come out with the \"you look better\" and I have to talk myself down and remind myself they mean well.\n\nIt sucks people make comments, and I wish we could live in a world where appearances didn't matter so much. I think of my family as kind of a lost cause for mental health awareness, except my mum who has finally after ten years learnt a lot about my ED and BPD and stopped making ignorant comments. It's hard for people to understand EDs, some people think we want to hear we're thin, some people think we want to get better and that is synonymous with weight gain and don't understand the mental ramifications that has, because surely if you're \"bigger\" you must be totally fine now.",
