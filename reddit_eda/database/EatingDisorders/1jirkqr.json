It's the publicity.\n\nI have to take both metformin and welbutrin together for weight loss (and as an antidepressant) because my BMI was at 47, and I was starting to experience extreme joint pain. I couldn't work out because of asthma and couldn't change my diet because of my BED. \n\nI agree that the way they're talking is terrible, but the medication itself shouldn't be the total negative.\n\nEdit: I would like to say that before you downvote, please think about the fact that this is not just an ana sub. It's eating disorders as a whole. I feel like a lot of the time, BED gets pushed to the side and shamed because from an ana prospective, we're doing what you can't. But from a BED perspective, all I want is to be a healthy weight. I'm 300 lbs. I'm only 20, and I have extreme joint pain in my hips because of it. I can do strength training, but all that does is add more weight. I've only just recently been able to eat without feeling guilty about the binge. I no longer fast for days after a binge.\n\nMedication is a tool. You wouldn't forgo a shovel just because you have hands. Yes, medication can be abused, and it can be co-oped by the media and trends, but it can still help people.\n\nMy best friend and I are polar opposites she is recovering from Anorexia, and I have Binge Eating Disorder. We both support each other, though. She doesn't care if I take meds to assist in my weight loss because she's been on the other side of that coin. She supports the fact that I'm using the tools at my disposal for my own recovery, and I will support her in hers.\n\nPlease remember this when you shame people for taking meds. I understand that it feels like you've put in more effort, but the meds only really work properly with diet and exercise. I do what I can using the meds to help me have a healthy diet and to be able to exercise to the best of my ability.\n\nLike I said at the beginning, it's not the medications themselves that are the issue. It's how our society views them and weight that's the issue.\n\nContinue to be kind to yourself and others. You never know who might be on the other side of your coin.",

Like you said, they are cheating, but it's not the right solution to the problem.\n\n For @OP, I think maybe you should let your friends know it makes you uncomfortable. If they are on Ozempc for weight loss, they must have at least SOME understanding of having thoughts of feeling the need to be skinny, it's possible they even have an ED themselves. You don't have to get angry with them about it, or even tell them how much it upsets you, you can just say \"hey that makes me uncomfortable,  could you please not make those sorts of comments around me\". If they wanna abide, cool. If not, ditch em. Or, less drastic but still effective, don't agree to anymore social settings where you'd be eating a lunch or dinner together.",

It's the publicity.\n\nI have to take both metformin and welbutrin together for weight loss (and as an antidepressant) because my BMI was at 47, and I was starting to experience extreme joint pain. I couldn't work out because of asthma and couldn't change my diet because of my BED. \n\nI agree that the way they're talking is terrible, but the medication itself shouldn't be the total negative.\n\nEdit: I would like to say that before you downvote, please think about the fact that this is not just an ana sub. It's eating disorders as a whole. I feel like a lot of the time, BED gets pushed to the side and shamed because from an ana prospective, we're doing what you can't. But from a BED perspective, all I want is to be a healthy weight. I'm 300 lbs. I'm only 20, and I have extreme joint pain in my hips because of it. I can do strength training, but all that does is add more weight. I've only just recently been able to eat without feeling guilty about the binge. I no longer fast for days after a binge.\n\nMedication is a tool. You wouldn't forgo a shovel just because you have hands. Yes, medication can be abused, and it can be co-oped by the media and trends, but it can still help people.\n\nMy best friend and I are polar opposites she is recovering from Anorexia, and I have Binge Eating Disorder. We both support each other, though. She doesn't care if I take meds to assist in my weight loss because she's been on the other side of that coin. She supports the fact that I'm using the tools at my disposal for my own recovery, and I will support her in hers.\n\nPlease remember this when you shame people for taking meds. I understand that it feels like you've put in more effort, but the meds only really work properly with diet and exercise. I do what I can using the meds to help me have a healthy diet and to be able to exercise to the best of my ability.\n\nLike I said at the beginning, it's not the medications themselves that are the issue. It's how our society views them and weight that's the issue.\n\nContinue to be kind to yourself and others. You never know who might be on the other side of your coin.",

I will use the tools I have at my disposal. It's like using a shovel instead of your hands when digging holes for flowers. You don't need to get an even bigger shovel when the one you have is perfect. But giving one to someone using their hands won't hurt. \n\nHealthy is healthy no matter how you get there. What matters is you're there. Even if you waver and dip down or go up, what matters is that you are treating your body with love and care. And what's healthy for one person could be unhealthy for another. But you're still someone to be proud of, no matter how far you've come.",

I am on Lexapro and the Nexplanon so this weight gain has been really hard on me the ads aren\u2019t helping. It\u2019s all beautiful women smiling and dancing while they explain the weight loss. I had finally gotten comfortable with my weight gain and then I saw an ad of a plus size woman on Ozempic talking about how she wants to be healthier. That felt like a knife to the heart.",

Being able to be weened of medications is exactly why they emphasize the healthy diet and exercise part in commercials (the things that most influencers and celebrities leave out). You can definitely become healthy for what your body deems healthy with the help of medications. They aren't mutually exclusive. Medication is just a tool, but you can't make use of a tool without putting in some work.",

Everything in the world takes effort, and if they can't see that, they deserve to learn the hard way.",
