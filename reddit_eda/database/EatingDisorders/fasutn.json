Growing up I had s lot of mental health issues, but food and body size was never an issue. \n\nAt 18, I was in a toxic home environment, and I didnt notice but I began to eat less. I was just being healthy, or so i thought. A coworker was encouraging me, even introducing me to laxatives. \n\nIt quickly spiraled, I'm not sure how it \"clicked\" but suddenly it was about counting calories, jogging in my room. I felt guilty for eating, like I was doing something wrong. \n\nI move away to university, where everything went downhill. I was so stressed, so depressed, and my trauma was coming back to haunt me. I couldn't deal with anything. \n\nFor me, being small(er) makes me feel safer. I feel guilty for eating. I have extreme anxiety over food and feeling full. It's about the number, in a way, because if its bot lower every day it crushes me. But I never went down this path intending to lose weight to fix my body image. Although I look in the mirror and can point out that I \"can still stand to lose\" weight in certain areas (etc face, thigh, whatdver) I know I look gross to others. But when I eat, everythingcomes back and I get so worked up I cannot function in my life. Anorexia has \"helped\" me survive by reducing my life to nothing, each day the same routine, I'm so exhausted that every day is a struggle to just get through the day. \n\nI hope this helps in some way. I know a lot of people with Ed's have histories of trauma (esp people with bulimia). Its tough.",

I grew up being told I was fat, and I'd try to starve myself before doctors appointments so my doctor wouldn't agree with that sentiment. It became an eating disorder instead of just disordered eating when I was 14 and experienced my first heartbreak. I assumed it was because I was too fat to be with someone like him, and I spiraled. About a year later, we made up, and he started helping me recover.\nIt was quiet for a while, though I've always struggled with severe anxiety over my body, and extremely low self-esteem. Last July it flared again, and I ended up losing almost 30 pounds in six months, 20 of those in one month. Officially I was diagnosed with anorexia sub-type 2 last November, though I went through a period of about 8 months where I gained 20 pounds back in an attempt to recover.\nHere's where it gets tricky tho: I have an insecure anxious attachment, which stems from being abandoned as a child. Because of this, I also struggle with codependency. There's no definite link, but people are beginning to study whether there's a connection between this attachment style and eating disorders. (personally, I'd love to study it). I was also abused by both of my moms husbands (ex and current), both who ragged on me for my body and my weight. It's trauma that has been resurfacing, and honestly the only thing that helps it go away is to starve, restrict, and smoke.",

      "body": "\nI think the biggest thing to keep in mind is that EDs are NOT ABOUT THE WEIGHT. People in fat bodies can have restrictive EDs, people in very thin bodies can have binge eating disorder. Body size and weight are a symptom. \n\nEating disorders are a coping mechanism. When the world is perceived as unsafe or a person\u2019s environment seems out of control, an eating disorder is a way to take control back and protect yourself from pain. You know what you don\u2019t feel as much when you\u2019re starving/purging/binging? Feelings. Feelings are scary, and frankly people in general aren\u2019t taught how to regulate emotions. Eating disorders are a maladaptive emotion regulation technique. \n\nAs far as restriction specifically, people who restrict tend to have messed up reward sensations. In people without EDs, hunger doesn\u2019t feel good. You don\u2019t like it, you know you need to eat. In people with restrictive disorders it tends to be the opposite- hunger feels amazing, it\u2019s like a high. Even 2 years into full recovery I still like how it feels, and I forget to eat because hunger doesn\u2019t feel bad to me and I will often not realize how hungry I am until someone mentions food. \n\nI don\u2019t want to speak as much for bulimia or BED because binging was never a symptom for me (though people assume it is because I\u2019m in a large body, please never assume a patient has one type of ED or symptom because of their size. A dietitian in treatment did that to me, it\u2019s incredibly triggering) but I know all ED symptoms stem from the same general goal- to cope with something you don\u2019t otherwise know how to cope with. \n\nI also want to say there are certain things you should never say. \u201cI wish I had your willpower/that problem\u201d (had a psychiatrist say that to me back in the day when I was thin), \u201cwhy can\u2019t you just eat\u201d/\u201cwhy can\u2019t you just stop\u201d, \u201cyou don\u2019t look like you have an eating disorder\u201d, things like that will never be helpful. Validation and empathy go so much further than judgment or anger ever will. \n\nIn the end, remember that people with eating disorders aren\u2019t happy people. Like substance addiction, you don\u2019t tend to reach for this maladaptive coping mechanism that causes numbness if you\u2019re doing well and feeling good. You aren\u2019t in control of your life when you have an ED, no matter how much you think you are. It controls you, it controls your thoughts, it helps you block out the bad stuff (and the good stuff- my therapist made the point recently that you don\u2019t get to turn off certain emotions like a drink tap. Numb out and you\u2019re numbing them ALL out). \n\nEating disorders have the highest mortality rate of all mental illness. Suicide rates are astronomical in people with EDs. These people you\u2019re working with aren\u2019t enjoying life and having fun, they\u2019re stuck in the bottom of a deep hole that they\u2019re desperately trying to claw their way out of. \n\nSorry this is so long! And sorry if it doesn\u2019t make sense, I\u2019ve been feeling off today but I\u2019m v passionate about awareness. NEDA has a lot of great resources about this stuff, too.",

I felt in control of myself when I was starving. I loved it when my bones started protruding out (even though it was painful) because they were signs of achievement. I was able to recognise that I was/am severely underweight but I would still fixate on the little bits of fat left.",

For me, I have something called body dysmorphia (give it a Google) but basically it's like looking at yourself in a series of fun house mirrors. I honestly don't know what I actually look like. It's societal pressures mixed with faulty wiring. The ED is a coping mechanism that we've created to deal with stress. I know I've been through abuse and bullying and life changing health circumstances and sexual assault etc... And my window of tolerance for stress was extremely low before I went to residential treatment. While everyone's journey and circumstances are unique, through the people I've met in my journey, there are so many similarities. When it comes to helping people in the ward, just be open to asking questions.",

They'll be your biggest challenge,  as well as extremely sick people that can't think correctly and are completely consumed by the disorder. The rest will be struggling but just want to end the pain and still have some hope to get the help they need,  although every day will be a challenge for everyone. It's a meal and a snack at a time thing.  \n\nFor me,  I've been anorexic, bulimic,  and an less intense disordered eater my whole life.  \n\nI've had a 6 yr period of stabilization,  but that was mainly due to a lack of stress from working fulltime since I'm on disability for my EDs, and chronic depression to make me not care.\n\nWell,  I just got back to my old ED clinic since I'm living alone and I was worried that would trigger me. It didn't really until they wanted to treat the depression,  so they put me on a new drug. \n\nI'm feeling strong emotions probably for the first time in my life or one of the only periods of time,  and I'm super struggling to deal with it. \n\nRight now it's not about weight or body image (which I have never nor will I ever be ok with,  but I have fully accepted that and don't really notice anymore). It's about numbing out those feelings I don't know how to handle despite all my many treatments. \n\nI was probably pretty numb throughout all my previous treatments which explains why I am falling back into the only thing I know to make myself feel better.\n\nStress and anxiety usually causes bulimic symptoms for me,  but right now I'm extremely restricting to get that high it brings and distract me from my new emotions (both good and bad. I feel naked with such strong reactions,  such as crying and I'm not used to it.) When you're hungry and empty it's hard to feel much else,  and you feel powerful and strong unlike how I was feeling out of control. \n\nSee, I know all these things. I'm 41 and have been in more treatments than I can count,  but I still don't seem to have the ability to care suddenly,  which makes me someone with a predisposition to an eating disorder. I will struggle for the rest of my life. There is never any \"recovered\" state,  at least not for me.  I'm hard- wired for this.  I'll try to keep fighting,  and I'm not someone that would ever give up and not ask for help. But I can't help myself alone either. \n\nI'm going to try to stay out of treatment this time,  but with this new situation,  who knows if outpatient will be enough. I hope I'm strong enough to cut this shit out, my older body won't handle it well. \n\nBut honestly,  once that weight starts coming off (I've been at an overweight/ medically obese \"set point\" which hasn't changed for years) I'll be excited to lose weight and get to normal weights again,  and that's extremely addictive and then I'll start to lose control and care more about the body image of it. \n\nSo you can see it's extremely complicated,  and doesn't really make sense to anyone including ourselves. So expect behaviors and attitudes that differ wildly between different patients and different moments. It won't be boring,  I'll tell you that,  we're all extremely dramatic once we get that sick.",

I was just being healthy, or so i thought. A coworker was encouraging me, even introducing me to laxatives. \n\nIt quickly spiraled, I'm not sure how it \"clicked\" but suddenly it was about counting calories, jogging in my room. I felt guilty for eating, like I was doing something wrong. \n\nI move away to university, where everything went downhill. I was so stressed, so depressed, and my trauma was coming back to haunt me. I couldn't deal with anything. \n\nFor me, being small(er) makes me feel safer. I feel guilty for eating. I have extreme anxiety over food and feeling full. It's about the number, in a way, because if its bot lower every day it crushes me. But I never went down this path intending to lose weight to fix my body image. Although I look in the mirror and can point out that I \"can still stand to lose\" weight in certain areas (etc face, thigh, whatdver) I know I look gross to others. But when I eat, everythingcomes back and I get so worked up I cannot function in my life. Anorexia has \"helped\" me survive by reducing my life to nothing, each day the same routine, I'm so exhausted that every day is a struggle to just get through the day. \n\nI hope this helps in some way.
