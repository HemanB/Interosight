  "title": "Request: What can I tell my girlfriend when she\u2019s going through rough days?",
  "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI\u2019ve been with my girlfriend for 8 months now and we love each other very much, but early on into talking she made it clear that he\u2019s has mental issues and has fought with her ED for over a couple years now. She went through a massive weight change since over a year ago and has lost a lot of pounds but i\u2019d rather not mention anything because I don\u2019t want it to be triggering to anyone here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe was obsessed with working out, counting calories, and losing weight in an unhealthy way and some days today can be worse than others. Sometimes she just doesn\u2019t want to eat at all, some she worries about the repercussions, some days she seems fine and will enjoy her meals with me when we go out but i\u2019m assuming those thoughts are still in her head. I just don\u2019t want to push her into doing anything she doesn\u2019t and thankfully she\u2019s very comfortable with telling me about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt times, she\u2019ll have bad days. A few days at a time where the voice is constantly in her head. She\u2019s more than a body and she\u2019s beautiful inside and out no matter what as i keep reminding her, and I know she knows that her body isn\u2019t different to what she may be thinking in the moment, or that i would judge her which i\u2019d never. I just want to know if there are any other things I could tell her at times when it\u2019s bad or randomly to make her feel better. I try my best to console her and it works a lot of the time but I just want whats best. Thank you guys for everything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: What can I tell my girlfriend when she\u2019s going through rough days and and struggling with her ED to console her? How do i make her feel better about herself sometimes, and can I?",

I hope I\u2019ve helped, i know it\u2019s really hard, I nearly caused my relationship to end. I really hope you two don\u2019t end up in a circle of focusing on food all the time like we did.

Because not everyone think about it and end up saying something triggering.\n\nSo onto the advices :\n-At all cost, and I mean AT ALL COST, refrain from giving her appearance related compliments. I know you mean we'll but when in recovery or simply on a bad day everything can be overturned by the Ed. \"You look beautiful\" May be translated as \"You look beautiful Now, but if you put on weight you wouldn't be anymore.\" it could even induce a relapse and a wish to loose weight again.\n-Ask her what she needs/wants\n-Let her vent, if she wants to anyways, stay open minded and listen to what she says, comfort her. This can make a huge difference\n-No food rated comments either (and this on a daily basis), because once again you may mean well but it has the opposite effect. \"You eat well\" or \"You're eating mroe that is good\" can be triggering comments.\n\nThat is all I cna think about :) And once again Bravo, you are an amazing boyfriend/girlfriend. I know dealing with an Ed is hard for people around Ed sufferers but I promise it can get better. One day it will be fine :) I hope the best for the two of you and have a lovely day!",

      "body": "Hey, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re looking for advice from a community that has experienced it firsthand. What has personally helped me the most is my bf making it clear that he was not judging me for any of it. No matter how worried you are for her health, never try to be controlling about her issues (\u00ab\u00a0you shouldn\u2019t do this, you know it\u2019s not good for you\u00a0\u00bb etc.) Make sure she knows you\u2019re on her side, this means asking \u00ab\u00a0could you tell me how I can help you?\u00a0\u00bb. Validate her struggle, by telling her you understand why she would cope this way and that you love her no matter what, and that you\u2019re willing to do what\u2019s necessary to support her. Like I said, the most important is to make it clear you don\u2019t judge her, no matter how mentally unhealthy she gets; shame is one of the biggest factors in an ED, so being loving to her while she feels the worst about herself can be very healing. \n\nReassure her when it gets bad that everything is temporary, and that many people who have suffered from the same problems have recovered, even after years of struggle. And that you will be holding her hand the whole time. Of course, only say those things if you mean it, because if you know you can\u2019t handle it (which is totally understandable, it\u2019s normal) then don\u2019t commit like that. So if you do choose to commit, know that it won\u2019t always be pretty and you have to learn how to be self nurturing. Also what you could do is research about her ED with her, it\u2019ll show her you\u2019re truly invested and have the best intentions towards her.\nHope this helps, wish you the best of luck, again thank you for taking her seriously.",

      "body": "For me, it is so comforting to know my BF loves me no matter my weight fluctuations. He\u2019s def seen me as heavier and smaller and loves me just as hard. \n\nI\u2019d be careful about commenting on her eating cause it can be triggering. This really depends on the person tho. For me, I feel very self conscious to receive praise about eating or any comment about the amount I\u2019m eating. \n\nGet her her safe foods. She feel loved and understood. \n\nI think the best time to talk about eating disorder help is when I\u2019m at rock bottom (sitting next to a toilet/purging), experiencing chest pains, ammenhorea, or just not around food. I feel desperate to get better when I\u2019m at rock bottom but seldomly when I\u2019m seeing weight loss.  \n\nI recommend expressing how scared it makes you feel to lose her but please don\u2019t get her ultimatums to recover. EDs are an addiction/mental illness. We need support to get better.  Support her, not her illness. Ask her what you can do, what triggers her, what you can do to help her feel safe/loved. \n\nAlso, PLEASE don\u2019t make it about weight. EDs aren\u2019t just about being skinny. It\u2019s about control a lot of the time and coping. I\u2019d steer convos away from weight =/not = worth cause that\u2019s triggering. Nobody wants to be told they\u2019re just doing this to be skinny or for other people. This isn\u2019t that simple.",

      "body": "Sometimes it's more about the actions than the words.  For me, I've dealt with ED for many years and have lost a significand amount of weight in the last 2.  I'm finally at a healthy weight and struggling with body image issues.  My boyfriend doesn't always know the right things to say and he struggles with how to approach me about food.  BUT...he always knows how to touch.  He touches my stomach with its extra skin and folds, he caresses my flappy arms, he massages my wrinkly thighs.  There are so many things about me that are unattractive due to the effects of my ED and weight loss but he doesn't \"see\" all that.  He touches me and loves me in spite of all that.  So, my point here, is to touch her body\\* and reassure her with physical affection (all kinds - intimate, playful, casual) that you love her.  The more normalized you can make touch feel for her, the better she will feel about herself.\n\n\\*This should obviously be done with her consent, of course.",

      "body": "I think that a huge part of it is to help yourself learn how to adapt your language. Focus on learning how to speak about others in reference to who they are as a person, and not about their appearance. You can set the tone by not making bodies a topic of conversation, even about your own or the bodies of strangers. Talk about people as though their value isn\u2019t attached to their body/appearance. You would be *shocked* how much of a difference it makes to be away from the toxicity of what is considered \u2018normal\u2019 to say about ourselves and other. \n\nIf you happen to feel very motivated to compliment somebodies appearance, go for something they had control/a choice over. Tell them you like their sweet new shoes/jacket/earrings/tattoo. Tell them their hair looks really cool the way they styled it that day. Tell them you love their style. \n\nWhen you are close with your girlfriend, you can compliment her smell, tell her you love the feeling of her skin against yours, that you love the way it feels to have your arms wrapped around her, the way it feels to have her hands against your skin. To heal, we need *new* experiences to connect with so we can lessen the connection with our old, unhealthy beliefs. Giving her language that drives home how it can feel to enjoy being present in your body and connecting with someone you trust who values you. \n\nFor me, having people try to \u2018convince\u2019 me that my body is fine, and they think I am beautiful, does absolutely nothing. Healing for me came from being physically close with people who genuinely believed in the value of my physical presence and the experience of my body in a way that was connected to intimacy, not beauty standards. \n\nTldr- I think everyone should stop trying to convince their girlfriend she is hot. Instead, work to change the culture of bodies.  We don\u2019t need people to think we are beautiful. We need people to love and value who we really are, which is human.",

Focus on learning how to speak about others in reference to who they are as a person, and not about their appearance. You can set the tone by not making bodies a topic of conversation, even about your own or the bodies of strangers. Talk about people as though their value isn\u2019t attached to their body/appearance. You would be *shocked* how much of a difference it makes to be away from the toxicity of what is considered \u2018normal\u2019 to say about ourselves and other. \n\nIf you happen to feel very motivated to compliment somebodies appearance, go for something they had control/a choice over. Tell them you like their sweet new shoes/jacket/earrings/tattoo. Tell them their hair looks really cool the way they styled it that day. Tell them you love their style. \n\nWhen you are close with your girlfriend, you can compliment her smell, tell her you love the feeling of her skin against yours, that you love the way it feels to have your arms wrapped around her, the way it feels to have her hands against your skin. To heal, we need *new* experiences to connect with so we can lessen the connection with our old, unhealthy beliefs. Giving her language that drives home how it can feel to enjoy being present in your body and connecting with someone you trust who values you. \n\nFor me, having people try to \u2018convince\u2019 me that my body is fine, and they think I am beautiful, does absolutely nothing. Healing for me came from being physically close with people who genuinely believed in the value of my physical presence and the experience of my body in a way that was connected to intimacy, not beauty standards. \n\nTldr- I think everyone should stop trying to convince their girlfriend she is hot. Instead, work to change the culture of bodies.  We don\u2019t need people to think we are beautiful. We need people to love and value who we really are, which is human.",

I would say keep going with telling her that her body doesn\u2019t determine her worth, which usually is the recurring idea when someone has an eating disorder. Keep telling her that it\u2019s okay to gain weight and that it doesn\u2019t reflect on her as a person. Don\u2019t focus too much on her looks but more of her worth, and don\u2019t ever mention things like \u201cyou\u2019ve gotten thinner\u201d OR \u201cyou\u2019ve gotten bigger\u201d. Remove the stigma and anticipation of food, make it not a big deal  and don\u2019t force her. Just be casual about it, teach her subtly that food is not a big deal and is to be enjoyed without worry. \n\nAgain, you seem like a really sweet person. Best of luck!",

Because not everyone think about it and end up saying something triggering.\n\nSo onto the advices :\n-At all cost, and I mean AT ALL COST, refrain from giving her appearance related compliments. I know you mean we'll but when in recovery or simply on a bad day everything can be overturned by the Ed. \"You look beautiful\" May be translated as \"You look beautiful Now, but if you put on weight you wouldn't be anymore.\" it could even induce a relapse and a wish to loose weight again.\n-Ask her what she needs/wants\n-Let her vent, if she wants to anyways, stay open minded and listen to what she says, comfort her. This can make a huge difference\n-No food rated comments either (and this on a daily basis), because once again you may mean well but it has the opposite effect. \"You eat well\" or \"You're eating mroe that is good\" can be triggering comments.\n\nThat is all I cna think about :) And once again Bravo, you are an amazing boyfriend/girlfriend. I know dealing with an Ed is hard for people around Ed sufferers but I promise it can get better. One day it will be fine :) I hope the best for the two of you and have a lovely day!",

Not talking about her looks or calling her beautiful is something I haven\u2019t thought about as being triggering so thank you for the advice. Do you think there\u2019s anything I could say as an alternative? Sort of like saying she\u2019s always beautiful to me and that there\u2019s no judgement at all? I just want to make sure I can compliment her the right way without it being triggering. Once again thank you for your kind words :)",

He\u2019s def seen me as heavier and smaller and loves me just as hard. \n\nI\u2019d be careful about commenting on her eating cause it can be triggering. This really depends on the person tho. For me, I feel very self conscious to receive praise about eating or any comment about the amount I\u2019m eating. \n\nGet her her safe foods. She feel loved and understood. \n\nI think the best time to talk about eating disorder help is when I\u2019m at rock bottom (sitting next to a toilet/purging), experiencing chest pains, ammenhorea, or just not around food. I feel desperate to get better when I\u2019m at rock bottom but seldomly when I\u2019m seeing weight loss.  \n\nI recommend expressing how scared it makes you feel to lose her but please don\u2019t get her ultimatums to recover. EDs are an addiction/mental illness. We need support to get better.  Support her, not her illness. Ask her what you can do, what triggers her, what you can do to help her feel safe/loved. \n\nAlso, PLEASE don\u2019t make it about weight. EDs aren\u2019t just about being skinny. It\u2019s about control a lot of the time and coping. I\u2019d steer convos away from weight =/not = worth cause that\u2019s triggering. Nobody wants to be told they\u2019re just doing this to be skinny or for other people. This isn\u2019t that simple.",
