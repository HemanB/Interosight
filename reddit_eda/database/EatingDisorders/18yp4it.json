  "selftext": "I just wanted to give a heartfelt message to all of you - after watching and being in this community for a little while.  \nI am SO grateful to be sitting in this place of peace and ease and understanding with my food and my body. After 17 years of eating disorders, disordered eating, yo yo dieting, weight instability, falling off diets, binging daily, TERRIBLE body image....  \nI didn't think I could win the war with my body. I didn't think I'd be able to look in the mirror and think \"we got this baby, we're on the same team\". I NEVER thought I'd be able to feel good about everything I ate. I never thought I'd be able to let go of all the control and the strictness - and still have a body that I'm happy with. I didn't think I could get here but I did.  \nA lot of people ask me how and if I could fit it into this tiny text box I would. But 18 months of recovery is so scattered, back and forth, unpredictable...  \nI can say that my main focuses were:  \n\\- nutrition (eating what I needed to repair my metabolism, not make hunger a factor when using coping mechanisms, learning what was \"normal\" for me)  \n\\- my relationship with myself  \n\\- alternative coping mechanisms (this was for EVERYTHING; anxiety, boredom, excitement, etc.)  \n\\- changing my WHY and my empowerment behind my own decisions  \nI didn't think I deserved it, but I do. And I really just want to remind you that you deserve that too.  \nAt the risk of sounding old - life is WAY too damn short to be at war with yourself. To try to hate yourself into change. To not go on that healing journey so you can EXPERIENCE life.  \nWe can walk through this journey together + I'm so open to anyone who wants to talk about this journey",

And I felt like that was it, that was as far as I was going to be able to go.  I was going to have to live with it the rest of my life.  But recovery (like every journey) has many legs and directions.  And when I decided I didn't want to settle for that being my life, I pivoted and went down a different recovery path to find FULL recovery.  \n\n\nYou don't have to settle with a life you're unhappy with.  Ever.  But sometimes you're gonna have to completely change direction to get the rest of the way there.",
