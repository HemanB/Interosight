  "selftext": "I\u2019ve been on a journey recovering from an eating disorder. It\u2019s been crazy, hiding it from my parents and pretending like I\u2019m recovering, especially after relapsing a gazillion times. Anyways, I ate two huge burgers on consecutive days. Yes, I ate one yesterday and one today. I don\u2019t know how to feel about it, but I did it. I\u2019m usually the person who binge eats one day and then skips meals for three consecutive days, and so on ( the cycle continues ). Recently tho, I just unconsciously started eating and enjoying my meals. It\u2019s been three weeks since calories or weighing scales have been integrated into my routine checks. Am i proud? I\u2019m not sure. But I did it, somehow. \n\u2022\nPs: if I, a weak-willed individual and a fucking coward, can do something like this, you for sure can. SO don\u2019t give up. You\u2019ve got this!!",
