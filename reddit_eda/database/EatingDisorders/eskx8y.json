  "title": "Request: New doctor thinks I have Anorexia but I don't think I do",
  "selftext": "I'm a 23 year old guy and my new doctor seems to think that I have anorexia but I don't think I do. I just don't think it fits, and to be honest I don't want that stigma attached to me. \n\nI'm 5'11 and quite underweight for my height. \nMy previous doctor never mentioned anything about any kind of eating disorder. He just told me to eat more and didn't make a big deal out of my weight loss. I went to this new doctor because I was worried about hair loss and feeling tired and dizzy all the time. I'm aware my weight may have something to do with that but I thought it might be something else as well because I'm not that underweight and it started getting worse recently.\n\nI admit I have issues with my body image, however I never intentionally starved myself to become underweight and I don't even want to be skinny, it just happened.\n\nAbout a year ago I was obese, I started a diet and got very obsessed with it and ended up underweight. I am very happy with my weight loss and I look a lot better now, but I would like to be more muscular. I have been underweight for several months now and I'm used to it and afraid of eating more.\n\nI am very careful and controlled with what I eat and I calorie count, however I do NOT starve myself. I eat a healthy vegan diet, just enough to maintain my weight. While I was losing the weight, I ate very little. I have no desire to become thinner now, but I am very afraid of gaining the weight back, which is why I became underweight and why I haven't made any genuine effort to start gaining again. \n\nThe one thing that the doctor really latched on to was the fact that i take appetite suppressants, I only take them because I took them throughout my weight loss, and I know binging often follows restriction and I don't want to binge and gain all the weight back. \n\nIs this anorexia?",

I find it disappointing that mental health issues are seen this way in our society, but maybe you can agree with me that this should change. There\u2019s no reason why eating disorders should be shameful or stigmatized, and reversing that stigma starts with the individuals who are affected.\n\nYour life is very clearly being negatively impacted by anorexia, but I\u2019ve struggled with the same issues of acceptance that you have and I know what it\u2019s like to be in disbelief at a diagnosis. I never starved myself completely, or went days without eating the way I thought \u201creal\u201d anorexics did. However your body needs a lot of calories. For me (a 5\u20193 teenage girl), my daily caloric needs are like 2500, but for you they\u2019d probably be close to 3000. This means that eating around 1000-1500 can be considered severe undereating for you, which is equivalent to starving yourself in terms of health risks. You said that you\u2019re underweight, you\u2019re eating a low amount, and you\u2019re scared to eat more, and these are very clear diagnostic criteria for anorexia, so I think your doctor is right. \n\nI urge you to reverse your thinking and accept the diagnosis and suggestions your doctor has given you. It might be helpful for you to find a nutritionist you could meet with who has experience with eating disorders. They can help you develop a meal plan that will prevent the developing of binge eating while returning you to normal eating habits. Reaching out can be scary, but the end result is so worth it.

I know labels suck and you don\u2019t want to be told something is wrong, and yet you also seem concerned about your current physical state. You are taking appetite suppressants not to lose weight, but in fear your eating will increase if you don\u2019t? You say you eat enough to maintain your weight, yet you also say you\u2019ve lost weight unintentionally? If you are having hair loss I\u2019m going out on a limb to guess you also are having fatigue and maybe some skin issues? Joint pain? And again, just guessing... but you probably want these physical problems to go away... as long as you don\u2019t have to eat more or gain any weight? Trust me I was mad at everyone for telling me \u201cto just eat more\u201d because that was frankly just the tip of the iceberg of the hell I was going through.

Probably, you will just reach healthy weight, your situation with dizziness and tiredness will improve a bit, your hair will start growing back.\n\nSecond, if you want to be muscular, you need to workout and eat at a surplus, otherwise you'll see little to no progress.\n\nI understand your concern about the symptoms, and I know that sometimes doctors tend to blame all the problems on the weight of the patient, but you do have an issue. Even if your symptoms are not related to your weight (which I doubt), it's better to not make it worse by ignoring it.\n\nTry to gradually improve your diet and ditch appetite suppressants and then see if your conditions will improve.\n\n>I don't want that stigma attached to me\n\nYou don't need to tell that you are/were anorexic (besides the doctors, of course). No one should stick their noses into your life without your approval. No one should blame you for your illness. Would you blame someone with a cold?\n\nTry to reach psychologist/psychiatrist with your concerns. Don't be afraid of the stigma. I know, I was, and I regret it now because I could feel so much better and not be miserable for so long.

You're experiencing hair loss, feeling tired and dizzy and yet you don't want to change you're current eating structure. That's concerning.
