  "title": "I feel \"dirty\" without anorexia",
  "selftext": "Hi everyone. I went through a period of anorexia, but afterward, I developed binge eating and bulimia and ended up gaining weight. Now, I feel out of control, sort of 'messy' and 'dirty,' like something is always wrong. When I had anorexia, I would restrict my food and exercise compulsively, and it made me feel 'clean,' focused, in control. I\u2019m trying to recover from the BED, but this feeling keeps pulling me back toward anorexia, like it's the only way to feel good about myself again. Has anyone else felt this way after a shift in their eating disorder? How did you deal with not feeling 'good enough' or 'focused' without anorexia?",

If I am starving, I am clean, pure, and my whole mindest just changes its bizzare. \n\nWhat mostly causes this for me is binging, if I choose to eat healthy food I won\u2019t feel dirty afterwards, even if its a larger meal I don\u2019t mind if it was truly consistent and healthy. But bouncing from anorexia to binging is something im currently dealing with so\nnot sure how to help with this feeling of \u2018dirty\u2019 :( \n\nAtm I exercise more or less compulsively and restrict and then binge. And to be honest, at this point I feel like the most doable solution would be to just find a balance between restricting and binging, part it in weeks/days and so on.",

      "body": "I think at a fundamental level, it's connected to come combination of shame, sexuality and control.\n\nI feel that a lot of women in particular start having eating problems when they start puberty. I was always told I would be loved if I didn't need or want things, if I wasn't sexual and I was in control of myself. So, lo and behold puberty happened, my mother freaked out an put me on a starvation diet. I realized my mom praised me so long as I kept losing weight - until I became dangerously underweight.\n\nBeing skinny and unwomanly meant men couldn't objectify me, my body could survive with very little, and I alternately earned praise from my mother for losing weight or alternately could control her with threats of starving myself to death.\n\nBut it's actually a trap. It makes your normal, human body into a prison. Because in an effort to stay \"small\", you lose out on strength, contentment and pleasure in your own body.",
