  "title": "Request: Roommate is triggering",
  "selftext": "I haven't been officially diagnosed with an ED but my eating habits have certainly worsened exponentially over the past year. I've lost significant weight and have a lot of anxiety around eating in general. My roommate, who I moved in with around February, is very thin and makes a lot of comments comparing our bodies. I am not that much larger than her (we share clothes) but she will jokingly say things like \"your thighs fill out those pants more than mine\" or \"you're tiny but not anorexic skinny like me.\" I'm sure she struggles with disordered eating habits too - she constantly asks what I've eaten for the day and then shares what little amount she has eaten. I find myself overwhelmed and even more food-averse now. How should I handle this situation?",

I would say to try & change the subject when she mentions these things, tell her you are not interested in comparing yourselves and leave it at that. If she can't take the hint then maybe it's time to find a new roommate.",

She deals with more depression than I do (I\u2019m just anxiety prone) and she recently became obsessive with meal prepping and weighing out every portion of everything she eats.  She now spends her waking hours only working and then at the gym when she\u2019s not sleeping.  We are both very active but I\u2019ve seen her drop a lot of weight in the past couple months.  She is visibly upset with me about not congratulating her on being more thin than usual but it\u2019s really hard to be happy for someone expressing such obsessive unhealthy behavior, and not to mention how triggering it is for me. Makes my anxiety go crazy. And I can feel judgment from her because I\u2019m not getting as skinny as her lately, it\u2019s sounds really pathetic and strange but I can just tell. \nSorry for the word vomit, I don\u2019t really relate to many of my friends about these things",
