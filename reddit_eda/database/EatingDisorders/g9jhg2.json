  "title": "Request: How do I stop having \"cheat days\"?",
  "selftext": "I've been calorie counting well for about 1.5 years now until I got inspired by fitness YouTube videos to have \"cheat days\" - absolute WORST idea of my life.\n\nNow, every Saturday is essentially a controlled binge. I would gain kilos, and spend the rest of the week eating EXTREMELY restrictively (sometimes fasting for days) to get rid of this weight, only to do it all again.\n\nI told myself this was fine because people on YouTube did it, and only found the courage recently to admit I had developed some form of an eating disorder.\n\nI've been trying to stop it, but it's difficult to dissociate the feeling of euphoria and freedom with cheat days. The other 6 days of the week I feel depressed, moody, and extremely fatigued. Has anyone experienced this, and how did you overcome it?",

But she explains so well about set points and metabolism etc so you can understand why its not scary and why youre not going to gain 600lbs overnight! Feel free to message me if you want to talk about this more! Xx",

I\u2019ve found when I go through phases of restricting and not losing any weight this helps bring my body back to normal and then I start losing weight again. It also stops you thinking you have to eat every \u201cbad\u201d food in less than a day because you have to be super strict the following days. This way you space it out, and can still lose weight in a healthy manner.",

For me creating a healthy relationship with food was one part of it, finding foods that fueled my body and helped balance my hormones and energy levels. Another part was to face my emotions and work through them rather than eat them away. Have you thought of working with someone to help guide you through everything?",

The most helpful thing you can do is eat regularly and often, and properly for optimal nutrition. \n\nSeeing an RD - even \"Virtually\"/online - will help you so much. S/he can give you advice as to what is truly appropriate for your activity level and needs.\n\nThen - stick to the plan. Whether you do 3 squares or 6 mini's, or any other iteration - don't deprive yourself any more. This will ruin the high of a \"cheat\" day idea, even if it takes some trial/error.\n\nYour body has a natural set point that it loves to be, and wherever that is, it will become easy to maintain and stay healthy there. That does NOT mean \"overweight\" by any stretch. Bloating and temporary swelling is normal while re-feeding, but that will definitely end.  Stay strong!",

I also count calories and try not to cut more than a couple hundred (max 400) a day - it's slower, but the food cravings are less intense. I'll also find foods I can eat in large quantities without gaining weight to satisfy the craving to be full or eat for a long time. For example, very large salads with low calorie dressing and broccoli with sriracha are two of my binge-replacement foods/meals.",

      "body": "Omgggg I can not stress how much I hate the \u201ccheat day\u201d concept!!!! Its SO unhealthy!!!\nI think the first step that you should take is stop the black and white thinking. There are no such thing as bad foods. Food is food. Some are just more nutritional then others but that\u2019s pretty much it. \n\nI had a BED myself and what really helped me is the book \u201cOvercoming Binge Eating\u201d by dr. Christopher G Fairburn and \u201cPotatoes not Prozac\u201d by Kathleen Desmaisons. \n\nThe book overcoming binge eating is one that my therapist uses in her practice. Its a book that explains everything about binge eating disorders and it really helps you to understand your thoughts better. With all the information it gives it contains a 5 or 6 (can\u2019t remember) step plan that will make you stop binge eating.\nThe steps are to start journaling, write down how the time you eat, what you eat, how you feel eating it and where you are eating it. This allows you to see patterns as in why you are binge eating and what triggers you to do it. You will start to notice that some foods, places, thoughts or events trigger a binge. \nThe other step in the book is eating every 2 hours, i know its hard to be eating that much out of no where but it will really help to go your false hunger go away.  Later in the book they will teach you how to stop being afraid of gaining weight, why you\u2019re not gaining weight during this process and how to stop looking at yourself in such negative ways and how to stop \u201cbody checking\u201d and they will teach you how to start adding in you \u201cfear\u201d foods again. And last but not least, ones you learned how to feel an upcoming binge, you can start doing other things to replace your binge so the thoughts will go away, such as calling a friend, working out, watch a movie, pick up any activity that you LIKE doing instead of binging. \n\nIts a bit much to explain but I would defenitly recommend it! Potatoes and Prozac is more a about why your body CAN be addictive to sugar. I think if your considering doing this plan it\u2019s best to cut out sugar for a while. When I stopped adding in sugar + eating regularly the bingeing stopped immedenitly. With \u201cno sugar\u201d I don\u2019t mean it in a restrictive way. For me sugar was just a big trigger and I\u2019d rather have lets say a pizza or some chips in my eating.\n\nWith that said, I would also recommend you to go to a therapist so they can help you with your journaling, reflecting and with this plan in general. Eating disorders are hard to overcome by yourself. I told this myself for 4 months until at some point I just gave up, I couldn\u2019t do it. Now I\u2019m at a therapist and I\u2019ve made huge steps! I started with being diagnosed with anorexia, with later lead me on to having a binge eating disorder (some would call it extreme hunger), and now its safe to say that I\u2019m no where near where I was! I still struggle with the black and white thinking sometimes but i barely binge anymore and I\u2019m happy with what I eat.\n\nIf you have any questions or just wanna talk, you\u2019re not alone and you can always message me if you like :) \n\nGoodluck! I\u2019m 100% sure you will overcome this \ud83d\udc9e",
