  "title": "Overheard two non disordered people talking about food and my god that was eye opening",
  "selftext": "I was in Walmart cutting through the cookie/snack aisle, and I walked past these two gorgeous girls in their 20s and one of them flipped over some sort of packaged cookie thing and said >!oh my god and it only has 320 calories!< and it's like I snapped into legitimate reality because I was like god damn, they're so freaking free. That's what a normal person thinks. They don't really care about items having two digit cal counts. Idk why but that was so motivating and made me so happy. two super pretty friends just hanging out and grabbing ~snacks~. I don't know, the fact that if I saw anything with more than xxx cals I'd be like nope. But knowing that it literally doesn't matter and it could have xxxx cals and nothing would change is so relieving. Memories and friendships are so much more important than obsessions with numbers. Fuck ocd and fuck anorexia.",

I\u2019m super restrictive with my diet 90% of the time and then end up binging the other 10%. I just can\u2019t find a happy medium. I\u2019ve been tracking my weight and daily calorie intake every single day for the last 15+ years. It\u2019s like an obsession.\n\nI see people who can just eat something they\u2019re craving when they\u2019re hungry and stop eating when they\u2019re full and I\u2019m like amazed. How do they do it? \nThey must feel so free and unfettered. Eating is such a basic human need, it\u2019s amazing that we can make it such a burden on ourselves.",
