Eventually she just laid it all out and told me about her Ed. This allowed us to move forward. It has not been easy. I love her and stick by her but I really needed her to take getting better seriously. She's come a long way since she told me. I m caring when I need to but also have to tough love sometimes. Your S0 is going to have to make a choice because being with someone with a serious ED is not easy. Your SO if they decide to stick it out will make mistakes like I have trying to figure it out. You probably will too. Just remember you love eachother and do your best.",

It\u2018s hard, and it can be scary due to a fear of being misunderstood. Personally for me, I developed an eating disorder around the age of 13. I was fearful to open up. I was sent to a residential treatment center, and I found that family therapy helped immensely. In your case, having couples counseling, or having a therapist that specializes in eating disorders that involves your boyfriend in sessions could be a great option. At the beginning, my parents also were wondering why I couldn\u2019t just eat, but after this experience they were even researching online, and started having meal times with me as exposures. It was amazing, and I felt loved. Are you currently seeing a counselor? As for your eating disorder, know that there is hope. I know the fears, the lies, the pain, but now I know the freedom, the hope, the love, and the truth! There is a better way to live. God is always working in my life. Rooting for you!",

      "body": "I\u2019ve had success explaining it like an addiction. When someone eats, you get a blood sugar spike. When someone eats when they\u2019re hungry, this spike comes with your brain feeling happy and relieved at not dying. We\u2019ve gotten addicted to that euphoria of a blood sugar spike after restriction. Eventually your tolerance builds and just eating a sandwich doesn\u2019t give you the same feeling of relief, so you have to eat more all at once to get the same effect (binging). \n\nOften, addiction therapists will see people with EDs because the patterns are so similar. It was a little easier to explain to someone in those terms: I\u2019m addicted to the binge-restrict cycle, and rehab is extra hard because I have to confront that fear everyday at least 3 times. \n\nI\u2019ve told my past 4 partners about my ED. My current partner is a total gem, but one ex started encouraging my eating disorder and trying to get one too to get closer to me. Another lied to see how much more he could get me to restrict. If your SO doesn\u2019t react in a pro-recovery way, that\u2019s not because you told them wrong. It\u2019s because they\u2019re not good for your mental health. I stayed with those two way too long and endured a lot of abuse. If they don\u2019t respond respectfully, that\u2019s worth more red flags than a communist parade.",

I can agree that two individuals, regardless of their shared lived experiences, can never truly \u201cknow\u201d how the other truly feels because individual experiences are felt individually, of course. In that sense, I could saw someone could never understand. However, it\u2019s possible for loved ones to be able to \u201cunderstand\u201d even though they have not experienced an eating disorder. I think being open to your loved ones, if you choose to be, is tough and you\u2019ll get some miscommunication of various severity and frequency. But it\u2019s still possible for people to understand and empathize and maybe even provide helpful support and advice from time to time.
