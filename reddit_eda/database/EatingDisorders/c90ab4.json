  "selftext": "My daughter is 14 and is struggling with body image issues. I recently learned that she will sometimes not eat for days, when she does finally eat it's a binge it seems. this has caused her to become sick enough to vomit. She is seeing a therapist but the therapist said today that if this continues she would need a therapist that specializes in ED. \n\nI have removed the scale from the bathroom and I'm trying to check in with her about how she's feeling and trying to make stuff she would want to eat. But I really don't know how to approach this.\n\nTomorrow is gonna be super hot but she said she wont go swimming, I guess cause she doesn't want people to se her in a swimsuit. She's so beautiful and is at a good weight for her height and age but no amount of reassurance is helping. Please help",

      "body": "An ED specialist therapist will be the only way for your daughter to recover. It\u2019s impossible for someone without the disorder/without training in the disorder to understand its mechanisms because it\u2019s a very illogical condition. The only things you can do outside of professional counselling are making sure your daughter knows that she can trust you and speak to you whenever she wants to. As an anorexic teenagers myself the most helpful thing my mum does for me is taking me to buy my own food from supermarkets. Your daughter is much more likely to eat if she can select her own safe foods and count the calories in shop bought food rather than eating home cooked meals. The disorder is all about control and, even though this isn\u2019t a sustainable system, giving her as much control over what she eats as possible might encourage her to eat at least some food, rather than nothing at all. Once the anorexic mind has been activated it\u2019s nearly impossible to combat it alone, so get her on to that ED specific therapist as soon as possible.",

I\u2019m sure it\u2019s hard to know what to do about such a touchy subject.  \n\nA specialist for ED will work much better than a general therapist. I think that seeing someone who can truly understand will be helpful. \n\nAs for what else you can do, let her know you\u2019re there for her always if she needs someone to talk to or needs help.  She needs to know she\u2019s not alone, even though she probably feels that way. Try to praise her on things unrelated to weight or beauty. It may get frustrating, but one thing to not do is place blame on her or the situation. \n\nJust love her through it and get some professional help for her. \n\nBest of luck! You are an amazing mom.",

      "body": "Ive had annorexia for over years with relapses on and off. I have real issues with how  treatment is done. This is my prefered way to do things.\n\n\nDont remove her control! It will freak her out and lead to more extreame behaviours to compensate.\n\n\nLet her weigh herself - but in the context of normal  fluctuations e.g. food weight,  constipation, dehydration etc. I always weigh the least on a Thursday for a reason. If she doesnt know if shes losing or gaining she may restruct extra to ensure a loss.\n\n\nLet her know how many calories are in food , even homemade food. It can be a relief to know. I would teach her about recipies and weighing food, but also that its not an exact science - and thats okay! Its okay not to know sometimes and its okay to go over your allowance sometimes. Make it as stress free as possible.\n\n\nTeach her about TDEE and NEAT.\n\n\nTeach her about body composition - how losing more weight wont get rid of the jiggle but building muscle will. And you need to fuel muscle growth with lots of protein. Show her the pictures on the internet comparing thecsize of muscle and fat that weigh the same. Explain how you can weigh more but be a smaller size with weight lifting. Its great exercise.  \n\n\nTeach her how fat, even animal fat is essential for homone function and skin integrity. Fat is better for intestinal transit than fibre.\n\n\nFasting is okay, its benefical. Let her fast as long as she refuels properly afterwards ( not binging on sweets and carbs) \n\n\nRestriction is an addiction. Treat it that way.\n\n\nAvoid keeping trigger foods in the house - sweets, bread etc.  Keto is a brilliant way to get rid of binge cravings. She might get a bit hypoglycemic. She should try one or two glucose tablets to ese the feelkng so she can then make better food choices and avoid binging. \n\n\nHypoglycemia was a huge binge trigger for me. Sweets and carbs just make it worse, by far. \n\n \n\nRemember : she is growing. Her prefrontal cortex is still growing its cover so her thoughts ate not as rational as an adult, plus she is swimming in hormones. Please stay calm with her, listen. Reassure her that you love and value her. Dont resort to emotional blackmail. \n\n\nShow her the reddit instagram reality. Its eye opening. \n\nThere is more i can say here.\n\nMistakes:\nRemoving the scale. Removes the control\n\n\nSneaking additional calories into food. She will never trust you again, never feel comfortable trusting the calorie counts of food as she wont get the results she expected \n\nDo not lie to her. Ever. If she is chubby or flabby , acknowledge it, in the context that she isxin control of her body and can change it if she wants to. Emphasis on fitness and fueling perfomance through healthy eating ( mot vegan imo). I really believe in the keto/ low carb carnivore way of eating\n\n\n\nDo not force her to eat. Maybe offer an alternative. This was a major cause of my annorexia. My parents tried to force me to eat - it became a battle of wills i was determined to win. And i did. The more they forced the less i ate - just to spite them. \n\n\nIf she wants to be a low healthy bmi, thats okay. 18 is fine. No lower, but dont try to force a bmi of 22 as she will over compensate any go lower than 18 next time.\n\nThis is eveything i wished id known at 15. Im 42 now and i have a handle on it , but i still get into binge restrict cycles if im not careful \n\n When i say binge  i mean normal eating for normalkinda unhealthy people - pizza and carbs and sweets.  Im very petite and cant eat like that regularly without gaining weight.  I can look like a regular bmi 22 person eating some of that,  but i prefer myself at a bmi 18 and fittibg my  smaller clothes. Its not worth it to me to eat that stuff. \n\nI was veggie for many years (16) and it ruined my body composition (even though i danced). I had terrible cellulite at a low weight as my skin fascia was damaged by all the sugar (process of glycation) which made me restrict more. Much more meat and collagen supplements havd fixed this for me and im focusing of fitness and muscle tone now. I really wish someone had told me all this years ago. \n\nMy heart goes out to you and your daughter.",

Let her know you know this is difficult and it's not about the food, it's about her emotional and physical health. Make sure she knows they're equally important.\n\nSet meal times but choose not scary food like vegetables, salads, protein and legumes etc. Ask her on walks and maybe over time she will open up to you.\n\nThe most important thing is to strike the balance between understanding and interfering - it will be the hardest thing you'll ever do but also the greatest display of unconditional love. Make her feel supported and loved and try to make her see that food is not the most important thing in the world. These are all things I know I would have appreciated.\n\nI wish both you and her the best of luck \ud83d\udc96",

Finding a therapist is like finding the perfect pair of jeans. Let her know that she is loved and you are there for her, often. Reassurance is so helpful. Constant reminders and seeing that someone is concerned for her would help a bit. Try to see if you guys can go out and eat, but something healthy. If you expect her to eat a burger with you she will probably lose her shit, get upset, and obviously not eat that burger. Bring more healthy foods and snacks to the house to help her get a healthy relationship with food. If she\u2019s surrounded by a lot of unhealthy and processed foods that she knows has a lot of calories she will not eat it. However if it\u2019s healthy she may eat bits of it but please remember to be slow with her. Do not rush anything bc it may just make her feel worse. Please do not yell at her, be calm and try to be understanding. Go shopping with her maybe but only at a point you see her feeling a bit better and let her know that she looks okay. I am saying when she is better because the numbers and sizes are scary.  When it comes to food try to keep numbers off the table too. Also she probably does know that this isn\u2019t healthy, but when you start to become anorexic nothing really matters. It\u2019s so painful, you feel so alone, you never feel comfortable in your own body, you hate yourself, so much negativity it hurts so much. I\u2019m still on and off and barely managing myself, but it\u2019s so painful to see someone else struggling like me. I used to go to ediop and group therapy too and it helped. I\u2019m stable now it\u2019s just still difficult. I don\u2019t want her to have permanent damage like me it just sucks..",

Some of the comments below about giving her more \u201ccontrol\u201d by allowing her to count calories, or teach her about macros, or telling her to eat \u201chealthy\u201d foods, or exercise... probably mean well... but as someone who had an ED for 8 years, that could just transition her from anorexia or bulimia to orthorexia. She could just shift the obsession from restricting to eating \u201csuper healthy\u201d and exercising excessively. I was so proud I \u201ccured my own eating disorder\u201d in my own mind... even though I was going to the gym 6 days a week and peeling breading off of chicken when no one was looking. The worst thing was, I was constantly praised for how \u201chealthy\u201d I was being when I was actually breaking my body down. \nUsually the underlying issues behind eating disorders are the need to feel in control, self esteem, anxiety. Did you know some people with anorexia have a negative chemical reaction in their brains after they eat that causes anxiety and the desire to avoid food? There are so many factors at play here that you really can\u2019t recover alone.
