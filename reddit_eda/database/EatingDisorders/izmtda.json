  "selftext": "ive been very stressed and sad lately because school just started and one of my family members left to work in another country. so i took comfort in eating a lot. i eat like thrice the amount of meals i usually have. if i'm not constantly stuffing my mouth with food, i feel like i will go crazy. i guess eating became a distraction and also a source of comfort. i already gained noticeable weight even though its been like a week. if i continue like this, i fear i may become overweight again when ive worked so hard to get to a healthy weight.\n\nplease give tips on how to stop binge eating",

Worst thing you can do is restrict.\n\nI like to set a 30 minute timer when I get the urge to binge, and promise myself not to act on the urge until the 30 minutes are up. Sometimes I still binge, and sometimes the urge fades. There are a long list of skills you can try before binging. Not all of them will work. Look through some of these: [https://www.yourlifeyourvoice.org/pages/tip-99-coping-skills.aspx](https://www.yourlifeyourvoice.org/pages/tip-99-coping-skills.aspx)\n\nI know it sucks. Hang in there. Get professional help if you can. Makes a world of a difference.",

You have to forgive yourself for binging and remind yourself that you are human and this kind of stuff happens. Don't be too hard on yourself. Something that helps me, is finding joy in other things besides food. I know, easier said then done. For a long time, food was the only thing that gave me joy. Like some of the others have said, it's important to see someone about this. Meal planning is also very helpful. I know I'm just some random person on reddit, but I hope that you start feeling better.",
