  "selftext": "I\u2019ve been \u201cin recovery\u201d for a long time, but this year was the first time I actually started to eat more to fight my anorexia. As a result, I\u2019ve gained a lot of weight and am objectively much healthier physically. However, I just haven\u2019t been able to mentally accept with all of these changes. Beyond endless body distress, I feel weak for not being able to restrict like I used to, and my ravenous appetite scares me. It\u2019s like even though I\u2019m healthier physically, there\u2019s a voice in my head constantly bullying me for my weight, trying to get me to restrict again or start purging. It\u2019s really kind of scary because I haven\u2019t been able to stop that voice at any point in recovery, and I\u2019m beginning to fear that I never will.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations for making recovery easier on my brain? I am losing hope and think I am close to relapse.",

      "body": "recovery requires a lot of time and mental strength.. I'm in recovery almost 2 years.. and the last half of a year have been devastating.. from undereating to overeating, from fasting to binge and purge. I've lost control of myself absolutely.... Just because I wanted to get better.. I've never felt worse.. until now .. last few weeks are the best weeks in my life.. I still have thoughts that I'm disgusting, have no control, or im hopeless piece of shit. But that is just thoughts... I'm able to control my feelings,  and I'm in control of my ED. No purging, no restriction.. \n\nI thought that recovery is impossible. But that's not true.\n\nI believe you can do it!\nStay strong and the day when it gets easier will come!\n\nAlso. I suggest you can try DBT therapy. Or just read about it, maybe try to use some DBT skills. It actually helps to overcome the voice in a head",

      "body": "Being mindful and as mentally prepared as you can. You know that recovery is what you want. You know that with recovery (often) comes extreme hunger and weight gain. Tell yourself that these things will happen. \n\nThen, prepare yourself for when they do. When you look in the mirror and have mean thoughts about your appearance, have something prepared to say to yourself like \"I knew this was coming. I chose this. My discomfort is temporary.\" And make sure you have prepared yourself for needing different clothes that make you comfortable. That is expected and part of the process.\n\nWhen you have those mean thoughts about your appetite, you can think \"it makes sense that I am so hungry. This is a normal human body's response to restriction. There is nothing wrong with eating more and feeding my body is my new goal.\"\n\nIn general, I would say that feeling bad from time to time is expected. Expect that you will feel bad sometimes as you change your habits and rewire your brain. That way, when a particularly bad day comes, you can, say, hello, I've been expecting you. I will still eat today even though it feels bad, but maybe I will choose to do something that helps me sit with those feelings like watching TV, doing a puzzle, calling a loved one, etc.",

      "body": "It does get easier, but it's also not so black and white. Recovery is not linear. There will be easier days, weeks, months than others. I have a few thoughts for you. \n\n1. Try to accept/acknowledge the dialecticals of recovery. You can feel disappointed in yourself for not engaging in ED behaviors (which is not really you, but really the internalized ED voice) AND you can still appreciate your healthy body.\n\n2. You mentioned feeling more hungry, and that causing you discomfort. This is called extreme hunger, and is so common! This is the mental and physical hunger associated with recovery. And yes, it is a bit disorienting and uncomfortable. I know I hated it (and still do). Your body (brain, muscles, connective tissues, etc) needs to repair itself and that requires extra nutrition over the course of YEARS. The physical ramifications of an ED is no joke. Mental hunger is also something that is part of being human. You have likely deprived yourself of foods sure to the ED habit of labeling certain foods \"unsafe\". These foods are part of helping you feel satiated. Sometimes a donut is going to satisfy your hunger more than a bowl of plain oatmeal. Honor your hunger. Your body is telling it what it needs to recover.\n\n3. Opposite action. Feel your feelings, acknowledge your ED thoughts, and then move on. E.g. \"I should restrict.\" \"Yep, that's my ED. I'm hungry, so I'm going to eat this because my body needs it.\"\n\n4. Joyful movement, fueled appropriately. Hikes, swimming, yoga, running. Enjoy your body's abilities.\n\nYou are not weak. You are not out of control. You are choosing health - to have coherent thoughts, to have energy, to engage with other people in meaningful ways. \n\nYou can do this. Day by day. Minute but minute.",

      "body": "it may feel impossible now, but it will get easier. i promise. last fall I was entering recovery and ended up in the mental hospital a few times because of how much weight gain f-ed with my mind. i tried desperately to lose it all again but it was a losing battle and I was never happy. i was bingeing constantly and hated myself. very slowly i began having breakthroughs and eventually i reached a point where I was at peace. once you get over the hump of wow-this-sucks-and-is-totally-impossible your body will physically be able to handle food better - you won't feel as bloated or horrible - and your metabolism will recover. your weight gain will even out and the weight will redistribute as you continue eating more. eventually you will be like wow I can eat without feeling super bloated the next morning which prevents the extreme guilt (in my case), and that's literally just because your body knows what to do with food now. I once lived in a mental state where I had to do intense cardio and I had to binge/purge/restrict constantly, but yesterday I had mac and cheese, a big cookie, and a pint of ice cream without even thinking about it and I woke up this morning exactly the same as I was yesterday. i haven't binged or purged in a long time and I can finally enjoy life without constantly agonizing over what I'm going to eat. ultimately, I just filled out with weight gain and most of my clothes still fit, they just look better on my because I actually have a body for them to be on. basically, once you begin realizing that your body is designed to know how to eat, handle food, and maintain weight, you will become more comfortable and it becomes a positive feedback cycle. you eat more, your body recovers more, you can continue to eat more and more, and eventually retrain your mind that food isn't evil and that nothing will change if you eat.",

Some periods are harder than others in recovery and you just have to muscle through.\nI'm in recovery for 5 years now and it has been a crazy ride. \nMy refeeding phase was really long, now that I think about it. I had extreme hunger, but even after that stopped, my body still needed more food than I was used to. And that's fine. Just learn to listen and trust your body.\nRecovery is not linear and healing needs time. For example, it took me until now to stop having fear foods.\n\nThe pandemic was particularly hard, but I feel like I came out stronger out of it. Although I still struggle a lot, I am happy. I can manage my emotions, I can eat with friends and I am more comfortable in my body every day.\nI wish you all the luck in the world. You are not alone! I hope this helped!",
