  "title": "Is talking about healthy eating a trigger for you?",
  "selftext": "I have a coworker who is obsessed with healthy eating and likes to proselytize me and my coworkers about the benefits of going wholistic and organic. I've been struggling with eating disorders since I was 11 years old (I'm 24 now) and have gone through phases of hyper-vigilance when it came to the ingredients I put into my body, which is often a slippery slope into restricting/purging.  I've found that when she goes on one of her tangents I sometimes walk away feeling anxious and ashamed and want to throw away all of my food and stop eating. She doesn't advocate for that at all, she just talks about how we all need to eat better as a society, but I still get triggered into more unhealthy thought patterns regardless. I also know it's a good thing to think about the quality of your food, so I feel conflicted about these conversations. How triggering is the topic of healthy eating for you/is it triggering at all?",
