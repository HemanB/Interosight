  "selftext": " \n\nTW: Laxative abuse.\n\nI\u2019m a 37-year-old woman who has been \u201crecovered\u201d from bulimia for about 20 years. I say \u201crecovered\u201d because while I\u2019ve stopped the daily purging, I still occasionally fall back on ED behaviors. I\u2019m fully aware of this and won\u2019t lie to myself.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago, I was constipated. Stimulant laxatives are a MAJOR no-no for me. Even with my sporadic disordered eating, I will not touch them.\n\nI stupidly convinced myself that a diet tea was a better alternative. \u201cIt\u2019s made from plant extracts,\u201d I told myself. How bad could it be?\n\nReally bad. Really really bad. I drank too much - like I fucking should have known I would - and now my digestive system is wrecked.\n\nIt\u2019s been a week since I last had the tea and my stomach is still hyper sensitive. Eating anything other than binding foods sends me running to the bathroom within an hour of my meal. I can\u2019t eat while I\u2019m working. I can\u2019t eat before bed.\n\nI\u2019m worried that this is going to send me back into the cycle of restrictive eating. I feel so fucking stupid.",
