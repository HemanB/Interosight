  "title": "Is my young teen daughter becoming anorexic?",
  "selftext": "Hello there \ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffc and thank you in advance for taking the time to reply, if you can. My 14 year old daughter has been getting thinner this last year, and eating less and less: I give her protein bara to take to school and sometimes she takes salmon or tuna salad: in the evenings she does eat with us whatever protein I\u2019m keen on serving. But I am worried that she is becoming anorexic in front of me and I might miss it: she looks thin but not sick, exercises a lot and has all but stopped eating bread; she does cook herself eggs everyday and says she is making sure she eats enough but I am a bit loss, so I thought I\u2019d ask you guys your opinion: should I worry more and take her directly to therapy?, what should I do?\nThank you \ud83d\udc96",

It\u2019s a tough subject to bring up but there are gentle ways to go about it. You could always start with a doctors visit and see how she is doing health-wise. I would recommend calling the doctors office ahead of time to  share your concerns privately. You could frame it to her as a regular checkup, but if the doctor is aware of your concerns, they can order specific ED-related blood tests. In regards to talking to her about it, often times if too much focus is put on food or weight, patients can shut down or deny. Focus on her feelings, her other behaviors. How is she doing? What are her stressors? How does she cope with stress? And listen without judgement. If she does have disordered eating, she may not even know it. It\u2019s tough but she is lucky to have you as a parent!",

Protein is super low calorie for how physically filling it is - very similar to insoluble carbs / dietary fiber (vs sugars). I used to feel physically full on >!800cal!< of dietary fiber + protein a day. Fats and carbs are awesome because they're both filling (moreso fats) *and* calorically dense, which is why I used to avoid them.\n\nMay be worth considering - the behavior you described sounds eerily familiar.",

She seems to have issues with food that goes beyond the usual \"diet\" thing. I would at least take her to a GP to have tests done and to monitor her. You are right. Therapy might be a good idea. Personally, I would make sure it's someone who knows eating disorders. It is *very* easy to \"manipulate \" a therapist who knows nothing about Eds.  Also, it would be a lot more helpful from the start. If you think it's getting worse to the point of being dangerous, don't hesitate to go to the ER. Eds are not just weight. She might still be in a visual good shape, but her organs will end up suffering. \u2764\ufe0f",

I think that you shouldn't confront her about it right now, but maybe pay a little bit more attention about how many calories she could be eating a day. If the amount is going to be concerning for a few days in a row, talk to her carefully. Ask, if she struggles and show your interest in her good. Just have a honest talk and if she admits that she may have some kind of disordered, sign her up to go and see a therapist/doctor and that will probably be a way to recover. It's great that you see all of the signs because then you may catch it earlier and there won't be as many consequences of the sickness in the future. You are an awesome parent for caring. Mine didn't to that for me and it's so good to see that a lot of parents take this seriously. Wishing that this thing was only a concern and everything is fine!!!!",

I know people with perfect parents develop EDs too, but I was taught that love is conditional and it contributed to my utter lack of self worth.

If the amount is going to be concerning for a few days in a row, talk to her carefully. Ask, if she struggles and show your interest in her good. Just have a honest talk and if she admits that she may have some kind of disordered, sign her up to go and see a therapist/doctor and that will probably be a way to recover. It's great that you see all of the signs because then you may catch it earlier and there won't be as many consequences of the sickness in the future. You are an awesome parent for caring.

I would recommend calling the doctors office ahead of time to  share your concerns privately. You could frame it to her as a regular checkup, but if the doctor is aware of your concerns, they can order specific ED-related blood tests. In regards to talking to her about it, often times if too much focus is put on food or weight, patients can shut down or deny. Focus on her feelings, her other behaviors. How is she doing? What are her stressors? How does she cope with stress? And listen without judgement. If she does have disordered eating, she may not even know it.

You should start to get an idea of her daily calories. It should be around 2000. Many parents will tell you not to snoop, but sometimes you have to. Look for evidence of food hiding and diuretics.  If your investigation doesn\u2019t yield anything, you might consider making an appointment with a dietician so you can help her diet properly. If she resists passionately that may be a hint. Watch for unhealthy hair, bowel movement issues, and irregular periods. Remember that lots of teenage girls experiment with wacky dieting, and only a small percentage develop an eating disorder. It\u2019s definitely worth watching closely, though. I wish I had paid more attention when my daughter was developing hers. We didn\u2019t figure it out until she was pretty deep into it.

I did see the cuts yesterday morning , a few hours before the doctor\u2019s appointment and it prompt me to explain to her everything I had gotten from you guys as well as to reassure her that I would do anything I can to help her feel better: I told her that I wasn\u2019t mad, but extremely worried for her wellbeing and ultimatwly her life.\nSo yes, I thank you all for your advice and insights, of course you were 100% on pointe.\nAlso, I came here to say something else: I love my daughter with all my heart, more than my soul can resist and I\u2019d give my own life in a blink for hers, I am absolutely commited to helping her feel better, go trough depression and manage her eating disorder but ultimately I am commited to making her aware that I am with her, her brother is with her, her grandmother, her aunt and uncle and we all love her dearly: she is not alone, and she doesn\u2019t have to be alone. So for all you kind and beautiful souls that offered advice so openly since you wourselves are going through and have gone  through this nightmare, know that you are not alone: you don\u2019t have to feel alone because some people that are close to you love you so so much, much more than you think\u2026 so much more!

I took my daughter to a dr specialized in teens yesterday, following all you kind people\u2019s advice and, just like you all\npredicted, she ordered a ton of bloodwork and heart exams: as it turns out, my daughter is way below her weight for her height and the dr found evidence of malnutrition: so what I feared, that she \u201cmight\u201d become anorexic in front of me and I might miss it was already happening, so we got a consult with a psychologist and. psychiatrist as well; she got sleeping pills to rest (which I didn\u2019t know that she didn\u2019t, since both my teenage kids have their own room and are entitled to their privacy) and the doctor asked her to not lock her door from now on, even in the bathroom, since it turned out my darling daughter had been cutting herself in the arms and hips as well. I did see the cuts yesterday morning , a few hours before the doctor\u2019s appointment and it prompt me to explain to her everything I had gotten from you guys as well as to reassure her that I would do anything I can to help her feel better: I told her that I wasn\u2019t mad, but extremely worried for her wellbeing and ultimatwly her life.\nSo yes, I thank you all for your advice and insights, of course you were 100% on pointe.\nAlso, I came here to say something else: I love my daughter with all my heart, more than my soul can resist and I\u2019d give my own life in a blink for hers, I am absolutely commited to helping her feel better, go trough depression and manage her eating disorder but ultimately I am commited to making her aware that I am with her, her brother is with her, her grandmother, her aunt and uncle and we all love her dearly: she is not alone, and she doesn\u2019t have to be alone. So for all you kind and beautiful souls that offered advice so openly since you wourselves are going through and have gone  through this nightmare, know that you are not alone: you don\u2019t have to feel alone because some people that are close to you love you so so much, much more than you think\u2026 so much more! I know you feel lonely but you are not; someone cares for you and doesn\u2019t know how to hold you at this moment; us who love you miss it, we miss that you\u2019re in pain, we miss that you\u2019re suffering and have absolutely no clue as to what you\u2019re feeling, and that\u2019s on us: but we still can help and will hold you if you reach out. So please do: let us know, the ones that are closest to you, what you\u2019re feeling because we are the ones who can help. We love you, we really do, with all our hearts.",
