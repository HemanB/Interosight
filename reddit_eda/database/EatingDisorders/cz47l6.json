  "title": "Request: Responding to the question \u201cDo you think I\u2019m fat?\u201d",
  "selftext": "Some background info: My girlfriend and I have been together for just over 3 years. In all the time I\u2019ve known her she\u2019s been underweight, and she recently confided in me that she has had a difficult relationship with food for a long time. She was diagnosed with an eating disorder just under a year ago and around then she lost a significant amount of weight in a short period of time.\n\nSince then she has made some amazing steps and has put some weight back on (although she is still a ways away from her weight when we first met, and by extension what her doctor would classify as healthy) as well as tackling the psychological aspect of recovery head on.\n\nI\u2019m extremely proud of her and trying to be as supportive as possible and this sub has been incredibly helpful for advice, but one thing I\u2019m still struggling with is the question she sometimes asks: \u201cDo you think I\u2019m fat/gross/heavy?\u201d I\u2019m struggling with how to answer this in the best way and I hoped I could get some advice from you all. \n\nSo far, I have responded with a \u201cNo.\u201d followed by changing the subject slightly by telling her how proud I am of the progress she\u2019s made in such a short space of time, trying to draw attention to the positives of her recovery so far without focussing on the weight.\n\nOne thing I\u2019ve been actively trying to avoid saying is something like \u201cNo, you look healthy\u201d or \u201cNo you look fine\u201d. Some other threads I have read on this sub suggested that telling someone they look \u201chealthy\u201d can also be demoralising, and I feel to say \u201cfine\u201d would be to downplay the progress she has made. \n\nIn addition to this I\u2019m also trying to avoid this language so as not to normalise the weight she is currently at, although I am wondering if this is a valid concern?\n\nThis is all very new to me and though I\u2019m trying the best I can any advice on this subject would be extremely helpful, thank you.",

Part of the reason many people develop eating disorders is because of this fat phobic diet culture world we live in. We are raised to demonize fat so when someone is battling this horrific and dangerous mental illness and working to get better, they can still overwhelmed with a fear of getting fat because surely that is \u201cbad\u201d even if it means making great strides to improve mental health. I think it can be helpful to remind her (even if she doesn\u2019t ask these specific questions) how much you love and care for her and you don\u2019t just love the way she looks, you love her for who she is. That\u2019s another reason people tend to develop eating disorders is that we get so tied up in putting our value only in our appearance when the fact is human beings are so much more than that. When she does ask you questions directly related to her looks and appearance you can tell her that she is and always has been beautiful to you. Best of luck to you both!",

Don\u2019t get me wrong, that\u2019s obvious. I take inspiration in people with eating disorders who recover and go on to be a healthy, normal, weight. However, many people with certain eating disorders such as bulimia, BED, and EDNOS can not have this mentality that you can eat whatever you want and being obese is ok, which lately, seems to be the majority of the recovery stories that are floating around. It\u2019s unhealthy to be underweight, but it is also unhealthy to be overweight and I\u2019m sick of body positivity for people who are clearly unhealthy being pushed.\n\nMy sister was made fun of all throughout high school for being naturally skinny. Of course, I was jealous and still am, that she can eat whatever she wants and not gain weight. She feels horrible about the body shaming she gets. \n\nMost people with bulimia and bed are afraid of \u2018if I stop purging, I will gain weight, and not in a normal sense, but to the fact that I will be obese\u2019. I have EDNOS, and engage in C/S and binge purge behaviour, and if I kept everything down, I would be where I was before, A bmi which put me at the high end of obesity. I then starved myself down to 75 pounds and was in the hospital for a year. I was miserable both ways. I am a normal bmi now, on the lower end, but still normal. Hell, we are all normal. But pushing pro-obesity isn\u2019t helping either.
