  "selftext": "I\u2019m new to this subreddit and I don\u2019t have a eating disorder myself bjt my friend does and its affecting me so bad. She takes note of how much Im eating when were together and always makes me eat the \u201cfattier food\u201d like scraping mayonnaise onto my plate, the oily dressings and even frosting on the cake. Whenever we meet she wraps her hands around my arm and comments about How skinnier its gotten and one occasion made me a jar full of cookies and told me that I MUST video myself finishing all of it on a video and send it to her. \n\nI know shes having a hardtime but her habits are affecting me. I dont know ehat to do but I find myself avoiding her, especially when we need to eat. \n\nI still love her very much but I dont know what to do.\n\nEDIT: \n\nThank you so much everyone who commented with advice. This has been sitting heavy on my heart for years now and there was always a quiet sense of dread whenever I had to meet her. I know how people with EDs have a really hard time so I felt terrible for resenting her alittle bit\u2026 i feel so heard from all your comments so thank you.",

But.. some people refuse to be saved and that\u2019s when you have to leave before your head deep in the water with them.\n\nI felt guilty for her, I let her keep doing it to me because she really had no other friends and she formed a super intense emotional bond with me and it ended up ruining me. Her habits rubbed off on me and eventually I followed in her path. We were like 2 toxic peas in a pod and it was hard for me to set boundaries but once I did it was too late and it actually ended our friendship.. not just over this issue it was many but I have a hard time myself setting boundaries. I like for people to feel comfortable, but sometimes they get too comfortable and you need to speak up and express how you feel, because chances are she might not even know she\u2019s doing that to you and how badly it affects not only you, but it lets her know that it\u2019s okay for her to continue that behavior towards people. \n\nIt\u2019s definitely hard talking about something like this especially if you don\u2019t have an ED. I tip toed around it because I knew she was insecure about it but also pushing her insecurities so much onto me.. then I developed those insecurities later on. I would talk to her, let her know how you feel truthfully and see how she reacts to that. Me personally, if someone said that to me I would be like holy shit I am so sorry that will never happen again. But there\u2019s a chance she may continue the behavior and then you need to set a heavier boundary and GET THE FUCK OUTTA THERE. You don\u2019t deserve that!! Mental health is important but don\u2019t ruin yours trying to help someone else\u2019s. You can always love someone from a distance!",

I think some clear, declarative statements (whether request or setting up what you will do) would go a long way in re-establishing some more appropriate behavior expectations.\n\nHere are some examples, if having a script to use or edit helps. Remember that you can change the boundary to reflect how strongly you feel about the circumstance (ex. \u201cI will leave\u201d could be \u201cI will not go here with you (ever again)\u201d if that is how serious it is.\n\nRequest: I don\u2019t feel comfortable when you put things on my plate for me without asking. Please don\u2019t do that anymore.\nBoundary: If you put things on my plate without asking, I will not go out for meals with you again.\n\nRequest: I don\u2019t like when people comment on my body size or shape. Please stop doing that.\nBoundary: If you comment on my body, I will leave and have to take some time apart from you.\n\nRequest: I understand that you are suffering from/have an eating disorder, but I am not comfortable recording myself eating. Please don\u2019t ask me again.\nBoundary: If you make demands about what I do with food or ask me to film myself, I will no longer spend time with you to maintain my own health and agency in food decisions.\n\nI absolutely understand that it can be hard to know how to treat folks with eating disorders because you might fear causing harm, but it does not benefit either of you to do these things to please her eating disorder. It runs the risk of normalizing what she is doing and reinforcing her disorder beliefs, and it runs the risk of causing further harm to you. You deserve to be safe emotionally!",
