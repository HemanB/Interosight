  "selftext": "I need a outside perspective on this. I noticed my boyfriend comments on my portion sizes. \n\nFor example tonight - I asked for one more piece of bread and he said hmmm you\u2019ve must\u2019ve had very small lunch today, to be this hungry. I had normal lunch and for dinner I had hummus with veggies and bread. Normal dinner. \n\nSo it did upset me, I was like - what kind of comment is that? This did not happen the first time, I feel like he often comments on my portion or is looking at my plate.\n\nSo we talked about it and from his point of view he did not mean it in controlling way, in his view is conversation like any other. In my view I see this as controlling behavior. \n\nAm I just projecting my own problems with food on his comments? I am honestly confused. \n\nLet me know what you think. ",

      "body": "Ever since I'm a little kid I have been a disordered eater. I'm talking from the age of seven and up - I am now 40. My ED developed in my early teens and ramped up in college and beyond. I've had bouts of recovery, but never really long term. I am also an alcoholic and addict. I've been in recovery from substances for almost five years, but I can't seem to do the same for my ED (A, B, BE). \n\nI've never liked to eat in front of people and have always been deeply hurt when people have commented on what or how much I eat. I was the chubby kid, and even a morbidly obese adult. Even today I don't \"look\" like someone with an ED but it's there. I currently live with my sister, brother in law, brother, their daddy, and five nieces and nephews. I swear to Bob that their daddy has a frickin tracker on me every time I go to the kitchen. He just appears outta nowhere like a daggum ninja and watches me. I buy my own food, I rarely eat what the rest of the family has bought and he has me self conscious of eating my own food. Maybe I want two yogurt cups, I bought them. Maybe I want two bowls of cereal and milk - I bought them. Yet, he watches. Even my nieces and nephews will comment. It makes me incredibly self conscious to where I don't even want to eat my own food and a lot of it goes to waste. I'm on a fixed income so wasting food is just not good. Everything I buy is on manager's special, so the shelf life isn't all that long, and I tend to buy so much and literally throw it away. \n\nI'm sorry to ramble, but all of this to say I understand. I don't think it's right for anyone to comment ever, whether there's an ED or not. I'm from the south - people eat lol. I'm sorry this is happening, and I hope that he'll understand in future. Thanks for listening to me ramble. Love and light \ud83d\udc9b",
