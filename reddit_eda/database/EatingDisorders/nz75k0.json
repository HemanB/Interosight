  "title": "Request: Gained weight and body looks better than before but the numbers on the scale just bothers me so much",
  "selftext": "\u201cSo I\u2019ve always had a very unhealthy relationship with my body. I grew up really chubby until in middle school I went on a diet and lost the weight. Now looking back it was extremely unhealthy and I ate so little and I wouldn\u2019t want to do it again, but I\u2019m struggling again now because I have gained weight again. I was extremely light in freshmen year of high school, and now I\u2019m a junior and I gained some weight. Though I look more toned now than chubby with this extra weight, the number on the scale just bothers me so much. I check myself excessively in front of the mirror. I have no perception on wether I\u2019m fit or fat anymore and whenever people tell me I\u2019m thin I find it so hard to believe. I really want to know if gaining this weight is a normal part of growing up. When I was extremely light I haven\u2019t even gotten my period, but I was only slightly shorter than I am now. I really don\u2019t want to fall back into unhealthy eating habits because of fears of me being fat.\u201d\n\nThis is the question I want to post, please consider it :)",

      "body": "Hi!\n\nIt sounds like you might have body dysmorphia, meaning no matter what your body looks like, you will sometimes feel fat: I completely relate to that, because my story is pretty similar to yours: was pretty chubby all of my teenage years, then I developed an eating disorder and became very skinny, then gained all the weight back, and now here I am, trying to lose it again. But I know that even though I am not super skinny like before, I am not overweight, but the numbers on the scale really trigger me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo one of the advice I could give you, is to switch up the system of your scale, if you can. Meaning I used to be insanely triggered when I'm not between 57 and 60 kilos, now am a few kilos above it, and since it hurts me so much to see it, I switched it to pounds. I have assimilated the numbers in pounds to guilt and shame, so it's easier to control my weight like that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother thing is that it's very hard to get rid of an eating disorder. Don't get me wrong, we get better and make sure that our bodies are not in danger anymore, but the toxic thoughts are very stubborn and they hold on to your brain like shells on a rock. So what I keep telling myself is that those thoughts (\"you're fat, look at the numbers, it means you're fat, you don't fit in a size 0 anymore, etc\") are just those ugly huge shells that I need to destroy: it's just your eating disorder that wants to survive, it wants you to restrict again. But it's not you, you're stronger than it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also relate to what you wrote because it feels like you know all about the theory, you just need the practice: you know that it's normal to gain weight, that you're healthier, and your friends tell you that you're thin. You know allllll of this. Your ED just wants you to stop believing those truths, and start believing its lies. Seeing my ED as a real being that wants to hurt me really helped me overcome my fear of weight!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really hope you'll get better, but congratulations for getting healthier and wanting to heal, I'm sure you'll succeed!",

      "body": "Hi! I struggle with this too. Also, I'm really tall so I could never be healthy AND 45 kilos. Even when I was 55 I missed my period and looked really sick. These are just numbers. I know it's really hard to accept but they tell nothing about you. You can be 70 kilos and still look thin and fit and be healthy and I know that. Nowadays so many fitness models dare to share their weight and it made me realize that extra small is not the only acceptable size. Being less and less kilos or a size xxs is not an accomplishment and not a thing to be proud of especially if you torture your body to get there.\nIf the scale is really bothering you, don't measure yourself. And most importantly, don't let your ED stand between you and your life. I'm 26 now and I spent most of my high school years battling anorexia. I barely have any memories from that time, I missed prom and hanging out with friends or going to parties because all I cared about was my weight and how I looked",

I'm here mostly to second this, but also:\n\nI totally get that avoiding weighing oneself is the best option, but it's also not viable 100% of the time, in many cases. So, CHANGING THE METRIC FOR WEIGH INS, WHAT???? THIS IS GENIUS. HOW HAVE I NEVER THOUGHT OF THIS??? WHY ISN'T THIS SUGGESTED MORE???",
