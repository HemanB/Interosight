  "selftext": "Ok, so my girlfriend (12f) since 5th grade has been doing this thing where every other day she won't eat anything. \n\nHer mom noticed she hasn't been eating, so is now making sure that she eats enough. \n\nShe mentioned at school a joke about throwing up. I asked about it and I'm pretty sure it's a... More than one time\n\nWhat should/can I do? It really hurts to think about her doing stuff like this, but I don't know what to do. Please. Any help would be greatly appreciated \n\nEdit: She's 12 and I'm 13. I got a few asking our age.\n\nEdit 2: I an unable to tell her mother. I haven't even met her ",

You can\u2019t do this alone and there are adults with education and training in ways to give her the best help available. Absolutely talk to her counselor. Tell the counselor you\u2019d like to remain anonymous if you don\u2019t want your girlfriend to find out it was you, but if that\u2019s an adult she trusts then that is a great place to start.\n\nAlso, definitely talk to your parents about this if you think they\u2019d be able to offer any support. Maybe they can help you talk to her mom or even just help support you while you\u2019re helping her.\n\nRegardless, it says a lot about your character that you\u2019re noticing the issue and trying to do what\u2019s right. You\u2019re gonna be a good man someday. Just keep doing the right thing and reach out to the adults around you.",

If it were me, nothing you could say or do would convince me to stop when I felt like it. And bringing it into the open, something I would never seek to do, would make me angry and push me away from you. \nHowever, you said that she hinted at it in conversation, so it is possible she is asking for help as she must know that this would cause concern. (Not sure of your age, if around or under 20 she may be naive enough to not realize this). \nIf it\u2019s possible she is reaching out for help, the guidance counsellor idea is a good place to start. I would tell the Counsellor and leave it to the professionals to manage, I wouldn\u2019t try to mention it or make any difference yourself. \nThe only thing you can do is tell her she\u2019s beautiful, particularly when she\u2019s having a scruffy \u201chome\u201d day wearing baggy pants and after a big meal, saying you wouldn\u2019t change a thing about her without being too obvious. \nOther than that, I wouldn\u2019t suggest you yourself doing much else. If things got bad and the guidance counsellor thing didn\u2019t work you could always mention it to her mom and/or family but I wouldn\u2019t expect to have a relationship after that",

If she shows you a picture of a normal skinny girl probably with defined waist and toned arms/ thigs it's normal but if she shows a picture of an extremely skinny malnourished girl who looks sick, then take her to a therapist or something like that because that's not normal and probably has body dysmorphia.

Tell her that you are there for her and make her feel loved and not judged.i am so sorry that this is happening, especially at a very young age. it can be alot, i am proud of u looking out for her. if u have any questions feel free to ask",

There r reasons she's doing it and sometimes it isn't just about weight.. my reasons are lack of control, when I'm stressed or upset.   She may feel uncomfortable talking about it because for me, I'm so embarrassed for anyone to know.  I feel like they won't understand or they'll look at me differently. But the fact that she didn't deny it is a good sign.  Maybe u can try to bring it up to her and ask her what is going on in her life that is causing her to do that.  She may still not be honest and openly admit it but if possible, reassure her that u won't tell anyone. Maybe shell be more open with u knowing what ever she tells u, it'll be safe. I'm really sorry.",

We're 12 (her) and 13 (me)\n\nI'm worried about talking to her about it though because when I first tried, I said \"Hey, you mentioned throwing up and I just wanna know... Was that just a joke or did you... Do it?\" And she said, pushing through tears \"I'm sorry. *Sniff* I-I don't wanna male you upset. I'm sorry.\"\n\nI will definitely try. Byt how could I bring it up? I understand reassuring her I won't tell and letting her know I won't be upset with her or look at her different, but how do I safely bring it up?",

I'm so sorry. It's so difficult being in your place and it's so difficult for her too.  Please keep us updated on here. I really hope she stops because it will affect her health, teeth  etc..",
