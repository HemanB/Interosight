  "title": "Request: Handllng weight gain in recovery",
  "selftext": " \n\ni thought i had already been eating for recovery for like six months, but after my last doctors visit where my mom told me i supposedly had lost two pounds, i decided to try harder. i\u2019ve been fitting extra snacks in where i can and started using oils to saut\u00e9 food (big fear). the only problem is i\u2019ve just NOW started to see the effects and i don\u2019t like it. i can see that i\u2019m getting chubby. i don\u2019t know why but this part is insanely triggering for me. back when i was underweight i used to feel bad about my body; i didn\u2019t like how i didn\u2019t even fit into my old size at target and it made me feel horrible. at that point i knew i needed to gain weight. but now that it\u2019s actually happening i\u2019m seriously freaking out. every time i finish eating i wish i could go throw up but i don\u2019t have the energy to. there are still places like my arms and my upper chest that are ugly and honey, but all of the weight is going to my thighs. nobody in school ever commented on my weight but i still liked seeing that i was skinnier than them. it seems like since i was able to start eating more, slowly giving up on my fear foods, that i\u2019m not sick anymore, like i was never sick. it\u2019s like i need the label \u201ci have an eating disorder.\u201d i don\u2019t know why because i hate making it seem like i\u2019m begging for attention but at the same time it\u2019s exactly what i\u2019m doing. i want people to look at me and be scared for me. but they\u2019re not going to do that when i\u2019m eating and at a healthy weight. i know how this fucked up this sounds, im sorry. i guess what i\u2019m asking is, how do i stay motivated when i feel so close to giving up? how do i keep going when in the back of my mind i know that i\u2019m just voluntarily making myself bigger?",

      "body": "I recovered almost 4 years ago and felt the exact same way. Try to focus on why you want people to look at you and be scared. Or why you don\u2019t think your worthy of that attention on your own without scaring people. It\u2019s good you are recognizing this, and Id recommend diving deeper into that feel to sort it out. And I can offer a little bit of the experience I went through. \n\nGaining weight was scary. From what I went through and from what I\u2019ve seen other people go through, it can be dispersed awkwardly at first. But it settled more naturally after a bit. And during the awkward weight gaining time ya know what I learned? Not much changed. My friends and family still loved me. I was still the same person. Only I could be more of that person / friend / daughter / sister because I wasn\u2019t spending all my time focused on food and exhausted. Especially adding fat back into my diet made me feel a lot better over time. At first I gained weight more in my stomach. But now my stomach is still flat only in a healthy way and now that I\u2019ve been eating right for a bit I can see that it does look better. Also I\u2019m quite jealous you gain weight in your thighs. People get plastic surgery now a days to have a smaller waist and bigger butt and thighs. Own it gal! But something that did really help me during recovery was I started lifting weights. I never got huge muscles, girls have to work crazy hard and purposefully to get that. But it did help to want to eat food when I knew it was going to fuel my muscles instead of fat. I don\u2019t work out as much know and have stayed thin but I do miss being strong. So id give that go, helps a lot with your mood too! And we all need a mood boost during recovery. I say weight lifting over cardio because with cardio I could only focus on the calories lost. With weights I wanted to focus on calories in to fuel my workouts. \n\nYou have a lot more to offer the world than to be super skinny. You deserve a place on this world without feeling like you need to shrink yourself smaller than your healthiest and happiest weight. You may be feeling like this feeling is a set back, but recovery comes with a lot of ups and downs. You are still much better off than when you started since a big part of you wants to recover. Proud of you \u2665\ufe0f",

But you are doing the right thing. The weight can settle a little unnaturally at first (I thought this was a lie back in the day - its not!) but it will change over time. \n\nGive yourself grace - and trust your body. She knows what she is doing. She knows when to make your heart beat and your lungs breathe. And she will know what to do with the nutrition you are giving her. You are healing and it will take awhile but it gets better. I promise. Maybe not tomorrow but maybe the tomorrow after that. \n\nYou are doing great. <3",

      "body": "What's happening to you and your fears of gaining weight is totally normal in recovery. A major component of eating disorders is not being able to see and assess your body accurately. Body dysmorphia can manifest itself in many different ways, and what you're describing is definitely within those bounds.\n\nI went through the same thing when I started my own recovery, when I felt like eating normally was just causing me to pack on fat. There was such negative self-talk about any kind of weight gain, much like you. I also had this sense of superiority over other people when I ate less than them, didn't get excited about food like them, and was super judgmental about people who were getting excited about a 'bad' food. My anorexic body was a symbol of pride in. It's all totally false though, and it hurt me so much.\n\nI made a lot of peace with gaining weight and seeing it as a positive thing. I turned that negative self-talk into acceptance and positivity about myself other than body image. It took a lot of work, a lot of time, and a lot of sessions in therapy to convince myself that I'm okay. To this day, I still struggle some with weight fluctuations, but I know that because I have this disorder, I cannot assess my own body shape accurately, nor see it, no matter what shape it is, as a healthy part of being a human. It's still scary, but I accept that I feel this way in a sense. I accept that it's only a small part of who I am now.",

      "body": "I'm going through something similar, and felt so alone until I read your post and the comments (I just for the first time sought out this reddit page because I was desperate for support and advice). The last couple weeks, I started to eat regularly again for the first time in ages, and been totally freaking out because I can see myself filling out all over.. but not enough to be considered fat whatsoever by probably anyone besides myself. I've never been rail thin or anorexic, but used to be a little slimmer than I am now, as recently as like 2 weeks. I'm afraid of me gaining weight becoming out of control and the idea of becoming legitimately fat scares the shit out of me. I've never had a flat stomach, and came to the realization I probably never will, because strict dieting and frequent exercise never made my tummy go away.. I think my flesh is just built this way and all I want in the world is to accept myself and not put all my worth and importance into a number on the scale or pants size or if my shorts fit somewhat tighter than they used to when I was still starving myself. I have so much more mental clarity since I got my appetite back, and feel significantly happier overall, but still panicking over my weight and terribly distorted body image. my boyfriend whom I live with has been battling a severe eating disorder for a very long time, and his struggles kind of rub off on me. I wish I had advice for you, but I don't :( however  I wish you the best with your recovery and am proud of you <3",
