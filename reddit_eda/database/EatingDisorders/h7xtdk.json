  "selftext": "Does anyone feel like this disorder has taken their whole personality away from them? In the last 2 years I\u2019ve been progressively getting worse and after speaking with my boyfriend tonight he highlighted (and I\u2019ve thought this myself) I\u2019ve lost my carefree and fun side of me. Now I\u2019m just in constant stress or anxiety mode. Won\u2019t do anything won\u2019t go anywhere. Is anyone else like this?",

      "body": "Yes, I\u2019ve been there in a couple of different ways over my illness and recovery. Prior to my eating disorder I was carefree, easy going and down to earth but the constant striving for perfection and achievement turned me into a very highly strung person, I was also extremely judgemental of others for what my disordered mind perceived as weakness, I developed a hateful competitive nature and had a constant drive to push my successes into peoples faces particularly if I knew it would hurt them. This part lingered on in me for years and actually became more intense as my recovery progressed, I suppose this filled a void in me that was being left behind as I moved away from disordered behaviours. I dealt with this in therapy over the last year and a half and I\u2019ve really found my way back to myself, I feel I\u2019ve been able to truly connect with myself and be who I really am for the first time since I was a teenager.\nThere was also a stage during my disorder that I realised I was a blank person. I had nothing to say, nothing to do or think about. I would wake up in the morning eat what I was allowed to that day then I could have spent the remainder of the day staring into space thinking about when I could eat again, nothing else even registered as slightly interesting. During that period of my life I don\u2019t think I ever cried or felt any type of emotion, it was one of the most unsettling times for me.\n\nAre you engaging in therapy or taking steps toward recovery? For me personally I really needed that professional help to get through and it\u2019s changed my life for the better",

It's likely he/she/they has other clients who see ED doctors. You'll want a doctor who is specially trained in eating disorders, as doctors outside of that area tend to only rely on bmi rather than actual health.",

If they bothered to look at diagnosing guidelines now, then they'd know bmi has nothing to do with diagnosing and ED, well i mean depending on case, BUT it's not a valid diagnostic ED tool anymore, nor should it have ever been. \n\nI'm so glad you are looking into seeing a therapist again, just having someone to vent it out too that is trained for it can make such a difference. I'm really proud of you.",
