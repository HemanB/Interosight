  "selftext": "I\u2019m hungry, I can see my weight going down, I know it\u2019s not good, I like food, I want to eat. But, I\u2019m afraid of food, my stomach hurts when I eat, my stomach does like when there is food in there, I get diarrhea when I eat, I occasionally want to vomit when I eat. It is a recurring issue, happens like a cycle, few weeks fine, few weeks huge weight drop. It wasn\u2019t a huge thing when I was younger, I have always been underweight and I have always been know as the person who doesn\u2019t eat. I can go off not eating for days if I\u2019m not forced to. But I was a kid, I have other disorders and I was paired with a kind of meds that makes me want to eat. Few years ago, my family moved and I no longer take any meds or see any professionals. This time, it came back worst, the process sounds like food poisoning, but I\u2019m sure I can\u2019t get food poisoning from all food I consume everyday one meal a day for 3 days. My parents, eating the same food, were fine \n\nMy parents doesn\u2019t believe in eating disorders. How should I get help while being a minor? Who should I go to? What can I do to fight it?",

      "body": "Obviously nobody here can diagnosis you but I experienced this for a long time. It turns out the severe pain I was experiencing was from several food allergies. It\u2019s not 100% better, but now that I can avoid the specific foods that cause pain, I don\u2019t have nearly as much fear about eating.  \nSeeing an allergist or doctor would be ideal, but if that\u2019s out of reach, an elimination diet could still help. If you\u2019re interested I\u2019d be happy to explain what I did though it won\u2019t work perfectly for everyone.",

I'm actually very upset that it is difficult to eat, not an experience I had expected to have in my life about a year ago. I'm very happy about this shift in how I think about food. I never before thought I could trust my body again - which is of course a symptom of ED.",
