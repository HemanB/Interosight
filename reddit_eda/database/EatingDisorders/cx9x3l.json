  "title": "Request: My sister has an eating disorder and is mad that I told our parents.",
  "selftext": "I noticed over the summer that my sister's eating habits were getting strange. She'd skip breakfast and lunch, then tell our parents she ate a lot during the day to skip dinner. At first, I thought she was eating snacks when I wasn't looking, but it was getting pretty obvious that she just was not eating at all. I told my parents what I had noticed, and then they put her into therapy and pulled her out of her dance classes, which has been making her absolutely miserable. She knows that I'm the one who said something and is pissed about it. I feel awful that I caused her to get pulled out of dance, but I do want her to get the help she needs. But it's hard to deal with my sister hating me. I know, it's the eating disorder talking, not her, but a lot of it is still coming out of her mouth and I hate having to hear that from my sister. I feel like our relationship is ruined and I don't know what to do! How can I make it up to her?",

The sooner she gets the treatment, the more likely she will recover. It is normal for her to be angry and blame you though. Just remember again, it\u2019s the eating disorder that\u2019s mad at being caught, and it will kick and scream before letting go of your sister. Please don\u2019t hesitate to ask your parents if you can see a therapist or counselor to help you during this time as well.",

      "body": "First of all, you did the right thing. My personal opinion is that you don't really have anything to make up for, rather you should let her know that you did what you did because you love her and were worried about her. And you want to support her and help her while she gets help. \n\nI understand her feelings too. Eating disorders carry a lot of secrecy and shame. It's very hard to admit you have one, especially to yourself. It's possible in her mind she really doesnt feel she has a problem. However I really feel you did the right thing.\n\nGive her time. It may take a while, but she needs to recover and get help and some day she will understand you just wanted to help her.",

Sooner or later she will understand, although the journey is painful for everyone. Looking back, I wish someone had held me accountable (not that anyone is to blame in this sort of situation). It would have saved me from a very long and tiresome journey.",
