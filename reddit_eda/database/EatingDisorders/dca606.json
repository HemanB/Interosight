  "selftext": "Was on a subreddit and said anorexia is about obsession and control and people said I was generalizing. Has anyone who has actually gotten treatment also been told they have control/chaos/coping issues? The ncbi and national institute for eating disorders both mention control as a major part of EDs, but I guess I'm wrong",

      "body": "I agree that just saying it's about control is an oversimplification. \n\nMy bff in college had anorexia and he was so anxious and OCD about food. His brain was reminding him that food isn't very pleasurable and leads to further anxiety. Obsessive uncontrollable thoughts about food led to compulsive behaviors. I think anorexia is much better described as a subtype of OCD. \n\nI know I restrict more when I'm really anxious and on edge and binge when I'm more depressed. When I'm somewhere in the middle of anxiety and depression I do all behaviors. I \"diet\" till I can't take it because of the physical effects of not eating enough then binge and purge. \n\nI'm also tired of the troup that person feels helpless, then consciously realizes their body is withing their control as it feels like nothing else is, and then said person takes a knowing step forward like \"I can't control my situation so I'll control my food.\" \n\nI remember a Ted talk about a woman telling her experiences with treating anorexic patients. She talked about how the brain doesn't respond normally to food so you get little reward when you eat anyway and it may just actually increase anxiety and obsessive thoughts. \n\nIn a different Ted talk (I think? This info was from a while ago) people with bulimia experience similar responses to food. Say a normal person eats half a cup of ice cream and feels satisfied. A person with bulimia only has a mild pleasure response to that same amount. In order to feel enough of that dopamine high, they may need to consume a whole pint. And when you purge you body releases endorphins so you become addicted to that high. Both eating disorders have a biological component that interferes with the body's expected and normal response to eating. \n\nHence, when people hear \"it's all about control\" we roll our eyes.",
