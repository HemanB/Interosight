  "selftext": "I\u2019m confused. I don\u2019t have a diagnosed eating disorder but I restrict a lot. I don\u2019t think the amount of calories I eat is low enough t be That worrying but I try to burn off calorie so that my net amount is low If that makes sense? Still there are lower calorie diets that are accepted so idk\nAnyway to my understanding eating disorders are an all consuming thing and while a part of my brain is always occupied with food and stuff, some of the time I can still ignore it? Like some days I can make myself go the whole day without counting what I eat and then other time I cry for two hours cause my grandma made me eat a baked good that I used to love with no guilt. I\u2019m asking primarily today because I was in school and a teacher asked everyone to weigh themselves for a problem and I just started shaking and almost cried because the weight talk freaked me out so much. I don\u2019t have a scale so I don\u2019t know my weight but I do know I lost weight since I started and I body check like every hour . Anyway I kinda spiraled after that and I start getting distracted during classes because I\u2019m logging food or googling if theirs calories in the antidepressants I take which seems more messed up but other days if I know I\u2019m over what I try to eat I just won\u2019t log it so I just don\u2019t know why it changes per day and I find when I restrict all morning for example that food just stops tasting good, is this stuff normal?",

We all have good days and bad days, but some bad days are worse than others. \n\nIf you find it impacting your relationships with yourself, or anything like school, relationships, ability to properly care for self, or otherwise inhibits your ability to thrive, it may be time to reach out. \n\nI have to admit there are some red flags in your post.

Any time something is causing that much distress it means there\u2019s something wrong, and even if there are days where you\u2019re ok, the bad days don\u2019t need to exist at all and you don\u2019t want those becoming the *only* days \n\nAnecdotally, I spent many years of my ED in the on/off kind of mode (I went to treatment and then for almost a decade I would have periods of attempted recovery on my own followed by severe behaviors) and it\u2019s a circle of hell I wouldn\u2019t wish on anyone. I achieved nothing with it and wasted my 20\u2019s, to boot. So with that angle I can only say PLEASE speak to someone if you\u2019re able, because you don\u2019t deserve to waste your life on a miserable ED.",

They just celebrated my weight loss. When I was in your place and knew I was spiraling hardcore I started googling places I could call in my area to be assessed and talked about it with my therapist. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this. xoxo",
