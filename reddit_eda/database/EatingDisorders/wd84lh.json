I just dont know what it is i can go days with forgetting to eat and when i see food after starving myself i just ignore it. My mom is always yelling at me to eat and i jus feel so guilty why dont i just eat and stop ignoring food? Its been like this for a while and i dont know what to do..",

I\u2019m overwhelmed by food and have no interest in it. \n\nIt made me notorious as an ascetic and flagellant because I don\u2019t salt and spice my dishes and eat plain things like cooked lentil, hardboiled eggs, or steamed vegetables. I don\u2019t enjoy treats either and my parents still think I\u2019m being tough on myself or body-conscious.\n\nFind the least offensive, most nutritious foods and make sure you eat at least those. Make a habit of it, like preparing one sufficient meal a day in the afternoon. Malnutrition isn\u2019t fun and food has a major social aspect, so being able to eat and not get sick is pretty important for hanging out with friends.",

Sometimes I restrict on purpose because of my personal issues with my body, sometimes I just really enjoy the feeling of being hungry and having my stomach growling, and other times I'm just genuinely turned off by the idea of food and eating. I'm not sure if you had similar issues, but my parents always forced me to finish whatever was on my plate growing up, regardless of what it was or how much there was. I would sit at the table for 3 hours sometimes just forcing myself to finish and once I moved out, I realized I could just eat when I was hungry. I guess eventually, I just began eating less as I \"wasn't hungry\", but really I just chose not to eat or would skip meals to see how long I could go until I couldn't ignore it.\n\n I'm actively trying to eat more now but it's really tough sometimes, especially if I have no interest in it. I found that if there's a prepackaged food I really like (salad, chips, jerky, etc.), I'll just buy and eat that a lot because it's familiar and easier to remember.",
