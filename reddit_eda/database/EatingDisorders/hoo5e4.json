If they do then you did the absolute correct thing but if they don\u2019t understand it completely then, I\u2019m really sorry to say this, but it\u2019ll be a pain in the ass for her. Ed just becomes soooo much harder when living with parents who don\u2019t understand..I hope you\u2019ll look further into this and take the right decision..do tell your friend about this tho..she should not learn it from her mother that you let her know..it should come from you..also I completely believe in your intentions and there\u2019s no wrong in being worried,I believe you would\u2019ve assessed the situation and then taken the correct decision but if you see anything wrong with her mom, please take immediate action",

I think you did the right thing to raise your concerns to her mom. Your friend might be angry with you for a while, but I do not believe for a second that you betrayed her. I think, when you care about someone and know they need help, you tell someone who you believe will help them. When I was sick, other adults would notice my behaviour and pull my mom aside to tell her their concerns. Moms can miss noticing an eating disorder in their child because they are in denial. That's what happened with my parents, anyway. I personally never felt any negativity towards the people who told my mom their concerns, but every situation is different. \n\nI would be prepared that your friend could be upset, but know that sometimes loving someone requires you to do and say things that they don't want you to.",

However, if that\u2019s not the case you could make things worse. \n\nI personally have struggled with disordered eating for quite a while, and the actions of my family have only made it worse. My parents believe that I\u2019m fat, they make fun of me, they encourage my \u201cdieting,\u201d and are happy when I lose weight through unhealthy means. If they were to find out I actually had an eating disorder they wouldn\u2019t care, and that would only send me spiraling even further. \n\nI hope for her sake that she does have good parents who love her but that\u2019s not the case for everyone.
