I developed anorexia & bulimia at 16, I also am on the smaller side, and my chest is the first place I lose weight at my skinniest I was wearing little girls bras as that's all that would fit. My back teeth are also rotted away from my bulimic period (I'm 31 now). I think it also messed my hormones up as I started getting ovarian cysts at 17 that have never gone away. I absolutely believe having an ED during those ages can mess our bodies up.",

After a few years (normal weight) I went to the dr about the periods and got an ultrasound. I had ovarian cysts that made the dr suspect pcos but she said it also could be that I really screwed up my hormones with the anorexia. I did not have other symptoms of pcos. She told me it wasn\u2019t dangerous to not get my period, so I waited until my husband and I were ready to conceive. I needed hormone therapy via pills and shots in the abdomen but I got my period back in 3 months and got pregnant with a healthy and perfect baby girl. Since then my periods have been normal and my hormones have evened out. \n\nI was very sick from taking a new anti depressant last year and couldn\u2019t eat much at all. My periods stopped for 2 months and I was sure they wouldn\u2019t come back but since I have been off that medication and eating normally they have returned.

I\u2019ve had anorexia on and off (by which i mean extreme restriction on and off) from 13yrs to age 20 currently and both putting on just a few more kgs, the fenugreek (i only took it for a few months) and not wearing any bras are the only things i can think of that contribute to my increase by 2x cup sizes. I was an A-B till about 17, now i\u2019m more C-D. I\u2019ve been on birth control for a while too, i don\u2019t know if that contributes. I do recommend fenugreek though, i noticed no change in my weight loss at the time, so it won\u2019t have any affect on anyones recovery, and it\u2019s best noted for its health benefits (especially for pregnant women) and breast enlargement. it won\u2019t work miracles but it\u2019s nice.

      "body": "I can definitely relate to your history at least. I developed anorexia aged around 11. I had one period when I just turned 12, and didn't have another for exactly 10 years and 2 months. My breasts still grew  and were comically large compared with my body when I was very unwell, but probably not as large as they could have been given my genetics. My family is Easter European, and my shorter-than-me mother had size H cup size (UK cup sizes) in her early 20s.\n\nAt the healthy weight i usually sit at, I wear a 32E/F bra. Recently, I lost weight due to work stress and am about 1.5 BMI points below this. I'm now a tight DD or loose E cup. So personally, I store quite a lot of weight in my boobs and their size is very sensitive to weight changes. But obviously this will vary from person to person. I will note though, that my boobs did start having major growth spurts when I got my period back. I went from a loose D/tight E to the E/F in less than a year, without gaining much weight elsewhere. \n\nOther than gaining more weight, making sure you have regular periods, or getting a boob job, I don't think there is much you can do to grow them. But know that bigger breasts aren't very fun to have. Nor are they generally viewed as more attractive by men despite what we've been told to believe. So have confidence in your wonderful body!!!",
