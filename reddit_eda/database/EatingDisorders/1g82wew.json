  "selftext": "So first of all, a little about me. I\u2019m in my 30\u2019s and had issues around food my whole life. I\u2019ve been officially diagnosed with a binge-restrict eating disorder and it\u2019s basically ruled my whole life. I\u2019ve had 3 kids and after my 3rd I\u2019ve been stuck in the binge stage for soooo long (they are 2 now) The only thing that\u2019s changed is I reached out and told people. \n\nI told my midwife who was able to get me therapy. I told my husband and I told a friend at the gym. \n\nMy therapist was no help. She basically said that because my weight was stable they weren\u2019t concerned. \n\nMy husband once used it against me in an argument. He was upset because I didn\u2019t want to go out for lunch. He later apologised but overall I felt like I should be making food choices to keep him happy rather than what I actually want. \n\nMy friend at the gym was lovely but ever since I\u2019ve felt like I was lying. I\u2019m of average weight so I feel like I\u2019m making it up. \n\nBasically all these things make me feel like I\u2019m being watched all the time. Watched and judged. \u201cShe said she has an eating disorder but she looks normal\u201d \u201cshe ate x yesterday why won\u2019t she eat y today\u201d. \n\nI think unless someone experiences it they don\u2019t understand so when I want to talk or vent about it I\u2019m left feeling unheard. I hate that I feel the way I do. I hate being stuck in the binge stage so much. I wish I\u2019d never told anyone. It felt better when it was just me and I didn\u2019t feel like anyone else was watching me. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll talk about it anymore. Go back to talking online anonymously. I also feel like I\u2019ve made it all up. \n\nI should mention, my mum often suspected I had an ED and even if she wasn\u2019t able to get me the right help she did try. I\u2019m saying this just to say, if someone was really watching they\u2019d notice. I just wish I\u2019d never said it out loud. ",

Overall I'm glad I told people cuz it helped me get into therapy at first and I'm not sure I would have without help/support from loved ones. However I do wish I hadnt had to share it with family and many friends because it is a burden and just exhausting because it does mean a lot of unhelpful worry about me that just makes everything worse.  At this point, my eating is the most under control it has ever been and has been so for years thanks to lots of meds (probably also my weekly therapy but the meds changed my binge urges immediately so the therapy feels much less influential). However, I would say that I'm far from \"healed\" from my eating and body issues and I honestly doubt I ever will be. Mostly I feel alone and doomed to my negative perceptions of my body and food because I don't look sick and because I am the least sick I've been since I was a teen but that still is not good. It's exhausting to believe my weight is basically what defines me and I know that isn't rite but society really agrees with me and trying to get someone to understand how toxic my mindset is is just pointless as it does just come off as me whining about a non problem.  A first world problem. And I don't fully disagree.  But it is so upsetting that I never feel ok in my body and I'm basically dependent on meds to keep me this weight and this \"fine\". I'm nearing 40 and my biggest fear is still the same as it was when I was 13- gaining weight. I miss when I got to use my brain for things that mattere, like having fun and being creative and really not even thinking much about my body at all.\n\nToday I looked into eating disorder treatment options for the first time in over 6 years, just to see what was out there.  I see nothing there for me because I am sure none of these well meaning caregivers can know any magical treatment or regime to \"free\" me and I don't miss researching \"fixes\" 24/7. It's sad to me that I don't have hope for a better mindset from any intervention but I also am glad I'm not searching so hard for a fix that I don't believe exists for me. I'm healthy \"enough\" according to most people so pushing for more recovery just doesn't feel worth it or attainable.  I also am not sure I've met anyone who has a truly healthy relationship to their body image and food. \n\nSo rambling. But u r not alone and I feel for u",

So I kinda ran the gamut of starving and bingeing and paid the price for that in many ways. My current approach is that I try to focus on my weight and food as little as possible and basically distance myself from anyone who has critiques of my food (both praise of how I eat and criticism of how I eat I see as equally toxic) and I do not tolerate comments on my body by anyone at all. I think I've kinda learned to stay in my lane in terms of trying to change my body because I used to be so so much worse but my other family members seem to be low-grade caught up in that web increasingly. I think these approaches to it all are both terrible but sometimes it does make me feel less embarrassed about how public my struggles have been. \n\nBut then also a big part of me thinks I am just weak willed and if I really was motivated I'd never struggle with bingeing or be tempted by any unsactioned food. \n\nI'M EXHAUSTED :(",

It's exhausting to believe my weight is basically what defines me and I know that isn't rite but society really agrees with me and trying to get someone to understand how toxic my mindset is is just pointless as it does just come off as me whining about a non problem.

It's sad to me that I don't have hope for a better mindset from any intervention but I also am glad I'm not searching so hard for a fix that I don't believe exists for me. I'm healthy \"enough\" according to most people so pushing for more recovery just doesn't feel worth it or attainable.  I also am not sure I've met anyone who has a truly healthy relationship to their body image and food. \n\nSo rambling. But u r not alone and I feel for u",
