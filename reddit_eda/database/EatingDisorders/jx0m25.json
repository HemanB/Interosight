  "selftext": "When I was young (4-13) my father had custody of us. He bought drugs and alcohol, but rarely food. He often sold his foodstamps, so my brother and I walked home with food from the church and that was often our only way to eat, aside from hot dogs and bologna. \n\nI remember eating pebbles, lemon grass and clover flowers... I shoplifted and stole bird seed from the neighbor's feeders. I often traveled in search of food outside, even dumpster diving at the stores. Summers were rough, because that was the end of school lunches. \n\nWhen I was 13, mom got custody... Which was for the best! I was finally safe! But we both tried to make up for years lost, in food. She knew we went though hell so she'd get us whatever we wanted to eat. I was eating huge amounts of food, any hour of the day/night. I could sit and eat 4 packs of ramen, my own medium pizza even. It was never enough. My brother and I even started fighting over food when things got a bit scarce. I tripled my weight in a couple years.\n\nNow I'm 27, I've attempted to get help over the years of therapy, but I still have food insecurity. I've become severely diabetic and the injections aren't helping. \n\nMy doctor has told me I need to go vegan... Has told me to cut my plate size. Told me to limit myself. But has also told me she doesn't want to help me in ways until I \"try harder\" and lose weight. \n\nI've cut my eating in half- even moreso. I don't eat after 10pm (my husband gets off work at 10pm, so I can't eat sooner) I cut all sweets and don't drink any sugar. My doctor doesn't believe me. She suggested getting the belly band, but only if I \"try harder\".\n\nToday I ate grapes for breakfast, 2 slices of pizza for lunch, and carrots and lite ranch for a snack. My sugar is WAY HIGH... (Typical)\n\nI just don't know what to do. I'm so hungry, I have no energy, no self esteem... I was doing better when I was going to physical therapy and getting my spine injections, but haven't gone since the virus got worse (my community is anti science, anti mask. A lot of cases)  \n\nI'm sick of hating myself. I'm always afraid my husband is gonna fall in love with a pretty woman. \n\nWhat can I do? What helped you?",

For a lot of people (I'd wager everyone to some degree) eating too little in an attempt to eat healthy leads to extreme hunger and overeating or bingeing. \n\nI don't want to give you any advice, because I don't know you and I'm not a professional, and I think that's what you need. But just in case you can't, I would think you should try to focus on higher protein (and even fat), especially for breakfast. Grapes are pretty sugary I think, so is all fruit, so I wouldn't think it would be the best choice for a diabetic for breakfast...although even as a non-diabetic, I personally find fruit/carbs for breakfast leaves me hungry really soon and causes me distress for that reason.",

      "body": "I developed an eating disorder from scarcity in my childhood. When I had my own money and independence to go get my own food I quickly became absolutely obsessed with food. If I wasn\u2019t eating I was thinking of my next meal, watching cooking shows, looking at pictures of food online, reading about food. \nI would ping pong between binge eating and total starvation. I remember during binge eating periods in my life I just couldn\u2019t wrap my head around the idea that food had to come to an end, an entire share size bag of chocolates wasn\u2019t enough I was genuinely distressed at the idea that I would eventually eat them all and there would be none left. I\u2019d eat until I physically couldn\u2019t move, my skin would hurt from being stretched so far, I thought on occasions I had done serious internal damage. I would go through periods of starvation not so much for weight reasons but primarily because I find the feeling of a totally empty stomach extremely comforting I guess it reminds me of a simpler time. \n\nThe only way I could get this to stop was to lean into the idea that there is ALWAYS going to be more if I want it, always. So I had to ditch dieting or any notion that I would curb my binge eating. My binge eating came from a fear of food scarcity so it was never going to go away if I kept imposing food scarcity as a solution. I had to resolve with myself that I was going to let it play out until I finally realised that food wasn\u2019t going away again, if I don\u2019t eat enough now and I\u2019m hungry later I can get more. It\u2019s a slow process but I\u2019m about 6 years into recovery and I haven\u2019t had an episode of binge eating in 5 years. I can\u2019t even get myself into the frame of mind I was in at that time anymore. I distinctly remember I couldn\u2019t keep peanut butter in the house because again I couldn\u2019t accept that I wasn\u2019t allowed to use an entire jar at one time. Which now feels bizarre, I use as much as I want and that\u2019s like one tablespoon, but my brain was wired to stockpile and take as much as I could for fear there wouldn\u2019t be enough food later. \n\nIn short you cannot remedy an issue that came from being deprived of food by depriving yourself again. I really recommend resolving to square this away mentally, I\u2019ve had an incredibly free 5 years and I can now maintain my healthy weight without a thought",

Someone who is diabetic should be focusing on eating foods low on the glycemic index if they need to watch their blood glucose. Typically thats picking carbohydrates that have a good Fibre content. \n\nI 100% agree about seeing a professional, though. Healing the relationship with food is so hard and the right professional will be able to guide through that process!",

Also if you're able to I would suggest seeing a nutritionist (don't go to a dietitian, they have no formal education so the advice they give is varied). \n\nYou're strong and you can get through this you just need the help of professionals who have dealt with this before so you don't damage your health (physical and mental) any more than it already is.",
