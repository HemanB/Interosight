  "title": "Broke up with my anorexic gf",
  "selftext": "So as the title says, I broke up with my girlfriend (31) of 3 years. She told me that she suffers from eating disorders about a year into our relationship, but that she is fine now. She actually was hospitalized because of it in her teen years. We moved in together after a year or so. I must confess that I didn't take her condition seriously at first and she said she was fine now so I guessed she's cured. Several months have passed with us living together and I had to go on a restrictive diet because of my health. I wasn't overweight but had some other medical reasons for which was suggested to me to try this diet. Little did I know this triggered her disorder in a major way. When I said I'm skipping breakfast one day because we didn't have anything that I could eat, she exploded and told me \"how could you say this to me?\". I was left in awe because, in my mind, I wasn't doing anything to her. That's when she started to not eat and loose weight. When I came off of my diet, things got better again and we didn't talk about it anymore. Fast forward another year, she was triggered again by some problems in our relationship that had nothing to do with food but with her insecurities and jealousy (which was totally unfounded). This time she didn't tell me anything, just started to loose weight. She lost a lot of weight and everyone was telling her how skinny she's looking. I was telling her that she's too skinny and should eat more, but her response was always \"I'm not hungry\". ..\n\nShe and I both like parties and hanging out with friends which usually involves alcohol. Because now she was not eating enough, alcohol would really kick in faster and harder and she would get into these awfully destructive states. She would either cry or take it out on me calling me names, that I'm in love with somebody else, that I'm boring and she doesn't want to hang out with me and stuff like that... She was unrecognizable to me. Every time, the next morning, she would apologize and say that she doesn't know why she said all those things and that she loves me and wants only me for the rest of her life... Our relationship was pretty good (the best I had so far) when she was sober, but every now and then, she would get drunk and have these dramas that I didn't understand and quite frankly was getting tired of... These dramas became more frequent and I started to loose interest in her and spending my life with someone who tortures me like that was beginning to scare me. On the last incident, she not only insulted me, but threw stuff at me at a party in front of other people. I ended it that night. Of course, when she got sober, she said she didn't mean it and that she has a problem and would seek help again (she already went to therapy, but left because she was not satisfied with the therapist). When I mentioned that she should stop drinking all together, she said \"That won't happen....\". So I decided to leave which crushed her emotionally... It was really hard for me too (and still is) because I still care about her and see how good of a person she could be, but I couldn't stay and watch her taking it all out on me and basically saying \"This is the way it's going to be and I won't do anything about it. If you love me, you'll stand by me...\"\n\nAfter I moved out, I spoke to a friend of my now ex and said that she has a problem with eating disorder and alcohol and I asked her to wash out for her. I kind of doubt anything has changed because she's been going out until dawn every weekend since we've broke up. I'm suspecting that a lot of alcohol is involved. So I'm worried she went on a self destructive path rather than the opposite way...\n\nIt's hard to even imagine what she is going through. Eating disorders are a completely unknown to me. So can anyone explain to me what is it about eating disorder and alcohol abuse? Is it possible that she literally transforms herself to a completely different person?\n\nWhat I'm questioning myself is \"does she really mean all that stuff she's saying drunk or is it some sort of combination of her mental problems and alcohol?\"\n\nAlso can you suggest a book that would help me to better understand the mind of a person with an eating disorder?\n\nThank you",

I don\u2019t speak for everyone with an eating disorder, but I have found that my irritability gets unmanageable the less I eat. I\u2019m currently struggling pretty bad again, and it feels like my brain isn\u2019t working properly. You kind of feel in a haze, food is fuel ykno. And when it\u2019s mixed with drinking?? Ooh boy. I\u2019ve found it\u2019s better I do not drink, because it\u2019s a fine line between a fun time & getting myself in negatively life changing situations. \nUnfortunately, the best thing you did for yourself (& probably her) was putting up that boundary. It\u2019s not fair to you, not many people deserve violence of any type towards them. But again, to answer your question, I would lean on the \u201cit\u2019s a mix of alcohol l & mental illness\u201d side of things. But, if she\u2019s not choosing to get help, that\u2019s on her. The best thing you can do to her, is tell her how her actions not only effect you, but effect her. Let her know you care, but you can\u2019t watch her kill herself (because when you are starving yourself and abusing substances, that is what you are doing). Remind her of who she was before all of this. It\u2019s a nightmare of an illness, but I think human connection & someone helping fight the voices in our brains, is so important.",

I actually went through something similar, with me being the aggressor. \n\ni met someone a couple months ago and we were goin steady for a decent amount of time. I dealt with my eating disorder behind closed doors, because the shame, guilt, and anxiety were too strong to let him in on what i was struggling with. if i wasn\u2019t dealing with my eating disorder, i was drowning my heart in alcohol to ease the shame and strong emotions. and for awhile i called myself \u201chealed\u201d, but really i just band-aided the ed with alcoholism.\n\nhe got the worst side of me that has ever existed. i berated him and drunkenly told him that i was using him to fill a void\u2026 really not proud of it. there was one time i was blacked out while he tried getting me out of the car, and i quite literally told him i hated him and went down a list of reasons why he was \u201chateable\u201d. bless his heart, he swallowed his pride and took me to bed. thankfully he had a good head on those shoulders and left me. \n\nNow that i\u2019ve sought out help and reflected, it had nothing to do with him and everything to do with me. I was so incredibly insecure, sad, and overall in a self destructive cycle. it was nothing personal against him, he was a great man who unfortunately met me at a weird time in my life. \n\ni think you 100% did the right thing, and it isn\u2019t wrong to still care for her. i will say, eating disorders on top of alcoholism is VERY detrimental to heart health, and i hope that she finds it in herself to be \u201csick and tired\u201d of being sick and tired. it\u2019s not your responsibility to ensure she\u2019s safe and getting help, but it\u2019s not wrong to be concerned. i wish nothing but the best for the both of you.",

Should I have stayed and try to help her? Be her support no matter how ugly it gets? Although she's addressing the ED problem and is seeking help, her not seeing the alcohol problem is something I can't help her with. She doesn't see that at all and I feel like she has to come to a point where she figures this one out by herself. What pains me is when she does eventually figure it out, I won't be there anymore. I'm slowly healing from all of this and trying to move on...\n\nWhat frightens me is the health problems you guys mentioned. Long term ones. She has hormonal issues because of it and she has heart issues which I didn't connect with this, but one of you mentioned them... Might be that those problems are from ED too. I really hope she's going to be better because she's an amazing person and I feel like she doesn't deserve this, but life's not fair, right?\n\nI will check out the books you mentioned. Thank you...\n\nAlso, I wish all of you that you heal from this horrible disease. I can see from your answers and from my experience with my ex that people who are suffering from this are very intelligent (I actually read this somewhere and it's true), self aware and empathic which are great, if not the best, values a person can have. Hope you all reach the point where you can reveal that to the people around you\u2026",

      "body": "I can only speak for myself:\n\nMy ED has nothing to do with food. Its just what my body ended up going to in order to cope with bullying when i was a kid and even tho i am not considered anorexic anymore (im at a healthy weight for my age and height) i still struggle a lot with it. I may look like i dont have ED but in my mind, i constantly struggle with it. I always feel like i am really fat. And its honestly a coping strategy for things that i cant control. I can control how much i eat and how much i weigh. Also, its like a form of self harm in that i can starve myself and control the pain and intensity of pain that i can feel instead of dealing with pain that i cant control. \n\nAgain, only speaking from my personal perspective: You going on a diet was triggering for her because she was probably going to eat breakfast and since you were skipping breakfast, it was in her mind as if you were telling her that she was fat or something. Like, you dont have to eat and can skip a meal but she cant. I dont know if that makes sense. And her reaction was lashing out because she struggles with that on a personal level. \n\nAnd she probably had a hard time connecting with you because ED is something that you just dont understand and its something she probably struggles with every day. \n\nI would also say that she probably hates herself tbh. Im again speaking from personal experience so this might only apply to me but my ED is connected to the way i see myself. Even though i still struggle with it, it was significantly worse when i hated myself and had a perfectionistic mindset. Now that i am beginning to accept myself as i am, i dont struggle with it like i used to. It doesnt control me anymore. The fact that she would lash out to you and then later say you were the lohl tells me that she is probably scared of being vulnerable with you. She probably really wanted to be with you and still does but was afraid at the same time. So she was sending mixed signals. It sounds like she has a lot of work to do on herself before she gets in another serious relationship. \n\nHaving said all that, its good that you broke it off because her behaviour was getting out of hand. But also, why are you just now trying to understand her ED instead of trying to understand sooner?",

I\u2019m very lucky I don\u2019t carry the addiction gene.

I am currently in recovering and in therapy for it and things still really trigger me. People who you eat with regularly become some sort of comfort at least for me. If I was her and my partner was going on a diet even for health reasons so be open about it would really make it super hard for me not to be affected. And if I was left alone with those emotions while my partner is on an open diet I would most def release. An ed is a mental illness, buts it\u2019s something you can control. That\u2019s the main reason it really difficult to ever get over it. If something is out of control your brain will say \u201cyou can always starve yourself it\u2019s something you can control\u201d so the first aspect that my therapist told me that pretty much every person suffering from an ed has is a control issue. And it\u2019s not about wanting to be in control of everything, it\u2019s more like this is the only thing I can rely on, a comfort. Even if it might not seem that way to you. As for the alcohol issues I have know some people with an ed that use alcohol as a way to loose weight and suppress the voices. And it fuels anxiety and insecurities. It\u2019s a bully in your head that never shuts up. But a bully that\u2019s always there and will manipulate you into thinking things and doing things.",

      "body": "Eating disorders (from someone who has one) are really mean and nasty to endure. They completely fuck with your mental state because it's not just attacking you mentally but also physically and then put you in denial that it's the lack of food. You get used to being hungry and not feeling well all the time and try to cope. When you've restricted so much to lose weight, even eating in the beginning feels worse.\n\nI did not know I had a disorder until about 3 years ago, I had it majority of my life and thought I just was depressed and anxious. When I started recovery it was so hard and so much anger and frustration came out of me. I wanted to find any solution that didn't involve eating, anything to make myself FEEL better. anything but food because at that point I was convinced i hated food, hated eating, it didn't feel good and was pretty much the worst. I hated that I needed it.\n\nIt really snowballs when it's triggered, and it takes effort sometimes to walk that back and eat when you know you need to. Your brain functions less without proper nutrition, which makes it easy to go back to the old ways of thinking, like, oh I don't really need this, food isn't going to help, I don't feel good enough to eat, or whatever those thoughts are. For each person I think it's the challenge to have strategies to identify and combat the ED thoughts that come up. Even now I wouldn't say I'm \"cured\" though i feel good about my current status. I don't think most mental disorders ever really go away, it's just something you have to learn to live with and come up with strategies to manage.\n\nI'm really sorry for what you've gone through with your wife. It sounds really painful and it's clear you care about her a lot. I hope this can help with some of the context.\n\nI listened to a podcast called \"recovery talk\" to help me understand what was going on in my brain and feel some support about the process of recovery.

Imagine wanting to sit still and being absolutely jittery. It's an aggravatingly frustrating battle with themselves, and nothing they do will resolve it. It's a disorder because they keep thinking, \"I can do it. I am completely in control,\" while watching it slip through their fingers. They also don't want you to know because they think they can control it. So as when any person does when they are frustrated and lose control, they lash out. To anyone and everyone. You just happened to be the safest and closest lighting rod.\n\nI'm no one and nobody, and so you and everyone else can take what I say as complete bunk.

ED NEVER go away. I might not be purging this year, but I definitely restrict. But not enough to \u201clook anorexic\u201d. So to everyone else, I look \u201cfine\u201d. When in fact, my mind is just as unhealthy if not more as it was years ago when I was severely underweight. And yes, some of us might heal ourselves and never binge, purge or restrict ever again, BUT, in my opinion, it truly never leaves our minds. To me, \u201cit\u201dpretty much calls the shots. \u201cIt\u201d decides how I will feel today. How I will look today. It fucking SUCKS. ED SUCK. I wouldn\u2019t wish this on anyone.  \n\nIn regards to people having relationships with us, I guess that all depends on how much you can handle and how much you are willing to take on. Most people will run. Most people will run extremely far away. There are those few that stick around out of love for the person, but it takes a strong heart and a strong mind to be with us let alone live with us. So that is the question that you need to ask yourself. How much do you love her and how much are you willing to take on? As the above poster said though, boundaries are extremely important as well. I wish you all the best and I hope that your ex recovers and becomes the best version of herself.",

I haven\u2019t been in this position in my relationship, but as a social worker I have worked with inpatient ED clients (with addiction and without) as well as with addiction and mental health in other capacities. I also have a friend with very similar behaviour to your ex. \n\nYou could spend the rest of your life trying to help (save) her, but it will never be you to do that. It has to be her. Until she decides she wants help, no one else can make someone change. I\u2019m sure you feel guilty, like you could have done more, etc. but please know that no matter what you did or didn\u2019t do, it likely wouldn\u2019t have made a difference (I mean this in the nicest way). \nPersonally, I don\u2019t see this as alcoholism, but definitely problematic drinking, likely caused by the same emotional issues as her ED- depression, self hatred, guilt, anxiety, trauma, avoidance, you name it\u2026.\n\nI have a friend who is 28 but has had an ED since 13. Been to inpatient, outpatient, etc etc. She\u2019s doing all the stuff to help, but it isn\u2019t \u201ccured\u201d. She still struggles with it every day and has lapses. She was at my house recently and we were drinking wine, and she ended up on the floor in a ball crying about how she thinks I don\u2019t like her, how much she hates herself, etc. She has recently realized that she gets completely out of control when she drinks, usually as a result of not eating, but also drinks more than she \u201cshould\u201d and as much as someone who is a healthy weight (for example will drink as much as me who is 5\u20195 and 135 lbs.) She always cries when she drinks and regrets everything she does and says, and then spirals into more self hatred. She hasn\u2019t stopped drinking but the last few months has reduced the amount she drinks and is more mindful. This isn\u2019t always the case though. \nI also believe eating disorders are the hardest to recover from (if you think about it in the same lens as addiction). All are maladaptive coping strategies but if you are recovering from a substance use disorder, you can avoid people, places, and things that trigger you. \nFor EDs, food is your \u201cdrug of choice\u201d but you CANT avoid it. It is the thing that sustains life. It\u2019s like telling an alcoholic who wants to remain sober that he has to have 3 drinks a day but no more or less. Or putting fentanyl in front of someone in recovery from opiate use disorder every day and expecting them to remain sober (possible but makes it extraordinary difficult) That\u2019s simply not the way recovery works. \n\nIf you want book reccos, DM and we can discuss further. I\u2019ve read so many but want to know more about what type you\u2019re looking for. \n\nI apologize for the rant and I hope it makes sense. I could talk about this for hours but we will never understand unless we have Ben there ourselves. \nAddiction and EDs are so complex and heartbreaking. I feel for you and everyone suffering from this. Hopefully one day your ex will get the help she needs to live a happy and healthy life.",

Although she's addressing the ED problem and is seeking help, her not seeing the alcohol problem is something I can't help her with. She doesn't see that at all and I feel like she has to come to a point where she figures this one out by herself. What pains me is when she does eventually figure it out, I won't be there anymore. I'm slowly healing from all of this and trying to move on...\n\nWhat frightens me is the health problems you guys mentioned. Long term ones. She has hormonal issues because of it and she has heart issues which I didn't connect with this, but one of you mentioned them... Might be that those problems are from ED too. I really hope she's going to be better because she's an amazing person and I feel like she doesn't deserve this, but life's not fair, right?\n\nI will check out the books you mentioned. Thank you...\n\nAlso, I wish all of you that you heal from this horrible disease. I can see from your answers and from my experience with my ex that people who are suffering from this are very intelligent (I actually read this somewhere and it's true), self aware and empathic which are great, if not the best, values a person can have.

I listen to hella eating disorder podcasts (easy to find on Apple Podcasts) and try to trick myself into eating sometimes.

Its just what my body ended up going to in order to cope with bullying when i was a kid and even tho i am not considered anorexic anymore (im at a healthy weight for my age and height) i still struggle a lot with it. I may look like i dont have ED but in my mind, i constantly struggle with it. I always feel like i am really fat. And its honestly a coping strategy for things that i cant control. I can control how much i eat and how much i weigh. Also, its like a form of self harm in that i can starve myself and control the pain and intensity of pain that i can feel instead of dealing with pain that i cant control. \n\nAgain, only speaking from my personal perspective: You going on a diet was triggering for her because she was probably going to eat breakfast and since you were skipping breakfast, it was in her mind as if you were telling her that she was fat or something. Like, you dont have to eat and can skip a meal but she cant. I dont know if that makes sense. And her reaction was lashing out because she struggles with that on a personal level. \n\nAnd she probably had a hard time connecting with you because ED is something that you just dont understand and its something she probably struggles with every day. \n\nI would also say that she probably hates herself tbh. Im again speaking from personal experience so this might only apply to me but my ED is connected to the way i see myself. Even though i still struggle with it, it was significantly worse when i hated myself and had a perfectionistic mindset. Now that i am beginning to accept myself as i am, i dont struggle with it like i used to. It doesnt control me anymore. The fact that she would lash out to you and then later say you were the lohl tells me that she is probably scared of being vulnerable with you. She probably really wanted to be with you and still does but was afraid at the same time. So she was sending mixed signals. It sounds like she has a lot of work to do on herself before she gets in another serious relationship. \n\nHaving said all that, its good that you broke it off because her behaviour was getting out of hand.

If I was her and my partner was going on a diet even for health reasons so be open about it would really make it super hard for me not to be affected. And if I was left alone with those emotions while my partner is on an open diet I would most def release. An ed is a mental illness, buts it\u2019s something you can control. That\u2019s the main reason it really difficult to ever get over it. If something is out of control your brain will say \u201cyou can always starve yourself it\u2019s something you can control\u201d so the first aspect that my therapist told me that pretty much every person suffering from an ed has is a control issue. And it\u2019s not about wanting to be in control of everything, it\u2019s more like this is the only thing I can rely on, a comfort. Even if it might not seem that way to you. As for the alcohol issues I have know some people with an ed that use alcohol as a way to loose weight and suppress the voices. And it fuels anxiety and insecurities.

It's a disorder because they keep thinking, \"I can do it. I am completely in control,\" while watching it slip through their fingers. They also don't want you to know because they think they can control it. So as when any person does when they are frustrated and lose control, they lash out. To anyone and everyone. You just happened to be the safest and closest lighting rod.\n\nI'm no one and nobody, and so you and everyone else can take what I say as complete bunk. However, what I do want you to know is that this was NOT about you. None of it is about you. Her problems are her problems, and you can only help people who WANT to be helped. You can't pull someone up who is constantly letting go.\n\nYou should also check in with a therapist yourself. Being with someone with ED is not easy and will definitely take its toll on you.",

She doesn't see that at all and I feel like she has to come to a point where she figures this one out by herself. What pains me is when she does eventually figure it out, I won't be there anymore.

I haven\u2019t been in this position in my relationship, but as a social worker I have worked with inpatient ED clients (with addiction and without) as well as with addiction and mental health in other capacities. I also have a friend with very similar behaviour to your ex. \n\nYou could spend the rest of your life trying to help (save) her, but it will never be you to do that. It has to be her. Until she decides she wants help, no one else can make someone change. I\u2019m sure you feel guilty, like you could have done more, etc. but please know that no matter what you did or didn\u2019t do, it likely wouldn\u2019t have made a difference (I mean this in the nicest way). \nPersonally, I don\u2019t see this as alcoholism, but definitely problematic drinking, likely caused by the same emotional issues as her ED- depression, self hatred, guilt, anxiety, trauma, avoidance, you name it\u2026.\n\nI have a friend who is 28 but has had an ED since 13. Been to inpatient, outpatient, etc etc. She\u2019s doing all the stuff to help, but it isn\u2019t \u201ccured\u201d. She still struggles with it every day and has lapses. She was at my house recently and we were drinking wine, and she ended up on the floor in a ball crying about how she thinks I don\u2019t like her, how much she hates herself, etc. She has recently realized that she gets completely out of control when she drinks, usually as a result of not eating, but also drinks more than she \u201cshould\u201d and as much as someone who is a healthy weight (for example will drink as much as me who is 5\u20195 and 135 lbs.) She always cries when she drinks and regrets everything she does and says, and then spirals into more self hatred. She hasn\u2019t stopped drinking but the last few months has reduced the amount she drinks and is more mindful. This isn\u2019t always the case though. \nI also believe eating disorders are the hardest to recover from (if you think about it in the same lens as addiction). All are maladaptive coping strategies but if you are recovering from a substance use disorder, you can avoid people, places, and things that trigger you. \nFor EDs, food is your \u201cdrug of choice\u201d but you CANT avoid it. It is the thing that sustains life. It\u2019s like telling an alcoholic who wants to remain sober that he has to have 3 drinks a day but no more or less. Or putting fentanyl in front of someone in recovery from opiate use disorder every day and expecting them to remain sober (possible but makes it extraordinary difficult) That\u2019s simply not the way recovery works. \n\nIf you want book reccos, DM and we can discuss further. I\u2019ve read so many but want to know more about what type you\u2019re looking for. \n\nI apologize for the rant and I hope it makes sense. I could talk about this for hours but we will never understand unless we have Ben there ourselves. \nAddiction and EDs are so complex and heartbreaking. I feel for you and everyone suffering from this. Hopefully one day your ex will get the help she needs to live a happy and healthy life.",

If I was her and my partner was going on a diet even for health reasons so be open about it would really make it super hard for me not to be affected. And if I was left alone with those emotions while my partner is on an open diet I would most def release. An ed is a mental illness, buts it\u2019s something you can control. That\u2019s the main reason it really difficult to ever get over it. If something is out of control your brain will say \u201cyou can always starve yourself it\u2019s something you can control\u201d so the first aspect that my therapist told me that pretty much every person suffering from an ed has is a control issue. And it\u2019s not about wanting to be in control of everything, it\u2019s more like this is the only thing I can rely on, a comfort. Even if it might not seem that way to you. As for the alcohol issues I have know some people with an ed that use alcohol as a way to loose weight and suppress the voices. And it fuels anxiety and insecurities. It\u2019s a bully in your head that never shuts up. But a bully that\u2019s always there and will manipulate you into thinking things and doing things.",

So just asking is a great thing even if you aren\u2019t together anymore. But think of something that has always been a constant in your life. Maybe a game, club, family time, maybe you always have a dessert after dinner or you need to watch something before bed. Then think about if you rely on it, do you rely on it to be happy, to fulfill a requirement, maybe it\u2019s just a tradition. And replace that with something harmful something that hurts you. But you rely on it, if you dont have it anymore things will get really bad in your head. So the control is a little related to ocd, it\u2019s not a type of ocd but it\u2019s the same compulsive issue. I recommend watching the \u201cto the bone\u201d movie. It might still be in Netflix, if you still want to do your best to understand eating disorders and how they hurt and control people. Even if you aren\u2019t together anymore or don\u2019t plan on getting back together, I think this is a good start to grow as a person. Because we all need to try to understand each other, even if it doesn\u2019t outrightly affect us.",

Tell her that she will get arthritis, that her bones will break, that she won\u2019t be able to have kids, that she\u2019ll have severe long term heart and other medical issues.\n\nTell her that she is beautiful but her body is dying and she should love and cherish it for everything it does.\n\nI definitely resonate with her situation. Subtly limit the partying as she is likely saving her calories for drinks and that\u2019s a hard habit to break. Encourage her to get a new therapist or join a support group.\n\nShe can get through this. Anything someone eats less than her, or mentions calories or weight, she will get triggered. Recovery is just a matter of understanding that food isn\u2019t the enemy, it\u2019s the disorder that is.",

      "body": "Usually it comes from people who need something to rely on, and it just never leaves. Even if you find someone later in life it\u2019s still there. Like PTsd. It really feeds on insecurities and anxiety. It also thrives in depression. But sometimes it\u2019s come from determination as well. It\u2019s really easy for it to start from wanting to loose weight so you just stop eating. Then at some point the euphoria comes and your brain releases the chemicals like seratonin. Most of the time eating disorders come because we want to improve ourselves. Then we realize this isn\u2019t good maybe I should stop, but it feels good why would I stop. Then you become dependent. So it\u2019s more than I need control straight forward, it\u2019s like an addiction. And for people who have addiction problems genetically it\u2019s really hard to stop and even if you heal u can always come back. Overall it\u2019s a mental illness that can start in many different ways. But it feeds off of any mental problem that might lie dormant or a problem you think you have under control. In my opinion it\u2019s a lot like OCD. Maybe you have watched the show MONK he had ocd, it\u2019s an exaggerated form for tv but it\u2019s shows the calm you get from the compulsive behavior. Eating disorders are compulsive behaviors.",
