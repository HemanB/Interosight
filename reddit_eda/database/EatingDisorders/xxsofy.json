  "title": "Hosting weekend with sister who is currently in out patient rehab for anorexia and need advice!",
  "selftext": "My sister is currently in a program where she is not allowed to prepare food, grocery shop, or know what the nutrition facts are for any meal she consumes. She eats 3x per day with a light snack. She also eats vegetarian. Her eating disorder developed from a restricted diet that turned into barely eating at all. My mom has made all of her meals in the last 4 weeks and she goes to intense therapy where they even bake or cook with a therapist and eat together. I need advice on some recipes that are super fast, and easy to throw together, that will be healthy for her because she is staying the weekend and I have to cook for her. Each meal needs one fat, one carb, and one protein. Nothing restricted. She is used to making gourmet vegetarian dishes, and when she started therapy, my mom took over preparing the same complex meals that are a lot of effort. I am worried that these meals I have found on google will take me longer than the time it says it takes and she will see me in the kitchen struggling and then get anxiety thinking, \u201cwhat is my sister cooking? How healthy is it?\u201d And just be triggered by me. I\u2019m a scatter brain, and it takes me at least 1 full hour to make a semi-easy dinner each night not including clean up, so I am not fast in the kitchen. \n\n**Please drop some links of your go to vegetarian meals that are FAST and tasty!!! Also, lmk what\u2019s triggering for you that I should avoid doing when she\u2019s around!!",

Adding in some prepackaged marinated tofu or vegetarian meat substitute gives some protein, and using sesame oil (or any other oil) while cooking adds a source of fat. The whole thing will take about 10 minutes if you use noodles, it's super fast.\n\nPasta with tomato sauce is really fast, for protein you could add vegetarian meatballs.\n\nFajitas are also really fast, you can buy premade fajita seasoning. Then just cook some peppers, onions and vegetarian chicken substitute with the seasoning and serve in wraps with cheese/sour cream/guac/salsa whatever you fancy. I usually make my own guac since it's quick and tasty, but shop bought would totally work and would add a source of fat.\n\nThese are my go to dinner in <15 minutes meals, even being scatter brained I think these would all come together in under half an hour.",

Then learn to mix liquid into your roux without it clumping up by adding liquid bit by bit until it's nice and creamy. If that liquid is milk, you have a bechamel. If that liquid is stock you have a brown sauce.\n\nIf you water down bechamel sauce and add vegetables you now have a \"cream of ...\" soup.\n\nIf you add cheese to bechamel you have a mornay sauce and a mornay sauce on macaroni noodles is mac and cheese.\n\nIf you thin a roux by slowly adding soup or stew to it until it is thin you can then pour that mixture back into the soup to thicken it and to make it more filling. You can also just start with the roux before adding the water.\n\nIf you just throw bechamel on pasta you have a meal.\n\nThe bechamel can be safely improvised upon. Any vegetables that need to be sauteed should be sauteed in the oil or butter before it is combined with flour to make the roux. Any other vegetables should be added to the bechamel after the milk is added. This way you can basically cook your entire meal, minus the noodles, in one pot. If you learn to prepare a mise en place while your pasta water is coming up to temperature you should be able to reliably bang together a pasta dish in 30-40 minutes.\n\nCongratulations, you now understand the basic theory behind 90% of vegetarian French cuisine.",
