That being said, she is still heavily convinced she is not thin enough and continues the routines and rituals and asks for reassurance of looking emaciated. Is it appropriate to answer her question? Is it actually helpful to tell her she looks emaciated? Or am I just adding fuel to an already roaring fire? ",

I am diagnosed with anorexia and it is by far the worst thing someone can go through. One of the main reasons I was able to start recovery is because I saw how it was affecting my loved ones - I was well on my way to dying, but I'm so glad I didn't.

We might soothe them if they say things that make no sense, and this is similar. I can't imagine saying 'oh yes, you are so very skinny', but just reminding her that she deserves to eat and is the thinnest she can possibly be.  When I received treatment, there is truth to the feeling of being told \"you MUST eat, you are desperately in need of food, there is simply no further you can go\".  The mind sees it as 'permission' to eat. If you leave any wiggle room, such as \"you did good today\" (if they eat a cracker, for example), then their brain will read that as \"you ate enough, in fact you ate too much. Scale back.\"\n\nYou have to overemphasize the need to eat, but also not seem shaming or as i they are causing you/others to be displeased. It's so tricky.",

Hospice means you are dying and are not going to live. They don't put you in hospice care unless they decide you are not going to get better. Nobody is stepping back and letting someone die. This is what happens when there's no way to help the person get better. If she's in hospice care, she likely isn't going to make it no matter what.",
