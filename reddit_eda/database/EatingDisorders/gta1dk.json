  "title": "Request: asian culture and eating disorders",
  "selftext": "here's my post request: \n\nhi everyone, seeking support. i'm asian american and i don't really see culturally-specific help for people who grew up with family dynamics like mine. also don't see as much representation in general. my asian parents don't know how to respond to the problem. they seem to want to help but whenever this topic gets brought up, they say something hurtful. i feel like i'm being too sensitive when it happens, but it feels bad enough that i just avoid the topic all together. it's also an Asian thing for relatives and family friends to greet you with a \"oh hello ____ you look so good! you lost weight!!\" or \"oh hello ____ you gained weight!! omg stop eating so much\" and then proceed to shovel your plate high with party food. additionally i don't have a habit of being emotionally honest with my parents so trying to explain my feelings feels massively embarrassing. these are 2 people who lived through the communist revolution in china, where the government was disappearing dissidents, sending off droves of young people into the countryside for useless \"reeducation,\" and food rationing/crop failures created a generation of underweight children. basically they've been through some shit and in light of all that, i feel like my problems ain't shit. but they're still problems because they're my problems. i have a hard time reconciling this generational/historical guilt and feeling like my problems are real. idk if anyone can relate, but give a shout out if you do.\n\nsort of related-- i found a related facebook group a few days ago for asians with eating disorders. it's pretty new but it's a start. basically a group for asians everywhere to vent and find support about their ED experience. i've just been lurking but a couple of posters have shared things that really hit me hard. hope this helps. https://www.facebook.com/groups/subtleasianeatingdisordersupport/",

When I came home from college, the first comments I always got were from my mom \u2014 \u201cyou got skinner\u201d or \u201cyou got fatter.\u201d After quarantining recently, I saw my grandpa for the first time in many months. His first words to me were \u201cdid you get fatter?\u201d I\u2019ve found it extremely difficult to open up to my mom about any emotional issues I may be going through. What has helped me the most is talking to my Asian-American friends. Even though not all of them suffer from EDs, many of them have had disordered eating due to our culture\u2019s opinions about how our bodies should look. You\u2019re not alone :)",

Piling large amounts of food on a plate is probably because they don't want you to starve. You can tell your parents to stop certain behaviors, if they are triggering to you -but I don't know what your dynamic with them is like.",

      "body": "I am not asian at all, a European male from Vienna, so I doubt that I will have to say much insightful here, but my first thought when I read this was: My broad idea about Asian cultures in general is that they tend to suppress emotions in general, a bit more than others maybe, which of course is a very fruitful starting point to develop an intense eating disorder, since eating disorders are almost always about dealing with some complex emotional issues, and suppressing, controlling those issues. Your personal description of family affairs do not seem to be that different from things I know from my own family or from friend's families, from the middle eastern spectrum, Muslim, or not, Afghan, Turk, whatever. So, maybe an open and honest conversation with your parents from time to time would help to dissolve much of the tension. That 's the obvious advice, but of course that is easier said than done, especially when things are as they usually are with your own parents, especially when you are a teenager or a young adolescent; complicated. Well, that 's my dribble of \"help\". Take care.",

Both my sister and I have had eating disorders (she has repaired her relationship with food whereas I\u2019m still struggling) and i had NO idea how prevalent it was in our community. I can ABSOLUTELY relate to the fact that relatives/family think it\u2019s totally ok to comment about me looking fatter or me losing weight and how I should always finish the food on my plate (also grew up in communist decade where everything was scarce). Also I\u2019ve been trying to lift weights and my mom constantly tells me I\u2019m gonna start looking ugly if I put in muscles and because I\u2019ll start to \u201clook bulkier.\u201d Which, is super discouraging/just her wanting me to look like the typical slender asian female. \n\nReally, really opened my eyes since you wrote this post. Thank you so much. I would join the Facebook page, but I\u2019m taking a break from all social media.",

      "body": "I am Asian American and well, let\u2019s just say that my particular culture has a lot of intergenerational trauma as well. I also struggle with thinking of my mental health issues including ED as legitimate. But all I can do is just try to accept the reality that I do have them and pain isn\u2019t a competition. Happiness isn\u2019t a competition so why should pain be too? Or something like that. I\u2019ve also been learning a bit about epigenetics and how things our ancestors experienced do get passed down and make us more susceptible to developing certain conditions. I mean, that\u2019s a massive simplification but it is kinda comforting in that maybe I\u2019m like this because I\u2019m carrying the stress from my past ancestors too in a way so it doesnt feel so much that I\u2019m personally just weak and stupid. It does kinda help me to be a bit more compassionate to myself. \n\nBut yeah, my parents know I have an ED but don\u2019t think it\u2019s a real thing because \u201cAmerican doctors don\u2019t understand our culture\u201d and keep saying things that try to encourage disordered behaviors. It has made me feel frustrated but also like I\u2019m the over sensitive problem but I\u2019ve come to accept I\u2019m still allowed to be upset about anything I want if it\u2019s an infringement of boundaries and my needs even if it\u2019s culturally normalized or whatever. So all I can do is just try to not take it personally and ignore what they say because I don\u2019t think I can change them and their attitudes towards food/weight. I basically just emotionally tap out in those situations.",

When you lose weight or get dangerously unhealthy, they either encourage it or feign concern with stuff like \"are you eating enough? eat more\" then talk about you behind your back about how you're not taking care of yourself.\n\nSomething that I've come to realized in the past few years that may be helpful to you and others reading this: relatives, even your parents, have no criteria for what is acceptably thin or plump.  When I was going through the roughest period of my life, I lost 6 kg and when my mother visited me after not seeing me for a few months she sent a picture of me to my father.  He commented that it was good I lost weight and she commented that she thought I had gained.  This was when I realized they have no metric for weight gain or health.  Don't let your family tell you you're not enough, your struggles are valid and as far as I'm concerned, relatives are strangers if they're not involved personally with you.",
