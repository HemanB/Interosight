  "selftext": "Today I took a step towards feeling good, I managed to eat a biscuit! and I also had lunch with my family, last night I came back from a party and I was a bit hungry, so I looked in the fridge to get some greek yogurt and apple but it was 2% instead of 0% fat, at first I almost had a a panic attack but then I managed to eat! Hurrah for me :) actually I'm feeling pretty anxious bc I think I ate too much but I have to fight this fear",

Don\u2019t beat yourself up because you couldn\u2019t eat at the party, you rewarded yourself entirely by going at your own pace and being able satiate yourself In whichever way was appropriate to you. Take this experience as a victory and way to remind yourself you can go to the social event, you can eat at the party or not eat if you feel so uncomfortable but you will eat at home. Eventuallly you\u2019ll eat the other things a little more easily but it takes time.",
