  "title": "Request: Need to lose weight, but every time I try I feel my disordered eating creeping up",
  "selftext": " \n\nI'm a 22 year old woman that's struggled with various kinds of disordered eating over the years, and I'm trying to find the best way for me to lose weight.\n\nI am obese. My doctors always really want me to lose weight, and I would like to as well. My problem is that every time I try, I feel my disordered eating creeping up.\n\nI've been overweight since I was pretty young, and due to my parents pushing, weight has always been a focus of mine. Up until the past couple years I went through cycles of binging and purging with periods of excessive restriction and excessive binging in between.\n\nWhen I try to use pretty stands methods, like just simply counting calories, I impulsively try to push the number lower, or get distressed and binge if I go over it.\n\nWhile I've been relatively stable for a while, attempts at weight loss tend to throw me off and make me start a spiral, so I'm not sure where to begin. Therapy is not an option because of how much the co-pay is (and in my experience, therapy doesn't work too well for me. Since I'm undeniably overweight, my concern with weight loss tends to go overlooked).\n\nAny suggestions? Books, websites, guides?\n\nThanks",

      "body": "Hi!\n\nI'm really sorry you're struggling. I've also been (and sometimes still am) struggling with my relationship with food.\n\nWhen I diet I have a crazy urge to binge as if it's my last meal ever. And sometimes I also binge (food is just too damn comforting).\n\nThe issue here isn't the weighloss per se, but rather your relationship with food and your coping mechanisms. \n\nI wouldn't look into dieting for weight loss right now, but rather to create better habits. Weight loss will come later, that is just setting some long term goals.\n\nTherapy would be ideal, but there as other things you can do until you can properly speak to a therapist. \n\nI know it sound corny, but try meditation, low impact yoga, going for waks, dancing in your pyjamas while singing into your brush/microphone. Try experimenting with ways of being active and ways of de-stressing that don't include food. See what's easier and what gives you joy.\n\nAnd of course, manage expectations. It's a long term commitment that pays off every milestone you reach. Set small goals to start with. If you're thinking walking a mile even though you're mostly sedentary,  try for smaller goals. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. \n\nYou need to take baby steps so you don't trigger those anxious reactions that lead to binging.\n\nBut if you slip a bit, don't beat yourself up! We all have bad days and you are allowed to have one. But don't abandon altogether, that is the most important part. \n\nGood luck OP. We are rooting for you \u2764",

I couldnt calorie count becuase it would send me into a spiral or talk about how many calories are in a food item ir meal. What I did instead was focus on how I approached food. When I cooked a meal actually measure out the true serving size. Its insane to see the difference in what I thought was a half cup to what a true half cup is.\n\nI also ate while I wasnt distracted. So rather than make a plate of food and plop down in front of the TV, I sat at the table and ate. It let me focus on what I was eating instead of mindlessly eating and I would feel quite satisfied after my meal that I wouldnt go back for seconds or thirds.\n\nThis really helped me.",

I prefer them in audio format such as podcasts etc - you can find free podcasts online. \n\nI also find with myself that counting calories doesnt work for me. Its a trigger. Therefore I try to measure food by how it looks on the plate. You can find images on sites like pinterest that show portion sizes based on the size of your fist etc. \n\nI also like to integrate yoga or pilates into my daily routine. You tube 30 days of yoga. Its free if you already have a mat and is a wonderful chance to get 30 mins to reconnect with your body and mind. \n\nHope this helps but please let us know how you get on and what works for you :)",

Knowing I\u2019m not the only one who needs balance recovery with weight loss (for health reasons) is such a relief. \n\nIntuitive eating may work for you. I tried it, but due to the pressing health concerns of my weight, I felt it was too little structure. Honestly, I couldn\u2019t afford to gain any extra weight. I also tried calorie counting but found that would trigger me and my obsessive thoughts. Currently my approach is to eat balanced meals (protein, veggie/fruit, carb, and a healthy fat) and exercise I enjoy like walking the dog or even dancing to my music. I\u2019m hoping that taking a holistic approach to health will eventually result in shedding some pounds.

As soon as I started I told my therapist I wanted to build a relationship with food and exercise based on health and not body image and just completely detach myself from the idea that weight loss was something I wanted to achieve a beauty standard, because it would always make me go back to my ED. I think through both therapy if that\u2019s something that\u2019s available to you and meditation, and just distancing yourself from the thought of your body when it comes to the reason why you want to lose weight you should be able to start being healthier without letting your ED take over. I hope this helps in any way.
