  "selftext": "That\u2019s basically it. \nEvery ad, book, video, commercial, on cars, on billboards, at the grocery store. The rampant, insanely deluded and unethical use of ozempic. Buccal fat removal. \u201cSkinny legend\u201d. Heroin chic is back.  I\u2019m trying so desperately to GAIN weight. I\u2019m trying to heal the distorted view of my body and weight in my head only to go out into the world and see what I DONT need to hear or see plastered everywhere. I download an app to track my eating and the options it gave me were are you trying to a) maintain weight or b) lose weight. Where was the option to gain weight?? I was only able to add the \u201cgain weight\u201d option to my profile after going into my account settings, it wasn\u2019t an option when I first signed up. I thought that was so weird! Everything is about suppressing your appetite, low cal, etc. Trying to research food and nutrition options for a person who struggles with even having an appetite and consuming more calories felt like I was doing NASA research. Everyone has their own journey and needs!\nIf anyone has some tips on inciting a healthier appetite I would really really appreciate it. Bought myself some owyn protein shakes for the morning and they\u2019re starting to help but I still struggle with solid foods for the first 3/4 of the day.",
