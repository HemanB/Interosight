  "selftext": "i\u2019ve struggled with anorexia for years and i was doing better for a while but recently relapsed. my boyfriend is aware of everything going on and has been incredibly supportive. his family invited me for dinner tomorrow for the first time and i\u2019m very anxious about it.  my mind has been plagued with all of these concerns since they invited me. \u201cwhat if i get too anxious about eating and i don\u2019t talk enough and they think i\u2019m stuck up ?\u201d \u201cwhat if they get offended when i don\u2019t eat a lot of their food ?\u201d the countless what-ifs are killing me. i want to be able to get through this one night as smooth as possible and i don\u2019t know how. does anyone have any advice on how to get through this ?",

      "body": "I would suggest asking your BF to talk to his family.  If that\u2019s something you feel comfortable with. An ED is nothing to be ashamed of. Perhaps ask your BF to find out what will be served so you are prepared and not surprised by what\u2019s served and then you can plan a way to manage your worries in advance if giving them a heads up isnt something you feel comfortable with. My BF is great with mine and when we are in social situations involving food and knows how to help me and can spot when I\u2019m getting stressed out.",

      "body": "Have you talked to him about your anxiety regarding this dinner? I would let him know all your concerns/thoughts/hesitations with it and that might give you a clear mind going into it. He knows his parents and if they\u2019re good people they\u2019ll be understanding and empathetic (most people actually are). I think for their sake he should 100% mention that you\u2019re recovering from an ED, so they don\u2019t think they\u2019re feeding into a destructive, harmful pattern but understand if maybe don\u2019t finish everything on your plate.\n\nThis all of course depends on how comfortable YOU feel about it, if it\u2019s too much pressure, too soon consider alternatives like watching a movie together after dinner or something. I do think it could be a very healthy step though to confront your anxiety as long as it\u2019s in a welcoming, friendly setting.",

U can still feel comfortable with how big ur portions are without feeling like ur offending his parents. \nIf this is not possible definitely talk to ur bf and tell him ur concerns, if he is as understanding and supportive he will be able to come up with solutions with u and a game plan to make u feel more comfortable. It always helps to have someone in ur corner during uncomfortable situations.",

      "body": "I totally get this, OP. If you are in a relapse, remember not to be down on yourself, first of all. It's not linear (recovery) and these \"hills\" are what make recovery so valuable in the end. You will overcome this.\n\nCan you reframe it as a challenge to your ED? As maybe a chance to show yourself that nothing - not one bad thing - will happen if you eat the meal?  It's one meal, so thankfully you aren't asked to live there and join them at every meal! :-)  \n\nImagine how proud you could be of yourself once this is over; you would have this experience to show that you defied that stupid, hideous voice that tries to talk you out of life.  \n\nWhatever happens: Your SO will still love you, your SO's parents WILL understand. I truly have the feeling they will. If you are kind, that is what matters. If they judge you for your eating, then that says a lot about them, and I seriously doubt they will do that. <3",

I would definitely ask him to tell his parents that you\u2019re struggling (don\u2019t have to say \u201chey she\u2019s anorexic so she\u2019s not gonna want to eat\u201d) right now and feeling overwhelmed so don\u2019t be offended if you are quiet and not devouring food,\n\nI\u2019ve never had ED conversation with my bf because it makes me super anxious and I\u2019ve been lucky to have been in recovery since we met. Eating in front of his family is exceedingly stressful. I get so scared and stressed over comments that may come because I eat little food that must = lower body weight. I just don\u2019t want to hear comments on my body, but I\u2019ve found that parent-age people are more likely to do so. I\u2019m glad your bf will be there to be your ally and that you\u2019ve already made progress just by reaching out to talk about how you feel to this community.",

It all depends on whether or not you feel comfortable enough in your recovery to handle this situation. If you aren\u2019t it could trigger additional restriction over the coming days as you wrestle with guilt and shame related to the event. At some point you are going to have to practice public eating but this may not be the time. You could be open with your struggle or not but it might be better if you can suggest a time to spend with his family that doesn\u2019t involve food. Maybe afternoon or after dinner walk at the park or games?",
