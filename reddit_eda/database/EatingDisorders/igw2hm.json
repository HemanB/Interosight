  "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nI\u2019ve been feeling the struggle lately and I just wanted to let it out. I\u2019ve struggled with EDNOS for most of my life and it comes in waves. Right now I\u2019m not restricting or purging or self harming or food avoidance, but I think about doing those things a lot lately. I\u2019ve just been feeling really down and I don\u2019t know why. I just feel like I look at my body and I hate everything I see. My legs look too fat. My stomach is too fat and my hips are too big.\n\nWhat do you all do when you start feeling really, really down?",

So for me, I picked up skating recently, and it's a great way to engage my body that feels good. I also really like sewing and baking. And the physical end product of any creativity related task can be really rewarding and validating.",

Be proud of yourself that you've been able to have the thoughts but hasn't let them take action. That doesn't mean it isn't hard, it's hard af. But take a moment and pat yourself on the back for being honest about where you're at and the work you've put in to not start doing bad habits even though you've had the thoughts!!",
