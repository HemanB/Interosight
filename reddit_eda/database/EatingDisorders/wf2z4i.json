  "title": "Suspecting my sister has an ed",
  "selftext": "My sister is turning 14 this year and I\u2019m quite worried for her and im unsure what the correct way to approach this situation is. We\u2019ve always had a healthy attitude towards food in our household but since starting a new school and especially this summer she\u2019s been eating way less. Yesterday she only ate dinner for example, and right after dinner she\u2019s been going to the toilet. A habit she\u2019s never had previously. She never drinks soda with dinner anymore and rejects ice-cream offers etc, things she used to love.\n\nIt hurts my heart so much because I have no idea how to approach this subject, I\u2019ve tried to talk to her about issues in the past and those seemed to clear up with time (self harm) as I don\u2019t see any scars anymore. But I have no idea what to say or what to do, I mean it\u2019s my baby sister and I love her to death, but I have no idea how to be there for her, especially since I don\u2019t really live at home anymore. She\u2019s started looking malnourished and my parents are trying to encourage her to eat but she never does. She has previously fainted during school as well. \n\nPlease if you have any ideas or tips on how to help or just even support her through this lmk. Thank you",
