Am I supposed to count my calories and macros, am I supposed to eat intuitively and eat whatever I want, am I supposed to do a meal plan or eat clean or do fasting or WHAT!?!?!?!? HOW DO PEOPLE EAT WITHOUT FUCKING UP ALL THE TIME AND HATING THEMSELVES I DONT GET IT!!!!! I've had eating disorders for 6 fucking years now and I haven't been able to eat normally since I was 14. I don't know what to do. I've tried all of the above and I keep on falling down the ED slide over and over. Tell me I'm not the only person who SERIOULSLY DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO EAT FOOD! I'm a grown adult, I have a job and a car but I don't know how to eat without having my guts and wanting to throw myself off a bridge. FUCK! My life is consumed by this thing. Its like a poisonous gas that leeks into every room of my house and toxifies every surface. It follows me wherever I go and I cannot enjoy my life one bit with it hanging around in the air. God damn I need some help. Someone please reach out.",

For someone who struggles with ED, the best plan is probably to just have a good plan. Otherwise, it\u2019s a roller coaster. I agree with others- work with a licensed nutritionist who has experience with ED to help you come up with a plan that will act as guideposts for you. If nothing else, having an accountability partner is huge.",

There\u2019ll always be a little back voice inside your head, or a little habit you think you quit that is still vigilant, even if weaker.\n\nAnd that fucks up your whole perception of what is \u201cnormal\u201d. How many calories? Why do I feel the need to count anything? How do i balance? Is this enough? \n\nOf course this is not meant to make things worse, but that\u2019s also why I think working on living with it and learn to manage ups and downs is better than putting on a fake scenario of \u201ci\u2019m free forever!!\u201d \n\nIf you have the financial availability I recommend you to reach out to a nutritionist who works with EDs, it can really make a huge difference, wishing you the best! <3",

If tracking help you, track. If it harms you, don\u2019t do it. Try to eat something every 4 hours to avoid getting overly hungry and practice listening to your body. Don\u2019t do \u201cgood food\u201d vs \u201cbad food\u201d there is nothing inherently wrong with your food or fantastic about it. It is made to fuel your body and it does exactly that so just let it do that.

Then from taking the supplements to avoid a stomach ache you end up eating something small.\nI\u2019ve read that supplements help open the appetite. At my worst I had no appetite, I had \u201ccravings\u201d but couldn\u2019t touch the food once it was in front of me. Now these past couple days I\u2019ve have been HUNGRY. Able to eat, nothing big, but actually able to take bites and feel like I\u2019m actually eating. I started with a daily vitamin, then added a supplement for anxiety, magnesium, and then b-12.
