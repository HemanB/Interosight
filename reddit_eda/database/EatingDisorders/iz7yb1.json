  "selftext": "(TW-described eating habits) \n\nA little back story. I (17F) have been overweight for all of my life. I recently lost a lot of weight, like another person amount of weight. For the most part, it was healthy. However, when quarantine began I was eating very restrictively. I only ate at 5 p.m. This \u201cmeal\u201d consisted of about 2 carrots, some broccoli, some frozen fruit and water. That\u2019s all. After about a month or so, I began eating a little more. Then, I went to my boyfriends. (I stay at his place for the summer since we are long distance) Then I started to eat whatever I wanted, without care if I was hungry or not. I gained a few pounds and started heavily restricting again when I got back home. Fast forward to now, I\u2019m in a binging episode. I ate 1 think out of my set calories for the day and believed that I had ruined everything. So I binged. I keep telling myself that I will start tomorrow, so I eat anything and everything I can that day. And the cycle repeats. Sometimes I will try to make myself throw up. However, this dosent work anymore as my reflex is too far back now.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if I have an eating disorder and I\u2019m too embarrassed and scared to mention it to anyone. For example, my father is constantly telling me how proud he is of me for losing the weight. (Which makes me feel so incredibly angry inside for some reason) I just feel like he wouldn\u2019t understand or would be sad/upset with me. \n\nWhat would happen of I were to tell my doctor? Would they have to tell my dad? Would they put me into some type of recovery place? I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m in some kind of denial but I would really appreciate any thoughts you guys have.",

      "body": "It definitely sounds like you have an eating disorder, but it\u2019s a really great sign that you\u2019ve been able to see that. I would absolutely recommend seeing a doctor ASAP and also a therapist that has experience with eating disorders. The longer this goes on untreated, the harder eventual recovery will be, I *promise* you that. \n\nTo answer your questions:\n1. I guess that really depends on your doctor. Since you\u2019re still a minor, I believe if your dad asked he would be entitled to that info; but like I said that depends on your doctor and how comfortable you feel sharing that info and whether you think it\u2019d be kept in confidence.\n\nTo be honest, though, recovery will be difficult if you\u2019re also juggling hiding it at the same time. It\u2019ll be easier with a support system of people that can help and encourage you along the way. Your dad is proud of your accomplishment. Having an eating disorder doesn\u2019t diminish that accomplishment; in fact, it has nothing to do with it. You have a dangerous illness that is a completely separate thing. \n\n2. Would they put you in a recovery place? That seems unlikely. You\u2019re not at the point where you need to be hospitalized. I\u2019d start with your doc (or preferably a psychiatrist) and a therapist. Hopefully, since you\u2019ve caught it early, that\u2019s all you\u2019ll need. It\u2019s a BIG deal that you\u2019ve caught it early, seriously. \n\nFeel free to PM me if you have any more questions. I wish you the best of luck!\n\nEdit: typos",

They will not make you go to a treatment center, but they may talk to your dad (although perhaps not, especially if you ask them not to). I suggest talking to a therapist about it, they can provide coping techniques, and outpatient can also be great!",

      "body": "Also regarding point 1, your doctor doesn't communicate with your parents unless you're suicidal or homicidal (a direct threat). Please don't be worried about that. Please do share with your doctor your struggles with food. They are there to support you. They can only treat you in a meaningful way if they know the full picture of what's going on with you. They can offer resources to you, options for treatment, counseling, nutritional support. You need to make sure your body is okay. EDs can kill without warning, and you need someone following you.
