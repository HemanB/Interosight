  "selftext": "Hey everyone :) I\u2019ve been recovered from a restrictive ED for about 18 months now, but I recently got a bf and I\u2019m struggling again. \n\nFor context, when I first met him, I wondered if he had an ED himself as he never seems to eat much and he\u2019s pretty skinny, but later realised he\u2019s just one of those teen boys who has a fast metabolism and a small appetite which keeps him from gaining weight. Actually, he often brings up how he wants to gain weight for his health/for aesthetic reasons. My problem is that being around someone who never really seems hungry, or who buys food but doesn\u2019t eat most of it, is starting to push me back into old mindsets. I really like him and he\u2019s an amazing person, I feel so guilty letting something like this get in between us but I can\u2019t seem to help it. \n\nIt seems like any time I spend with him I end up not eating anything. Last week I was at his house for about 8 hours and we didn\u2019t anything cos he never brought food up and I was too embarrassed to say I was hungry. \n\nIf anyone has any advice that\u2019d be so helpful. I\u2019m still not sure if he may have an ED or if he\u2019s just genuinely never hungry, but either way I can feel myself getting worse and I don\u2019t know how to resolve this. It feels like I\u2019m just making a big deal of something not that important \n",

If it's taking you back into bad habits you should try to bring it up with him, since talking about weight with him is OK since he's talking about wanting to gain weight right. If he's really nice then he'll be supportive.  \nif you can't get yourself to talk to him about it or ask for food first, maybe just take a snack in your bag to eat when you hang out, so you don't have to ask him if it's too embarrassing. it would be a little more food which is good. some protein bars taste p good actually. lol",

I agree with the other comments though about if you're comfortable enough, maybe bringing up the fact that restrictive eating is something you've struggled with, and how it's really important for your recovery journey to make sure you eat consistent meals to prevent slipping backwards. It sounds like like he's a sweet guy, and since he often mentions wanting to gain weight for his own health, approach it as a way to also hold each other accountable for making sure you both eat. It's scary opening up about this stuff, but it sounds like in order for a healthy relationship, and for your own physical and mental health, it's something that needs to be approached! you guys got this :)",

      "body": "well, if he wants to gain weight and you are hungry, the only logical thing would be for both of you to eat! \n\nalso, coming from a guy, of course i can\u2019t speak for everyone, but i don\u2019t think you should ever be ashamed of eating, even if that means eating more than your partner or eating something that isn\u2019t as nutritious as what your partner is eating. i\u2019ve never been in a situation where i was like \u201coh wow this person is eating a lot\u201d, at least not before my disordered eating habits started. because if you\u2019re normal around food, you really don\u2019t pay attention to how much or what other people really eat. at least that\u2019s my experience. \n\non another note, remember the freedom you have. the tasty foods, the amazing dates, the shared ice creams and movie nights. the life you have. a life that is exhausting when all you focus on is calories and food. \n\nlast but not least, no matter how old or young you are, no matter how fresh the relationship and no matter how scary it might seem: communication is key to absolutely everything. and again, this should be a fairly easy talk to have since he wants to gain weight anyway, so eating more together doesn\u2019t sound like a bad idea from any standpoint in my eyes. \n\ndon\u2019t be ashamed to be hungry, just because some dumbass made you believe women don\u2019t deserve to be hungry or any of that bullshit! best of luck :)",
