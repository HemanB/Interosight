  "selftext": "I\u2019ve been \u201crecovered\u201d for five years. Whenever I feel hungry - like really hungry - there\u2019s this jolt of excitement, like, \u201cHa, stomach! Take that you little bitch. You\u2019re not the boss of me!\u201d And the longer I hold it, the better. It\u2019s like a game and I\u2019m winning. Even when I\u2019m not hungry, I think about that feeling.\n\nI\u2019m normal now, but I\u2019m want to go back to MY normal, pre-ED. I\u2019ve cut out alcohol (1-2 drinks per day for the last 4 years\u2026probably a problem but I\u2019ve never told my psychiatrist). I think that should be enough to restore, but to make things go faster, I\u2019ve started restricting as well. \n\nThat hunger high is back. I feel diabolical and strong. Even when it distracts me or makes me feel light-headed, it\u2019s just confirmation that I\u2019m winning. \n\nI\u2019m confused now. It\u2019s like I don\u2019t just want to be less - I want to be sick. On one hand, being sick would make my goals easier. On the other hand, being sick was exhilarating (and sometimes terrifying). It was something that took up space. \n\nIs this specific to EDs? Or am I just really messed up? It\u2019s not like people get nostalgic over broken bones and cancer. ",

I wish I felt it every time I was hungry. Which is crazy. I know. \n\nAnd I'm so scared of the second one. It's bloody awful. The annoying thing is I have no control over which one it will be. \ud83d\ude13",
