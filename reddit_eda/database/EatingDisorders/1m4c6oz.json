My dad told me today that he has a camera in the bathroom and this shocked me because I only thought we had cameras in the living room and downstairs but the bathroom is a violation of privacy no? I told my mom about it and she dismissed it but I feel like it\u2019s kind of weird but im not sure if im overreacting. ",

Librarian - while not a mandated reporter, if you ask them to report something, chances are they will. 2. Someone from EDA - preferably someone who is trustworthy, not everyone there is, but you could probably also find someone who would make a report to law enforcement for you.
