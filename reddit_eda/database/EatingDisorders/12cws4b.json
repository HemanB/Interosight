  "selftext": "Hello friends\u2014\n\nI\u2019ve been MIA for some time now, both having been in Inpatient and just needing to step away from these communities for a moment. \n\nI wanted to share with you all that I am currently in kidney failure, and awaiting lab results to determine which stage I am at. I am only 32 years old. There is little hope that I can recover at this point without major medicinal intervention, of which I am not willing to do. I have suffered long enough, and wish to die with my dignity. \n\nI have suffered for over 25 years with this terrible illness, and I wanted to compassionately warn you all that death by EDs is a VERY REAL THING. I hope this shakes you to your core. I am 32 and dying. It could be within days, or months, but I will die from this. \n\nI wish you all nothing but healing, and peace. I am terrified. My family is in ruins. I truly cannot believe I am writing this post.\n\nThank you to every single one of you who has sent me well wishes; I take every word to heart and I have made some beautiful connections here. You are spectacular people, and you deserve full recovery.\n\nBe well, friends \ud83e\udd0d\n\nThank you, thank you, thank you, all! You are incredibly kind, gentle souls, and you have given me more than I can express in words.\n\nIn incredibly surprising news, my lab results are in, and by some chance of all that is good in the world, almost every single value has SHOT up; not just little jumps here and there, like major life-changing amounts. My doctor, family and I are shocked, as I haven\u2019t changed any behaviors! \n\nI don\u2019t know what to make of this; is it a second chance? I have so much thinking to do. \n\nLove you every one of you! I think the prayers I have received here are what has made this happen?",

I don\u2019t think things like organ failure gets talked about enough in ED spaces, and it is kind of you to share this part of your experience with this community. \n\nPeople have a tendency to think \u201cbut I\u2019m not sick enough for this to happen\u201d but you are. You are sick enough, and even if you\u2019re not underweight, things like this can happen as a result of an ED. \nPlease take your disorder seriously, folks.",

I can tell you from experience that miracles do happen. <3\n\nWork hard and be well so that you can live long and be happy.",

Even while suffering so much, you're trying to help others here. I wish I had answers and I wish I could share hope with you. I hope your kidney values can improve without the major medical intervention that you don't want to go through. You still deserve healing very much so and I know it's not my place to say, but even when feeling hopeless, there can be reasons to fight that we haven't yet discovered. Something we would fight for with everything that we didn't even know we had, if we know about it ahead of time. You deserve care and healing, mentally and physically.",
