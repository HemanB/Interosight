  "selftext": "So i (21F) have had my eating disorder since the third grade. I remember the day it started and play it in my head over and over constantly. About two years ago i finally decided i was ready to work on getting rid of my ED. And I\u2019m doing okay but i feel so confused and alone because i miss it? I don\u2019t know how to not sound like the worst person ever but i LOVE my eating disorder. I have been working so hard to stay strong and not fall into certain habits i have, but a huge part of me just doesn\u2019t care because i like it? I know what i do is so bad for me. My ED just feels like my security blanket, and my friend in a sort of way. I have never ever told anyone about it and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready too, so i battle with my mental health alone too. I wish i could talk to someone and get advice or anything at all. Are these thoughts normal or do i have another totally inappropriate issue to work on? I also have days (more often than not lately) where i feel SO fat. I know i definitely deal with body dysmorphia but this feels way too extreme, i physically start to feel ill when i start feeling fat. I get sweaty and irritable and my body just feels so disgusting to me. If anything i just want to know how to stop feeling that strongly when i have thoughts about being fat. When i think rationally i know I\u2019m not fat, but the rational thinking does not last long in me because i just hate myself and body so much. It\u2019s exhausting having these thoughts running through my head 24/7 for years now. I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m not asking a clear question, I\u2019m just confused and stressed and lost. And lastly to anyone on this page, you must be on it because you are also struggling and i am so so incredibly sorry you\u2019re dealing with similar issues too. You are so loved!",

      "body": "while I don't have any clear cut advice, I do just want to say that you are not alone in this. It is horrible to see others suffering the same issues, but sometimes feels like a breath of fresh air seeing that other people have the same thoughts and feelings as I've had. I (24f) have also struggled on and off for many years and am not ready to talk to other people in my real life about the ED. This can be so isolating and exhausting but I have hope in recovery, or at least being at peace with myself and accepting the occasional ED-related thought. \nAlso - this is so cliche but I have found yoga and meditation to be invaluable in making steps toward recovery (especially in relation to lessening those physical feelings of fatness and disgust) . Take care",

      "body": "First of all, I just want to let you know that you are not alone in this! Missing our Eating Disorders is a very normal part of the recovery process. I suffered from mine for 14 years, so I had a lot of these feelings during the earlier stages in my recovery process (and I still do at times). When you live with something for so long, whether it is good or bad for you, it does become like a security blanket. Disconnecting with that and cutting the cord can be extremely hard. It is during times when we are having thoughts like these is when we have to remind ourselves to practice compassion with ourselves. \n\nWhen I start to have feelings of disgust or discomfort in my body, I find the best thing that works for me is to eat a nourishing meal and move my body. Movement is so healthy for us, but when we have crippling feelings it can be really hard to make ourselves do that. I personally have found a love for roller skating and that helps me to move my body, but everyone is different. \n\nI hope any of this helps and that you feel better soon <3",

      "body": "Life Without Ed is a book that has helped me work through some of the ambivalence toward recovery you describe. The author personifies her eating disorder as \u201cEd,\u201d and talks about her ED as an abusive partner, someone she loves deeply but also needs to break free from, someone who comforts her but makes her believe lies about herself. I believe that the ED sticks around even after I want to be rid of it because it serves a purpose\u2014 I didn\u2019t choose it, but it grabbed hold because I had an unmet need earlier in life and the ED somehow addressed that need. So perhaps recovery is a matter of finding a healthy way to serve that purpose/address those needs. I\u2019ve found free Zoom support groups hosted by the ED treatment centers to be really helpful with feeling less alone in this struggle. Anyone with an ED can attend. PM me if you want more information about groups. Sending you hope and care <3",

But all 3 centers\u2019 groups have been helpful for me in similar ways. I think finding a group that fits in well with your schedule so you can make weekly attendance a priority is helpful. Also, there are some groups that are specific to LGBTQ+, or adults over 30, and other specific populations, which could be helpful. Attending weekly means I get to know others better and can use their support to keep me accountable week to week and celebrate my little victories. Important caveat: these groups are NOT a replacement for individualized ED care. They are intended to be an adjunct to individual care, whether that\u2019s therapy, seeing a dietician, etc.",
