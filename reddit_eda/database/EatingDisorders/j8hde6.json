  "title": "Request: Is avoiding certain food an ED symptom",
  "selftext": "I\u2019m very concerned about one of my family member that\u2019s currently on a diet and they really wanna lose weight. They\u2019re purposely avoiding to eat carbs and sugar and sometimes they skip their meals too. I wanna know if that\u2019s okay and won\u2019t develop an ED, not only what they\u2019re eating is very little for me but also knowing they wanna eat lesser and lesser is really triggering to me. Can I know if that\u2019s normal to do so since they\u2019re on a diet? Or it\u2019s not healthy and I should do something about it. Any advice is appreciated, thank you.",

      "body": "I used to work with a girl who was on a very strict Keto diet (very low carb, high fat) with intermittent fasting and definitely seemed to have developed disordered eating - although maybe not an eating disorder. She was even avoidant of taking OTC medications bc she was scared there were carbs in them. It was very triggering for me as well and I always felt like i had to compete with her. I always feel like anyone around me trying to lose weight or diet is developing an ED, I think we just become hyper aware and maybe watch out for telling signs. Which isn\u2019t a bad thing. Your family member could be struggling with disordered eating patterns and not even realize it. I don\u2019t see harm in trying to talk to them as long as it\u2019s not accusatory or harmful.",

I often think if this is my ED taking over but somehow is good for me, so I just let it flow\nThere was a time where I thought cutting off some other stuff but I was to scared to not having control... any ways",

      "body": "It depends on how long they do it for and how extreme the restriction is. Restrictive eating for a few weeks or months isn't terribly concerning if they are doing it in a reasonable and balanced way. And keto diets can be effective for people with diabetes if done under the supervision of a nutritionist. But even a Keto diet is supposed to have SOME carbs. It is just a very small amount.\n\nFEAR of eating ANY carbs (or pills because they might contain carbs like a respondent said) sounds like a mental disorder to me. A healthy person following a low or no carb diet should be ABLE to eat carbs; it would just throw them off their diet that day and they would have to get back into ketosis if that is their goal. If someone seems deeply distressed by the idea of eating a normal food... I would question their mental health and feel they dont have a healthy relationship with food.\n\nI personally don't like the keto diet. I tried it twice and both times it just made me feel sick. The thought or eating ONLY fat and protein made me want to puke and not in a bulima-inspired way. \n\nIntermittant fasting is easier for me, and okay if not taken to extremes. Three meals a day isn't necessary for everyone to have energy. I have never really eaten breakfast unless I am at a conference or something where food is served. \"fasting\" for me is just not eating after 10pm and not rising early enough to be hungry before noon. Lunch is usually my first meal of the day.",

      "body": "Even if a diet doesn\u2019t lead to health issues, restriction will screw with with a person psychologically. \n\nNaturally if you restrict, you\u2019re going to feel totally out of control around those foods you don\u2019t let yourself have.\n\nAnd avoiding carbs isn\u2019t ideal. The brain needs whole grains to function. Carbs give your body energy. \n\nIf you\u2019re trying to get through to them I would recommend coming with the facts - follow some HAES dietitians and therapists on Instagram. Dieting doesn\u2019t work. Neither does skipping meals. Dieting causes a person to gain all the weight back and then some. It also is a miserable way to live your life whether it leads to an eating disorder or not.\n\n\nGood luck.",

I hope that they really do stop once they reach their goal and don\u2019t develop any ED kind of thought patterns and habits. I did not talk to her about it unfortunately. We weren\u2019t terribly close and I wasn\u2019t sure how to approach the situation. The office that I work in is all female and is very pro diet culture, including Keto. I knew that any sort of counter argument I would have made would\u2019ve been met with hostility from her and others and I just don\u2019t have the energy or brain power to argue about it. I am worried about her though and hope that she is ok :( it just seems so well accepted in my office to skip meals and watch intake, etc. thank you! and no problem, I hope that you are ok as well! \ud83d\udc95",
