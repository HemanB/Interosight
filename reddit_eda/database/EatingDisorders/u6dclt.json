What you\u2019re referring to is commonly known as the \u201clast supper\u201d, eating all the \u201cunhealthy\u201d foods you can so you can \u201cget back on track\u201d tomorrow or next week or whenever. \n\nWhen I was in treatment, I ate \u201cjunk food\u201d every single day for two months. I had restricted and only binged on them for so long that I craved them constantly and felt so guilty every time, but after a couple months of allowing myself to eat them whenever I wanted, those foods no longer have that power over me. I don\u2019t eat a pint of ice cream or an entire bag of chips in one sitting anymore because I know I can always have more later, so there\u2019s no scarcity mindset. \n\nI\u2019m definitely unhappy with and uncomfortable in my body, have gained a lot of weight in the past year of treatment, and I still have a long way to go in recovery.  But I finally feel at peace with so many foods that used to have such control over me, and I hope you\u2019re able to find the same peace someday.",

      "body": "In addition to therapy, mindfulness can be very helpful with this line of thinking. Putting effort into preparing food, developing good mealtime habits, and understanding your triggers are good ways to maintain a healthy easting mindset. Think about what initiates these thoughts. Is it stress? Are you so hungry that you feel the urge to eat a lot? Is there a scarcity mindset (It will be awhile before my next \"cheat day\" so best make the most of it.)? Be aware of these factors and develop strategies to handle challenges when they arise. \n\nAn additional approach would be removing the restriction mentality. Work to erase thought patterns along the lines of \"food x is bad\", \"no more x food for x period of time\", \"it would take x to burn of this\", \"I ate x now x bad consequences\", etc. Take time when you eat to erase the binge mentality (spacing meals and snacks, giving yourself a bit of time before you get seconds etc.)",

      "body": "I\u2019ve heard this comes from restricting \n\nLike\nI\u2019m going to just use broccoli for an example because broccoli is a food that\u2019s neutral to me, I don\u2019t mind it, but I don\u2019t adore it either. Feel free to substitute with anything that fits the description for you. \n\nIf someone just sets a bowl of broccoli in front of me, I might have a couple of pieces, maybe a little more if I\u2019m just in a broccoli mood that day, but probably not very much. I\u2019d just have as much as I want, and then be done. \n\nNow, if someone set that bowl in front of me and said \u201cYou can\u2019t have this. It isn\u2019t for you. Don\u2019t touch it, you can\u2019t have it.\u201d\nThat would make me *want* it. That would make me react as if this is a scarce thing. So, whenever they did let me have some, I\u2019d probably take a lot of it. \nNow, maybe this wouldn\u2019t happen the first time, but if I learned the pattern that broccoli isn\u2019t allowed 90% of the time, then, during that 10% where it *is* allowed, I would go overboard. \n\nIf using a food here doesn\u2019t really click as much, you could replace the bowl of broccoli with a specific video game, or a book, or a website, or a musician. \n\nBy limiting something and mentally labeling it as \u201cbad,\u201d you\u2019re making it something of a \u2018forbidden fruit,\u2019 which makes you want it more and makes you think it\u2019s limited, so, when you actually do have it, you go overboard because you don\u2019t know when you can have it again. \n\n\nI tested myself with this by giving myself to have ice cream whenever I wanted. Still had a lot of issues with other foods, but ice cream, I just let myself go nuts. For the first few weeks it was BAD, I had a big carton (?) of ice cream in like three days and then got another one immediately after. I was going through it like crazy for the first three weeks or so. Then I slowed down a little, a carton lasted over a week. Now I\u2019m capable of having ice cream in the freezer for over a month, easily, not because I restrict myself, but because I just don\u2019t want it. And when I do want it, I have a bowl, and then I\u2019m fine. I don\u2019t go as crazy over it because I know it\u2019s there whenever I want. \n\nI would honestly recommend trying to give yourself permission with at least one of the foods you mentioned, because that \u201cmight as well\u201d type of thought really did go away after I decided that ice cream was \u2018allowed\u2019\n\n(I will say it wasn\u2019t an instantaneous guilt free thing, it took me a while to get to where I stopped feeling as guilty for it, but when I decided that guilt or not, I *deserve* some goddamn ice cream, that binge urge went down drastically)",

(This one is cheesy but I think it\u2019s important) Remind yourself this is apart of the processes, urges happen, binges happen, that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re any further from getting better. It will take many tries, just like everything, so at least now you\u2019ve gotten one more bump in the road behind you. \n\n2. Okay, actionable thing; don\u2019t restrict too much. Often when we get strong urges like this it\u2019s from built up desires finally surfacing. It\u2019s tempting to eat as little as possible but that will make you desire more food and eventually that desire will be too much. \n\n3. Similarly, plan for minor indulgences. If we stop ourselves from having our favorite foods, the desire to have them will just get stronger. It\u2019s better to plan for it then let it unfold when the fuck it switch comes up. It also is just a healthier lifestyle, the goal should be a healthier relationship with food. It\u2019s okay to have treats here and there. Also, I think the planning thing can help prevent the fuck it switch from being flipped. It does for me, anyway. \n\n3. When the fuck it switch does get flipped (it will happen and that will be okay), I like to reset immediately. For me, the \u201cI\u2019ll start tomorrow\u201d is usually a trap (insert Bo Burnham, \u201cbut tomorrow never comes, it\u2019s always today. Makes Annie more depressing\u201d lol). Starting tomorrow rarely works for me so I will literally say out loud \u201cI\u2019m starting right now.\u201d Sure, I had too much food but I don\u2019t need to let myself become victim of the sunk cost fallacy, I can get back on the horse right now. If fact, it\u2019s easier to do it then because I just ate a lot lol. I can just have a normal sized dinner and be perfectly satisfied. \n\n\n\nAnyway, that\u2019s what works for me. Hopefully at least one of them will help, I hope you take the first one to heart especially. A lot of this is a mind game for me so I\u2019ve found changing my mindset is huge. For me, thought spirals are public enemy number one but you can catch them with intentional and generous thoughts. Best of luck, OP! You\u2019re don\u2019t better than you know!",

The only things that makes me at least try the next day is the fact that my dad had the same problem with tobacco and tried really hard as a child to help him stop and nothing worked, 2020 he lost a lung to cancer. I don't want my possible future children to feel like I'm killing myself slowly and they can't do anything about it. Remember why you are tying to heal, for me is the family I want to have, were my kids can have a healthier childhood than me. For you it could be all the things you want to do with your life, think of swiming in the sea, feeling the fresh air of a mountain or going to a music concert. Not getting better will eventually prevent you form doing the things that you love.\n\nMost times this thought don't help when I'm falling down a spiral at 3am but then I just remind myself that the spiral will only last a few hours and that after that I will actually see what I want to do (like getting period craps like \"ok it's going to be exactly 52h, after that I'll feel better\") I hope it helps!",
