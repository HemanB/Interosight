I mean can you honestly tell me that you don\u2019t find any cuisine of food but processed fast food nice? You don\u2019t like East Asian food? You don\u2019t like Mediterranean food? You don\u2019t like middle eastern food, Indian food etc etc? There is a world of non processed foods which literally taste 100000x better and actually won\u2019t destroy your health. Find substitutes for things. Learn about nutrition- and also learn but the idea that calories in and calories out is the base level of idea for losing weight sure, but guess what? You might not be losing actual fat lmao. Your body can very easily start using its muscle mass too if you\u2019re eating shit ass foods. You can 1000% have an ED and not be focused on healthy food. But I\u2019ll tell you what will happen - you\u2019ll destroy your health, destroy your mental state, you\u2019ll be stuck in a cycle of constant restriction because guess what? You\u2019re loading your body up with nutritionally void junk so you will constantly be fucking starving. And your body will start eating away at some fat, but also muscle. You\u2019ll likely still have visceral fat which is bad fat - because you\u2019re loading your body up with the foods which literally CAUSE visceral fat to develop aka \u2018skinny fat\u2019. You\u2019ll get more and more health problems. I\u2019m speaking from actual experience. Calories aren\u2019t your enemy - hyper processed foods is. Now that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t have them occasionally. But our bodies weren\u2019t designed to consume this shit. So the way you get out of it, is by challenging your own thoughts. And to realise that your ED is fucking stupid and wrong. And that eating processed foods but restricting won\u2019t get you skinny. It will get you unhealthy. And restricting under your TDEE long term will make it a guarantee that you destroy your body long term. Your body is a lot smarter than your ED. You won\u2019t gain weight by eating at least one decent meal of non processed foods. But the only person who can break that cycle is you. Your ED isn\u2019t helping you - and any weight you lose is literally just short term and meaningless because two things will happen A) you\u2019ll eventually start binging and gaining weight back OR B) you\u2019ll start losing muscle mass and become skinny fat, weak and unhealthy as fuck. Either way, you won\u2019t be getting out of the cycle. I\u2019m not going to sit here and validate you and say \u201cdon\u2019t worry ofc you have an ED, ur so valid.\u201d I\u2019m gonna do something I wish someone said to me years ago. Your ED and its ideas, and its hold on your life ISN\u2019T valid. It isn\u2019t okay, it isn\u2019t acceptable. And if you\u2019re self aware enough to want to break out of the cycle of this shit - then PLEASE START doing it. Your ED is a liar, and it\u2019s going to hurt you long term. And when the day comes when you want to have a better life - it will be so much harder for you to get there because you will be dealing with the health consequences as well as the mental ones. I\u2019ve been hospitalised before. I\u2019ve seen what EDs can do. It\u2019s not a life worth living. I\u2019ve seen women in their 20s, in wheelchairs and struggling to walk. I\u2019m telling you - start challenging it while you can. And if you hate all non processed foods. Then you need to get tough on yourself and start challenging yourself. Whatever your calorie count is - why not start by adding to that, and making sure that a little over half of those cals are from non processed nutrient dense foods? Start slow and start little by little.",

Learn that calories in calories out is a basic idea - but the CONTENT of calories matter. X calories of sugar and refined carbs vs x calories of protein, healthy carbs, healthy fats are NOT made equally. Your body needs real food, not fake food. You deserve to nourish your body. Start slow. Whatever your calorie intake is per day, add to it slowly and make sure that half of those calories are made up of nutrient dense foods. You\u2019re way more likely to gain weight by eating processed junk food then eating whole, fruits, veggies and healthy carbs. Your body is literally designed to consume those things. Refined sugar and carbs are useless to your body but spiking your blood sugar which keeps you hungry which keeps you eating them. Whole foods keep you full, because your body actually uses the energy properly for organ function. \n\nIf your ED was so smart, why would it be telling you that it\u2019s okay to eat the very thing which actively keeps you on a cycle of losing and gaining weight? If your ED was so smart, why wouldn\u2019t it want you to eat things which help brain function, muscle maintenance, heart function, digestive function, skin health etc? \n\nLearn about your body. Learn about your brain. Challenge your thoughts. And remind yourself that you deserve better and so does your body. And that restriction only hurts you long term.",
