  "selftext": " \n\nHi! im a recovering bulimic w/ 4 years under my belt now but i can\u2019t seem to start working out. My dad would make fun of me whenever i tried to lose weight n that\u2019s one of the big reasons i resorted to bulimia.\n\nIm wondering if anyone has some practices around exercise that they use to remove the importance off of body image and more to do with wellbeing and contentment with self? Any exercise youtubers you watch that offer that kind of support in their vids? any overall tips/experiences?",

      "body": "First of all, your dad sounds like an ass. Secondly, I agree with the idea of finding joyful movement. I know one of the go to for recovery and exercise re-entry is yoga and walking. Maybe that's your thing? I personally found weight lifting to be empowering, rather than focusing on the aesthetic of exercise I focus on how it makes me feel. I love feeling strong, and would never choose to go back to my previously weak and underfed form. I found Sydney Cummings on YouTube about a year ago, and I think she's been a liberating influence for me.",

      "body": "I find going on walks is more relaxing and focused on enjoying nature than workouts. I know yoga is cliche for its focus on wellbeing, but it's cliche for a reason. I like Yoga with Adrienne, Yoga with Kassandra, and Allie the Journey Junkie.\n\nDancing like others mentioned is another good one. If you want the social aspect of a workout community, ballroom dancing is great. Unlike other dance studios, ballroom is not about perfection or weight loss. It's about learning something new, meeting new people, and having fun!",

Is it the environment at gyms, the things youtube instructors say, the act of pushing yourself, etc.? \n\nFor me I started off with doing yoga and walking, and then I moved onto strength training using dumbbells, and then I found a gym that\u2019s typically really empty and started using the cable machines there. I avoid any fitness content (whether that be subreddits, social media accounts, or workout videos) with any sort of diet culture bullshit like the plague. I actually like to listen to anti-diet culture podcasts while I\u2019m working out (my favorite one is called Maintenance Phase)",

A big part of my recovery was picking up a hobby that involved joyful movement. \n\nFor me personally that was burlesque because my teacher is very adamant that \u201cevery body is a burlesque body\u201d and affirmed everyone no matter where they were at with their body image. It was also a good exercise in getting to know and listen to my body. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be dance of course and I know that type of dance isn\u2019t for everyone. But definitely something that helps you connect with your body in a non appearance based way. Some people prefer yoga for that but you may want to look for body neutral or body positive classes or on YouTube. \n\nAlso I agree with the comments that your dad is an ass.",
