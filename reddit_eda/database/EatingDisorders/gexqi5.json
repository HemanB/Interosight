  "title": "Request: How to stop projecting my feelings onto my SO?",
  "selftext": "I\u2019m not sure if anyone feels the same way or knows what I\u2019m talking about, but I\u2019m hoping I can get some advice. \n\nMy SO is one of the most amazing people I\u2019ve ever met. He is aware of my eating disorder and is very patient and gentle with me. He never gets angry when he doesn\u2019t understand my feelings nor does he belittle me. My SO is slightly overweight and is aware of this. He loves his body and is very comfortable with the way he looks. He has come to me before and stated that when he was much younger, he hated his body and thought he was overweight even when he was at his skinniest. I\u2019m so proud (and envious) of his progression and I\u2019m so glad he loves himself for who he is.\n\nThis brings me to the problem: my ED has made me so many times project how I feel about my body onto him. What I mean by this is that if I see him eating a snack after dinner, or with a big plate, or even just considering eating after we\u2019ve already eaten, I make comments to him about how he shouldn\u2019t eat more, how bad it is to eat dessert, etc. It\u2019s gotten to the point where I know I\u2019m going to say it and I want to stop it but it just comes out anyway. Then I immediately regret it afterword because it\u2019s awful and no one deserves to be talked to like that. In a way, he\u2019s getting a sense of what it\u2019s like to live with my thoughts but I would never want to subject anyone to feel that way so I hate myself for doing it. \n\nHe is very, very patient with me and I\u2019ve communicated to him how sorry I feel when I say things like this. He knows it\u2019s just my ED talking and I can\u2019t exactly help it, but I know I can be better about silencing myself when it\u2019s inappropriate. I just need advice on how to be better at this. These thoughts are always going through my head when it comes to my eating habits, but I hate myself so much for even putting such thoughts in my SO\u2019s head. Especially when he\u2019s been through some difficult times with his self-image.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if any of this made sense but I\u2019m hoping someone has some advice so that I can be better for him.",

I literally can\u2019t help but make comments, so I try and make it about \u201cus\u201d, as in WE don\u2019t need seconds and WE don\u2019t need a snack. But I feel so horribly guilty about commenting every time, especially bc be has body image issues of his own & used to be very overweight. \n\nIt\u2019s so horribly triggering to see him overeat that sometimes it gives me anxiety and I shut down. Other times I get angry with him in my mind but I KNOW it\u2019s not his fault so I never let him see those emotions. \n\nI know exactly how you feel, and it\u2019s awful.
