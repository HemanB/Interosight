  "title": "Request: Making ED Recovery app with game elements and I need your help!",
  "selftext": " Hello There :) I am a computer science student and for my Master's I am making application for people recovering from Eating Disorders with game elements in it. However I need some help with thinking of ideas how this game should look like. Right now I know that this game will have tasks with different stages of difficulty (by doing easy one you will be able to do hard ones etc.), achievements, special prizes etc. The goal is to create beautiful forest with variety of trees (I want this app to be calming) - easy tasks with give you seeds and harder versions of the same task will water your trees so they will grow. I thought that asking you, people you could be using this app daily in the future, is a great idea! So, do you have some thoughts on this? Any examples of tasks that you think would be great and you would like to do (like eat 3 fear foods or drink some liquid calories)? Or maybe some ideas of what achievements would mean a lot to you, how they should be seen? I would be really thankful if you'd share some of your creative ideas and experience to help me make the best possible app for fighting eating disorder! <3",

Either state that it's an anorexia recovery app or perhaps the user would select which eating disorder they have and they get challenges based on that. Here are some ideas but they are based on my personal experience:\n\nAnorexia challenges\n\n* Have a bigger meal than the person you're eating with\n* Have a different breakfast/lunch/dinner than you usually do\n* Liquid calories\n* Unfollow 5 Instagram/youtube/TikTok accounts that negatively affect you\n* Have a meal 20 minutes earlier than you usually would\n* Don't measure any food for a day\n* Have a fear food (e.g. pizza, chocolate, cake, oil, ice cream, pasta, cookies, peanut butter etc)\n* Let someone else make your food\n* Unfollow 5 instagram/youtube/TikTok accounts that negatively affect you\n* Have a meal out of the house\n* Don't exercise for a day\n* Let someone else portion out your food\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBulimia challenges\n\n* Eat an adequate amount the day following a b/p (binge and purge)\n* Eat a trigger food without b/ping\n* Go 5 days with no b/p\n\nThere are other eating disorders but I don't have personal experience and I don't know enough about them.
