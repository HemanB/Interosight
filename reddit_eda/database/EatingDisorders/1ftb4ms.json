  "selftext": "So I\u2019ve struggled with an ed for a lot of my teen years and I\u2019m now at the point where I can eat somewhat \u201cnormally\u201d again. I\u2019ve been struggling abit with my depression and anxiety in recent weeks and for the past few days after I\u2019ve eaten I feel like I need to/am going to throw up. I\u2019m just wondering if anyone else has experienced this and if it\u2019s something I should be worried about \n",

      "body": "When I was recovering from being sick for two whole weeks and not being able to eat without getting sick (nervous collapse bc PTSD), it took me at least two or three months to get over that feeling. It sucks and I had to eat like the \u201cnormal\u201d people (three meals a day) but with therapy and time the feeling disappeared \ud83d\ude00\nEating without appetite is HARD, but now after almost a year I can say I finally recovered!! My therapist says that digestion is strongly connected with emotion, so in my case meds and better habits worked for me.",

I have always had issues with eating but I ended up with a stomach ulcer (always felt hungry, wouldn't eat, then would eat a tiny bit felt sick repeat). I eat everyday but still have irregular patterns of eating however when I was over using aspirin (gave me a massive ulcer) I began having this issue. I still have this problem occasionally and I think it also may be high stomach acid/stomach lining thinned.",
