  "selftext": "Hi mods, I'm in need of support :( I'm about to relapse.\n\nI feel like I'm internally COLLAPSING. I was triggered by Eugenia Cooney today and I'm spiraling. For context, I'm a 23 year old guy and my worst moment yet with my ED was in 2019. Since the pandemic started I've of course gained weight and I've been managing it well but I've come to a breaking point and I'm about to snap. I want to cry but I'm around family and all I want to do is to go back to where I was before starting to recover. I saw old photos, and though I remember just how miserable I was, I can't keep thinking about how much I desire to be there again. \n\nMy boyfriend doesn't understand what I'm going through and he's very cold and rational about it and I don't feel like I have anyone's emotional support anywhere. My heart feels heavy and I'm really fucking sad right now but I can't do anything right now but sit here and feel the hunger idk i'm not making sense anymore because i have nasty brain fog and i'm triggered af AAAAA",

Try talking to them about how you\u2019re feeling. If it\u2019s available, support and love from your mother is a good place to start.\n\nDo you have a therapist or doctor you can talk to? Please try and book an appointment if you can. If you\u2019re comfortable, ask your boyfriend to block her on all your accounts on social media. I\u2019m not sure exactly how to help you, but I\u2019d say talking to somebody is definitely an amazing place to start.",

She said \u201cwhat would change if you gained weight?\u201d And that question really took me by surprise. I\u2019d never thought of that before. My friends would still love me and be my friends, my family would still love me and be my family, I could still achieve all that I can and more than when I was rail skinny. \n\nYour boyfriend making you feel like a burden and being cold and not understanding is an issue. The best thing I had to finally recover was a boyfriend who didn\u2019t know what it was like to have an eating disorder, but loved me and supported me the whole way through. I don\u2019t know if I could have gotten to where I am without that support. You need to know that you are LOVED and CHERISHED for who you are, not by how you look. \n\nAll that gaining weight is going to do for you is allow you to physically be able to do more! It\u2019s incredible how much more beautiful life is when you don\u2019t feel faint and weak all day long. \n\nYou are loved for WHO you are. You deserve to eat and fuel your body.

You are acknowledging it and that means you\u2019ve already achieved so much. You WANT to get better. Regardless of how hard it is, you WANT it. And that is such a huge achievement in itself. \n\nI think the question that my therapist asked me that really shocked me the most was when she asked what I was scared of, and I said getting fat and that I wouldn\u2019t find love if I was fat. She said \u201cwhat would change if you gained weight?\u201d And that question really took me by surprise. I\u2019d never thought of that before. My friends would still love me and be my friends, my family would still love me and be my family, I could still achieve all that I can and more than when I was rail skinny. \n\nYour boyfriend making you feel like a burden and being cold and not understanding is an issue. The best thing I had to finally recover was a boyfriend who didn\u2019t know what it was like to have an eating disorder, but loved me and supported me the whole way through. I don\u2019t know if I could have gotten to where I am without that support. You need to know that you are LOVED and CHERISHED for who you are, not by how you look. \n\nAll that gaining weight is going to do for you is allow you to physically be able to do more! It\u2019s incredible how much more beautiful life is when you don\u2019t feel faint and weak all day long. \n\nYou are loved for WHO you are. You deserve to eat and fuel your body. Your body does so much for you and you\u2019ve struggled long enough. \n\nMessage me if you need to vent. I\u2019ve been through it all. You are not alone. And you are doing so great!!!!",
