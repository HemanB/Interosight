I understand her decision and i still will be there for her no matter what, but honestly it's killing me inside. I can't get out of my head the bad  thoughts, I'm so worried and scared. I want to be strong for her, and I don't know what to do :( i love her with all my heart and i really want to spend the rest of my life with her but I'm just so scared for her health and everything.

      "body": "Eating disorders are very similar to addictions in the way they affect the individual and the people around them. \u2639\ufe0f The person does have to be ready to recover. \n\nAdvice for her: recovery can start small. It's something you have to practice, you dont have to stop everything all at once. Harm reduction is important, every little bit counts. I think it might benefit her to find a therapist if she doesn't already have one. Eating disorders often result from some sort of trauma, so even just starting to process that is a step in the right direction. Learn some coping techniques. \n\nI am in therapy but I don't talk about my ED with my therapist (which is bad, I should be open about it, im just personally worried they'll change my medications if Im honest). But the work I've done in therapy has helped me with my ED a lot on it's own. Once she trusts her therapist she may be more likely to be willing to take steps to address the ED directly. \n\nThere are also peer support groups, but I wouldn't advise that until she's further on her journey cause people with EDs can be competitive and it might do more harm than good rn.\n\nAdvice for you: this is a really intense thing you're going through with her. You fears and emotions are valid. I think you should find a support group for people whose loved ones struggle with EDs. You might even be able to find one online. Here is one I found with a quick Google, just scroll down the page and you'll see the loved ones option: [link](https://centerfordiscovery.com/groups/). It is free! \n\nAlso, and this is IMPORTANT. If it's too much for you to handle, it is okay to back out until she makes changes in her life to get better. It does not make you a bad person. It does not mean you don't love her. Again, EDs are like addictions and loved ones should set boundaries to protect their own mental health and wellbeing. \n\nI was in a relationship when I was young and very deep in my mental illness and it was far too much for him to cope with. He tried, but the stress of it eventually eroded our relationship and we were totally codependent. It wasn't healthy for either of us and it did not end well. Just be careful. My relationship was not your relationship, but I've seen the same pattern play out in other people's lives too. \n\n\nThank you so much for trying to support her and reaching out for advice.",

Often families stop challenging EDs because people say things like your girlfriend does - that they are \u2018not ready\u2019. What is the message here?: is it - \u2018stop asking me to change\u2019?
