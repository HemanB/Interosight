  "selftext": "Hello. I have been anorexic for two years now, and recently it\u2019s starting to really hurt. My chest hurts and I feel weak. This makes me sad; it\u2019s sad to think I\u2019ve permanently damaged my body and that I may have problems forever because of this. Even still, I am having incredible trouble following my eating plan. \n\nI\u2019m afraid to gain weight because as someone who is already misgendered regularly, I worry that because I carry weight in traditionally masculine places, feeling like a woman is going to be hard for me after recovery. I also worry that my appetite will grow out of control. \n\nI am not sure what to do. Should I just go to the hospital?",

You're having chest pain and your body is weak. Your body is shutting down. \n\nYou need to focus on living right now. You need to stop using this as an excuse. If you gain weight in the wrong places, then there are ways you can fix that later on. But you don't actually know what's going to happen. \n\nBeing misgendered sucks. Being dead is worse. Go to the hospital, be honest about your condition, tell them how bad you are and get help, please. Chest pain is really bad.",

It\u2019s heartbreaking to know that you\u2019re going through that with an eating disorder on top, and that your eating disorder helps you feel more like the gender you identify with. I am really concerned about your chest pain. I think you should see a doctor and I hope you can see a therapist that will help you feel better.",

Eventually hrt did what it does and redistributed the fat in ways that made me more feminine and helped me pass.\n\nMy body couldn't absorb my hormones properly when I was deep in my anorexia.  I could never keep my levels right until after recovery.  And, I couldn't have curves if it weren't for body fat.\n\nGetting help and recovering is terrifying.  It's worth it though, especially when it comes to making progress in your transition.",

And we love her to bits for it.\n\nI can imagine your mind wants you to worry about how other people think and do in regards to you. That doesn't matter at all, but I will tell you how it is: People that are worth it will love and support you for who you are, not for how you look. And all the people who don't should gtfo. Everyone that matters wants you to be healthy and happy. And they are rooting for you to recover from this.",
