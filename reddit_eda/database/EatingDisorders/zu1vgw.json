  "selftext": "I\u2019m seeing a lot of posts here and in other Ed communities basically just begging for someone to help them with their binge eating issues.  If we had the answer to that problem, none of us would be here. Binge eating isn\u2019t a one size fits all approach to healing. Some people are moderators and some people are abstainers  and some people fall in between. Some people can do intuitive eating and some people cannot because it wouldn\u2019t make sense or be possible with their lack of hunger hormones or hunger/ satiety cues and signals. Coming to this sub and expecting others to help you stop bingeing is absolutely not going to happen. Again, if we had the answers, none of us would be going through the cycles. \n\nListening to podcasts about binge eating is probably the BEST and MOST EFFECTIVE way to get the support and the inspiration needed to stop bad habits around food or eating . Podcasts are FREE :) and there\u2019s thousands of them. If you just type in bingeing or eating disorders in Spotify you get all the support and information you need to get through really bad moments with ED\u2019s. \n\nHere\u2019s a list of them that you can listen to! Spotify is easy to navigate. Listen to episodes with the topics you\u2019re struggling with. Podcasts can help you re wire your brain and help change your habits. \n\n\u2022 The Recovery warriors shows\n\n\u2022 What you\u2019re craving \n\n\u2022 Nutrition matters podcast \n\n\u2022 Any podcast you can find with Isabella foxen duke\n\n\u2022 any podcasts with James clear (author of atomic habits) \n\n\u2022 Brain over binge podcast \n\n\u2022 Any podcasts with Glenn Livingston \n\n\u2022 The psychology of eating podcast\n\n\u2022 Food junkies - amazing !!!! \n\n\u2022 any podcasts with Joan ifland \n\n\u2022 any podcasts with Mary roberts and Jessyca Reynolds \n\n\u2022 unsweetened sio \n\n\u2022 any podcasts with Susan pierce Thomson \n\nHope this helps. Knowledge is power. Support is medicine. Habits can change but it requires the will to WANT to change. And trust me, I\u2019m not perfect because I have a host of Ed habits I am trying to release. :)\n\nMerry Christmas \ud83c\udf81 I hope this gift helps y\u2019all",
