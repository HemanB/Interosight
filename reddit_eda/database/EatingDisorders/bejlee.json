  "selftext": " \n\nHi I'm sorry if my formatting is weird or I'm not doing this right. I haven't been using Reddit for very long. But I really wanted some advice.\n\nI have struggled with binge eating and restricting since I was in highschool. And now I'm in college and morbidly obese by my BMI. I wanted to make a change so I've been trying to lose weight without relapsing. But it's so difficult. I've lost some weight through low carb and counting calories. But it's such a difficult line to walk.\n\nI have to be strict about my calories but not too strict. I have to think about what I eat but not too much. I have to actually avoid situations where I know my trigger foods will be available.\n\nDoes anyone have advice on how to lose weight without reverting back to your eating disorder?",

I only have experience in trying to lose weight in what was intended to be in a healthy way and it quickly became a full blown relapse in weeks. \n\nIf I ever need to lose weight again (I have cranky knees; being at an average weight it what makes them feel the best), I will not do it without being in therapy and seeing a dietician to help hold me accountable. I would suggest you do the same.",

Look in with a therapist or dietitian if you can. \n\nI think that you should start small, like go for a walk every few days and build from that. Don\u2019t push yourself to look a certain way, but rather feel better about your body. Ik it\u2019s hard not to relapse and it\u2019s good that you\u2019re aware, but don\u2019t crash diet or push yourself too hard. Progress is progress and that means taking small steps. \n\nHope you get better! And good luck on your journey :))",

      "body": "I don't like hard/fast rules like not believing in \"weight loss for anyone\", but there are a few things to consider here. The poster said that you should take care of your body physically/psychologically/spiritually in a way the feels good for them. Being unhealthy, with diseases like diabetes or high blood pressure, doesn't feel good, so taking care of yourself in a way that feels good includes preventing disease, or potentially, managing your diet and I suppose maybe your weight (though I believe people with history of disordered eating should take alternative routes first rather than going straight to manipulating diet/intake, doctors are very quick to prescribe weight loss rather than explore all treatment possibilities).  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, it is important to note, that no one is required to care about their health nor are they obligated to take action to improve their heath. In some cases, like with chronic illnesses, there is nothing you can do, you are always going to be \"unhealthy\" and that is okay (I mean it sucks, but that doesn't make that person any less deserving of respect and dignity because they don't fit the mold of \"healthy\".   \n\n\n> It takes discipline and determination to change unhealthy eating habits to make your body healthier overall. \n\nThis rhetoric in particular has the potential to be harmful. Some people see anorexics as being extremely disciplined(I suppose they fit a certain definition of the word) when they are really diseased. The idea that people in larger bodies are there because they are not disciplined and determined enough to have a smaller/\"healthier\" body perpetuates the stigma around weight and fat-phobia. This movement is not to say all fat people are healthy or that people should aim to be fat, but rather that no matter what your body you have the right to love yourself no contingent on changes and that you deserve to be treated with human respect(fat people are treated as less than human frequently in our society, so much so that some people would rather be dead than deal with the hatred/discrimination that comes with living in a larger body in our society)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTone is hard to show over the internet, but I mean this to provide some insight and continue the discussion rather than to cut things off or butt heads, I am open to all opinions so long as they don't come from a place of hatred or discrimination.",

All I can think of from here is: Make sure your goals are realistic, so you can celebrate losing weight at a healthy sustainable pace, not aiming for something that will necessitate you getting too hungry. And do you feel well connected to satiety and hunger? Are you experiencing them both in ways that feel healthy for you? I love when my body is sending me those messages clearly and that's the main messages I get to eat/stop eating. For me exercise is supportive of that. But I don't know about for you.\n\nI don't have to avoid situations with trigger foods but I can't have them at home, so I feel you on that. It's annoying.",

Guess I'll always feel bad and miserable. That is ridiculous. I take medication, but diet plays a HUGE part into how I feel and what symptoms I experience. Additionally, I also am semi-recovered but have a diagnosed eating disorder and attend therapy regularly. Don't spew facts at me like I'm some sort of internet fat shamer. Being sedentary and majorly overweight is not healthy for anyone. PERIOD. Ask a cardiologist. I know those habits are hard to change. \n\nAs someone who literally currently stuggles to include foods that I have formerly banned from my diet...into my new auto immune diet... yeah...it's F'ING hard. It also takes discipline and determination to not overeat or eat sugar at all when I know it causes inflammation and makes my symptoms worse. I would prefer to live in a world where I could at least choose to have a physical or mental illness but I'm stuck in some sort of personal hell and have both. I'm done checking this thread.",

          "body": "I don't like hard/fast rules like not believing in \"weight loss for anyone\", but there are a few things to consider here. The poster said that you should take care of your body physically/psychologically/spiritually in a way the feels good for them. Being unhealthy, with diseases like diabetes or high blood pressure, doesn't feel good, so taking care of yourself in a way that feels good includes preventing disease, or potentially, managing your diet and I suppose maybe your weight (though I believe people with history of disordered eating should take alternative routes first rather than going straight to manipulating diet/intake, doctors are very quick to prescribe weight loss rather than explore all treatment possibilities).  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, it is important to note, that no one is required to care about their health nor are they obligated to take action to improve their heath. In some cases, like with chronic illnesses, there is nothing you can do, you are always going to be \"unhealthy\" and that is okay (I mean it sucks, but that doesn't make that person any less deserving of respect and dignity because they don't fit the mold of \"healthy\".   \n\n\n> It takes discipline and determination to change unhealthy eating habits to make your body healthier overall. \n\nThis rhetoric in particular has the potential to be harmful. Some people see anorexics as being extremely disciplined(I suppose they fit a certain definition of the word) when they are really diseased. The idea that people in larger bodies are there because they are not disciplined and determined enough to have a smaller/\"healthier\" body perpetuates the stigma around weight and fat-phobia. This movement is not to say all fat people are healthy or that people should aim to be fat, but rather that no matter what your body you have the right to love yourself no contingent on changes and that you deserve to be treated with human respect(fat people are treated as less than human frequently in our society, so much so that some people would rather be dead than deal with the hatred/discrimination that comes with living in a larger body in our society)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTone is hard to show over the internet, but I mean this to provide some insight and continue the discussion rather than to cut things off or butt heads, I am open to all opinions so long as they don't come from a place of hatred or discrimination.",
