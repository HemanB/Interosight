  "title": "Request: Managing/recovering from ED while pregnant",
  "selftext": "I have been in outpatient treatment since February for an ED that is closest to binge eating. Treatment has overall been going very well.\n\nI recently found out I'm pregnant, and though I know that my therapist and dietician will be able to help out with some questions and food planning, I was wondering if anyone had experience with certain resources that they found really helpful.\n\nMy biggest concerns are eating healthy for baby (of course) but also not confusing pregnancy cravings with disordered thoughts.",

I also kept up with moderation. Like if I decided baby wanted a chocolate bar I would only have half. It also helped me to tell myself that baby didn\u2019t actually want 15 chocolate chip cookies or a family size bag or Doritos and indeed those things weren\u2019t good for the baby \ud83d\ude02 essentially, I reminded myself on the daily that pregnancy is not an excuse to eat in excess. It\u2019s harder to manage \u201chunger\u201d but I PROMISE you that baby doesn\u2019t increase your appetite or caloric needs that much. It\u2019s possible to stay on track and at the end you\u2019ll be rewarded handsomely when you don\u2019t have the 30-40 pounds most moms have to lose at the end. Also, it gets easier as baby gets larger. You won\u2019t have as much room and it decreases your appetite so don\u2019t beat yourself up in the early weeks for eating more than you feel you should.",
