  "title": "Request: How can I encourage my anorexic girlfriend to eat without overwhelming her?",
  "selftext": "Since a stay at home order was issued in our town a week ago, my girlfriend has been restricting her eating with worsening severity. In the last three days, despite my encouragement, I\u2019ve watched her eat a granola bar and one small microwave meal. I am really scared, and I don\u2019t think I responded properly at all. I told her, honestly, that I was afraid she might die if she keeps starving herself. She started crying and told me that she would die if she got fat during quarantine.  I know what I said plus my prodding her to eat probably overwhelmed her, but I\u2019m sort of at a loss for how to help her, and I\u2019m just so scared for her. I just don\u2019t know how I can ease some of her fears about eating. I know I can\u2019t make her see  how thin she, but what can I do to make sure she at least eats enough to stay alive and doesn\u2019t completely hate her body? I don\u2019t want to overstep here, but as her girlfriend I know I have to at least get more educated to be able to make sure she\u2019s healthy and safe while we\u2019re living together.",

      "body": "This is tough, but you're right to worry. Unfortunately, the only real thing you can do is keep trying and present her with facts. Like how even if she just sleeps, or stays in one spot all day, she needs at least 1200 calories a day just to keep her organs working properly. That her starving herself will kill her much faster than eating ever will.    \n\n\nI'm not trying to scare you, but once your body has eaten away at all the neccessary fat and muscle, it does go after vital organs like your heart. For me it left me with a resting heart rate of 40, and much lower when I was sleeping to the extent that my husband finally broke down and told me he would watch me all night because he was terrified I wasn't going to wake up. That was enough for me, seeing the damage I had done to someone I love, made me want to try and snap out of it. But in turn I had to be honest with him and myself as to why I was doing it. My reasoning was my own depression and suicidal thoughts that I've battled with since I was a child. Once I was able to be open and honest with myself about it, I was able to take the steps neccessary to recover. And maybe that's the discussion you need to have with her, why does she feel the need to hurt herself in such an undeserving way.    \n\n\nBut be prepared for things to get worse before they get better, I was personally a nightmare to deal with because letting go of my rituals was like losing my best friend. And I know that can be a hard concept to understand, but many of us with an ED truly believe that \"voice\" IS our best friend and the voice of reason. And that's going to be the hardest for her, getting her to understand and accept that it's not, and that all it's doing is stealing her light and life away.    \n\nIf theres any passions or interests she used to love, but seemingly doesn't care about anymore, maybe remind her of them? I've always been an artist, but when my ED was at it worst I litterally couldn't draw. My brain was so malnourished that I couldn't be imaginative in anyway and it broke my heart to see that I had done that to myself.   \n\n\nAbove all, remind her that you're there for her. Especially during the bad times. Recovery is not linear and is VERY personal. No one has the same story, but let her know you'll be there to support her and help in anyway that you can. I do highly suggest she contacts her doctor or a physician of some sort if possible though. Depending on how malnourished her body is, she may not physically be able to take on the amount of calories that a normal person would. And that's okay, it all comes with time and consistency. I hope I was able to give a few good suggestions, there was a book both my husband and I read that REALLY helped us to understand what I needed to do and why my body was reacting the way it did. If I can find it, I'll let you know the name of it. Good luck and I hope she's able to get better.   \n\n\nEdit: the book we used is \"Recover from Eating Disorders: The Homeodynamic Recovery Method\"",

Like I was proud of myself for causing the impression of not eating enough, and fed on the worry of my loved ones. Sick, I know.\n\nBut as most of my friends and family were glued to me saying I should eat more, I had ONE friend that stayed by my side without ever forcing the \u201cyou should eat more\u201d conversation upon me, and her company and support felt a lot more encouraging to me than everyone else that seemed so worried. I think you\u2019ll probably help her more by giving her your unconditional support, company, love, empathy and always being patient and calm even if you\u2019re worried sick. It\u2019s really hard but she won\u2019t recover unless she wants to and forcing her to do that may kill all the trust she places on you. Just stay by her side and make sure she knows you\u2019ll always be there for her and want to live a healthy life together!",

It\u2019s incredibly difficult and scary and truly requires professional help to overcome. If you can find nutritional facts to help challenge her ED thoughts that might be helpful.

I hated eating alone, as for some reason it made me feel like I was fat, that I shouldn't be poisoning my body with food. My best friend knows about my disorders, and will eat with me even if he isn't that hungry, just to make sure I eat. You could try this, maybe cook a meal, a healthy one, and offer to eat with her. Show her that food isn't the enemy, and food can be healthy and ok. I'd also reiterate the fact that you think she is beautiful the way she is, and that you are worried about her because you love/care about her. The best thing to do is look up recipes that look like they're healthy online. My favorite is turkey meatballs in lettuce cups with carrot strip, lettuce, and celery slaw tossed in red wine vinegar. \n\nJust try and get her to see that food isn't dangerous for her. That it isn't poison, and it helps her live. What also helped a lot was seeing people that were worse off than I am, people that were in the hospital for their disorders on feeding tubes, with hair loss and rotting teeth, etc. It might not be the nicest thing to look at, but it's the truth. However, what worked for me doesn't work for everyone. I truly hope that you're able to help her. We're all rooting for you.",

Unsweetened Greek yogurt for healthy fat that is guilt free but key to nutrient absorption and a little bit of honey to sweeten it a little more.

For myself and many people with eating disorders, it can be /very/ difficult to deal with not eating less than everyone around us. I think if you (OP) would naturally be eating more than she is, it might help her feel like she is not eating \"too much.\" I would recommend against eating in secret to try to keep up the illusion that you two are eating the same amount.\n\nAdditionally, I would caution against using the word \"healthy\" when talking to your girlfriend about her body. To a lot of people with EDs, \"healthy\" = \"fat.\" If anything, I would advise commenting on her body size at all, instead giving her compliments on her outfits, jewelry, etc., or saying she looks beautiful/lovely/etc. \n\nAgain, no disrespect to you liziphin, and I am so glad if this strategy has helped you or someone you love with recovery.

However she would have to either have a shake or a small meal to hold down the vitamin because its so rich, so idk how it will go!",

For myself and many people with eating disorders, it can be /very/ difficult to deal with not eating less than everyone around us. I think if you (OP) would naturally be eating more than she is, it might help her feel like she is not eating \"too much.\" I would recommend against eating in secret to try to keep up the illusion that you two are eating the same amount.\n\nAdditionally, I would caution against using the word \"healthy\" when talking to your girlfriend about her body. To a lot of people with EDs, \"healthy\" = \"fat.\" If anything, I would advise commenting on her body size at all, instead giving her compliments on her outfits, jewelry, etc., or saying she looks beautiful/lovely/etc. \n\nAgain, no disrespect to you liziphin, and I am so glad if this strategy has helped you or someone you love with recovery. However, I know some of these things would be difficult for me to cope with.",
