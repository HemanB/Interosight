  "selftext": "So after a few weeks of feeling nauseous, dizzy and completely empty, I finally decided to cook last night. I was about to pass out on my couch as I usually do when I\u2019m hungry but I knew I\u2019d have to go to work the next day and eat lunch with my coworkers, and I hate the comments I get when I don\u2019t eat so I decided to just make something real quick. Well I ended up making enough for two servings so last night I ate dinner for the first time in a long time. I didn\u2019t even finish the whole plate but I was so full my stomach hurt. \n\nHas anyone else noticed that when you\u2019re anorexic and don\u2019t eat for a long time, when you do it after it feels like your body is regulating itself and suddenly wants more food? I ate a whole meal and an hour later I could feel hunger creeping back, which was wild to me considering I just ate in one sitting what I usually eat in three days.",

During my last refeeding process, I wouldn't be able to finish meals and would feel sick then the hunger cue would hit me like a ton of bricks shortly after. The more regularly you can listen to it, the more regulated your brain and body are. It becomes a lot less intense",
