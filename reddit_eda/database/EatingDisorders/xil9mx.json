After I got my first hot chocolate in years, I tried a bunch of different kinds and now whenever I'm feeling a little bit down or I need a pick-me-up I go to the $1.50 gas station coffee bar and get a hot chocolate. My personal favorite is French vanilla creamer, two pumps caramel flavoring, and one pump hazlenut. It tastes like a fall drink and you can even do half coffee if you need the caffine. I hope your hot chocolate adventures go great and you get to try all the different kinds that you want to. :)",
