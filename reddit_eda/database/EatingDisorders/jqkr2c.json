  "title": "Request: No support from boyfriend",
  "selftext": "My bf and I have been dating for 2y now. This year has been taking a really bad turn on my mental health the last few months which didn\u2019t make my relationship easier. My eating disorder has been getting worse. I know I can be a hand full and I appreciate the time he was there to help me get better when I was being upset. If I look back on the first year, I was being really irrational. I feel like I\u2019ve broken him at this point, I wanted to get better and went into therapy this year. I\u2019m following DBT, going weekly to a psychologist & (since recently) a dietitian. I\u2019m really trying and I\u2019m doing better with handling my emotions and conversations but I get no more support from him especially with my ED. This makes recovery so hard for me, if I\u2019m having a hard time he just ignores me and eventually just leaves. I try to make up for the times I\u2019m upset but it\u2019s just not enough anymore. The distance keeps getting worse and I\u2019m stuck cause he doesn\u2019t know how to help even though I\u2019ve told him exactly how he can help. It just doesn\u2019t happen. I can\u2019t do this alone, especially since I feel like I\u2019m being judged by him and the people around me but I\u2019m at a breaking point. I\u2019m thinking of breaking up, since I feel like it\u2019s the best for both of us. He\u2019s clearly not happy anymore but I feel like this relationship needs to go both ways and he\u2019s pushing me down further. But I would still like some advice, I don\u2019t wanna be unreasonable but I\u2019m tired of trying and getting no support from his end.",

      "body": "Been in two very long relationships with girls with psychological and/or eating disorders, so just my take to bring some insight from the other side (without pretending to know your situation or what he is thinking/feeling).\n\nYes, it takes a real toll on your partner, especially if he feels like you have been working some anger out on him. What bothered me most was that no matter how hard you try your best, you keep being on the receiving end of a lot of the bad emotions and in the end you stop even trying to guess what you need to do to do the right thing.\n\nSo it may be possible that it's not a willingness to help, but just a feeling that he can't help. I don't know how the dynamic between you works, but maybe try and acknowledge a bit more the moments that he does support you and try to look at things from his side too.\n\nIt's up to you to find out if there is still something left in the relationship, and if yes, then I would try to salvage it if you think that improved relationship can help you with your recovery.\n\nIf not, then it's just more negative energy.",
