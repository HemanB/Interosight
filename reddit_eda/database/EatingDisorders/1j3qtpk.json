  "selftext": "I\u2019ve been binging for the past 2 years which has been off and on. I\u2019m a freshman in high school and I\u2019ve told my parents abt my eating disorder but they haven\u2019t done anything and completely forgot abt it which is so frustrating. I also just relapse today after a week of eat clean. Please can anyone give me tips on how to stop it really feels like I\u2019m not getting any help and alone on this.",

Initially it will be hard to even stop long enough to detect the feeling before you eat, with time that will become manageable and you will be able to better detect the feeling. Write it down, write \"March 6, 7pm, anxiety\" and so on.

She has a lot of free resources.\n\nIf it's a possibility, you could have even just one consultation with a dietitian, better if an ED informed or HEAS dietitian, to verify you're eating enough. Sometimes our idea of \"healthy\" eating is actually too restrictive, and we unintentionally starve ourselves. Of course at some point our body is just going to push you to eat everything in sight because, yeah, survival.\n\nI read you're in high school so you're still growing. The most important thing is to eat enough, growing requires a ton of energy and a variety of nutrients. I know it's frustrating, but if you don't manage to fully address your BED at this time, so be it. Get to adulthood and you'll have time, resources and autonomy to do so. Provided you eat enough and get there.\n\nAh, and drinking instead of eating won't work, it's just another form of restriction, which will make binges even more likely to happen.\n\nTalk about all of this with your therapist when you see them, stress how important it is to you and that you want help with it.
