  "title": "my girlfriend (16) is eating less and less and I need advice",
  "selftext": "my girlfriend has struggled with self harm and eating problems before, to the point where she'd eat a slice of bread a day for weeks. I wasn't around during these times so all i know is what she's told me. \n\nher eating was amazing, whole meals + snacks during the day, but recently I've noticed and so has she it's been getting less and less. I know she knows what's going on, and she tries to hide it but she's told me she's scared of her eating less, because the less she eats the worse the gets and its a negative cycle. she scared she's gonna go back into her old habits and im shitting bricks\n\nhow do i help her and support her, because I want to be there and show her im here for her, and I'm willing to do anything to help her get better with her eating and everything else because i care so much.\n\nI've tried telling her the scientific stuff but that's because it's all i know, and i get that's overwhelming and not helpful. a few years ago i had my own struggles with eating but no matter how hard i try it feels like i can't seem to help. ive never done or considered self harm, so i can't even begin to try relate. she's told me she knows none of this is good for her, and the further it goes the more embarrassed and helpless she feels, and it makes me wanna ball my eyes out then wrap her in bubble wrap and never let her leave her room.\n\nhow do i help her without overwhelming her or making it worse. I know most of the work will have to come from her because she needs to want the change in order for it to happen, but i still want to know everything I can do to support and help her\n\nplease help im begging ",

      "body": "If she\u2019s 16, you can\u2019t be much older. I say this because as much as you want to help, you\u2019re also probably still a child or close to. You can be a positive in her life, but you have to accept that you\u2019re not able to heal her from this.\u00a0\n\nWhat I\u2019m not seeing in your post is any mention of trusted adults, or people in her life who can intervene to get her help. Has she been in treatment before? Do her parents know she has this issue? Does she have any trusted adults in her\n\nFood/weight/frequency of eating are topics will probably always be overwhelming and unwelcome for her. Which doesn\u2019t mean they should never be brought up, but it does mean you\u2019re probably not the best person to do so. I\u2019d recommend finding someone you trust to talk about it with. A guidance counselor at school, a therapist, a parent or older sibling etc.\u00a0",

      "body": "at the end of the day, it\u2019s going to be her decision to make the changes she needs to make to be better. don\u2019t put too much pressure on yourself to be \u2018perfect\u2019 for her and try to heal her (speaking as the girl in this situation lol). For me personally the most helpful thing was when my bf would gently offer me food or snacks but not pressure to eat them. Also when wed be cuddling/hanging out/etc he\u2019d casually get up and grab a snack for himself and then offer me some after a minute. Every girl is going to be different of course but those were some of the things that helped me. Just keep doing your best to support her and show her love, you\u2019re doing awesome",

      "body": "The fact that you care about her enough to post in here begging for advice is amazing. However, I don't think there is much you can do besides not commenting on her body or what she eats. Don't even say \"positive things\" like telling her how skinny she is, she doesn't eat enough, etc because it is so triggering even if it doesn't seem like it. just be there for her. That's all you can do. that's what my boyfriend did for me and it genuinely helped so much just having that positive force in my life, especially since he was one of the only people that wasn't constantly commenting on my body and how much I was eating. Ask her to share food with you, instead of asking if she's hungry say \"i'm hungry do you want to eat\", etc. don't ask her if she's hungry because it's likely she'll just say no. DO call her beautiful and and perfect, like the other comment said, but don't make it constant. it gets overwhelming. Overall, just be normal. otherwise she might feel bad for worrying you which could cause it to get worse (at least it did for me.) \n\nI really really hope this helps at least a little bit! good luck.",

      "body": "from what you\u2019re telling me you\u2019re already doing a great job of being there for her :) especially if she feels comfortable enough to show you that she\u2019s eating, that means she has a lot of trust/love for you so that\u2019s great \ud83d\ude0ai\u2019m not sure what her love language is, but i think reassurance and compliments are something that can really help. letting her know you\u2019re always there for her, telling her she always looks pretty/beautiful etc. just general reassurance will always help no matter the person. especially compliments that aren\u2019t about appearance are nice. \n\nsomething else i can think of, idk how old you are but maybe offering to doordash her something or even doing it without telling her. i was thinking you could send her money for a coffee, but honestly if my boyfriend did that for me i\u2019d probably just save the money to avoid eating. if you decide to do this, she may get mad at you bc in her head it will come off as you force feeding her, but you can reassure her you just wanted to do something nice for her and buy her a treat/meal :)\n\nat the end of the day, if you guys call or text maybe you can ask her what she ate that day, or throughout the day you can update her on what you\u2019re eating. you have to be careful with this though because sometimes it can come off as competitive. for example if a girls bf if skinnier than her and is constantly telling her what he\u2019s eating, yet he\u2019s still skinnier than her it could come off as bragging. (insane i know but that\u2019s just anorexia for you) but from what it sounds like she doesn\u2019t see you as competition, so being like \u201ci just grabbed lunch, im eating ____ :) have you had lunch yet?/ what did you have for lunch ??\u201d it won\u2019t come as interrogative but instead you genuinely wondering about her and her day !! \n\nthat\u2019s all i could think of for now but i hope that can help you :)",
