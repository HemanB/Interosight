  "title": "Request: Is using laxatives after someone eats a sign of an ED?",
  "selftext": "I have a eating disorder myself, and I met up for food with a girl I met for the first time. When we were choosing what to eat, she said she ate already an hour or two ago so she doesn\u2019t want something too big. After she ate, she had a little sealed plastic bag with pills. She mumbled to herself that she needs to take a laxative pill. I found this extremely strange? \n\nWe have the same body types, skinny and short, I am underweight but I am unsure if she is aswell, she has a very small frame though. \n\nDoes this sound like an ED? I ask because this is the first time I\u2019ve met her and I don\u2019t think I could be friends with someone who isn\u2019t pro-recovery. For example, I met a different girl a few weeks and admitted she also has an ED, but is recovering.",

      "body": "Hi there! Well done for looking after yourself. I am sure there can be a number of reasons why people take laxatives. Maybe you can gently ask whether she is not well? That shows your care and it seems appropriate as she is not hiding the fact she is taking them. \nAs you probably know better than anyone \u2018coming out\u2019 with eating difficulties might be difficult and she might tell you. \nGood luck!",

      "body": "As other commenters have noted, there could be other explanations for what she isn\u2019t eating much and is having to take pills. If she does have an eating disorder, there\u2019s a chance she could be very secretive about it, not wanting anyone to know anything. If you met someone for the first time and we\u2019re engaging in behaviors in front of them, how would you want that person to address it? Leave it alone completely or bring it up? If you feel comfortable disclosing, you could mention that you have an ED and you\u2019re working on recovery and see if she then takes the opportunity to share anything with you.\nThen again, there\u2019s a chance she doesn\u2019t have an ED. Maybe something else is going on that requires her to watch her food or to take meals at pills. Again, taking the time to share your story and being open could encourage her to do the same.\nIf at the end of the day her behaviors, whatever the motivation, make it harder for you to stay on the recovery track, then maybe right now is not the best time to become besties.",

Like some redditors mentioned, you could try to open up about your ED to her then go from there. If it\u2019s too triggering to do so, keep her at a distance",

I get so dehydrated any time I have to take them. In fact in my experience most doctors would recommend a gentle stool softener instead, laxatives are NOT recommended for more than a week or two, so I would see if she is still taking them in a couple of weeks.",
