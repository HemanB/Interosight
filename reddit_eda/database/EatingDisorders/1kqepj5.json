  "selftext": "went to the allergist today and i had lost weight since i visited last time (healthy way this time) and was immediately praised for it. i totally understand that losing weight can help mitigate other health concerns but the automatic praise feels so uncomfortable now that i\u2019m in recovery. like when i was my lw i was not healthy in any way. then everyone became concerned when i gained weight whilst entering recovery. \n\nlike no wonder this is such a hard thing to beat. it\u2019s completely reinforced in so many different ways. \n\njust needed to vent",

      "body": "I agree wholeheartedly, and it isn't just doctors. Even as a kid, I was praised by grown women for losing weight. The last time I relapsed, I got more attention than I ever thought possible. I don't mean to glamorize low weights, though, because there is a definite point where your weight loss becomes uncomfortable and you become invisible again. But yeah, I've put on some recovery weight, and I'm still in the recommended range, but my medical paperwork tells me to lose weight again. It's maddening.",

Sigh. Can\u2019t expect them to be mind readers but she would always get on my weight and when I was finally bones she wanted me to get tested for MONO and wondered why my iron was low. Lmao.",
