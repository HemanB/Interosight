  "selftext": "Today, I got my period back after a really long time of not having a period. I\u2019m happy. I am. All of my effort has paid off and I let my body remember what it feels like to trust me again. I\u2019m no longer fearing for my physical health. I no longer fear that I ruined the future that I have worked so hard to earn. Nevertheless, I can\u2019t help but think of this feeling that I don\u2019t know what to do next. This entire year, everything I have done has been completed with a goal in mind. Anytime that things have gotten hard, I\u2019ve had this crutch to rely on because I knew that it would be worth it when I reached it. I thought that when that goal was reached, that would mark the end of all of this. I thought I would go back to how I used to be as soon as I crossed that metaphorical finish line. Now I\u2019m sitting here, and I certainly don\u2019t feel finished. I don\u2019t feel recovered. Now, that crutch is gone. I have to do this on my own now.\n\nRegardless, I feel blessed that my body trusts me again. Nothing about being at the peak of my disorder felt good. I'm proud of how far I have come. :) (Btw: Even if you didn't lose your period ever, you are still valid.)",

I think as we\u2019re on this journey we have this idea of being \u201cnormal\u201d or how we used to be again. I know I thought for me when I finally hit a healthy weight and was no longer clinically underweight, that would be it for me. What I\u2019m discovering is that my recovery from ED goes much deeper than the disordered eating. There\u2019s a lot of psychological things behind it and a ton of trauma. Working through all of that, and consistently eating differently, while rewiring my brain to think differently is a lot! I hope I get to a place one day where I feel recovered, but right now I\u2019m just happy to say I\u2019m in recovery. Best of luck OP!",

This is a massive testament to all of the (very, very) hard work that you\u2019ve doubtlessly put into recovery, and you deserve to celebrate!!!\nI totally relate to that feeling of \u201cwhere do I go next?\u201d Having a concrete goal is so helpful, but it can also leave you feeling a little underwhelmed when you finally make it. Maybe try working with your team/support people to identify a next step to strive for in your recovery? Getting your period back is a major win, but\u2014like you said\u2014you\u2019ve still got tons of room to grow :)\n\nAlso remember that, just because your period is back, that doesn\u2019t mean that you get to stop nourishing your body. Your body is healing, but it\u2019s still in a delicate place, and it\u2019s very possible to lose your period again if you stop taking care of yourself. From what I\u2019ve heard, maintaining your \u201cbig wins\u201d comes with its own set of challenges (which I\u2019m sure you will absolutely CRUSH just like you did this one). Take a minute to celebrate your win, and then pick the next goal to conquer :)",

Recovery is hard and healing is a freaking roller coaster. \n\nYou\u2019re in a weird point now, it\u2019s ok. You\u2019re allowed to enjoy your accomplishment. For what\u2019s next, maybe you need a new goal? Something else that would be healthy and happy but also attainable and measurable. It could still be related to physical health if you still need it as a crutch to not fall back on unhealthy habits, but it could also be unrelated, just something to work towards to keep your mind busy and your life full. Maybe hobby related?\n\nI hope you soon get to feel the full extend of your accomplishment, without the feeling of uncertainty you have right now. What you managed is big, special and inspiring.

I got my period back on July 22 \ud83d\ude0a. I don\u2019t consider myself fully mentally or physically recovered yet because I do still struggle mentally and I am still suffering a few consequences physically, but we\u2019re getting there! Of course, every body is different so my experience is not parallel to anyone else\u2019s experience :) Good luck in your recovery! <3",
