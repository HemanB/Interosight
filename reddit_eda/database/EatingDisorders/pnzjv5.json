It\u2019s hard to explain but it\u2019s got NOTHING to do with a body goal or image. I\u2019m genuinely not concerned with any of that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMore so, it\u2019s like I\u2019m so sad and miserable I feel like I shouldn\u2019t eat because why take care of myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know this is so depressing and I also realize that I don\u2019t actually want this for myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt\u2019s hard to explain, but it\u2019s like the food sounds good, looks good, and I know I should eat it\u2026but for some reason I tell myself no, it\u2019s not even worth the effort to eat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I don\u2019t.",

Without numbers, in a relapse day I eat about a third of what a normal meal should contain, and I\u2019m like that for as long as I\u2019m in the relapse. Since it\u2019s so little, I get brain fog, headaches, tired all the time, feel super hungry, can\u2019t keep up with my job, etc. I have to acknowledge that my symptoms of not physically taking care of myself start to become worse that whatever emotional thing triggered them. My last relapse was 9 days straight, and the last 4 days was when I was pushing and pulling with myself over whether I was going to give in and recover. But you said it yourself. It doesn\u2019t work for everyone, but I really do have to \u201csnap\u201d out of my actions. Half-recovery doesn\u2019t work, because you\u2019re still hanging on to what you think you have. The good thing is once your brain starts receiving nutrients again, it\u2019ll almost re-wire itself and your recovery brain will actually be in a better mental state than when you started restricting. You\u2019ll start to feel good again. The bloating is definitely annoying. The fatigue is normal as well. For that, I\u2019d recommend eating the majority of what you\u2019re going to have towards the end of the afternoon, all the way into the evening. Try to spread it out a little bit, every 2 hours or so, but the extreme hunger is a real thing with recovery. But at least you can sleep it off somewhat, give your head a break from the thoughts and discomfort. After a day or two I do have to use laxatives responsibly if things aren\u2019t moving because of the more intense change. And I\u2019m in no way a professional, this is just how I\u2019ve worked though it with trial and error. If you\u2019ve been restricting intensely for more than 2 weeks or so then I\u2019m guessing you\u2019ll need better help than what I can offer. You might be able to find resources through something like youtube where it\u2019ll feel really safe, or you could try a hotline and they can give you tips and recommendations. I wish you the best of luck. If you need to ask anything else or want to vent it out, feel free to, I\u2019ll still be here",
