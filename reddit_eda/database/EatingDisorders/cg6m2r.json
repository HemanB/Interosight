  "title": "Request: commenting on my food at a party",
  "selftext": "I'm a former anorexic who has also had issues with bulimia. Today I was feeling major swallowed up by my social anxiety...but I had to go to a friend's party. It was packed. The food line was crazy long and I was so stressed out about having to get in line and have everyone see me. I didn't know many people, so I felt especially nervous. In the past I would have just not ate.\n\n   I am trying to do opposite actions. So I got in line. I got salad with fatty regular Italian dressing and a piece of lasagna. Was still afraid to eat in front of everyone...I ended up eating back in the kitchen by myself. A couple friends ended up joining me and it eased my anxiety some- had some laughs etc, etc.\n\n   A couple minutes later I went back and got dessert. A small brownie and tiny piece of cake. Was feeling really proud of myself...and as I'm headed back to the kitchen a man stops me and says, \"you know that all turns to fat,  right?\" I said nothing and just looked at him...THEN a woman stops me and says, \"Hey, I saw those up there...I wonder if they're worth the calories\" I said, \"I don't know....I don't count calories\". Regardless, I ate the food. And I can't get their comments out of my head hours later. \n\n   I feel like I've been punched in the stomach and I don't know why. I find this kind of stuff especially detrimental to me and it makes me honestly hate people. I came home and ate too much food and I hate myself more. I just want to isolate and not go to parties ever. I literally forced myself to go to this one. How do you deal with this stuff? Am I overreacting?",

Your progress isn't about how those comments made you feel, it's about what you were able to achieve despite what was said! I don't have disordered eating and that would still bother the fuck out of me. They have no right to make those comments so it's a huge win for you that you were able to be confronted with a trigger and power on despite it, even if you may not feel like you did.

I remember before my eating disorder, I thought dieting was good. Hell, I thought it was virtuous or one of those ultimate life goals to pursue weight loss. And many, many people do. Even now after my eating disorder, despite some relapses, I still find is disorienting to think of who I was at that time because it was like I was another person. So I think the best thing for me is realizing that not everyone is going to understand and understandably so. Our culture praises dieting and being thin. \n\nKeep your support close and try to use instances like those to remind yourself exactly why you recovered. I\u2019m rooting for you\ud83d\udc95",

I just switched jobs and I'm so excited to start again soon. That might sound weird, but I hold my therapist in very high regard...got me through the worst times in my life.",

      "body": "\n     Thank you for pointing that out, gnosiscna. I feel that\u2019s something perhaps overlooked. Our relationship to BAD foods, that we may only eat in private. I\u2019m not comfortable myself yet to even do what she did, it\u2019s so inspiring. What do you think about secret eating of foods; any more thoughts you have on it? \n\n     I\u2019m struggling with eating during the day, and I make my boyfriend do takeout so we don\u2019t eat in public, I feel picky and listen to Ana during the day, yet change into a sloppy, gross person (in my own head, still feels real but is not) that eats more until I\u2019m full. Then I feel that the weight is put on me, I\u2019m completely a different sort of person, I feel disgusting in my own body when I eat around others, yet disgust myself on my own, just fighting and wounding myself. \n\n     I\u2019m vegan as well, so I already feel isolated in my eating. I am vegan for moral reasons, but it is making me sick and less sociable. \n     \n     I recently dropped a lot of weight, not meaning to or doing anything differently. Now I feel more obsessed about body dysmorphia. The more I think about the scale, the more it triggers phobic, debilitating thoughts of binging that I don\u2019t and haven\u2019t done in so long. My image of what my body\u2019s appearance is and how body dysmorphia plays a huge part of what I eat.\n\n      Do you think any of all my ranting(haha) can come from Depersonalization Disorder or at least plays a role in my ED?",
