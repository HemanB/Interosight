      "body": "Accept the things I cannot change and have courage to change the things I can. Look for places where you CAN find control in the chaos. So if your job is a shitshow right now, you have control in your choice as to what to do about it - you can ask for support or changes from other people at work (you don\u2019t have control over how they respond but you do have control over whether or not you ask), you can change how you approach work (how much you put in, what boundaries you set around your time and what you take on, when and how you take breaks), you can choose to tough it out in hopes that it will be temporary, or you can search for a new job.  You can even try all of these things at different times. It helps me to feel like I\u2019m taking action where I can, even when there are certain things I have no control over. It\u2019s going to feel MORE out of control if you are spending time and effort trying to control things that you have no real control over. \n\nThe things within my control are MY thoughts, MY words, MY actions, MY choices, MY effort. If we\u2019re trying to control other people\u2019s actions/choices/etc were gonna have a hard time, but you have choice in how you respond.",

Typically the urge to use behaviors comes when you\u2019re feeling some really intense feelings- sadness, anxiety, anger, guilt, etc. They help to numb you out so the emotions themselves don\u2019t feel so distressing. Learn to be okay with those feelings and find less destructive ways to express them. In addition to some other books suggested, you could try Radical Acceptance by Tara Brach.",
