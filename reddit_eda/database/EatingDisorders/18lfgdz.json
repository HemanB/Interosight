  "selftext": "UPDATE 2\nHer blood work came back with some indicators of extreme malnutrition to the point I think she might end up admitted tomorrow. \n\n\nUPDATE\nWe went to the appointment. My pediatrician was phenomenal with asking slick questions that weren't too obvious. She told me in private she was concerned because my daughter had lost a significant amount of weight and double digits off her percentage on the growth chart. She is starting with blood tests, liver function, kidneys, diabetes testing, and much more, to validate any medical/physical reasons, and then said she'll call me tomorrow. She was very discrete in the conversation in front of my daughter which was my biggest fear. She asked my daughter a series of all kinds of questions unrelated to weight or eating and then slipped in a question about how her appetite was and my daughter said \"I don't want to eat\" and I was so relieved that she said that. I'm not sure why I was relieved, because I still want this to not be happening, but I think I also feel her admitting it is a big step and it may mean she's not shamed, and so maybe it will be easier to help. I don't know. My mind is in so many places right now. \n\nThank you to every single one of you that has commented. I can't tell you what a difference it has made for me. \n\nOriginal post:\n\nHello,\nI have an 8 year old daughter, let's call her L. \n\nL has recently started showing some red flags, such as weight loss to a now unhealthy BMI for her age, extremely underweight. She has began having an excuse why something is wrong with every meal, and why she can't eat it, including things she used to love. She's avoidant of food, snacks, milk, everything. She hides her body under baggy clothing, even when it's hot, and I have heard her talk about calories (she's eight!). I recently started offering meal replacement shakes, but she doesn't \"like\" any of them. \n\nI'm concerned. I have a pediatrician appointment this week but I'm so scared. I am scared because if I say the wrong thing to the doctor, and my daughter hears it, will it plant more seeds or make it worse? \n\nI plan to write my concerns down on paper and hand it to the pediatrician but I'm just so lost. \n\nI don't know how to help. \n\nI don't know what I'm asking but at this age, what advice would you have for me?",

      "body": "Im sorry youre dealing with this. \n\nFirst, good job for noticing these flags and setting up an appointment. \n\nSecond, understand right now that eating disorders are a specialization. Your pediatrician may not have any experience with this at ALL and they can lead you incorrectly. But they can at least assess there are not more medical things at play that could cause her to do these things. \n\n\nBut lets assume it is an eating disorder blossoming\u2014\n\nYou need to seek out an eating disorder specialist NOW. A medical doctor and a therapist/counselor of sorts who specializes in pediatric eating disorders. Do not let anyone else treat your daughter. They may mean well but create more harm. \n\nYou are now the person to advocate for her and you also need to understand eating disorders inside and out. Not to overwhelm you, just letting you know the facts. I would definitely have a conversation with your pediatrician before the appointment, letting them know the extent of all your concerns. Do not let your daughter hear any of these concerns. Then, the doctor may speak to her with this information in mind during their assessment.\n\nNot sure what your home environment is or isnt but some basics: do not force food on her. Do not bring up food or lecture her. Do not talk about her body\u2014 good or bad. Set good examples for eating yourself. Reinforce that all bodies are normal and food is fuel.\n\nMy eating disorder started at 10-11. I am 34 years old and would not wish this on anyone, not even my enemies. My eating disorder started as a single adolescent thought \u2013 \u201cI look ugly and fat compared to other girls.\u201d It transformed into a coping mechanism for my anxiety, unstable home life, and my inability to name my emotions (my family never spoke about emotions). I am 24 years away from my 10 year old self. I do not think (or care) about looks or my body. Eating disorders are never just about looks. Theyre deep-seeded, anxiety-fueled coping mechanisms to a problem. You, a medical team, and your daughter need to find the problem. The problem may simply be she wants to be like other girls. (\u201cSkinny and pretty\u201d). It most likely has not become more than that, which is still bad, but you can make big strides and help now before it gets worse. \n\nGood luck OP. Sorry to sound short, on my cell and difficult to type out. Let me know if you have questions",

      "body": "Yes it\u2019s an eoedemic the age for early body dissatisfaction has gotten lower. Studies are showing children as young as 6 years old are now actively showing body dissatisfaction and body dysmorphia signs. I developed my ED at age 11. 25 f fully recovered now but wouldn\u2019t consider myself truly recovered until this year. A decade of on and off recovery and treatment and many relapses recovery truly isn\u2019t linear. First and foremost it\u2019s not your fault, it\u2019s a coping mechanism. How we talk about food and diet culture are known to fuel and exasperate the illness though. I know a lot of my ED behaviors truly were passed down learned behaviors from family due to diet-culture. I don\u2019t know the house of dynamics with food and what you have taught your children in regards to food but I know food labeling and calling food junk is normalized but disordered and fueled my illness. Be careful how you talk about food and the messages you could be sending about food and bodies. Seek professional help. Don\u2019t force or pressure to eat but rather encourage and promote eating opportunities for your daughter. The evidence based treatment for EDs right now is a team of trauma informed therapist and intuitive eating dietician. I didn\u2019t get help till I was 15 and went to my first program as a minor. It\u2019s a coping mechanism. It\u2019s serving a purpose for her. For me it started around puberty which is already a difficult time and then culture shock and being bullied for my weight and mom that was diet culture obsessed and pediatrician that pointed out my BMI and told me to lose weight at age 11 all contributed to the development of my ED. I also found out I had ADHD and a lot of my ED struggles were also sensory issues related as well as cognitive distortions and coping mechanism. Truly a multifaceted issue. Mental health is complex. Early intervention is key. I\u2019d recommend getting her help asap and talk to doctor for referrals for a good ED program if necessary. Treatment saved my life on many occasions. It\u2019s a deadly disease. Eating disorders used to be number one for years now second highest mortality rate of any MENTAL ILLNESS following opioid abuse. \n\nShe is trying to cope and survive the best way she knows how right now and it happens to be a maladaptive coping mechanism. Social media can be very dangerous for minors nowadays days especially with the pro Ana content and normalized disorder eating content in general. I fear to have kids due to this. Misinformation on health and bodies is rampant and social media influencers are out here spreading false info like wildfire. A intuitive eating dietician that specializes in eating disorders and therapist that specializes in eating disorders is highly recommended",

And thank you for the advice about seeking out an expert vs a general therapist. Once I have a referral, I'll have some say in which provider I choose so I'll start researching NOW.   \n\n\nAnd yes, my husband and I have been so incredibly careful not to ever say anything in front of her or within ear shot as we discussed our concerns between ourselves, and I did write down some of my main concerns and will hand that to the nurse at intake, asking them not to ask any obvious questions in front of my daughter. My daughter thinks the doctors appointment is just a regular yearly physical exam, so we'll do height/weight, and I'm hoping the doctor can ask some basic slick questions without being obvious, and then I'll have my husband take my daughter out to the waiting room. I'm just not sure at her age what appropriate conversation is with her, and that's why I need help. I'm hoping to find a local parent resource where I can learn how to support and not trigger.... because I am LOST and mostly frozen.   \n\n\nAs for home, we have NEVER forced food on her, and have never withheld desert to finish food, or grounded her for not eating, or anything, BUT I admit that we used to occasionally give her a hard time about refusing to try food. But, we have slipped up and expressed frustration like, \"Really! I really need you to eat something\" and then I hate myself after. We RARELY do this, and especially have policed ourselves since we started to suspect it was more than just pickiness. We're trying hard to do better. I was never yelling or making her in trouble, but she's a very very compliant child and any level of parental disappointment is enough to upset her. She's very much a parent-pleaser, so I wish I hadn't have made those gaffs. But they are rare.   \n\n\nAnd we've tried with the food is fuel thing, like when we go for hike, I'll say things like \"Oh I can't wait to refuel with dinner. We used a ton of energy and it'll be good to feed our bodies\" but now I'm like \"Did I lay it on too thick??\" Argh, the mom-guilt is intense. I'm trying so hard, and I'm afraid I'll overcorrect or if I try harder, it's going to look like calorie obsession. \n\nThank you!",

It can serve more than one purpose too, I know one of the purposes it serves for me was certainly control during times in my life where I got like I had none. It also doesn\u2019t help that eating disorder mentality and behaviors are so normalized and disguised as health that it can be far too easy for sufferers to pretend to be okay or just \u201cnot hungry\u201d or \u201cpicky eaters\u201d and to be believed because restriction is already relatively normalized and even encouraged. She\u2019s at an age where girls may start talking about bodies and even dieting during puberty and comparing bodies in gym class and what not. I remember in middle school being weighed and not really being aware of my body until that general age. That\u2019s when girls start to compare and be aware of their bodies as well. I think conversations about puberty and how it\u2019s normal for bodies to change can be helpful at this stage. Definitely seek professional intervention!

I\u2019ve drilled into my son that calories are units of energy and the importance of vitamins and macronutrients to keep our \u201cearth suits\u201d healthy. I was proud when he told his friend that you need calories for energy and that that there are no bad foods. \nYour little one is so young and I feel your pain. The Instagram page \u201cKids Eat in Color\u201d might offer some useful resources to you, but I would also seek out an ED Certified dietician. At her age, I would highly recommend the Maudsley approach, and avoid any treatment centers where she might be exposed to older children with eating disorders. As someone who entered eating disorder treatment inpatient in middle school, I can say, without a doubt, it only added fuel to the fire. \n   The fact that you care and are reaching out already speaks volumes about what a wonderful mother you are. My heart really hurts for you, and I hope you can get to the bottom of this soon. As a side note, when I was in treatment as an adolescent, there was a nine year old misdiagnosed with anorexia. It turned out she had developed an extreme phobia of germs and bacteria, after learning about food borne illnesses. She didn\u2019t know how to articulate it or was scared to do so. Once that was figured out and addressed with exposure therapy, she quickly recovered. I\u2019m really hoping it\u2019s something similar with your daughter.",

This is hard on both ends. It\u2019s hard for her, but it\u2019s also very hard to watch your child suffer. The mom guilt is real, but you are handling this so beautifully and tenderly. Please do not get discouraged that a lot of us had eating disorders at a young age and they continued for years. \n\nAll of us DID NOT get the help we so desperately needed. You are doing things differently. You are doing the right thing. You are doing what our caregivers SHOULD have done. \n\nGreat job mama! I speak for everyone when I say, we are so SO proud of you! \n\nSending so much love to you, your husband, and your baby girl. I just sent a prayer to Jesus for you guys & I will continue doing so. \n\nYou\u2019ve got this mama. You have it in the bag.",

It\u2019s hard enough without food & body dysmorphia issues. \n\nI know exactly what you mean though. I started struggling in fifth grade. My mom would just ignore it for the most part. At 20 years old, my mom could no longer deny that I had an issue, and called many places and found a wonderful hospital for me to go to. At that time she admitted to me, that she thought (when it first began at 12 years old) it was just a \u201cphase\u201d and that I would grow out of it. \n\nWhile it was hurtful to hear, I appreciated that she admitted it. I realized then, that she desperately didn\u2019t want it to be real. I\u2019m 25 now, I still struggle. \n\nI think, looking back, I would\u2019ve appreciated somebody making it real for me. I struggled in secret, and feeling like I didn\u2019t *really* have a problem, because if I did, somebody would have done something about it. I felt neglected, as if my problems didn\u2019t matter like everyone else\u2019s did. \n\nI promise you are doing the right thing. I promise. \n\nShe will be so grateful when she\u2019s older. You are showing her great care. \n\nPlease note, in the meantime, she will most likely be angry or sad that you are doing this. You & your husband might ask yourselves \u201cAre we doing this right?\u201d \u201cWhat if we\u2019re doing this wrong?\u201d \u201cAre we hurting her?\u201d\n\nI can assure you both though, you are doing this the right way. Treating her tenderly, like you are, will help. You are noticing the signs and taking action. That\u2019s all you can do, mama. By making it real, you are taking control. It is no longer controlling you.",

You haven\u2019t done anything wrong to cause this. \n\n**You. haven\u2019t. done. anything. wrong.**\n\nThis is your first time at life too. \n\nOur lives are complicated by nature. It was always meant to be that way. We will never be satisfied by things we think will satisfy us. \n\nI\u2019ve had many traumas throughout my life. Some were harder and others easier, but all have led to the same thing: Death.\n\nNot physical death. Mental. \n\nI\u2019ve been fighting to live my whole life. Sometimes it just feels like a prison. The *only* reason I\u2019m even here today is because of Jesus. When my soul wails, God hears me. \n\nI know your soul has been wailing for a long time. You\u2019ve had trauma, you\u2019ve had anxiety. You\u2019ve dealt with tough things. You\u2019ve dealt with other peoples selfishness. I\u2019m so sorry. Nobody should have done the things they did, to you. \n\nI know that this issue in particular is probably one of the harder things you\u2019ve been through, & I just wanted to let you know that God hears you.
