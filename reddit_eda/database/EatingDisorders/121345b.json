  "selftext": "It makes me really mad when I see moms putting their children who are very young on their toxic diet. I remember seeing a reddit post where a mom forced her daughters on exercise machines and restricted all junk food (even at bdays and holidays) which caused them ED. I get they\u2019re \u201chealthy\u201d but once you grow up with that toxic food relationship, it\u2019s hard to get out of the cycle. Some people should just not be moms.\n\nAlso this goes for vice versa. (Parents who fill up their house with junk food and let their kid binge.)",
