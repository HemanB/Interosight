  "selftext": "I started going camping with some friends. I didn't do it with my ED (binge eating, texture issues, picky eating) in mind at all. Purely just to get outside and trying to be social. \n\nThey take turns making meals on trips, and it's forced me to eat a lot of things I never would have tried on my own. They don't know about my ED. \n\nAt home I've made chili and corn. I've eaten some more breakfasts than usual. Had asparagus and peppers and a strawberry. I've never eaten any of those things before, but being around other people pushed me to try.",
