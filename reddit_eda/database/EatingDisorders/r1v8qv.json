  "title": "Request: How to enjoy Thanksgiving at my bf\u2019s family\u2019s house when they barely eat?",
  "selftext": " \n\nI\u2019m going over to my boyfriend\u2019s family\u2019s Thanksgiving tomorrow. This will be my first big holiday since being diagnosed with an ED and entering recovery.\n\nThis holiday is already a challenge for me, but going to his family\u2019s place is going to make it even harder for me. Simply put: they barely eat.\n\nYou know those scenes in movies where someone cooks an extravagantly large breakfast, just for another character to take a bite of toast, say they\u2019re stuffed, and leave? That is my boyfriend\u2019s family to a tee.\n\nI\u2019ve been out to dinner with them several times. They\u2019ll eat a small portion of whatever it is they order, then take the rest home.\n\nHis mother is the type of mom who eats a yogurt for breakfast and doesn\u2019t eat anything else all day. He\u2019s adopted some of these same habits, and it\u2019s understandable: the eating patterns you\u2019re raised around are typically the ones you eventually adopt yourself.\n\nI want to enjoy the day and not stress about it when I inevitably feel hungry for dinner and want to eat more than they eat. I\u2019m so stressed about this already and I can feel myself dreading what should be a nice day.\n\nAny advice would be helpful :/",

What I'm doing to prepare is reminding myself that food has no moral value, it is just food. And I try to view the situation as I feel more sorry for them because they're missing out on happy parts of life for arbitrary reasons.",

We had to learn to follow what the body says not our other unhealthy thoughts. So if possible, and this is easier said than done, enjoy the food despite their tablespoon serving of mashed potatoes. I've also had to train people not to make comments. It's not fun, but I think people in general need to shut the hell up and mind their own business about what other people are eating.  If you're inclined, i would love to hear how it went.",

I've started reminding myself that every body and metabolism are different, my needs are different from everyone else's and honouring my hunger and dietary needs comes before conformity",

Try to have a yummy filling breakfast beforehand so if you end up feeling too overwhelmed you know that you\u2019ve already nourished your body a bit. And try to remind yourself that food isn\u2019t bad, we need it to survive, and if you need more food you should get it to help your body and your mind.",

So I can\u2019t eat a meal at a big gathering without wanting to rip my skin off afterwards. My tip? Black everyone out and focus on your plate. You have suffered for a long time and worked hard to be able to finally enjoy a meal. The food is your fight for survival, it\u2019s your gift at the end of the tunnel. Fuck the other people. Just relish and enjoy your food. Bc it\u2019s not about them. It\u2019s about the joy you experience eating. They can go fuck themselves if they end the meal with a comment like \u201cwow you put away a lot\u201d. Yes tf I did. Bc I almost died a few times. You\u2019ll get it buddy, good luck",
