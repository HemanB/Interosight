  "selftext": "Hi, I have a 14 year old daughter and over the past few months I've grown worried about her eating habits. She has lost quite a bit of weight in a short amount of time, and on multiple occasions has expressed hating her body.\n\nFrom what I can gather she doesn't eat anything most days, and on days where she does it's not a lot of food. I'll also see her make food but not eat it quite often I'm sure if thats related though. \n\nI've approached her about this once and she got very defensive and swore she was eating frequently but just didn't like eating with an audience.  \n\nI'm very worried about her. I don't know how to get her help or what to say to her. I also dont know if I'm just reading too far into things. She's my world and I would do anything to help her. \n",
