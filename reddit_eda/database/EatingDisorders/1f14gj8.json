  "selftext": "Hi everyone. I\u2019ve noticed that recovery is often just associated with weight gain, but there\u2019s so much more to it. I wanted to share some of the incredible positives I\u2019ve experienced as I\u2019ve started recovering:\n\n**1. Improved Performance:**\u00a0I\u2019m so much better at working out and playing my sport. Although I\u2019m still getting back into shape, I actually have energy and can enjoy working out again. I\u2019m also much stronger at soccer now.\n\n**2. Rediscovered Personality:** My personality came back. That's all. It feels amazing. I remembered I am actually funny. \n\n**3. Enhanced Intelligence:**\u00a0I\u2019ve noticed I\u2019m so much smarter now! I did better in school during my recovery, despite the challenges. I can have deeper thoughts and conversations, and I feel more engaged in everything I do.\n\n**4. Emotional Stability:**\u00a0I\u2019m not as angry anymore. I used to snap at people when I was sick and thought I was just a mean person. Now, I\u2019m more enjoyable to be around.\n\n**5. Positive Attention:**\u00a0Boys have started to notice me and show interest. Before, they either didn\u2019t notice me or were concerned about my health.\n\n**6. Heightened Experiences:**\u00a0Everything is more vibrant\u2014music, nature, emotions. It\u2019s like life is in HD now.\n\n**7. Old Passions:**\u00a0I\u2019ve revisited old hobbies and interests. I actually have the time and energy to focus on things I used to enjoy.\n\n**8. Better Sleep:**\u00a0My sleep has improved so much. I used to struggle with sleep, but now I can sleep in and feel rested.\n\n**9. Womanly Appreciation:** This one is kind of random but I actually feel like a woman again. I've started to appreciate my hips and curves. \n\n**10.** **Social Life:**\u00a0I\u2019m much more social and can truly enjoy events, including all the yummy food that comes with them!\n\n**11. Healthy Hair:**\u00a0I have tons of baby hairs now because my hair is growing back thicker and curlier. No more bald spots!\n\n**12.** **Renewed Libido:**\u00a0My sex drive has returned, and it\u2019s amazing! I didn't realize how much I missed it. \n\nThere are A LOT more positives that come with recovery. These are just some that happened to me that I wanted to highlight. There is a reason recovery exists. It is not  \"weight gain\", it is recovery from an illness. You go from sick to healthy. You get your life back. ",
