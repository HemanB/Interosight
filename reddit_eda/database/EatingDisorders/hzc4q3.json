I\u2019ve always been very self conscious about my weight and basically everything about me I\u2019ve recently in the past 4-5 years roughly and only recently have been almost fantasizing about throwing up it comes and goes but it comes back stronger each time is it just me or is it something I should talk to my therapist about thanks in advance",

      "body": "In psychology, it becomes a disorder if it interferes with normal day-to-day function.  For instance, obsessive-compulsive behavior/thoughts become a disorder if, for instance, you spend too much time checking locks and washing hands.  So if eating behaviors or thoughts about eating prevent you from eating properly on a daily basis, it could be considered a disorder.",
