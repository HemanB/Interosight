  "selftext": "Has anyone dealt with this? \n\nBasically, I\u2019ve been told I am in denial of having an eating disorder by a professional. But I have noticed, the more I\u2019m aware of my eating disorder, and fear of gaining weight, the more I want to keep my body underweight. I will look up photos of other girls, and convince myself my unhealthy habits are fine and that my underweight body is attractive. \n\nThe less I think about my ED, the more I want to gain weight, and see my body as sick. \n\nPlease help, thanks!",

      "body": "Yes. Sometimes I fall into traps of being too focused on my ED, and at that point I start to think of it so much that I almost romanticize it or grow an affinity for it. I always think of it like this: the more its on my mind, the more it is keeping me company and distracting me from my underlying issues. Therefore, once I try to focus on improving I seem to somehow do worse or cling to the ED even harder. It\u2019s odd.",

Now I openly speak about it with my bf and other close people, I feel almost no shame and sometimes even a certain sense of pride. There are moments when I feel superior than other people (normies) because I have an extensive knowledge about nutrition and fitness, and my habits and abnormal - hence, according to my brain, better.",
