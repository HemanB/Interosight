  "selftext": " \n\nso, i have a very bad relationship with food...i\u2019m underweight, scared to eat, always paranoid about what i eat and the portions i eat, i always bring myself down if i feel i eat too much (xxx cal which is way under what i burn) i excessively exercise cause i feel like it\u2019ll burn the \u201cdamage\u201d my mind is telling me i\u2019m doing...i don\u2019t think i have an eating disorder but i have a bad relationship with food...today i ate yyy calories (more than I burn) because i\u2019m tired of living in fear of what and how much i eat...and honestly it feels great...i\u2019m full, but i\u2019m worryless...i feel as if it showed me eating a little over won\u2019t hurt me and if i do gain some weight from this itll me how much it actually takes to GAIN extra weight...i\u2019ll know that just a small number calories over what i\u2019m eating every so often will not hurt..thanks for reading if you got this far...\n\ni have no one to talk to about this and to rant to about how happy it made me.",
