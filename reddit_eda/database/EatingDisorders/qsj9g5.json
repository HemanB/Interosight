  "selftext": " \n\nHas anyone found that they replace their eating disorder post recovery with another thought/behavior/obsession?\n\nI've been struggling with intrusive thoughts on a certain subject and although it's gotten a lot better, I haven't been able to totally shake them.\n\nI think in some ways this thought/obsession mimics my eating disorder (giving myself a way to put myself down, a secret goal, also operates relationally, etc). I was wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar and what has been helpful for them.\n\nThanks!",

I will tell myself things like \"I am no longer alone, I can call someone, I can take a walk, write or read, people love me, there are people outside\". Movement, and singing helps a lot! \n\nAlso I try not to hate myself for giving into the anxiety sometimes. Remember the pain caused by the ED and recognise the progress, the strength you showed in recovering! Also, we will never be fully recovered or \"normal\". The anxiety will always resurface somehow but we will know better and better how to objectify it and deal with it, without it impacting our life so much. Congratulations, and good luck, brave person!",

      "body": "I also have ocd. I think I've had it for most of my life, but it only morphed into something that I recognized as maybe being OCD when the pandemic started. At that point my obsessive thoughts started to be focused on contamination. \n\nBasically, if you find yourself getting stuck in obsessive thought spirals about anything it might be ocd. I've had a variety of themes over my life, sometimes it is health anxiety, sometimes it is everyone hates me, when I was a kid I'd get stuck thinking every noise I heard was someone breaking into the house and trying to kill me, I couldn't stop thinking about it. \n\nThe other component is the compulsion.  In more traditional forms that can be the repeated hand washing, or checking if the door is locked.  I've been known to keep circling my block to double check that my garage door is down because each time the door was out of sight I wouldn't trust myself that the door was really down. I was late to work more than once because I would keep circling back to check.  I can also get stuck googling.  That can happen with the health anxiety, I get stuck thinking my scratchy throat might not jyst be allergies and then I will Google for hours trying to reassure myself it isn't cancer. \n\nSo, OCD isn't about being neat or organized for some of us.\n\nI only developed my restrictive eating once I started being afraid of things being contaminated.  So, my disordered eating is OCD related for me.  It is weird, I started having thought spirals about my appearance once I'd lost some weight after I became afraid to eat. That was never one of my themes, now it is.  So, for me my focuses will definitely change over time.  That's why I clicked on your post, it sounded familiar to me.",
