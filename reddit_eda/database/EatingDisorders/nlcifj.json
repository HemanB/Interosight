  "selftext": "I (23F) am still in the process of recovering from an eating disorder undeveloped at 16. Today I overheard my sister (14F) purging in the bathroom. She isn\u2019t sick and she\u2019s taken a recent interest in calorie counting and intermittent fasting. She\u2019s a perfectly healthy weight for her her age and height. How can I go about approaching her about this? I don\u2019t want to let it get to the point my ED got to.",

My wife was crying one time because she heard me throwing up after dinner 2 night in a row. I recently been losing a bunch of weight and she thought i was just throwing up everything i ate. I hate hiccups a lot and if you make your self throw up they go away. She went from crying to laughing at me very fast. Hoping for the best",

      "body": "I assume she knows about your ED but if she doesn\u2019t then tell her about it and maybe express that you could try to help her find help if your family can afford it. She may not want help but she also might be waiting for someone to notice what\u2019s going on. At 13, I was always a little touched and a little terrified when someone noticed I wasn\u2019t really eating much. I always just shrugged it off saying I wasn\u2019t hungry. You could start gently with the calorie counting and intermittent fasting and just talk to her about it and your concerns and if she seems receptive then mention the purging since it is often wrapped in shame more so than more typical diet-like behaviors. I started purging at 14 or 15 and if someone had heard me then I think I would\u2019ve denied it with everything I had. Alternatively you could come in strong with the purging and say combined with the other things you are concerned. You\u2019ll have to assess which one you think will work better. There is the risk that once you mention it she will try to hide everything more, but you will probably be able to recognize if that is happening if she suddenly stops mentioning her new food habits. I hope you can get through to her.",

It's terrifying seeing the people you love harming themselves the same way you do.\nTalk to her, heart-to-heart, about your own struggles. The downside is that she may think you're lecturing her and she might get upset. You know how hard it is to admit there's something wrong.\nTry to find in your environment what could be a trigger of the disorder. For example, if someone in your family says hurtful things or even seemingly innocent sentences that can be hurtful to your sister. Try to correct what you can in your direct environment.\nGood luck, I know it's not easy.",
