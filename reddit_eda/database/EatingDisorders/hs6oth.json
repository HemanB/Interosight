  "selftext": " \n\nI had a little bit of a rock bottom situation a few weeks ago so I decided it was finally time to get a therapist but when I asked my mom she told me therapy is for the weak and that all girls have bad eating habits for a little while, it\u2019s not a big deal.\n\nI now really don\u2019t know what to do cause on one hand my ED brain is like \u201cshe\u2019s right, you\u2019re still fat keep going\u201d but my actual brain just wants help and for this to start to be over\n\nSo yeah I just wanted to ask wtf anyone thinks I should do, if you guys decide to not post this I would really appreciate any tips you have cause I am not in a good place\n\n(I also tried getting an online therapist but everyone I reached out to said I needed parental consent)",

If you\u2019re in the US sometimes you can go through a school psychologist, counselor, or social worker without parental consent and they can connect you to ED resources. They could also advocate for you and try to get your moms support so that you can get an ED therapist",

I think everyone should see a therapist at some point in their lives. It is unnatural to have 100% self-esteem or to be 100% perfect.

She still didn\u2019t get it, came home 5 months later and she thought I was \u201ccured\u201d which clearly 20 years of disordered eating does not go away in a few months.. so she was awful any time of slipped up or anything, but I was lucky cuz I live in canada so my therapists and dietitian are all free so Ii meet with them 3 times a week.\n\nThey constantly tell me how well I\u2019m doing and how much I\u2019ve changed from even a year ago, and they have tried to meet with my mum but even they were like I\u2019m sorry but there\u2019s no changing her, which I\u2019ve come to accept, she\u2019s 67 years old like you can\u2019t tell her anything lol she thinks she knows what\u2019s best for me and tells me my therapists,counsellors, dieticians are full of shit... apparently mom knows everything lol.. I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s best to keeep her out of the loop with my recovery, and if asks just always say \u201cI\u2019m doing good, I\u2019m seeing my therapist tomorrow\u201d(even if I\u2019m not lol) and then that just ends the convo right there .good luck with everything and just remember you\u2019re mom doesn\u2019t need to know every detail, especially if it\u2019s going to make things worse for you!(one of the biggest lessons I learned in inpatient, she doesn\u2019t have to know every single thing, and if you think her response will harm your recovery it\u2019s best not to say anything at all about it to her!!) stay strong, you are worth it and I know you can beat this!! Msg me anytime if ever want advice or to talk,, I\u2019ve been through it alll more than once so I know how difficult it can be\ud83d\udc95",
