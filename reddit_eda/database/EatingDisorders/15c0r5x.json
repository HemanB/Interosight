  "selftext": "I (24F) work as a server at a restaurant and last night I had a 2 top. The one woman looked at me and said \u201cyou\u2019re so cute, so tiny.\u201d I was like dang, had to add tiny. They went on and on about it and she was like \u201cI was gonna say I used to be like you, but I wasn\u2019t. Don\u2019t have kids!\u201d While laughing. As always, I didn\u2019t know what to say so I just smiled told them I get it from my mother. She had six kids and swims every day. The other woman chimed in, \u201cI would drown if I was your size and went swimming.\u201d They\u2019re both laughing together. I was shaking and almost crying when I left the table so I had to go outside to take a minute. \nI get comments about how \u201cskinny\u201d I am almost regularly, and these comments struck me a little harder than most. I am fed up with smiling and acting like there\u2019s no problem. I don\u2019t think people should be so comfortable making comments and jokes about anyone\u2019s body size. \nI just don\u2019t know how to say something when I\u2019m at work and want to remain professional. Any advice?",

Any one of us could have cancer, a hyper-thyroid issue or dozens of other medical maladies. Still: It's up to us to set appropriate boundaries, since we cannot control what others say.  \n\nI agree with just about all the advice in this thread; you owe NO explanations, but people like these will be taken aback when you choose to abandon any shame, because there is NONE to be had. Anything from \"Your comment strikes me as incredibly personal; may I take your order for the meal now?\"  to \"Thanks. I have an illness.\"...or even *blank stare* \n\nWhatever you do, we are with you in spirit. This goes for all of us here.  Never be ashamed, because shame is where our sicknesses fester.

Any one of us could have cancer, a hyper-thyroid issue or dozens of other medical maladies. Still: It's up to us to set appropriate boundaries, since we cannot control what others say.  \n\nI agree with just about all the advice in this thread; you owe NO explanations, but people like these will be taken aback when you choose to abandon any shame, because there is NONE to be had. Anything from \"Your comment strikes me as incredibly personal; may I take your order for the meal now?\"  to \"Thanks. I have an illness.\"...or even *blank stare* \n\nWhatever you do, we are with you in spirit. This goes for all of us here.  Never be ashamed, because shame is where our sicknesses fester.
