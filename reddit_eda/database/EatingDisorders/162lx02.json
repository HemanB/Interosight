  "selftext": "my mother is going to have weight loss surgery soon (gastric bypass). i know it\u2019s selfish, i know it\u2019s unfair, but i feel like shit when she talks about it. i want to cry when i hear about how much weight she\u2019s gonna lose. i compare obsessively when she mentions what she has to eat in preparation and what she\u2019ll be eating afterwards. i\u2019m not thin; i don\u2019t just say that because of body dysmorphia, my weight really is over average. so i ruminate on how i\u2019d feel if she got thinner than me. currently, it\u2019s the main internal justification (or excuse) i have for continuing my disordered behaviours.\n\nshe doesn\u2019t know that i have an eating disorder so i can\u2019t really ask her to talk about it less even if i wanted to. i don\u2019t trust her to know about any of my struggles. we don\u2019t have a great relationship because of how she was in my childhood. besides, if i asked her to talk less about it to me, she\u2019d dismiss me, and continue. i\u2019ve tried to ask her not to talk about it in more vague terms, and she just says it\u2019s fine because she\u2019s only talking about herself.\n\ni don\u2019t know what to do\u2026",

It was rude of me to just put that as an answer\u2014but as someone on the other side, I couldn\u2019t think of where to even begin. \n\nNow that you\u2019ve said your comment, I do have a couple ideas that may give a pinch of clarity.\n\nWhile it\u2019s all too easy to compare your body to others, it\u2019s leading you somewhere emotionally difficult. That much is clear. Perhaps a different way to try thinking about it (easier said than done) would be to see it like you\u2019re both on the same team in a relay race. The race to being a healthy weight, I suppose. She got the turn to cross this finish line first, hitting the goal. You don\u2019t sound like you resent Mom for doing this; however, it\u2019s clearly striking a chord\u2014especially when you ask her nicely to drop the subject, she doesn\u2019t. Parents can be\u2026challenging to get to see your perspective, much less respect a boundary they may see you as being \u201cimmature\u201d about (when really you\u2019re just communicating your needs in the way you can for now). That often can\u2019t be solved until they stop seeing you as a child and instead begin seeing the adult you are. That\u2019s THEM needing therapy or harsh wake-up calls or both, none of which is your job to make happen for her. \n\nGoing back to the race. Some people walk, jog, or sprint\u2014she took a shortcut, and it sounds like that\u2019ll be fine. (It\u2019s not cheating; just different.) PLEASE don\u2019t be mean to yourself if you can\u2019t do the same for yourself that she\u2019s having done with this surgery\u2014if anything, maybe use it as motivation that it\u2019s possible to plan something like that out for yourself in the future (if that appeals to you). Or you could walk/jog/sprint the race. Whichever way, it\u2019s about YOU being comfortable with the plan and its result. There are no rules, so as long as you\u2019re not hurting yourself, your weight journey is yours. It\u2019ll take as long as it takes, and every success will be YOURS.\n\nBest of luck.",

As a psych student and someone who works in mental health and is going on to be a clinician in my senior year--I am incredibly aware of the stigma in DSM-5 diagnosis in regards to the fact that the only difference in symptoms between \"atypical\" anorexia and anorexia is literally just the weight component which reinforces weight stigma surrounding EDs and the already existing stigma that they have a certain \"look\" rather than the fact that this is a life threatening MENTAL illness--not a weight disorder. \n\nI'm genuinely confused on the point you were trying to make here to he honest. \n\nDieting behaviors and the Dieting mentality mirror the ED mentality and behaviors--there's no difference. They both encourage ignoring hunger/fullness cues, cutting our entire food groups, engages in food labeling and attaching morality to food, encourages restriction which fuels binging, and then ironically shames binging behaviors while putting restriction on a pedestal and even disguising disordered behaviors such as restriction as \"health\" promoting behaviors. \n \nMy opinion-- restriction by nature is disordered. If it weren't, it wouldn't be a literal ED behavior in the DSM-5. There's no way to make Dieting AKA ED behaviors \"health promoting\" in my opinion. \n\nMy opinion of what a HEALTHY relationship with food that encourages actual health promoting behaviors would be: intuitive eating--as was introduced to me by the professionals in recovery. Everyone was born a intuitive eaters, we lose this when we engage in diet-culture and the Dieting mentality. Dieting disconnects us from our body and teaches us we must fear and cannot trust our bodies. Intuitive eating breeds body re-connection. \n\nIf you are trying to argue that Dieting promotes a healthy relationship with food then I disagree and we can just agree to disagree because Dieting literally did fuel and encourage the development of my ED alone.",

And having too many excess fat will destroy your organs anyway.\n\nI\u2019m obviously not saying that anyone who is struggling with a restrictive ED needs to lose weight or SHOULD lose weight. But a lot of overweight people without restrictive EDs want to lose healthy amounts of weight and that\u2019s ok!",

          "body": " You can have a restrictive ED and be overweight. I've had 4 admissions amd was only \"underweight\" during one of them. It's about the behaviors and mentality surrounding food. The treatment for someone with a restrictive ED that presents as overweight is the same treatment regardless of weight and that treatment entails challenging the pre-occupation and obsessiveness with appearance/weight, unlearning harmful beliefs and misconceptions about bodies and health, and cultivating body connection which requires letting go of the need to manipulate and control the body, which always fights back.",

          "body": "Yes, you can have a restrictive ED and be overweight. Although for some of those EDs you have to be rapidly losing weight to have it, like anorexia. Don\u2019t get annoyed at me for mentioning it. Get annoyed at the DSM. You\u2019ve either gotta be at an already low weight or rapidly be losing weight.\n\nBut I wasn\u2019t talking about people with restrictive EDs anyway. Not everyone has an ED and if someone wants to lose weight in a healthy, sustainable way, that\u2019s fine. We shouldn\u2019t be acting like them no longer overeating is the worst thing ever and that they\u2019re destroying their organs by eating healthy amounts of food.",
