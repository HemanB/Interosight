  "title": "Request: I think my 13 year old brother has an eating disorder",
  "selftext": "For as long as I can remember, my brother has been \u2018fussy\u2019 with his food. He will eat: chicken nuggets (only one brand), McDonald\u2019s burger with NOTHING on it, cucumber and pasta. He will not eat sauce, if it touches his plate he will cry and scream and throw up. If his food touches he will not eat it. If it\u2019s a different brand of food he knows IMMEDIATELY. If the food isn\u2019t cooked correctly, he will not eat it. He keeps taking paracetamol for headaches. He exercises for a minimum of 5-6 hours per day (scootering). He is obsessive and has OCD. he picks at his food when he eats it. He drinks only 2 drinks (diet lemonade or water) He will not try any food or drink, ever. \nWhat startled me most, is that I bought him some joggers for Christmas and he said he couldn\u2019t wear them because he looked fat. He put on skinny jeans instead and won\u2019t wear anything else. Also, I had a meal replacement shake the other day (tooth extraction), and he immediately asked what it was and if he could have some.... he NEVER tries anything. He was very interested in trying it. His head is also kind of large in shape and he has a really skinny body. He is nutrient deficient and hyper mobile. His nails have started to get these white lines and he has huge black bags under his eyes. \n\nWhat do you guys think?",

      "body": "ARFID sounds way more plausible. It is a form of an eating disorder. Basically what is it is extreme picky eating that's linked with a serious uninterest in food. It's mostly seen in younger children. It can become serious if it is taken too far as it can cause the child to become severely underweight or nutrient deficient like your brother. So I suggest you talk unto your parents or your brother if you're comfortable.",

      "body": "Could be a case of bad anxiety combined with his OCD that slowly developed into him using food as coping method. He\u2019s pretty young though so it\u2019s hard to tell. I was a very very picky eater up till the age of about 14? My friends mom actually accused me of being anorexic when I was 12. (I wasn\u2019t, and I wasn\u2019t underweight either lol). \n\nBasically what i think is he his problems with food may be more related to OCD,\nIf he\u2019s actively controlling food to trying to lose weight because of anxiety from bad body image then that\u2019s an ED. based on one comment of him being fat you can\u2019t know for sure. Remember there\u2019s a large component of problems with body image in an anorexia or bulimia or OSFED diagnosis. \n\nI\u2019m studying behavioural neuroscience in uni, and from what I\u2019ve learned  it\u2019s pretty common for young kids to have weird eating habits and not have an Ed. So it\u2019s hard to tell",
