  "selftext": "I\u2019m a little past overweight and trying to recover from an ed. I\u2019m in a hospital program and my girlfriend knows all of this. Today i wanted to go to the beach but had a breakdown because clothes don\u2019t fit me like they used to and she got really upset at me telling me to \u201cjust stop\u201d saying mean things about myself (I know I shouldn\u2019t but I was really upset). And when we were calling later she\u2019s like \u201cif you want to lose weight why don\u2019t you just eat healthy?\u201d And that hurt a lot. I can\u2019t formulate the right words to explain why that bothers me so much. Does she think I didn\u2019t try that first? Does the think I am faking the disorder? Does she think I don\u2019t fight with myself whenever I get symptoms? Does she think I want to be fat? She knows my goal in recovery isn\u2019t supposed to be weight loss. I\u2019m just really really hurt.",

This is obviously a problem and you need to do something\"\n\n  \nKnow what is an actual problem? Having an effing eating disorder. Overweight by the dumb bmi scale doesn't usually/necessarily mean any health risks but having an eating disorder ALWAYS comes with very real health risks.  \n\n\n  \nED recovery is hard, part of it is building resiliency to comments like this, and that's really really hard to do. But you know what is right for you, and losing weight is definitely wrong and harmful for you. It's reasonable to be hurt, and It's reasonable to set boundaries with people, like asking them not to comment on your body or food intake.",

Maybe you can compare it to something that is a large enough problem someone else has that they're not fully in control of, like telling a poor person to just make more money to stop being poor. \n\nThey are obviously trying, their life depends on it, but it's not like they can wake up and say, \"I'm going to be rich today.\"\n\nIf she accepts that, great, you've got a healthy supportive partner who simply became frustrated as an outsider with even less control than you. If you can forgive her and move on, congrats! You have a healthy dynamic and just like your problems won't be gone in a day, you should be grateful that you've got someone there on your journey with you, and be mindful of the next positive thing she's directed towards you and to be thankful to her for that.",

I posted about it i r/bulimia and got a lot of really nice replies there. I could link to the post here, but I\u2019m not sure how? Anyway, the bottom line was that usually they mean well, but it\u2019s really hard for someone who hasn\u2019t been through it to understand how serious it is and how much control it has of your body. I would suggest taking your gf to therapy with you or maybe give her some literature so she can read up and get a better understanding?",

What you heard isn\u2019t exactly what she meant, I\u2019m sure. She didn\u2019t mean to hurt you, discourage you, or belittle you. I think she meant to offer you a solution, one that might work for someone without an ED. Again, don\u2019t fault her for that.
