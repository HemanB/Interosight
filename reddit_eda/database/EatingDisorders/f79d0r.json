  "selftext": "Hi there! My name is Cristina and I'm currently enrolled in a Master's program in Psychology. Right now I'm in my last semester and I'm working on my Master's thesis.\n\nI'm doing a research on the relationship between the sense of our personal identity and eating behaviors (I'll leave a link to a Google form down below, where you cand find more information on this and a number of 4 questionnaires). Everything is completely ANONYMOUS and shouldn't take more than 10 minutes. \n\nRight now, I'm mostly looking for girls (at least 18 years of age) who would be interested in taking part! Thank you in advance. \n\n[the link of the research ](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScMINQCaGZnuCYnPSCJfmvs0WL1GDDDDFJAGp1ZocKbyUiVNA/viewform?usp=sf_link)",
