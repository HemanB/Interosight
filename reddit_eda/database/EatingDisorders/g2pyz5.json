  "selftext": "I haven\u2019t gone to the dentist in a few years now. Probably like 3. But since my last visit, my bulimia definitely worsened and I can definitely feel the affects it\u2019s doing on my teeth. I feel like the back of my teeth have holes. I can see cavities. I\u2019m in pain a lot too. I\u2019m horrified of what I\u2019ve done to myself because of my ED and i\u2019m even more scared about going to the dentist. What will they say? I\u2019m only 21 and on my parents health insurance so what will i tell them if I need a lot of work done to my teeth? I\u2019m so so scared",

Then we talked about a plan to get my teeth healthy again.\n\nI had the same fears, but don\u2019t worry. They see this more often than you think.",

Don't be scared to go, they won't lecture you about and you don't have to explain yourself. I'm sure dentists know how to handle it",

When I finally went to the dentist, they were nothing but professional and talked about treating my dental problems.\n\nI chose to bring up my history of ED myself, thinking it might help in planning my dental treatment. I was really nervous and shaky the whole time, but the staff were super sweet, non-judgmental, and calmed me down by explaining everything they were doing this session and going forth.\n\nAs for the health insurance? When you put off the visit, it's going be way more expensive and possibly complicated if you wait. No better time than NOW to care for yourself. Good luck!",
