  "title": "Request: Is it a bad idea to ask someone with an ED out to eat?",
  "selftext": "So someone in my friend group (all age 16) planned for all of us to go out for a drink and something to eat. One of my other friends in the group has a purging disorder (we only found out about this about a month ago). Of course I really want to see her but I don't want her to be uncomfortable or have to worry about this while we're together, I don't want to push it to the side and ignore it but also I think we still need a sense of normality in our friendship so she can get through this. I've read that it's good to eat around someone with an ED so they don't feel awkward being the only person eating but I don't know what is a good way to go about this. I can't find much information on this subject, so I've come here to find out whatever I can. Please correct me if I've said anything that is the complete wrong way of thinking, I'm still working on making sure I support my friend in the best way I can. Thanks.",

My advice in this situation is for you to choose a restaurant you both like (and is in everyone\u2019s budget) and order whatever you normally would. It\u2019s not your responsibility to walk on eggshells, police them, or try to prevent their eating disorder behaviors. Try to just keep the focus on enjoying each other\u2019s company and having fun. People with eating disorders are often very isolated socially and giving them some company and fun can really help that persons quality of life. \n\nIt\u2019s perfectly okay to acknowledge the eating disorder and say, if going to a restaurant is going to be a problem because of what they\u2019re struggling with that you are open to doing some alternative activity. It\u2019s okay to let them know you care about them and hope things get better.\n\nEnjoy your evening out!",

If its a purging disorder, the best thing to do would be to avoid the purge trigger, but it's also kind of awkward to flat out ask what those are. Eating around someone with an ED could go so many different directions in their head, especially depending on how the type of cuisine and knowledge about the cuisine impacts their disorder. \n\nYou could ask her what she would like to do? Maybe suggest some activities that don't necessarily focus on food as the main event.",

      "body": "It really depends on the person and how they feel at any given moment. I\u2019d talk to her about it privately and see what she would like to do/what would make her more comfortable if she decides to go. If she doesn\u2019t go this time, you could suggest that the group plans more outings where food isn\u2019t a main focus, not to say that you can\u2019t ever go out to eat, but so it\u2019s not the main event every time you go out. You obviously don\u2019t want her to be triggered but it\u2019s also important that she still be included in social outings. I personally have avoided events where it\u2019s expected to eat, and it is harder to see people and/or plan outings that don\u2019t focus on food. EDs can be isolating and it\u2019s important that she know that you support her and want to include her, just make sure to remember that she is so much more than her disorder. Thank you for putting in the effort for your friend, she\u2019s lucky to have such a good support system.",

He knows what's going on and he'll understand if I suddenly can't eat anything on my plate.\n\nGoing out with others is another thing. I personally have a hard time with being worried that people will notice if I can't eat what I ordered. \n\nI personally get thru this by strategiezing with my partner ahead of time. I in general prefer to know where we are going ahead of time so I can look up a menu and see what I can eat there. I usually order something smaller and my partner orders a full meal and we 'share,' which really means I eat anything I can from either of our meals and my partner eats bits of my food as well, so it's not as obvious if I don't end up touching my food. \n\nEveryone is different. Offer your friend support and non judgmental love. Let them know you are there for them, and then they might be able to share with you things that help them or trigger them.\n\nI guess that's not EXACTLY the answer to your question, so idk if this helps at all.",
