So you have to let that go, and focus on working on recovery from it. \n\nI know recovery is hard, and the guilt is just adding to the stress, but just take a few bites, then take a few more. You tried, and that's important. But i encourage you to speak to a doctor/ therapist about this, because recovery is possible.",

      "body": "You're not greedy. Clearly if it were up to you you wouldn't be throwing out food that could be eaten, that's why you're feeling guilty in the first place. Eating disorders and other mental illness have a way of making you feel terrible about things that you can't immediately control, and this is just that. It's a way for it to fester and make you feel worse about how you feel in the first place and cause more distress, making you feel worse and continuing the cycle. It's not your fault that you're dealing with this though, it's not your fault that eating causes so much distress that you have to throw food out, and it's not your fault you have to throw that food out because of it. You're also not causing harm to someone through your actions, and that counts for a lot. It's not like your intention is to make people without food security feel shitty, or to waste food to spite them. It's just an unfortunate combination of two issues that mental illness is trying to twist to make you feel worse. I don't know if it counts for much but as someone who didn't always have food available as a kid, wasting food is the last thing I would want you to be concerned about. It's not your fault other people don't have food and throwing some food out isn't gonna hurt anyone. \n\nThere's nothing you should feel guilty over here, and that guilt is only making things worse for you as well. All I would ask as someone who has been there, is for you to do your best not to feel too bad about it and focus on moving forward and getting better, and when you do feel guilty over it, remember that it's okay and you haven't done anything you should feel guilty for. You haven't done anything wrong.\n\nAs others have said, if you have a therapist it would be good to go through this with them as well, and if you don't, it'd be really great if you could get to talking with one. I wish you all the best. If you ever need to talk to someone, you're welcome to message me although I don't have first hand experience with ED.",

It may or may not help to hear that same type of thing over again in so many words (others have state it far more eloquently than I\u2019ve been able to with this comment), but I believe in speaking the truth to ED\u2019s lies, even when we don\u2019t necessarily feel or believe it 100% (yet).",

It\u2019s good you recognize it. And you can use that to help drive you through recovery. But just because there are people in the world with worse problems doesn\u2019t make yours less real. Reach out to someone. \n\nIf a friend reached out to you about having an ED would you call them a privileged b for having access to food and still developing this eating disorder when people are starving? No. You wouldn\u2019t. And if anyone does that\u2019s not someone you need in your life. You sound like a really kind empathetic person. Good luck OP!",

That's not a justification of your current thoughts, just perhaps a way to spin it into a positive when it arises and a way to reduce the intensity of the feeling. Yes, some people have privileges and access to food is one of them, but we can also struggle - even with the best head starts. It's ok to recognise that and it doesn't make you a bad person.",
