  "selftext": "I\u2019ve been seeing a therapist for the past month primarily for my depression and anxiety. My ED (binge eating) has been triggered by stress and self-image issues recently. I brought up my history and my recent behaviors with her, and I felt like her response was super inappropriate.\n\nShe started telling me about how she had tried Ozempic last year and had to have her gallbladder removed because of it. Then she told me how she\u2019s on a keto diet because she can\u2019t have bread or carbs\u2026I was so flabbergasted by what she said I kind of zoned out and just sort of nodded along silently. She was basically saying that cutting out bread worked for her but I had to find what worked for me\u2026.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m overreacting. I feel like I\u2019m valid in thinking that was super inappropriate and not at all a professional response from a therapist. I feel like \u201cbreaking up\u201d with her over text. I just feel really sad and upset. It\u2019s so hard finding a good therapist. I feel like I\u2019ve wasted sessions. \n\nEdit for spelling",

My opinion seems to be unpopular though, as I\u2019m am yet to talk to someone who thinks the same as I do. Everyone is always uninterested in their therapist and only wants to talk about themselves and fair enough, it\u2019s their money so they should get as much out of their sessions as they need so no judgement. \n\nThat said, there is still a line and your therapist crossed it by talking about something that was clearly making you uncomfortable. It\u2019s weird that a therapist didn\u2019t seem to pick up that you didn\u2019t want to continue that conversation and I sorry that happened to you. I\u2019m also really easily triggered with my ED so I feel for you that you went to what was supposed to be in a safe space and felt the opposite.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that her telling you about her experience with trying ozempic and how it resulted in the loss of her gallbladder was well intentioned and she was trying to warn you that the effects can be detrimental and in a way you might learn from her mistake? And maybe that would help someone else, but as a therapist, she should be able to read the room and change the way she\u2019s talking and she failed to do that and instead triggered you and made it feel more like a vent rather than advice. If this isn\u2019t the first time then i definitely think you should look for another therapist that suits you, especially with the fact that\u2019s she doesn\u2019t show up to you sessions on time and cancels them without warning. \n\nSounds like she is not in the headspace to be counselling other people, especially something as complex as ED\u2019s where you have to be so careful and switched on to work with them. I hope she learns better and doesn\u2019t ruin her career by upsetting all her clients.\nAnd I hope you find a therapist that works for you and can recover \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79",
