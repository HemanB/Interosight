  "title": "Request: How to deal with panic attacks from \"bad\" food.",
  "selftext": "How to not freak out after eating a little \"extra\" or a snack? \n\nAlthough I've mostly stopped counting calories, sometimes when I eat a snack or someone brings me dessert (for example), I get a little nervous in my head, thinking that this will push me past my calorie limit for the day and that I'll be fat the next day, so I end up counting calories. \nI've also noticed that I'm especially concerned about the appearance of my face, and I often touch my cheek, neck, etc. \n\nAny help would be appreciated! :)",

I don\u2019t struggle with this specific example but I noticed no one else has commented yet so I thought I\u2019d take a stab at it. \n\nFirst of all, your food isn\u2019t going to turn into body fat in one day. It takes sustained effort over time to change your body\u2019s ideal weight. Your mind is really with fearful thoughts that aren\u2019t necessarily realistic. Maybe it would help to write a list of reasons why it\u2019s OK to eat fear foods. Remind yourself that every time you do those things and fight back against the anxious thoughts you are ACTIVELY battling your eating disorder. And that\u2019s awesome!!\n\nSome things you can tell ED voice:\nI am nourishing my body so that I can be strong and healthy.\nI am comforting my spirit by listening to my hunger cues and cravings.\nMy food choices don\u2019t reflect my value as a person. \nMy weight doesn\u2019t reflect my value as a person.\nI deserve food. I deserve good food. I deserve to feel satisfied. I deserve to enjoy food. \n\nThese are just some ideas. I don\u2019t know exactly what you are going through so just be real with yourself and come up with some phrases that work for you. Maybe you can even set specific times to eat a food that triggers those thoughts so you can practice your affirmations. After you\u2019ve done that go do some distress tolerance/distraction to get your mind off of it. You\u2019ve got this!\n\nEdit: formatting",

I do this by eating half of my lunch and then waiting 30 minutes to let the fullness go away, and then eat the other half.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for snacks, I try to eat them when I am talking with someone, while I am outside, when I am multitasking or watching something funny. Get your mind off eating, no matter what it takes. I'm here for you man, and we are all going through hell right now because of the virus. The virus has made us be inside, and when we are inside we have TOO MUCH time to think... About hurting ourselves. </3",
