  "selftext": "Post text:\n\nI did something bad for a long time, and I never told anyone this, it has always been my secret. Ever since I was about 13 or 14, whenever I'd feel nauseous or sick or even anxious I'd stick my finger down mg throat and make myself throw up. And I kept on doing if for years and years. More recently, for a few weeks I'd do it almost daily to help me lose weight. It somewhat worked and made me feel better, feel relief. I even did it in the psych hospital when I was feeling sick or anxious. It makes me feel the same was as cutting does, but I can't do it anymore. Made me feel in control. The hospital told my sister that my stomach was really messed up and that if I kept throwing up that I would bleed into my stomach or something. They think though that I was throwing up so much because I had a gastric bypass surgery 3 years ago and I can't keep food down sometimes. But even after that I would make myself throw up so I wouldn't feel so bad. I'm going to try not to do it anymore. I won't do it anymore. I have it under control now.",
