  "selftext": "In my Gym there is this woman, who is at the gym 24/7, no matter when i go there, she\u2019s always there. Both my Roommate and I have noticed her getting thinner and thinner, her hair thinning and just her looking unwell in general. There are several signs for an ED (specifically anorexia). For example she always wears multiple pullovers and sweaters layered even if it\u2019s warm outside (inside the gym it\u2019s always warm but she still wears 2 or more pullovers) And she always does cardio only or rather, just stands on the treadmill looking exhausted and only drinks diet soda and coffee. We are really concerned about her wellbeing and aren\u2019t quite sure of what to do. A bit advice would be really appreciated \nthank u ",

      "body": "Yeah, she\u2019s likely pretty isolated, if she has an ED. The ED wants you to be isolated. I would say the approach would be to just try to be friendly, and maybe strike up a friendship. Even just a gym friendship. It might help her get pulled out of the disorder some. \n\nWhen I was really sick, I was working a temp summer stock theatre job, and my roommate there never confronted my disorder, but she was just there and made me feel a semblance of normalcy. Invited me to dinner, made sure I was included in group things when I just wanted to be alone with Ana. She got me to see life was a bit more than just how much I was eating and exercising. To this day she is still my best friend. She never made me feel like a burden, like all of my other friends did (that was just my perception, because they didn\u2019t want me to be doing the things I was doing)\n\nJust approaching her and accusing her of having an ED will likely not lead to anything fruitful. Just an awkward conversation and maybe contention while at the gym. It might even shame her or cause a spiral. \n\nAll just my ramblings, so take as much or as little as you want",

      "body": "I need some support and advice. I\u2019ve been struggling with anorexia for 13 years. I have always struggled and have been in and out of quasi recovery. I was doing okay for a long time, but I recently relapsed this past year, and it really affected my relationship with my boyfriend (we\u2019ve been dating for 2.5 years, he\u2019s 29 and I\u2019m 26). He definitely seems to have different goals than me (he\u2019s not that ambitious & fears change, he complains about his financial situation but does nothing to help myself, has depression/anxiety, & was struggling to pay his bills). Unfortunately,\nI have a not so great relationship with my own family, so my boyfriend\u2019s family naturally became my chosen family & have been an amazing support system for me. When we were all together, it almost seemed like I had some respite from my ED for once because I just felt such a sense of belonging and loved. I was irritable from restriction, and my boyfriend and I started to both feel increasingly resentful towards each other. He said that I have a tendency to \u201cplay the victim\u201d a lot of the time. I often get frustrated because he gets so anxious in social settings & tends to ruin them for everyone involved. He just gets miserable & brings down the mood. He is so out of control if he drinks beer & acts irrationally and can be mean. He thinks that I\u2019m not emotionally supportive, but it\u2019s so frustrating when I\u2019m actively trying to help myself & he isn\u2019t doing his part. He keeps telling me he\u2019s going to go back to school, get healthy & lose weight, stop smoking weed, etc, but it never seems to happen. He was miserable the night of his birthday when we went out to dinner, and I had just had it. I went home as soon as we were done with dinner & that really upset him. I just couldn\u2019t stay there if he was going to continue being miserable for the rest of the night because I need to protect my own energy & it brings me\ndown. After that, he told me we needed to take a \u201cbreak\u201d and I haven\u2019t heard from him since (this was in late February). He said we both aren\u2019t In a place to be in a relationship and we both need to work on ourselves. This was over a month ago. Apparently he\u2019s in school right now and doing well. He knows I\u2019m at residential and that I\u2019m on another medical leave from work. I miss him and his family. I used to go there every holiday and celebrate with all of them, and it just makes me sad that I won\u2019t be there with them for Easter tomorrow. I guess im just asking for peoples\u2019 input and advice? Thank you in advance",

I think a lot of other people have the right idea, try to befriend her, but you might have to do it slowly since she seems closed off. Try asking her for a \"favor\" to get her \"advise\" on doing cardio or if she has any tips about another exercise. After you get that simple rapport going for a few days, you could try asking if she'd like to get coffee, or maybe better, go see something in your town -- like a park or an event going on. Or just keep a gym friendship for a while. If she is subjected to an ED, asking her to a food establishment might not be the best idea at first. Best case scenario, she accepts and you start a friendship. Worst case, she gets creeped out and stops going to that gym or reports u to management (gotta be realistic and prepared for that). \n\nI get you wanting to help people and honestly that's refreshing. You have to also keep in mind that some people don't want help or might not be ready for it. If you try to befriend her or help her, be ready to accept if she doesn't want it. don't get angry, don't get hung up on what you could have done differently. Just keep being a good person. \n\nAnd don't allow this insufferable world to engulf you in callousness or apathy. Humanity is failing because of it.",
