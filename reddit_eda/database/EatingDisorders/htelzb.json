  "title": "Request: I feel ashamed every time I eat",
  "selftext": "Every time I eat something I can't help but feel shame. It feels like I just commited a heinous act upon myself. I don't want to feel this way. I just want to be able to eat and not care what I eat. \n\nI put restrictions on myself and my diet and whenever I stray from that I act like it's a cardinal sin. Even when I eat within my restrictions I feel bad about eating.\n\nI also hide when I eat, most of the time, especially breakfast. \n\nAll of this is wacky and things I shouldn't be doing to myself and I shouldn't be feeling this way, but these are all things I've been dealing with since I was a teenager.\n\nIs there any help for this?",

Your eating disorder lives off of control - it comes out when you feel like you're out of control and it manipulates you into believing that by restricting and not eating that you're in control of it. You aren't, the disorder is. \n\nYou can seek professional help; there are some amazing online counseling services available for you! You can also talk to your family doctor about your struggles, bloodwork may be required to ensure your health is doing okay despite the restriction. \n\nFor now, try to distract yourself while and after eating until you can allow the guilt and shame to pass. Unfortunately there are no ways to NOT feel emotions, but by distracting yourself it will make it easier to cope. Read a book, color a picture, watch a movie, paint your nails, take a shower, call a friend are all examples of good distractions \u2764 wish you the best!",

Would you say or do anything to intervene?  What would you want to say to these people?\n\nSometimes we feel differently when it is directed at ourselves rather than someone we deeply care about.  Why is that?  Some of us may feel that we are unworthy of being loved and take out our shame on our bodies by feeling guilty about eating.  I know that's what I did when things got bad for me.  I know it takes a lot of work to start to see yourself as someone who is worthy of being loved, and, more importantly, someone who is worthy of your own love, but it starts by seeing the difference between how you treat yourself and how you treat others.\n\nThere are people who genuinely care about you and want to see you get better.  Maybe they are already in your life.  Maybe you haven't met them yet, but they are there.  Would they want you to feel guilty just for having eating?  Would they think badly upon you if you gained a few pounds knowing that it would improve your physical health?  Would they just want you to lead a happy and healthy life regardless of what number the scale says?\n\nOnce you're caught up in an eating disorder, things might not go back to normal for a while.  It's okay to take things at your own pace.  You recognize that this behaviour is not rational, but still it's hard to break free.  It will be one small victory at a time.  Don't be too hard on yourself.  You'll need a bit of time to heal your relationship with yourself.",

I want to warn you that there is a great deal of ignorance in the medical community when it comes to eating disorders. The current understanding is not widely studied or practiced by people outside of the specialized field.  It is very common for well-meaning doctors and therapists to give bad advice on the subject. That\u2019s the reason I recommend someone who specializes in it.  There is a lot that you can do on your own, but the nature of eating disorders can make it difficult to handle alone. You will need support from people not afraid to push you when you need it. I am not an expert by a long shot.  I am a father of a child with an anorexia and bulimia. We have been working on it for 7 years. She is 21 now and has a normal life.  She struggles from time to time and her mom and I still coach her a bit on meals.  You can do this!  It will be a challenging, but it can be done.",
