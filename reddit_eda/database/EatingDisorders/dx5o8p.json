  "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nNew here, but I\u2019m currently 21 and I was previously suffering from eating disorder(s) (won\u2019t dive into it extremely). From 14-16 was the worst of my issues, then I seemed to recover, and had a few slip ups in between. \n\nHowever, last year I got very heavily into exercising and dieting. I started to track my macros and that kinda sparked bad habits again. I got too obsessive and eventually broke down because it was wearing me thin. I was always hungry, tired, and drained, so I stopped counting and went back to eating intuitively. I also drastically increased my calories. \n\nAlthough I am eating more and I\u2019m no longer counting what I eat, I am still literally so hungry that it is insatiable. I am 5\u20193, small frame, I should not require half as much food as I eat but I literally can eat PLATES upon PLATES of food in one sitting, and then 45 minutes later be hungry again. It is LITERALLY like my stomach has no end, like I don\u2019t know what full is anymore. I tried to eat until I was full once recently, and it literally involved shoving my face with food.\n\nI haven\u2019t known what full feels like in so long it\u2019s ridiculous. I didn\u2019t have this problem previously, and it\u2019s getting annoying, because I\u2019ll go out to eat and then have to eat again 45 minutes later. And I\u2019m not eating extremely small portions anymore - I\u2019m eating normal sized portions. Any advice? How do I make this go away? I\u2019m back at a weight my body sits comfortably at so I don\u2019t know why my hunger hasn\u2019t subsided.",

Honestly i would get my blood work done and see if there is any underlying issue, if not, your metabolism might just be recovering and you may actually be hungry. Don\u2019t focus on your weight, we know that\u2019s a pointless measure, listen to your body. You may actually need the food! \n\nIf you can afford one, find a dietician who specializes in eating disorders who can help work with you on these issues. Sometimes we still need the professionals even after we think we\u2019ve healed.",

I stopped eating carbs because you hear what all the women say and I would eat and I was always hungry. It didn\u2019t seem to matter. I normally eat collard greens and turkey burger for lunch. And I would need to keep snacking because I was never satisfied.  The last 2 weeks I started eating 1 piece of bread with my lunch and MY GOD do I feel amazing. A piece of bread is only 100 calories, but I actually feel satisfied. I don\u2019t need to keep snacking after and my brain isn\u2019t constantly thinking about food. Not only that but im not gaining weight like all the media says carbs make you do. Like I said before I work out a lot so maybe this should have been obvious to me but it wasn\u2019t. Your body is trying to tell you something, maybe you need more carbs, more protein, or something else that your diet is lacking but you are feeling hungry for a reason! Listen!",

      "body": "Oh, this is something I have experience with! A couple of years back, I was diagnosed with CFS, Flu, an unknown flu-like illness, Bell\u2019s Palsy, and something else that I\u2019ve forgotten the name of. This lead to me being stuck at home for 6 months, practically bedridden for most of it. But during this period, I ate very little. Like, for the first 4 months, I was lucky to eat more than half a sandwich for the entire day. I wasn\u2019t really hungry, and I felt too sick and tired to eat. I started eating more for the last couple, but I never caught up to my normal amount.\n\nAfter it ended though, and I recovered mostly, I had the same problem as you. I\u2019ve always been someone who was hungrier than most, even as a baby, but this was ridiculous! Just like you said, I had to eat so much to feel full (1,500+ calories per meal) that I\u2019d feel sick, and then I\u2019d feel hungry again really quickly. Generally, I couldn\u2019t eat enough to feel full most of the time simply because I couldn\u2019t eat anymore without literally throwing up, or much more likely because my family wouldn\u2019t let me.\n\nFor me, although I wanted to eat more, I live with my family and back then my mum insisted on doing all my cooking for me despite being nearly an adult, and that meant that I couldn\u2019t eat much more than normal because of her. I ate a lot more snacks and started eating 4 meals a day for a while, 3 during the day and one at night when everyone else was asleep since my sleep schedule was still wrecked.\n\nEventually, it just went away. No clue why. It was horrible when I had it, but I couldn\u2019t eat enough to make myself full most of the time.\n\nI expect I probably triggered it because I ate so little during those 6 months. I lost a huge amount of my weight, it was the lowest I\u2019d been in years, but as soon as it ended I just kept gaining it at such an extreme rate that I ended up as fat as I am now. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s just because my metabolism got lowered or because I was eating too much due to being hungry.\n\nGood luck with it, regardless. I\u2019m currently dealing with the opposite issue and if anything that\u2019s even weirder, but I know how bad extreme hunger can be so I can sympathise.",
