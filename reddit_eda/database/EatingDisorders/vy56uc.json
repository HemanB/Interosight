  "title": "ED Recovery problems: Used to starve myself - now I can't stop eating :(",
  "selftext": "Hi. I'm asking for advice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've struggled with disordered eating on and off since my teens. I'm now almost 30. I've been starving myself an awful lot, especially the last 3 years. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn January this year I decided to start treating my body right and focusing on getting strong and healthy looking instead of small, weak and sick looking. I've been lifting weights and working out several times a week since, and I've pushed myself to eat accordingly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I'm finding is that it's hard for me to eat \"normal\". I can starve myself like I've done in the past, or I can over eat to \"make up for\" how restrictive and mean I've been to myself. I can't seem to find a balance. I'm obsessive over food all the time and I'm so fucking tired of thinking so much about it. I don't want to, I'm so fucking done.\n\nFor example when I eat my healthy sized, varied and delicious breakfast every morning, I get so sad after my last bite because it was the last bite. My thoughts run crazy with things like \"it's so unfair other people can eat how much they want but I have to control my portions\", \"I'm not full enough, I want to eat more but I cant, and I feel so bad for myself for never being satisfied\". I also find it extremely hard to control myself with delicious food. I recently got a new boyfriend who is an amazing cook, and whenever he makes something amazing (basically every fucking day) I'm struggling so incredibly much with not over eating to the point of great physical discomfort.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's like my body wants revenge for all the starvation in the past. I want to eat or chew something all the time, unrelated to being hungry or not - even when I'm already really full. Then comes the \"this is unfair\"-thoughts and the shame and I'm just so exhausted by it all. I want to have a normal, calm and stress-less relationship to food. I want to not think about food and my body all the goddamn time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm wondering if anyone can relate, and if so, what are your ways of handling it? Have you found anything that has made it better and made your thoughts around food healthier?\n\nThanks",

Instead of just saying \u201cI\u2019m never bingeing again,\u201d try to hold off the next time you get an urge. Hold off for 15 minutes, then let yourself do it. Next time , hold off for 30 mins, etc. And by hold off I mean literally sit there alone with your thoughts and zero distractions, not tv or music or anything. You\u2019re re-training your brain to know that you don\u2019t need those urges to binge anymore. There\u2019s a misconception that if you just eat enough, the urges to binge will stop, but that\u2019s not the case. Be patient with yourself and sit there with the urge either until you can\u2019t stand it anymore, or until it goes away. The if you wait it out long enough (which I know is hard), it will eventually go away. Celebrate the little victories and don\u2019t beat yourself up for falling back into old habits, because it\u2019s never too late to try again the next day. Good luck! Also I recommend the book \u201cbrain over binge\u201d which taught me a lot of this!",

I started trying to kick the ED behaviors in January  2021, kind of a new years resolution. I did gain about 13 pounds in the last year and a half, I'm not crazy about it, but my body is definitely more healthy and wayyy stronger. I was absolutely ravenous for months and it was so depressing for me. I went back and forth with ED behaviors for the first year or so, mostly binging. And it was so hard to find a happy medium. I think it really came down to time and commitment for me. I was a major calorie counter and deleting the apps that I used for that helped. I tried to just eat three healthy meals a day (not crazy healthy, just somewhere in the middle) and to give myself some grace. The last bit was probably the hardest. I'm sorry I can't really offer you any tips, just support. It's hard, but don't give up \u2764",

That\u2019s why is important to treat our body with respect and love, all those years of starving has made us feel now that we have to make up for the food we missed. My advice is that you respect your body and remind yourself that is okay to have big portions but the same way starving made you feel like in control, overeating makes you feel like you lost control which is also important as well. You can try dividing your portions to 6 meals a day so it tricks your brain into feeling like you are more.\nSending love and hugs and you\u2019re not alone\u2764\ufe0f",

Everytime I slip in my recovery and go through a period of restricting over exercising and plain obsession with losing weight, I end up rebounding and not being able to find a balanced diet.

I have learnt to kind of allow it and do a lot of meditation, restorative yoga and positive self talk, no matter how forced that feels on some days: the effect is that it shortens those rebound periods for me and I get to a place where I can have my healthiest relationship with food (which won't ever be 100% healthy) and not be obsessing about it 24/7.",

For me not tracking is not an option- I am having to relearn how to intuitively eat. \n\nI recommend either getting a nutritionist, nutrition coach or establishing some basic macros. Macros are great because it readjust how you think about calories and prevents you from going crazy on complete rubbish food (but you can also learn to work it in as well). A coach is good because they can help remind you of the process and adjust calories as your bodies metabolism recovers. \n\nAlso therapy, CBTE saved my sanity and has allowed me to get 27 weeks into a pregnancy with out starving myself and only having 2 bad mental days. There are SO many thought patterns that need to be revised and undone. \n\nThe journey is long but you deserve to feel good in your skin and you deserve to have other things occupy your mind.",

If you don't do it, this phase will last longer and you may relapse bc of this frustrating feeling.\nBelieve, but it's just a phase and it will eventually end as soon as your body start trusting you. Search for \"extreme hunger\" i think it can help you to understand this feeling. Like, think you're in debt to your body. Now it's not asking but demanding you to pay for all the years you damaged it. Trust your body, you'll overcome it.",

But after having 3 children and now eating too\nmuch and being 80lbs overweight I feel like I will never be free of food controlling me. Why am I such a failure???",

Impossible. \nYou're not overeating, you're hungry but while keeping those behavior your body will never adjust your hunger so you will be stuck on this over/under eating and being sincere also stuck on Ed. \nThere's a lot of information about this topic on the internet, i think you should check if you have doubt about it. Best wishes on your journey.",
