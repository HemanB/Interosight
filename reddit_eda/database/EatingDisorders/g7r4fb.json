I was with many girls who suffered from EDs largely because their mom's hadn't gotten help themselves so projected their issues onto their kids. EDs are viscious and they are nothing to be ashamed of. They are real and have a hold on more people than we know. If you have access to an ED therapist or clinic  I would go and see what they recommend. The person above you posted a link for free DBT which is awesome. I would also check this out...super helpful info and you could call their hotline: https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/\nIt's great that you are asking this question. I wish you the best because I know what a difficult spot you're in.",
