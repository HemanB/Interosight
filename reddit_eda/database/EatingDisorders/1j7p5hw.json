And, as I've stated, this has been going on even without any restriction and for well past what's typical of reactive eating (and \"2-4 sessions.\") I'm sorry, but listening to podcasts and reading 2 Reddit replies doesn't give you enough perspective to tell me what I do or don't struggle with every day.",

          "body": "Yep, still struggling with it. I went from nearly being kicked from PHP for continued weight loss to heavier than I've ever been. It was gradual at first, but then seemed to skyrocket into full-on BED. I've tried basically everything to maintain a healthy diet/exercise, but always end up falling back into the same pattern. I've been told it's fairly common for binging to happen during recovery since your body is reeling from having been in starvation mode, but how long it takes to level out naturally or get the reigns on it yourself (especially without risking going back to previous AN behaviors) is impossible to say. It definitely feels like a losing battle sometimes, but know you're not alone in the fight.",

I \"gave in fully\" after some initial fighting after it was drilled into me during treatment that I needed to listen to my body. The problem is it never passed. It's been 2 years since I committed to recovery, and I'm still having regular binges and overeating in general. I'm well aware that attempting to restrict can trigger more binging, but I can't even make the tiniest changes to get to any level of healthy moderation. I'm eating to the point of severe pain and having all aspects of my life negatively impacted, and no amount of acceptance or resistance changes anything.",
