  "title": "Request: My SO won't accept our break up for my Recovery.",
  "selftext": "I recently shared how my boyfriend had told me I had gained weight and how that has significantly contributed to a relapse in my recovery. Very fortunate to have a great therapist & friends around me - however after thinking through my circumstances decided to call it off with this guy & focus all my energy on to my self & my recovery - for the first time ever, woo! \n\nBUT - the conversation was so heavy and manipulative. He did everything in his power to make me feel like I'm not stable and it's a \"phase I'm going through\". He said things like -\n\n\n\u2022 \"if you choose to leave me I won't stick around, you'll never see me again and I will not be there to support you\"\n\n\u2022 \"right now you're having a bad time but when you recover a little more you'll see that breaking up isn't what you want right now\"\n\n\u2022 \"I thought you loved me, if you did you wouldn't be leaving me right now\"\n\n\u2022 \"give me reasons as to why you cannot recover healthily and have me by your side supporting you?\"\n\n\u2022 \"the least you can do is take some time to talk to a friend about this very big decision\"\n\n\u2022 \"this is not the person I grew to love , you're not acting yourself so I think you should go away and think about this\"\n\n\u2022 \"this is so unfair and cold of you to break up with me after what we have built these last few months\"\n\n\u2022 \"does this not even upset you?\"\n\n\u2022 \"did your therapist tell you to do this?\"\n\n\nThe chat was for 3 hours. It was exhausting, all on this kinda level. So heavy. Basically trying to convince me that I need him, it's a phase and that I need to provide reasons as to why I cannot be with him and be in therapy too. \n\nIs Recovery not a valid enough reason to choose to be single? Or am I actually being a cold person like he says? Damn",
