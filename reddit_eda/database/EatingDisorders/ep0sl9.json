This isn\u2019t because I miss animal products and need an excuse to eat them, but it\u2019s because having an eating disorder is super socially isolating, and so I need to remind myself of the joy of sharing food with loved ones, and also just to be careful not to let myself get too strict in any way with food.  It\u2019s really worked for me.  Obviously it means I can\u2019t truly call myself a vegan, but it means I eat vegan food 90% of the time and every little helps!\n\nHowever, I live in a big city with so many vegan options that I don\u2019t really feel restricted at all by my food choices anyway... there\u2019s vegan cake shops, ice cream, donuts, fried \u201cchicken\u201d as well as more traditional falafel and curry type vegan foods, so I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m forced to make low calorie choices which is important in recovery!  if you live somewhere with few vegan choices, it might be more of a restrictive trigger, and everybody is different, so I can\u2019t say my experience will be the same for anyone else!",

I'm a vegan now at the moment but I'm in a relapse and my bloods are whack. Basically what I'm saying is if you feel strong enough go for it, if not maybe try recover first before you go vegan as its a big lifestyle change.",

I am personally a vegan who has recovered from an eating disorder (several), however I am also a counselling psychologist and work in an eating disorder service.\n\nMy first piece of advice would be to feel as though you are generally recovered (as much as we can ever be) before taking on a vegan diet. Other peoples advice here about starting out more slowly make sense. I would also say that you need to make sure you are eating a very varied and as much as possible non restrictive vegan diet. Luckily where I live in England I can almost eat an identical diet to my diet before veganism because of the amount of vegan substitutes and the amount of options when eating out, but if that isn't possible get to grips with cooking/baking delicious and nutritious vegan meals for yourself so you dont feel deprived or restricted. Make sure you eat enough as vegan diets tend to be lower in calories overall and you may need to eat more volume than you are used to. You will also need to supplement B12 and maybe other things depending on how you chose to eat.\n\nThe last thing I would say is to listen to your mind and your body. If you get any warning signs that you know are features of your ED, you will have to consider how you can move forward in a way that works for your mind, body and values. I care about animals and the environment, but first and foremost you have to take care of yourself and your wellbeing. You are the expert on yourself, and only you can really know whether you will be able to do this safely. If it feels wrong, dont do it. \n\nAs a vegan I would like to say thank you for considering this lifestyle for the sake of animals and the planet, it is really kind and compassionate of you, but no one will blame you, or has any right to, for taking care of yourself first and foremost. If you decide to do it, monitor yourself closely, and if it looks like it could cause relapse. STOP.",

Because the reality is, there\u2019s no way you can starve yourself and be a healthy functioning vegan at the same time. I\u2019d suggest just focus on your mentality toward food at this point in time. If you think going vegan at this point in time would be a bad headspace then just focus on getting better. Maybe veganism can be a long term goal for you instead :) I would also suggest transitioning slowly to the diet e.g going vegetarian first, as it is a huge change.",

I would imagine this would be challenging as a teen living at home not being able to shop for yourself. Maybe as you transition into adulthood, you can slowly substitute non veg items for veg ones. For instance, cut out red meat first and try some legumes you don\u2019t normally eat, like lentils. I think the support of your family is crucial on this one, and mine was very apprehensive when I went veg because they thought it was simply to restrict. \n\nTake it slow, and if you feel yourself being triggered remember that you need to take care of yourself as a priority.

      "body": "I've been vegan for a while - and vegetarian. I remained vegan throughout my relapses, and recoveries. I now am in a pretty healthy place- I workout too, and I'd consider myself largely recovered. I was vegetarian/vegan before developing a restrictive ED, which may be a big part of why it didn't impact my ED recovery.\n\nFor me? It was all about a mindset change - about focusing on the cool new things I could try, versus the ones that I was restricted to, as a vegan. For me, dietary restrictions have also been a huge trigger in the past, and I simply expanded my plate, and committed to trying new things, so that it wasn't restrictive.\n\nIf you live in an area that is not friendly to vegans, this may be hard. I live in a rather liberal state, and near big cities, where vegan food is common. I am also okay with/have been able to always find the time to cook - so I can't possibly get away with lying to myself and excusing neglecting to eat. If you don't live in an area like this and/or have the ability to cook, it may end very differently. I don't fully understand why too, but it made me feel more connected to, and at ease with my food (being vegan that is). \n\nIf you feel like it may impact your recovery, then do what you can without sacrificing your health. People may disagree (some vegans/vegetarians can be ironically un-sympathetic with people regarding this....), but every little bit counts. If you replace one gallon of milk with almond milk once a week? It helps. If you pass up a burger for a veggie burger, or eggs for tofu once a week? it helps. You don't have to commit to a completely 100% vegan diet, to make a difference. There are also plenty of resources on zero waste, and other lifestyle factors you can change to make a difference. One of those is buying locally too!\n\nLook at it this way - if you don't take care of yourself and address your ED, you'll end up not being able to advocate for the environment, and at worst, contributing to it by ending up binge eating/etc (for me, this is when I make the worst environmental decisions).\n\nYour health should always come first - and if you want to pursue this, make sure you find a way to do it educated and with lots of support!",

It\u2019s hard if you frame it as restriction, and it is often framed as such, then it\u2019s going to mess with your Ed, but if you frame it as simply not an option to exploit an animal like u wouldn\u2019t eat a baby or a pup, and see food availability as SUPER plentiful aside from those few options, there will not be that restriction nagging feeling, I\u2019ve found. Gotta have staples in the house though bc one thing I\u2019ve found is nothing compares to high protein meal to prevent my binges, you gotta learn to cook and not be lazy, it\u2019s harder if you grew up in a culture that didn\u2019t teach you to cook veg. I\u2019ve been on both sides, restriction and binges and veg and not. It\u2019s about priorities. But you can still have a smaller carbon footprint than say, a vegan who eats all these processed veg foods, just be mindful about your sourcing and remember that EVERYTHING comes at a price of exploitation, the degree you are complicit is something you need to examine for yourself.",

Ethical consumption and moral perfectionism are both impossible in an imperfect world that is built on exploitation. Marx, I think, said it best: \"from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs\".
