  "selftext": " \n\ni have never talked about it with anyone but my entire life ive struggled with binge eating and eating as a form of emotional coping. im 22 and still havent figured out how to stop. but i am doing a lot better and lost a lot of weight over the last 2 years, but its getting bad again. so today i tried to ask one of my close friends if he can hold me accountable and not let me eat more than 2 times a day. (dont worry its not starving myself, i would still be getting enough calories and i make sure to eat nutritious foods) so i messed up and told him and he immediately says \"then why did u eat, go puke it out right now\" hes not a bad person...i know he only said that cuz he doesnt understand since he never had to deal with it and i never really opened up to him about it before. but i felt really terrible and guilty after he said that so i signed out of all my socials and i just wanna be invisible now. every single day i tell myself ok today is the day i start to get better. then every single day i mess up and just let it spiral. idk what to do and idk who to talk to :(",

I\u2019ve been there and this behaviour eventually brought me to life\u2019s rock bottom and ED/MH rock bottom. \n\nWhat helped me stop was eat whatever u want at all hours to begin with. You\u2019re gonna feel like you\u2019re binge eating all day long but eventually I didn\u2019t feel the urge to eat all day anymore and intuitive eating kicked in. I was stuck in a binge eating cycle for 2 years in my teens (gained 20kg through that), and what kept me in it was after every binge, I tried to \u201ceat healthy\u201d the next day but then binge again at night. This is because the \u201ceat healthy\u201d during the day was a form of restriction for me, not allowing myself sweets etc but those mental deprivations can trigger another binge. \n\nFor other people, what helped is eating balanced meals. But don\u2019t let urself get hungry\u2026 it\u2019s always hard in the beginning and restricting of any form WILL cause another binge",

      "body": "I would see if your PCP or anyone you know can recommend a psychiatrist. I used to struggle with minor binge eating and was prescribed prozac (mainly for issues with depression). Prozac is also prescribed for binge eating disorder also and it definitely helped me to not feel urges to eat a lot at one time. I felt more in control. \nAside from that, DBT therapy is really helpful for binge eating and any kind of disordered eating. \nWhat you\u2019re going through is serious and is not your fault! I would recommend distancing yourself from anyone who convinces you to purge your food or supports you doing it.",

      "body": "That sounds hard. It can be very confusing for people who don't have ED to understand what's actually helping vs harming! I obsessively count calories and my spouse thought it would be helpful to encourage the counting lol. I would get a baseline understanding of what sort of support you need. A good way to do that is with a doctor or a therapist who can direct you from there. If that's not an option, CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) workbooks for ana/mia/binging might be a good option. You can find workbooks cheap on eBay(3-15$). There's lots of free worksheets online as well! CBT helps you recognize why you react the way that you do, identify thought patterns and triggers etc. I try to be really careful on who I lean on w mental health because not everyone can handle it. If he is a good support then maybe doing some research himself might be a good idea.",

      "body": "What your friend said is so not okay and is also really counterproductive! I'm so sorry you're going through this. Know that lots of other people (myself included) have been where you are now, and you aren't alone! Though my ED issues have never involved purging, I know from experience that restrictive things like undereating/purging almost always make things worse. They set off a back and forth swing between binging and restricting that gets more and more severe and harder and harder to break out of. \n\nOne recommendation I have is to try to get away from the \"new day\" mentality where every day you tell yourself that this is a new day and you'll start eating healthier today. For me, that mentality just caused me to write off any day where I wasn't perfect and spiral out of control because if the day was already ruined I might as well just keep eating. And then the next day I would try to restrict extra hard to make up for it, end up caving at the end of the day because I was exhausted and hungry, and start the cycle all over again. When I stopped doing this and started trying to treat every new eating choice as completely independent, it helped me a ton. \n\nIf you can, talk to a therapist. Mine helped me so much with getting over my shame around eating, which I think is probably the root of my ED issues. And definitely tell your friend that what they said isn't okay (if/when you feel up to it). It's never okay to tell someone to purge, full stop, it doesn't matter if you asked them to help keep track of your eating.",

      "body": "Hi there here are some things that helped me in the long run\n\nDon't deprive yourself of anything. For example if you are forbidding yourself from eating sweets  or more than 2 times a day then you are setting yourself up for failure because we are humans who give into temptation. So you need to talk to yourself like a friend - \n\n\"I know you love \\_\\_\\_ so I bought you some. They are yours to keep and you can have them anytime. They aren't going anywhere so you can have some now AND later if you want.\" \n\nJust knowing that in the back of your mind can really help. \n\nIt is mental gymnastics in a way, and it wont fix overnight. But celebrate the little victories. One day you will be so secure knowing that you really can have any food you want whenever you want, you wont feel the demon breathing down your neck. You might see it places but it wont control you like it use to. \n\nAnd another note with the 2 meals thing. Your demon loves making you feel shitty and setting strict boundaries is like its dream come true. The only way around that is **absolutely no food rules.** \n\nYou can have food goals like \n\n\\- Eat with a friend \n\n\\- Try something new for lunch \n\n\\- Learn how to cook falafel or pomegranate pie  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first step is recognizing the problem the next is being willing to do something about it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**You are on the right track and you have millions cheering you on. YOU GOT THIS.**",
