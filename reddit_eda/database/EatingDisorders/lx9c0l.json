Thinks like eating before, preparing food etc.\n\nI\u2019m a diagnosed bulimic and have only ever relapsed because of alcohol and would like some advice. Thank you",

      "body": "I am a recovering alcoholic who is actively in my eating disorders. I would often use drinking as an excuse to eat normally. I went to rehab in July 2020 and have been sober for 249 days. People with EDs often have substance issues too. That said, make a plan. Set a drink limit, have water in between, and scoop the menu before the event. Maybe set an alarm in your phone part way to remind you to eat or to stop drinking.\n\nSorry if I went full Mom, anorexic at 42 on you lol.",

      "body": "I have a few rules for myself like not keeping sweets like cookies or ice cream in the house, make sure I eat before I'm super hungry and no food past 6PM. Those are all triggers for me. Booze could be one too so if I do drink I am cautious. I've struggled with both anorexia, bulimia and binge eating disorder for years and I feel like I have no idea how to eat \"normally.\" I don't know if anyone can relate but having those rules in place really helps, especially the no eating after 5/6PM. Night eating was really triggering for me. I hope you figure out yours and wish you well on your road to recovery",

I\u2019m also aware that because I think alcohol might make me purge, that in turn is more likely to make me purge because the worry is already there (a bit like self sabotage). I think the best thing is to simply not drink and reintroduce it in stages",

For example, only a glass or two at a dinner reception and none if you're going to party. I don't know for you, but personally even though I don't drink ever, I would be less likely to get drunk and relapse at a family dinner than at a club.",

I have different ED symptoms but they were so significant when I drank that I quit drinking and putting myself in situations where drinking would be tempting for almost a year. Since doing that I am much more able to moderate my drinking and it also gave me time to strengthen my coping skills so I can avoid relapses on the occasions when I do drink.",
