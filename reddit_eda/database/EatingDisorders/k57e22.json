  "title": "Request: am i sick enough?",
  "selftext": "i\u2019m afraid to like. start recovering. \nso the low down, at the start of quarantine I started to get into some really bad body image issues and it was no fun so i decided, like an idiot, to start counting calories, and at first it was fine. Then i got a fitness tracking watch and starting doing regular exercise which is great but it started small (30 mins a day of light jogging, an hour of dancing, youtube workouts, etc) but noes it\u2019s rigid 2-3 times a week strength training and 50 minutes of intense cardio a day + an extra 2 hour walk. I feel bad if i don\u2019t complete my rings or walk around for a certain amount of time. because i wasn\u2019t super strict with tracking i just exercise a shit ton to try and add a small overestimation of calories. Cal counting wasn\u2019t bad at first But now i think it\u2019s gotten to the point of like, actual disordered eating? I know all the calories in a lot of things, i kind of stopped eating cereal and others, i try not to eat a lot early in the day so i can have dessert and dinner later (my family cooks dinner and i never know what\u2019s going on so i just allot a lot of cals for it), I count and overestimate and 3 days ago i had a breakdown over some mac and cheese (i dont even really like mac and cheese, but i just wanted to eat a shit ton of it for no reason), and i\u2019ve been working on how to purge but can\u2019t bring myself to it. I don\u2019t know. i think this is disordered but I\u2019m afraid to try and get help or tell anyone because i don\u2019t think i\u2019m sick enough yet and it\u2019s kind of sickening because on some level I think i know this is heading down a bad path but on another level I just have this voice telling me i\u2019m not there yet, i don\u2019t have a problem and therefore can\u2019t talk about it. should i try and talk to a friend?",

If you\u2019re struggling, heavily restricting or obsessing over calories and exercise then I\u2019d say talking to someone would be a good thing, even if you don\u2019t go get help right now it can feel better to get it off your chest and just have people around to support you",

You are worthy of it. I used to think the same way. That I haven\u2019t had my ED long enough and I\u2019m not sick enough. Hell, I still think that way. But now, I\u2019ve had my ED for 2+ years and it\u2019s ruined my life. I\u2019m only 15 and I\u2019ve let this thing ruin my life. If I could go back months or years and get help, I would. You don\u2019t have to be sick enough to get help. If you\u2019re sick, you need help. I promise.",

      "body": "A note: even if you haven\u2019t lost tons of weight from these behaviors, the wanting to eat tons of something you don\u2019t even like is a side effect of restricting. It can either be because your body is craving more nutrients (especially carbs/fats) from not eating enough during the day to support your exercising or it can even be psychological from putting so many rules on yourself and your mind just wanting a break and some happy chemicals from eating. \n\nAlso STOP trying to figure out purging. Seriously. Once you go there you can\u2019t ever go back. If you can pull yourself back from the edge of that abyss then please do it. I know it is not really that easy but it will become so much harder if it becomes a legitimate option for you. Plus purging always gave me a lot of chest pain (plus orthostatic hypotension and bradycardia that got me sent inpatient) that made exercise really painful and it sounds like exercise is enough of a burden. \n\nTry to give yourself a little bit of compassion. You deserve rest and relaxation. Try to change out some of that exercise for some more joyful movement like dancing or yoga if you\u2019re into that.  Finding a therapist would be most helpful. You can tell your family that it\u2019s for anxiety if you don\u2019t want to get into everything right now but you have to be willing to open up about these behaviors there. \n\nYou are smart to be concerned with what you are feeling and you need to reach out to someone irl if you can. You probably won\u2019t ever feel sick enough. Even people dying in the hospital do not feel sick enough. If these feelings and behaviors are impacting your day to day life mentally, emotionally, or physically then you are sick enough to get help. That\u2019s all there is. If someone you care about had some kind of wound or sickness that needed medical attention you wouldn\u2019t tell them to wait until it got infected and/or was about to kill them before going to the doctor. Mental health is the same. \n\nSorry this is long, but good luck! \n\nTL;DR: craving food means you need it. Purging is a doorway to hell that you do not want to open. Try to relax a little and find a therapist. You are right that this sounds problematic and should try to get help now.",
