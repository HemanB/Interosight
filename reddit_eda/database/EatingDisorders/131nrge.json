  "title": "Why do people compliment my body the most when I am at my lowest? TW Ed",
  "selftext": "I don\u2019t get this. Recently I have been getting so many compliments regarding my body. I relapsed badly with my ED and lost a lot of weight. People keep praising me for my \u201dhard work\u201c, telling me that they wish they had the same \u201dambition\u201c as me. I put those words in quotation marks, because this is not \u201dhard work\u201c or \u201dbeing ambitious\u201c, it\u2019s losing control and risking your life. Anorexia is a deadly illness. Right now, I am severely underweight and have so many health issues, yet people keep telling me how great I look. I remember buying pants that were meant for 12 year olds, and right after putting them on, someone told me that I look so good. For information: I am 23 years old and 176cm tall, so obviously, wearing clothes made for a 12 year old is abnormal for an adult like me. I don\u2019t get this. What drives people to say these things? Why the hell is everyone so obsessed with food and looks, and why are eating disorders so normalized?! My suffering is celebrated and praised. When I was healthy, not many people kept telling me to \u201dkeep up the good work\u201c, and now they do, while I am at my lowest and suffering immensely. Comments like that keep me from reaching out for help, because they make me feel like what I am doing is okay and something to be proud of. When did society get so obsessed with being skinny? I feel like it\u2019s been getting worse again, sick bodies are becoming a \u201dtrend\u201c again. In general, why do people think bodies are a fucking trend? Why do looks matter more than health? That\u2019s just something I\u2019ve noticed and thought about a lot recently. So my question is: is anybody in a similar situation and can relate? Is it okay to feel incredibly angry about that? I\u2019ve been wondering about that a lot.",

I had similar comments when I had no energy, my face was gaunt and haggard, my skin looked grey and my hair was falling out - I very clearly looked ill, not to mention I was unhealthy on the inside too. It did anger me, especially when I\u2019d literally have just told someone how ill I\u2019d been or what pain I was in and they\u2019d be like \u2018worth it tho\u2019. Umm no it isn\u2019t. People would ask me for \u2018my secret\u2019. It\u2019s mental illness, Janet. I just thought to myself (for the people that knew I was ill but seemed to think thinness was worth it anyway) that these people are even more messed up than I am because at least I recognise this is a bad thing.",

      "body": "They\u2019re messed up that\u2019s it. \nWhen I was skinny (my whole life until two years ago) I was constantly hungry resulting in headaches 24/7, I ate one meal a day and the rest were for snacking. I was praised for eating one meal only and getting full, people said I wish I was like you, etc. \nBut tbh no one thought I was pretty, no one at all complement how nice I looked, but on how little I ate. My sister always got mad because clothes fit me and I always get to find my size. \n\nWhen I gained weight and I\u2019m finally eating, not gonna lie people got very very rude, commenting at my eating habits (I rarely eat junk now, when I was skinny it was all junk but that\u2019s ok because I was skinny), mocking me for prioritising my protein intake, mocking me because I\u2019m building muscles and \u201cyou should just lose the weight and look how you were\u201d. \nWhen I wear the clothes that were once baggy on me and now got filled up I get comments on \u201cyou should let go that you were skinny once\u201d. I\u2019ve letten it go, but people didn\u2019t and won\u2019t, but I\u2019m at the best I\u2019ve been. I love my body and I\u2019m more healthy than I used to be. Even as a child I was always sick and tired due to under-eating.\n\nLooking back at old photos when I was skinny I realized how zombie like I was, I was clearly sick.",

      "body": "I feel the same as you even tho I suffer from a different ED but was anorexic at one point. I also have had people tell me the same thing, I looked my best when I was working out all the time, restricting food, binging, and then eventually not eating due to health related complications but I still looked my best people would say! It's one of the main reasons I got off my social media because there were too many people even in boxing me asking me what my secret was to losing so much weight. It was hard for me because I've always had social media since myspace times but it was the best choice for me. I couldn't handle it anymore, society as a whole praising women based on their looks, weight etc. No one even cared to ask me how I had been feeling, bc truth be told I hadn't even been eating and became a workout addict, ended up malnourished and in the hospital. It's a terrible stigma to be thin and what's the secret, so many people refuse to realize maybe that person didn't eat that day or has body dysmorphia like myself and an ED and how comments from them building me up encourages and promotes ED to occur. I wish someone who cared enough about me including my own family, would have said to me are you ok? I just want to be sure you're not going through something and I'm here if you are! I am estranged from my family because first and foremost they're simply toxic and because I'm in ED therapy and recovery and they never even cared when I told them I was diagnosed with an ED! No support at all, \ud83d\ude1e society also sucks making us feel it's ok and we have no one really looking out for our best interests. Take care, hugs to you!! \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c You're not alone!",

      "body": "agreed, it\u2019s awful. i used to get complimented all the time about my body when i was at my lowest point. i was quite literally on death\u2019s doorstep: passing out in the shower, constantly exhausted, easily irritated, endlessly fatigued, bones jutting out, with brittle nails and damaged hair. people would see my frail figure and my twig legs, and they\u2019d compliment me for it. they\u2019d say- totally unprompted- that i had this killer body, that i should keep doing what i\u2019m doing, that they wish they could be \u201cgood\u201d like me, etc.\n\nwhereas if i- or anyone with common sense- saw someone in that condition, it would be an immediate red flag and raise alarm bells. it should never under any circumstances be validated- much less the standard.\n\nwhat\u2019s hard now is that i\u2019m in recovery, and i have a healthier bmi and everything, feeling much better than before, etc\u2026 but the compliments are all gone. people romanticize the worst shit, and it\u2019s very discouraging, and honestly borderline triggering. it really pisses me off.\n\nim so sorry you\u2019re going through this right now. i\u2019ve become less fragile to it over time, but it still hurts, and we have every right to be upset about it. people are fucking idiots. it is more than okay to be furious about these comments. i\u2019m here if you ever need to vent about anything.",

I just recently came off a medication so I lost a few (no ED on board) and I've heard these comments from three people so far. Including my *boss*. I just stare at them with a blank expression until they look away.\n\nImportantly, I don't let society's commentary impact my eating habits any more. It's hard some times, but I can only hold myself accountable, not anyone else.",

Not even clothes 5 sizes too large could conceal the blatantly obvious. I brought every ounce of that shame and humiliation upon myself.",

It\u2019s still hard with extended family or those who don\u2019t know but it helps to have those who understand. My brother who was the first people I confided in always redirects me after a comment on my weight such as \u2018wow, you\u2019ve lost weight. You look so good\u2019 and he\u2019ll jump in and ask about my clothes or asks about my bow (I like hair clips) so I don\u2019t dwell on those comments. I\u2019m lucky to have him.",
