  "selftext": "Just a vent really \nI have had an eating disorder since my mid teens and I am in my mid 20s now. In that time I have been deathly thin and I have also had periods where I have acc been an extremely healthy weight, in fact probably a little over weight at one point. \nAn ED never goes away really imo, even when you are deemed \u201chealthy\u201d again. The crippling dysmorphia is still there, you just learn to deal with it but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t have episodes and off days with it.\nI remember finding it quite frustrating that I felt a little like my ex boyfriend used to behave like I was \u201cmaking it up\u201d or being \u201cdramatic\u201d when I\u2019d have a breakdown about food as I suppose he had mostly known me whilst I was quite a healthy weight. I don\u2019t think he quite fully understood how full of dread it could make me because I did not look unhealthy enough on the outside.\n\nI have had quite a bad relapse so I am currently at one of the smallest weights I\u2019ve been at and it\u2019s not only been notable to me that people are suddenly taking it seriously again but also one of the many thoughts making me reluctant to put weight on again is the fear that people will not take this huge part of my mental health seriously again if I appear too visibly healthy. It is frustrating and makes me sad so I am venting the thought here. Sorry if it didn\u2019t make much sense.\n\nIt does not matter what weight you are, your struggle is so so valid and should be recognised x",

      "body": "I think that part of learning to deal with our eating disorders is realizing that using food as a way to manipulate and control how others perceive us or a way to control when we feel out of control is not healthy. It sounds like your bf isn\u2019t taking your eating disorder seriously which is a shame but that doesn\u2019t mean that you have to prove it to him either. I think a lot of us have felt like people don\u2019t take our mental or physical illnesses seriously and feel the need to prove to them at some point but trying to prove to them only hurts ourselves and puts us further and further back into our destructive habits. I think learning to communicate more directly about how you feel about your body or how it makes you feel when he doesn\u2019t take you seriously is important. If people still continue to disregard feelings or not take you seriously then there should probably be some boundaries put up between you and these people. This is all really difficult and like you said the eating disorder never fully goes away but learning to live with it and accept it and having people who understand that you can turn to can definitely make it a lot easier over time to nip in the butt. Hopefully this is helpful and you can use this time of people taking you seriously to help them understand what lead you here and how they could have helped more effectively to prevent this.",

I have struggled really bad while being at a normal bmi, and I\u2019ve felt okay while being underweight. People tend to think that the severity of eating disorders is based on how you look. I got the diagnosis anorexia nervosa when I was underweight, but as soon as I hit a healthy weight, they changed it into atypical anorexia, which is so stupid and feeds the idea that you cannot be a \u201dreal anorexic\u201c when you are at a normal weight. Nobody took me seriously when I was at my lowest mentally, just because I had a healthy bmi. But as soon as I got noticeably underweight, people seemed to care. Right now I am at my smallest and only now doctors are actually listening. Before that, I even got told that \u201deating is obviously not my problem\u201c.  So I totally understand how you feel.

          "body": "I think that part of learning to deal with our eating disorders is realizing that using food as a way to manipulate and control how others perceive us or a way to control when we feel out of control is not healthy. It sounds like your bf isn\u2019t taking your eating disorder seriously which is a shame but that doesn\u2019t mean that you have to prove it to him either. I think a lot of us have felt like people don\u2019t take our mental or physical illnesses seriously and feel the need to prove to them at some point but trying to prove to them only hurts ourselves and puts us further and further back into our destructive habits. I think learning to communicate more directly about how you feel about your body or how it makes you feel when he doesn\u2019t take you seriously is important. If people still continue to disregard feelings or not take you seriously then there should probably be some boundaries put up between you and these people. This is all really difficult and like you said the eating disorder never fully goes away but learning to live with it and accept it and having people who understand that you can turn to can definitely make it a lot easier over time to nip in the butt. Hopefully this is helpful and you can use this time of people taking you seriously to help them understand what lead you here and how they could have helped more effectively to prevent this.",
