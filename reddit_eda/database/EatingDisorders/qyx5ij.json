  "title": "Request: Boyfriend with ED lying",
  "selftext": " \n\nMy boyfriend and I have had several conversations about his eating disorder but mostly very emotional ones with both of us crying and me begging him to stop purging because his eating disorder is effecting our relationship. And in every conversation he agrees he will get help. Within a few days of those conversations he\u2019s back to purging and I check in with him and will say \u201cI\u2019ve noticed you doing this\\_\\_\\_\\_ are you okay?\u201d but he always says he\u2019s fine and that\u2019s nothing but he also repeatedly reminds me he hates talking about it which I get it but he hides so much from me and when he\u2019s starting back up again he lies to me about going to the bathroom.\n\nI keep seeing online that i am not supposed to take his secrecy personally but it\u2019s so hard to not feel like he\u2019s lying to me and abusing my trust, and now I feel like my trust for him is being effected too.\n\nHow do I tell him AGAIN that his eating disorder is effecting our relationship, and that I can\u2019t keep having these conversations begging him to get help and him agreeing and then he stops for a few days just to start back up again?\n\nI need advice as a significant other on how to help him, but I also need advice on when should I stop trying to help someone who obviously doesn\u2019t actually want help or get better?",

      "body": "I was married to someone who was an addict for many years, the relational behaviors you are describing are exactly what it was like when I was with him. I desperately KNEW I couldn\u2019t change him, we would have conversations where he promised to get better, to cut down, to try harder to fix it. But then it just lead to lying. The more pressure I put, the more secretive he got. \n\nIt\u2019s desperately sad and painful when people can\u2019t/won\u2019t quit the things that are destroying their life and/or their relationship or other important things in their life. The only thing you can do in this time is to put up your own boundaries. If you notice him doing xyz, then the only thing you can change or work with are your own reactions. For example- You can now decide that his choice to not get help is something you can\u2019t or can\u2019t live with- and you can leave or stay in the relationship. This is your time to make a decision, because he\u2019s unfortunately not ready. You can decide to accept where he is at if you can live with you can continue to encourage him to get help, but it\u2019s a slippery slope into begging- and may come with a world of pain/disappointment. \n\nThere will be a turning point, but it may not come for years - literally. I\u2019ve had eating problems for 10-15 yrs. Even my doctor looking me in my eyes and telling me I had an eating disorder over and over for a year couldn\u2019t get me to change. I literally had to come the conclusion on my own. It happened while I was completely alone for a weekend while my partner was away. \n\nA huge part of relationships are about accepting the person you are with, and deciding what you can and can\u2019t live with. That might sound like tough love, but at its core it\u2019s about both partners being able to live their truth. \n\nThings like addiction (which I kind of think EDs are similar to), and EDs, are that they are serving an underlying purpose. I found out a year after my husband and I broke up and he was molested.. and I grew up with so much trauma also. He was using his addiction to numb and I was doing something similar. While both things were absolutely horrible for our bodies they did serve a purpose in some ways. My ex is still not sober, and I am happy I have found recovery. \n\n\u201cHelp is the sunny side of control\u201d",

      "body": "It\u2019s easier and less confronting to purge than it is to address the issues at the root cause of the eating disorder. \n\nI am highly educated with a stressful and successful career but I have had some form of an eating disorder since I was 17 and it\u2019s only been the last 5 years that I\u2019ve started addressing the cause of my disorder. Just like an addict, I\u2019ve used a relationship with food as my coping mechanism rather than talking about the feelings of self worth, abandonment, poor self esteem, shame, guilt etc but I didn\u2019t realise that was what I was doing. I thought I had the control but the reality is the ED had the control and until I was ready to delve into the \u2018why\u2019 I wouldn\u2019t be able to stop. It\u2019s sucks and it\u2019s easier to binge/purge than to address my feelings. \n\nI refer to them as my demons, they tell me that there\u2019s so much that\u2019s wrong with me that there\u2019s no way I\u2019m worthy, loved, valued etc and it took me an acute depressive episode with significant suicidal ideation, failed suicide attempt and a complete inability to work before I was able to understand why I had my ED and start facing the causes of it. \n\nI started on medication and see my psychiatrist every week. I\u2019ve had great successes and huge failures but I\u2019m still moving forward - I don\u2019t want to be controlled by my demons and food. \n\nAddressing my traumas, I have physically lost so much - left my emotionally abusive marriage after being with him for 28 years, he accused me of stealing when I was attempting to take some shared property as well as property that was mine gifted to my by my granny upon her death - with my name scratched into the back of it by my granny. I walked out of the house with my clothes and car. I had no ability to fight it, I chose to abandon my religion as it was also a basis for my ED so I lost my identity and the support of the church. I lost a very close friend - who we\u2019d had family holidays with, children grew up together and we both had a grandchild a day apart but she decided it was too hard to remain friends. I was so devastated at that abandonment and was completely unprepared for that. Recently she has reconnected with me and I\u2019ve started to navigate what that friendship will look like. \n\nSorry for the long reply - right now your boyfriend finds comfort in his ED rather than trying to find the cause of it. He has to be ready to lose his support system (the ED) as well as others that might find it too traumatic for them and that is so hard \n\nPM me if you have any questions",

      "body": "from experience , I lied plenty of times to my friends about improving. I love them, it\u2019s not personal. But at that time I was processing things different. I didn\u2019t want to disappoint them and myself, and another part of me wanted to keep going because I would feel guilty if not. \n\nWhen he\u2019s ready, he\u2019ll open up with you about it, or he\u2019ll get better. Getting better from ED\u2019s are like, 80% self readiness. With you supporting him, he\u2019ll get there. He\u2019s not abusing trust, he probably thinks he\u2019s fine. I believed I was fine and didn\u2019t care about the danger risks. \n\nAnd honestly, when venting, my friends started picking up on my ED habits, so maybe he\u2019s trying to protect you.\n\nED\u2019s are a big deal. I knew it was unhealthy and didn\u2019t care. For a while, I thought it was good. It\u2019s a vicious cycle. When you try to stop, you feel yourself falling back. Opening up about it is hard, because at times I myself believe it\u2019s not \u201cbad\u201d, and that\u2019s your brain playing tricks on you",
