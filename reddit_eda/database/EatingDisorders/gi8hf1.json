  "selftext": "I moved back in with my family after the quarantine started because one of my roommates still goes to work. She has been constantly checking in the fridge and pantry to see what I eat. Asking me if I weighed myself each weekend. I\u2019m usually very active in my job and eat very healthy. I fully recovered from anorexia on my own. It took years. I still struggle with BDD but I\u2019ve been wearing baggy clothes and avoiding mirrors since there\u2019s no reason to focus on looks right now. The stress of her lately has left me binging late at night. After dinner tonight, I said I was so full. She said \u201cYou need to go back to starving yourself to shed that weight\u201d. I was mortified. Thankfully my sister wasn\u2019t there. Now the thoughts have been coming back. I feel so ashamed. I need help with the binging because it\u2019s becoming uncontrollable but I also don\u2019t want to fall back into restricting",

Then I'd look her right in the eye and take a big bite out of an apple.\n\nThe point is to make it clear that her abusive language won't keep you from living the way you want to. Dealing with narcissistic parents means neutralizing their abuse by not giving them the reaction they want from you. If she starts to withhold food as some sort of power play, it's time to head back to your own place because that home is not a good place for you to be.",

      "body": "I\u2019m so sorry this has happened, and that you\u2019re being challenged in your recovery. I know there are a lot of comments about how wrong your mother was and know it probably brings up a lot of anger. Try to remember that she is literally brainwashed by diet culture and her upbringing within a fat-phobic society. Her comment is actually coming from a place of wanting what she thinks is best for you/protecting you OR she hates herself so much she is taking it out on you... So try to have some compassion/forgiveness, as hard as that must be. That said, it is NOT acceptable for her to comment about your weight and eating EVER. You should try to establish boundaries with her so she knows that those topics are completely off limits. You could also try to explain how the comment was really hurtful/how it made you feel and see if she realizes how insensitive it is. If you have a therapist or other friends in recovery, reach out for support! \nListen to the Food Psych and Love Food Podcasts for help with the binging. Practicing Intuitive eating is the only tried and true method to battling ED in my experience. Do you have the Intuitive Eating book by Evelyn Tribole and Rush? Remember that you are loved and worthy no matter what your size/shape and that your body does NOT define you. Sending love and hugs \u2665\ufe0f You got this!",
