  "selftext": "My daughter quickly developed an ED and was hospitalized for a refeeding within weeks. She was home afterward for maybe 5 weeks with little to no progress, and became increasingly restrictive. We had little time to seek any meaningful therapy, which ended up being once a week for those few weeks she was home. Her therapist recommended residential treatment with school being out. She is at a very small residential facility and has been for 2 weeks. She\u2019s not made any progress medically. She is so miserable and won\u2019t even talk to us other than to say she wants to come home. She is also a 5 hour drive away. I\u2019m not looking for medical advice, rather, is this doing more harm mentally for her than good? She\u2019s so young and it is devastating to all of us. Anyone else started so young that had a positive outcome? I feel ready to pull her out and try more therapy locally. ",

And if you\u2019re saying it\u2019s a medical risk, it will get worse if she comes home and doesn\u2019t progress. At least the treatment center can monitor and hopefully improve progress with strict regimen and schedule and more intensive therapy. I was also very far from my family. It\u2019s lonely and devastating and I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like for a parent. But please give it a few more weeks. If she comes home and just does therapy, I truly think that is not enough. You could look into family based treatment but anyone I know who has done that has not had it work out well. I did that and ended up in a residential for an entire year as a teen and have been back to treatment about 6 or 7 times. Don\u2019t give up. I am so sorry you\u2019re going through this.",

I have ARFID and struggle with unfamiliarity and just skipping meals without much effect. I\u2019ve also never responded well to strict rules (I tend to fall into malicious compliance as a defence mechanism). After periods of restricted eating, it\u2019s possible your daughter is not suited to inpatient care and the lack of familiarity is causing her so much misery and struggles that it is making it more difficult for her. Having said that familiarity comes from time and I do agree with many people here that usually inpatient care is the best option (putting aside inherently bad facilities as you said you don\u2019t suspect that is what is happening here although keep aware of it) however some people respond poorly to it and may be able to meet her goals to get out but immediately fall back into the same habits. Like I said before though I think treatment is almost always the best option and inpatient when recommended is most of the time the best option",

I didn\u2019t care as long as I was fucking thin. I\u2019m now 39 and just had to spend $15,000 on my teeth and have osteopenia. The thing I most regret about my ED is what it did to my parents.

Keeping her monitored by medical professionals will help stabilize her in a way that you might not be able to at home. Plus, forcing weight gain when the ed is really just a method of coping will only make her feel like she needs to lose the weight again. There is a deeper issue that is causing her to seek out this level of control.   \n\n\nFor now, I would try to get to the root of what caused the ed. For me, I crave connection and felt like I had to fit a certain mold to \u201dbelong enough\u201d with people for them to like being around me. My therapist made me create a timeline of my thoughts about food and my body. When I was three I told my grandma I couldn\u2019t eat donut holes because they would make me fat- this was a reflection of my Mom\u2019s rejection of her body, so I took that on myself to avoid the perceived punishment of \u201cfat\u201d so that my mom would accept me. Since that discovery I\u2019ve been able to see how the ed isolated me and how I used it to cope with loneliness and insecurity. Thinking back to when I had disordered patterns when I was twelve, it was all about fitting in. Rejection can cause as much stress to your body as a broken bone can, so maybe try to identify if there are areas she feels rejected or needs more love. If anything, remember that while weight can play a large role in an ed, its not just a weight disorder.",

I was very resistant at first but eventually came around. She needs help, especially with her being so young she needs to nip it in the bud. And if you\u2019re saying it\u2019s a medical risk, it will get worse if she comes home and doesn\u2019t progress. At least the treatment center can monitor and hopefully improve progress with strict regimen and schedule and more intensive therapy. I was also very far from my family. It\u2019s lonely and devastating and I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like for a parent. But please give it a few more weeks. If she comes home and just does therapy, I truly think that is not enough. You could look into family based treatment but anyone I know who has done that has not had it work out well. I did that and ended up in a residential for an entire year as a teen and have been back to treatment about 6 or 7 times. Don\u2019t give up. I am so sorry you\u2019re going through this.",

But I suppose deep down, I know what you say is true and that this is the best thing we can do for her right now. The older girls there have told her this doesn't work, but I have to remain positive and believe she will benefit in the long term. I read horrible things about FBT on here and do not think that's the right approach at this time. I truly appreciate your sharing your experiences and for thinking of our girl :)",

As an adult in treatment, the general attitude is much better because most of the time you choose to be there. as a tween, I eventually got over the other attitudes of the patients, learned to stick by myself most of the times while still socializing on the surface level, and did quite well for a few years. I would recommend doing php and iop once residential is done. It helped me a lot and I did not relapse with my ED for several years.",

She will be depressed for a bit, but it\u2019ll all come around. Eating disorders stem multiple diagnosis. Be her rock, and try to talk about different things not so centered around food all the time. The biggest mistake in a kids residential treatment is making their entire stay their identity.",
