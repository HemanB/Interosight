  "selftext": "It\u2019s only really recently dawned on me that I\u2019ve thankfully recovered from my eating disorder, and I\u2019d like to share it!\n\nThis time last year my eating disorder was at its worst. I would weigh myself daily constantly, amongst other unhealthy habits. I tried different therapy paths but nothing was effective. \nBut I\u2019m very glad to say, I haven\u2019t touched my weighing scale in a long time! I don\u2019t calorie count any more. I eat when I\u2019m hungry and eat well (and healthy), and I don\u2019t starve myself any more or have regretful binging sessions.\n\nI did this all by myself over time, and I\u2019d like to share it. I feel quite proud of myself for getting through that dark period of my life.",
