  "title": "Obese after Anorexia",
  "selftext": "Hello! \n\nTldr; Can anyone relate to being obese before/after Anorexia? I feel so alone in this and need help with getting out of it. \n\nMy ED story:  \n\nI (F23) developed disordered eating styles due to growing up with CPTSD. For most of my life I have been obese. I've lost all the (over)weight three times. It was at its worst in 2018 right before I finished highschool. I developed heart palpitations and had to see doctors because of severe hip pain; they thought I had osteoporosis, luckily I didn't, but that was a wake up call for me. I made myself go inpatient in 2019, miraculously got pregnant after getting out and gained more than double my weight after that. I ate because I was so scared my body couldn't keep up with being pregnant. Then I ate and ate because I was emotionally overwhelmed and had a  baby. Now I'm at my highest weight ever, active, but I keep overeating and I feel stuck in this loop. Whenever I try to lose weight i swing into anorexic habits. I've tried just focusing on being healthy and active which helps with depression but I can not stop emotional eating when I'm anxious. And i am anxious 90% of the time. \n\nI hate my body so much and am having a hard time existing. I'm seeing 3 therapists, but I am scared of talking about food issues as it holds a lot of shame. We have scratched the surface and I hope to find the courage to talk about it. For now I hope I can maybe catch some words on here from people who might get it. \nOften I feel too gross to even leave the house, which used to be my downfall. Now, having a kid, that is not a thought I am allowing myself to indulge in. As soon as she sleeps it bursts out though. My relationship is definitely taking a physical blow because of it and I'm scared of what will happen when my child picks up on it. I just don't know how to stop this disorder.",

I have a very similar story, cptsd, and a mom that is still to this day chronically dieting.\n\nI've been in recovery for a while now, but last year I was told I had to lose weight in order to get surgery for my lipedema, which is very painful. That really messed with my head, but after seeing many doctors, I decided to go on ozempic. I have since lost 45 pounds, only a few pounds to go until I can do the surgery!\n\nMore importantly, ozempic has really helped me to take some of the stress out of eating. Dealing with bad insulin resistance, eating was often a matter of urgency for me. Ozempic really helped with that. I am eating fully intuitively now, and still losing weight.\n\nHowever, if ozempic had triggered my anorexia, I would definitely have prioritized recovery over the surgery.\n\nMy recommendation is finding a support group. A lot of things that were very shameful for me became ok when I was able to talk to people with similar thoughts. Interestingly, we all share the same basic thoughts in my eating disorder support group, no matter if we have anorexia, orthorexia, bulemia or binge eating disorder.",

I also second the person who recommended a therapist who specializes in eds, I need to do that too but my current one is not well known so it's kinda hard. When I have some extra money I found a book about the ED I have that I'm hoping will help since I can't seem to find a Dr that knows about it and will treat an adult.

I actually spent the first 2.5 years after my anorexia recovery perfectly fine and happy. I was still incredibly skinny, but at a healthier weight due to consistent exercise and diet. But then I went to college and gained 20 lbs\u2026I became super depressed about it and stopped attending classes because I couldn\u2019t leave my house. I spent a couple months just laying in my room and ordering food to binge on and kept gaining weight. My mental state got so bad that I had to quit only half a semester in. Even worse, I had paid a full years tuition and couldn\u2019t get the money back. I was dead broke since I kept spending money on food and had to move back in with my dad. It was a very humiliating and disappointing situation. I thought that living with my dad again would help me get back on track physically and mentally but nothing changed. Now, I\u2019ve moved across the country away from everyone I know to live in isolation. I work at a very remote area that provides free housing. When I\u2019m not working, I shut myself away in my room all day, and I\u2019ve become borderline agoraphobic. Everytime i need to drive into town to purchase supplies, I experience extreme anxiety and nervousness in public. Sometimes I bail on an errand run because I can\u2019t bring myself to go outside.\n\nI am very sorry about your situation\u2026 we just need to keep fighting and remember what\u2019s important to us. What matters is that we keep picking ourselves back up everytime we fall. This is a lifetime struggle.",

I actually spent the first 2.5 years after my anorexia recovery perfectly fine and happy. I was still incredibly skinny, but at a healthier weight due to consistent exercise and diet. But then I went to college and gained 20 lbs\u2026I became super depressed about it and stopped attending classes because I couldn\u2019t leave my house. I spent a couple months just laying in my room and ordering food to binge on and kept gaining weight. My mental state got so bad that I had to quit only half a semester in. Even worse, I had paid a full years tuition and couldn\u2019t get the money back. I was dead broke since I kept spending money on food and had to move back in with my dad. It was a very humiliating and disappointing situation. I thought that living with my dad again would help me get back on track physically and mentally but nothing changed. Now, I\u2019ve moved across the country away from everyone I know to live in isolation. I work at a very remote area that provides free housing. When I\u2019m not working, I shut myself away in my room all day, and I\u2019ve become borderline agoraphobic.
