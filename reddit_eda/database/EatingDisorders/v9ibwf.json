You posted under \u2018eating disorders\u2019 so I\u2019m assuming your boyfriend has disordered eating. \n\nMy thoughts/comments: \n\n1.) His medications (anti depressant & anti anxiety) are known to cause known to cause sexual dysfunction and appetite changes. \nIf he told you he is depressed because of the quality of your sex life, ask him what he thinks you can do as a couple to improve it/maintain a healthy relationship. Make sure you listen and remember the medication and conditions might have effects as well.  Someone also mentioned a thyroid issue so some simple bloodwork would indicate any deficiencies. Maybe suggest a doctors appointment to address his disinterest in sex.",
