  "selftext": "I absolutely adored by body when I was super skinny but I had an incredible amount of anxiety. I felt almost like I could \u201conly restrict for so long\u201d so everything had to be done fast. But everytime I would be alone I would sm*ke, get incredibly anxious, need caffeine pills to stimulate myself, and be absolutely at my worst point of anxiety. Can someone please validate the fact that when your body doesn\u2019t have the nutrients it needs, it absolutely has an affect on the mind and the amount of anxiety?? I can\u2019t isolate the variables but I\u2019m pretty sure the lack of food was a player in my anxiety spike.",

It's actually totally reverse for me. I felt completely comfortable and at ease restricting myself. I felt accomplished, in control, capable. Every time I got smaller, it fed my need for controlling something anything in my life. When I was put through therapy it was not working and causing significant anxiety and depression and severe adverse reactions because it was all based on triggers and ideals that didn't apply to me. They were trying to heal an injury that I didn't have. So it just triggered my lack of control even further and made it worse for me. \n\nI had to really dig to find a health program and support team that could understand and help me from the right perspective. I had to learn to find validation for my lack of control by being healthy instead of feeding unhealthy coping mechanisms.",
