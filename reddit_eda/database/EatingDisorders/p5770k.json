  "title": "Should we get my sister out of inpatient?",
  "selftext": "Not from the US, but I can't find advice on this anywhere else\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR Sister is getting help in public hospital but her treatment seems too restrictive and we worry it's going to make things worse**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy sister(19) has been purging for months and her weight is at an all time low, also starting to showing symptoms like muscle pain, teeth problems these few weeks. From what we know she's also diagnosed with anxiety but not delusional, is very smart and highly self aware of her problems.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFew days ago her counsellor advised her to be institutionalized, she agreed so we took her to a public hospital and she just got transferred to a mental unit yesterday, with her consent of course. By then all her personal items are taken away, which I understand. **Problem is they also took away her books, which to me seems very innocuous. We were told that the psychiatrist won't be able to see her until a week later. She probably won't have a counsellor aside from drugs. Also visitors are not allowed, not because of covid, but it's just a rule.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's great to have free healthcare here and I understand inpatient treatment comes with a lot of restrictions, the lack of doctors is a sad reality we have to accept, but the book thing seems too extreme to us. But if they're giving her all this free time and not doing anything special, why can't she at least read?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs inpatient treatment supposed to be this restrictive? We're tempted to get her out of there however we can't afford private hospitals. She has always been hated the attention and will likely resent us for her stay there anyway. Should we just wait and see what happens? What else can we do?",

      "body": "It is not supposed to be that restrictive, no. Such a harsh environment can make it really hard to recover. She should be somewhere where she can speak to a therapist and be able to read books in her free time. The treatment center I went to was somewhat restrictive, yes, but we met with a therapist a few times a week, had group sessions, and could read/do puzzles/etc in our free time. We could also have visitors.",

      "body": "I\u2019m a resident emergency physician almost 4 years recovered from anorexia. Taking away books goes too far. My guess is that they are concerned that the books contain material that will continue to feed the mindset of an eating disorder in some way, but that\u2019s too restrictive. Physicians do have the power to bend rules, but it\u2019ll be hard to justify getting an exception made for her when nobody else is allowed to have books. You may need to make a decision about the risks of leaving and how long it will take to transfer her elsewhere versus just gutting it out and hopefully finding some sort of alternate diversion. I have never heard of a psych ward taking books away unless they were spiral-bound (lethal weapons, truly! \ud83d\ude44).",

      "body": "I literally have PTSD from inpatient/ residential treatment, a lot of it came from being in an extremely restrictive setting without adequate mental health support. I spent years trying to scrape my self-worth off the ground (if mental health professionals feel I should be treated this way, then I must deserve it).  It made trusting professionals in the future very difficult and at times impossible.  There is a trade off in all of this.  Treatment temporarily gave me my physical health back, but it came at a huge long term cost.  It drove me further into my disorder instead of helping me reach recovery. Going to treatment remains one of my biggest lifetime regrets. I don't have a ton of advice, especially since your medical system is so different from the US, but you do have a right to be cautious and apprehensive about how your sister is being treated.",

Then, as they gain back strength and cognitive function- more normalcy is restored to their routine. I have had my clothes taken away before and although it made me mad as all hell at the time, ultimately it curbed a destructive behavior and the place that enforced that rule truly saved my life on multiple occasions. I would talk to her team before removing her from the unit, and see if they can explain the rules to you and her course of treatment.
