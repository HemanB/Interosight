  "selftext": "I\u2019m 17 M, I\u2019ve been really struggling with restrictive eating lately, I\u2019ve been diagnosed with an Ed, but I\u2019ve never been able to get actual treatment, I kept getting blown off my my local clinic when I requested outpatient instead of partial because I know that\u2019d be better than me. And they gave me no resources then and I haven\u2019t been back. It\u2019s gotten pretty bad in the past month, I don\u2019t know what to do, my mental health is also really bad. Idk if I should do inpatient, or is there anything I can do in the moment to encourage myself to eat like anything.",

      "body": "If you have the means I would get the most intensive option they suggest. This will allow you to really focus on giving yourself time to heal in a really deep way. The earlier you start the better opportunities you have to not let this take you down. I started at 15 and finally got help at 46. By that time things were unbearable. I wasted decades thinking I could do it on my own. Your investment in your healing is the best one you can make. Best of luck to you. This is such a beast but it is SO liberating when you get it behind you.",
