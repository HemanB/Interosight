  "selftext": "I have a 16 year old son who I am starting to suspect has an eating disorder. He's lost a lost of weight in the past couple of months. He started going to the gym this past year as well, but he's not been going enough to lose the weight he has, in my opinion. \n\nI've also noticed that when he eats, he eats very quickly, then he goes to the restroom shortly after. I've recently noticed remnants of vomit in the toilets. \n\nI'm honestly scared and lost. I haven't approached him with this yet. I want to make sure when I do I am delicate and don't make it at all worse. I am signing him up for therapy as well. \n\nAny help at all on how to approach this would be greatly appreciated. ",

Sorry you're going thru this, but glad you can recognize signs...I'm sorry for the \"novel\" & some graphic info, but this hits home & there are important things to know...\nI have a long history with Bulimia (31 yrs, off & on) & I didn't even see it in one of my daughter's at that age. Of course, I didn't have all the Dx's I finally have now, so there's A LOT I wasn't able to recognize. \nTell tale signs I know too well are the rapid weight loss,  the vomit remains, going straight to the bathroom or \"needing to take a shower\" right after dinner (in my teen years & some of my early adulthood) & possibly over exercising, but also, not eating a lot or at all in front of people, drinking a ton of fluids with meals, pretending to feel \"sick\" so needing the bathroom, toilet is clean after you come out and/or smells of perfumes or cleaning products, if he's doing this, you may still find vomit under the rim where you use a toilet brush if he's \"tried\" to clean the evidence, choking easily, food remnants coming up on their own because they're sitting in the esophagus, mouthwash, sore throats, cavities, tooth loss and one VERY noticeable one (depending on the consistency) are marks & or scabs on the knuckles- pointer, middle, ring fingers and VERY bad indigestion (which can lead to acid reflux & or a hiatal hernia (stomach sphincter no longer opens/closes properly & allowed stomach acid to come up into the esophagus & could lead to scarring or holes in the esophagus)\n\nI'm 43 now and I've probably done it a handful of times over a years time, I'm getting better, on my own, but it's a thought (more than an action) often.

I have a 16 yr old now & my older children, I understand 16 is a hard age because nothing you say is right or is heard/taken to heart and you couldn't POSSIBLY understand because you're the parent & even less so if you're different genders.

      "body": "Your instinct to address this early is spot-on. Before talking to him, it might help to learn more about eating disorders so you're well-informed. When you're ready to chat, find a quiet moment when you both have time. Start by sharing your observations using \"I\" statements - like \"I've noticed\" or \"I'm worried\" - and be specific about the changes you've seen in his eating habits and weight. Try to focus on his health rather than appearance. The key is to listen without judgment and let him know you're there to support him. It's a good move to arrange therapy, and you could also consider a check-up with his doctor. You could start the conversation like this: \"\\[Son's name\\], I've noticed some changes lately that have me worried. Can we talk about what's going on?\" Even just starting the recovery process takes time, so be patient and keep the lines of communication open. You're doing the right thing by addressing this - your son is lucky to have such a caring parent.",

      "body": "I\u2019m 18 and i have restricting and binge-eating ed, along with occasional bulimia episodes (purging, fasting, etc.). My family has never noticed, and I think it\u2019s because they don\u2019t fully understand eating disorders. To them, you only seem sick if you\u2019re deadly thin. I wish someone had talked to me sooner\u2014maybe I wouldn\u2019t be struggling as much.\n\nIf you\u2019re worried about someone, it\u2019s best to start by addressing your concerns directly. Tell him what you\u2019ve noticed and give him a chance to respond. There are two possible outcomes: either he admits to having bulimia, or he says you\u2019re overreacting and that he\u2019s fine.\n\nIf he opens up about having bulimia, it becomes much easier to help him. You can support him by scheduling a visit with a psychologist, and if he\u2019s resistant, give him time. Have a conversation with him yourself, explaining that he can still live a healthy lifestyle, lose weight, and work out without resorting to harmful habits. Share the side effects of bulimia, such as damage to his teeth, digestive issues, stomach aches, and acid reflux. And don\u2019t forget to offer him a hug; emotional support is crucial.\n\nIf he insists that there\u2019s no problem, keep an eye on him. If he continues these behaviors, approach him again and explain your concerns in a caring way.",

      "body": "The thread has given you some good suggestions on dos and don'ts. It can be very very scary to see and suspect this as a parent, I want to take a moment to empathise with you. And especially that you've recognised this and take a step back to assess your next move... That can be very difficult to do. So hats off to you for that. My Mum at first acted out in fear (I didn't realise it was fear at the time, I thought I was just disappointing her). \n\nSome tips moving forward from my own experience.... \n\n1. A gentle conversation expressing concern. Be careful with this one, EDs are very secretive and they'll likely be denial and possibly going to more extreme lengths to hide his behaviours if ED thinks it's being noticed. Be aware of this. However, a conversation expressing concern, care and offering support can go a long way to connect back with him, even if the ED may not like it. \n\n\n2. I assume your son is still in education? It might be worth talking to someone at the school pastorally or the schools DSL about your concerns. They may be able to sign post to services. But most importantly, if you end up seeking therapy/support, being connected with the school in this way will help his recovery. They'll be able to keep an eye on his eating habits, but possibly even offer him a quiet place to eat meals when he begins recovery. I'd be reluctant to do this without his knowledge or before the wheels are turning in terms of accessing support, you don't want to heighten his feelings of feeling out of control or undermine trust too early on while he's still deep in ED mindset. However, he's likely skipping meals at school and having some contact with the school when recovery begins will be key in ensuring meal plans are followed and he's not hiding the fact he's skipping these meals.\n\n3. A big one! Research, read and access support for careers for loved ones with eating disorders. Most eating disorder services will offer carer support, as it's key in recovery, especially if the patient is under 18. I'd be mindful not to research to much directly on eating disorders, as it can be scary, and I think its designed to be scary to motivate those with EDs who are researching to seek support. But if you do research directly looking at resources for carers, this can be very helpful in guiding you how to navigate this and having conversations. There's some amazing books and courses out there - treading on eggshells and this book my mum was given to by the ED team really helped our relationship and ED heal - https://www.amazon.co.uk/Skills-based-Caring-Loved-Eating-Disorder/dp/1138826634?dplnkId=825bc73c-656e-49c3-a845-1580f9720a9c\n\nTry not accuse him of anything - the ED will bite back defensively. Know that sometimes you're going to be talking to the ED, and sometimes you're going to be talking to him, and you're not always going to be able to notice the difference (especially early on). If you're suspicious he's making himself sick, but reluctant to bring it up without certainty here's a few tips to look out for beyond the obvious that you've already noticed.... \n\n1. Running the tap/shower to hide the noise of vomitting (he may not be doing this currently, but this will definitely become a thing once he knows people have noticed)\n\n2. Going to the toilet multiple times in quick succession after meals, or flushing the toilet multiple times in one sitting. This is key as the ED develops... It might only be one vomit after a meal now, but can develop into multiple toilet trips/purgers after a meal.\n\n3. Loo roll left in the toilet. Again, might happen later on.... I used to put loo roll in to hide the remains knowing my mum was listening out for a few flushes. \n\n4. Drinking more during meal times... Possibly even specific drinks, such as fizzy pop, which can make it easier to purge. \n\n5. Eating food in a specific order. For example, veg first and then more fearing foods last. this comes from a untrue belief that the food they ate last that they fear will come up first.\n\n6. Social media use. Unsure if you have access to his social media, or have any protections/age restrictions on tech, or parental tracking. Heartbreakingly, there is a LOT of pro eating disorder content online that targets young people specifically, especially on tiktok currently. Tiktok is notoriously bad with cookies streamlining content and harmful content not being removed quick enough. It really is contributing to dramatic increases of eating disorders in the young. Unknown to me, my mum created a Tumblr account when I was younger (it used to be Tumblr for this stuff when I was young, before tiktok) and followed me to keep an eye on what I was sharing and posting. Wasn't until I logged back in years after to unfollow all the proED accounts and turn it all into poetry, that I discovered she did this! She never bought it up to me, but was telling my therapy team when there was something concerning. I would have been mad if I knew this in the moment, but respected it years after.\n\n7. Marshmallows. Marshmallows do not flush, they float, even after being vomitting. If you want confirmation... Try and get him to eat some marshmallows after a meal, maybe on a hot chocolate. Maybe just a hot chocolate, and not even at meal times. And then listen out if there's multiple flushes after his toilet trip. Hopefully he'll be unaware of this fact about marshmallows, and you'll be able to listen out for the multiple flushes, or look out for a lot of extra toilet roll being used to help it flush/hide it. If you decide to do this, I really would not tell him this was done until years and years into being recovered or never. Don't then approach the conversation starting as \"I know you're doing it because of this\", as this will set you on the back foot trust wise and the ED will get even more secretive.  Only do this for your own confirmation, and still approach the conversation as expressing concern and hope he's honest (he might not be, but you will know if he isn't).\n\nPlease know if you ever get stumped, have a question, hit a wall (and you will) or need support or advice, this group is here. Taking care of yourself through this process is key in being able to help him in the best way possible, make sure you have a support network in place for yourself to regulate your own emotions and support you. It's going to be hard... But if all of this is done in a delicate, mindful and most importantly caring way, your relationship with your son will come out so so so much stronger post recovery. But it's a hell of a journey, so make sure you have support in place for yourself.",

      "body": "It sounds like he is engaging in purging behavior, and about a third to a fourth of people with bulimia are men. If I were now a regular teenage boy, i'd be able to tell my parents if I got accidentally sick and vomited unintentionally. Finding traces of vomit is a very common way parents and others suspect a person has an eating disorder.  I  am not sure i'd advise you to urge a school counselor to talk to him, but you might speak to one and see what they would advise. I don't know if you should say something or not right now, but if you ask the professionals, they will give you guidance.  If he does have an ED, denial and anger, resentment and distancing are going to happen bc of it, so know that it is going to be a rough road.  I don't want to give you advice i'm in no place to give, but go to FB and ask in those groups, ask someone at an eating disorder center, or do a search online for PROFESSIONALS to speak to, and Google your question too: \"How do I help my child I think has an eating disorder?\". There's even videos on Youtube about your exact concern, \"How to help?\" \"Does my child have an eating disorder?\" You should also know that in bulimia, it's common to not loose a bunch of weight, but many do, esp when it's combined with anorexia. Bulimics are typically in the normal-weight range, so that keeps it even more unnoticed, untreated, and hidden. And it's more prevelant for both men and women who are into working out or in a sport that is weight/athletically-conscious. I hope your son is well; I had a very long period of bulimia and/or anorexia, and it harmed not just my health, but ate-away at so much of my life, or the life I hoped to have.",

If his goal really is to get a lean body, tell him that this is not the way. Talk to him, but don't accuse him of anything - if he's going through such extreme lengths, then it must be a very sensitive topic for him.\n\nIt's scientifically proven that you need food to lose weight, and that not eating can have the opposite effect.

When you're ready to chat, find a quiet moment when you both have time. Start by sharing your observations using \"I\" statements - like \"I've noticed\" or \"I'm worried\" - and be specific about the changes you've seen in his eating habits and weight. Try to focus on his health rather than appearance. The key is to listen without judgment and let him know you're there to support him. It's a good move to arrange therapy, and you could also consider a check-up with his doctor. You could start the conversation like this: \"\\[Son's name\\], I've noticed some changes lately that have me worried. Can we talk about what's going on?\" Even just starting the recovery process takes time, so be patient and keep the lines of communication open. You're doing the right thing by addressing this - your son is lucky to have such a caring parent.",
