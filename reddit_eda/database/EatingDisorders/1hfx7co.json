  "selftext": "\n\nI\u2019ve had an ed for about 4 years. It started at the beginning of high school. Starting school would make me so nervous I couldn\u2019t eat. I\u2019m the type to throw up when anxious because my anxiety is straight in the gut. I feel extremely nauseous, and sick. And I was nervous everyday, so I wouldn\u2019t eat. I developed emetophobia which is the severe fear of throwing up. I would be so nervous about getting sick Infront if others that I started getting scared of it. Years later I can\u2019t eat anything now, I\u2019ve lost so much weight, muscle, I\u2019m a walking Skelton. They say I have the body of a 90-100 year old. I\u2019ve been trying to recover, but I\u2019m in so much pain. I\u2019ve tried inpatient but it doesn\u2019t cater to me, and I have a huge fear of eating Infront of others so I lost even more weight. I got extremely sick. I don\u2019t know what to do, and nobody will help me. Everybody says I\u2019m too complicated or they don\u2019t wanna make me worse. I feel so hopeless, I don\u2019t wanna feel like this I\u2019m just scared. ",

I might be projecting.  \n\nBut, you said something... \"I have a huge fear of eating in front of others\".  That says to me that it is deeper than fear of throwing up.  \n\nI want to ask u to ask urself if you are gaslighting yourself.  Is your case REALLY different from other people?  This is something to figure out if you really want to get to the bottom of this.\n\nHow have you been trying to recover?  \n\nWhat are the steps you are taking?\n\nWhat does recovery look like to you?\n\nWhat is standing in your way?\n\nYou hold the key here.  This is YOUR life-to live, to lose, to flourish, to struggle...lots of scary things to think about.  A lot of times it feels easier to stay exactly where you are.\n\nYou have only had an ED for 4 years.  I have had one now for 27 years.  It has really controlled my life and messed up my direction in so many ways.  I hold it secret still.  I don't know if people choose to ignore it or what, frankly.  \n\nBut, I think u have a few things going for u-only had the ed for 4 years and your family knows about it!  This is great.  Now you need to start doing the work yourself.  And the first step is having a conversation.   \n\nThat is my advice.  I don't know if it is worth anything since I'm really struggling myself.  But I have many years with this beast and I have experience in the fight.  Battles won and yes, lost ...but I hope I win the war.  I hope you do too.  Wish we could fight together.  I wish u all the luck.  \n\n(also...have compassion for urself.  and stop caring what other people think.  if u are scared to eat in front of others, why is that?  pretend they don't exist.  do they even exist?  pretend they are npcs .  act as if u are the only person in the world that matters and u have to eat to survive.  stop caring about what other people think and start wanting to feel good. and look up some healthy inspirational pics.  some stars or athletes or whatever u think is beautiful but is strong.  inspiration.  ok.  much love)",

      "body": "Look for other places for help, look up centers near you or go see a primary care doctor and take it from there, it might be a lengthier process to get you into residential if you take that route but you need to start advocating for yourself now. The longer you wait, the more difficult it gets. Don\u2019t give up! You can also try and schedule an appointment with a nutritionist and start from there. Once some sort of medical doctor confirms that your body is undernourished you should be referred to what will likely be a higher level of care like residential where you can be fed by other means until you\u2019re strong enough to start working on eating orally. Check if your city has an Eating Disorder Specialist website, for example, the city of Houston has https://www.houstoneds.org/treatment-providers/#!directory where you can find care. Hang in there! You\u2019re gonna be alright!",

Average recovery time is 7 years so it makes no sense that you would be written off like that. \n\nYou need to find a better doctor. Nausea is very common in EDs and especially during recovery and it can be treated fairly easily with anti-nausea medication. Almost everyone with an ED fears eating in front of other people, this is actually the norm and definitely not something that would make anyone turn you away.\n\nRecovery is possible, don\u2019t give up hope just because you\u2019ve met some not so helpful doctors.",
