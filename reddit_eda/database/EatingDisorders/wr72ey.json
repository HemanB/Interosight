  "selftext": "I\u2019m 20 y/o and extremely skinny to the point where nothing fits me. I\u2019ve noticed I\u2019ve not been able to eat full meals. Ex. I will order a rice bowl from chipotle, have 2 bites and convince myself I\u2019m full and feel nauseous and gag if I force myself anymore. I\u2019m always hungry bc of how little I eat but I cannot get myself to eat. My question is, do I have some type of eating disorder or is it just the fact that I eat too little so my stomach has adjusted to that amount.\n\nEdit- Thank you to everyone that left me a response and wished me a great recovery\u2764\ufe0f. After reading all the comments I figured the issue is untreated anxiety (which i never would have thought of). I\u2019m definitely going to look into getting professional help and once again I\u2019m so grateful for everyone that made an effort to help me figure this out.",

Unfortunately being perpetually hungry will continue to fuel your anxiety and it\u2019s a cycle. A mental health issue that impacts your ability to eat normally is by definition disordered eating so it sounds like that may be going on for you. What helped me get out of this loop was identifying some foods that were very easy to eat and not feel too full. Shakes and smoothies worked well for me. You have to slowly practice eating more than feels comfortable and little by little your stomach will get used to the amount of food and be able to eat proper meals. It takes time, go slow and be patient and probably see someone about anxiety",
