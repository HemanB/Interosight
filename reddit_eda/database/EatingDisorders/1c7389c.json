But just remember, a lot of people who have fully recovered have left this part of their eating disorder (including ED Reddit communities, and other other ED online forums) behind, for the best. Don\u2019t be too hard on yourself, there are so many out there that are fully recovered but just don\u2019t talk about it for their own well-being, to avoid getting back into the thoughts or even concept of EDs. This is coming from someone who is trying in recovery, who is in hopes to one day never think about or revisit an online ED community. Although, yes, I am in right now. I hope to one day never have to look on Reddit to ask \u201cAnyone else?\u201d. Just remember, recovery is possible!

Then at 22, I started reintroducing foods that I had been restricting before, and I was sure that this was now true recovery. Some more milestones: feeling thirst again; not tracking calories even in my mind; being okay with having some fat on me; getting rid of old small clothes without any bad feelings; working out to become stronger and grow muscle rather than burn calories; not doing any cardio (not the healthiest one, but still); resting all day and still eating my maintenance calories; intentionally being in a surplus and feeling fine with the resulting weight gain.

I knew it was full recovery when i didn't even have the thoughts any more.  \n\nI hit my #1 goal of going to a restaurant, not looking up the menu before, and just ordering whatever felt amazing in the moment.  No stress, no worry, no counting, no obsessions, no body checking.  Just normal.\n\n  \nThat's recovery",
