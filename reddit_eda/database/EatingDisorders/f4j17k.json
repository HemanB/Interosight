  "title": "Request: boyfriend broke up with me two weeks after i left residential treatment",
  "selftext": "three weeks ago i got out of residential treatment (i was there for four months). i was doing so well in recovery at home and feeling really confident in my ability to recover. then my boyfriend who i was with for two years broke up with me five days ago. \n\nit feels like a punishment from anorexia. it feels like it\u2019s punishing me for getting rid of it and caring about myself. i feel so much guilt for taking care of myself and not paying enough attention to the relationship. it feels like him falling out of love with me is all my fault. plus i gained weight through weight restoration and i can\u2019t help but think he thinks i\u2019m fat, ugly, and disgusting now. \n\nthis just makes me want to go backwards and relapse :( i know it\u2019s a bad idea because i did so much hard work, but it\u2019s so tempting to go back to my old habits.\n\nmy therapist told me something that was helpful: that i\u2019ve improved myself and am healthy now and he\u2019s missing out on the real me. but at the same time, i just wish that wasn\u2019t true and i wish i didn\u2019t have to do this without him, he was my best friend. :(\n\njust looking for advice on how to deal with this difficult time.",

If someone only is with you based upon looks then they are too shallow to deserve you. Embrace your beautiful self and know that you are the better company than anyone who doubts yourself. Honestly, just bask in honoring yourself is soooo rewarding. Only when you are super comfortable with yourself will you realize that you are enough and there is not ONE person who is more deserving of you than you. Sounds corny but it's true. Congrats on your progress of residential treatment. You are years ahead of most people. Stay true to you Boo Boo!",

Maybe it was empowering to him to be with someone with an eating disorder.\n\nI got married when I was still fighting my eating disorder.  When I started getting healthier, my husband at the time still treated me like I was sick.  I didn\u2019t know it at the time, but he liked having someone to \u201ctake care of\u201d.  We were only married a year.  He was a nice guy but a momma\u2019s boy and as I started to get healthy, I quickly realized he definitely wasn\u2019t a good match for me for the long run. \n\nYears after our marriage ended, I found out he started dating a neighbor of ours who has M.S.  I realized I was right, he needed me to stay \u201csick\u201d and a healthier me wasn\u2019t for him.",
