  "title": "Concerned about my elite athlete husband's food fixation",
  "selftext": "I (38f) am married to a marathoner (45m). He is very, very, very fast. In recent years, he has become increasingly fixated on nutrition as it pertains to his running. During the lead up to a race, he has strict dietary requirements and can become quite irritable if they are not immediately met, such as if we don't have suitable ingredients for a specific meal. To be clear, we do a ton of meal planning, and I am well versed in his nutritional needs, but things happen, plans change, we're all just human, etc.  \n  \nFor a long time I just thought, well, this is what he has to do to be fast. But right now is his \"off\" season, his diet is less strict, and somehow he is becoming even more irritable surrounding food. It's like a compulsion. If I say anything to him in the morning, it's \"okay but first can we talk about lunch.\" If it's the afternoon, \"okay but what are we having for dinner.\" It's to the point where it's more or less all we talk about. I'm pretty sure it's all he thinks about. It's gotten to the point where we're bickering about things I don't care about (for example having chicken two meals in a row, that's fine with me, but he brings it up like he's anticipating me having a problem with it).  \n  \nA friend suggested this is starting to verge on disordered thinking about food. It's definitely impacting our relationship. So I am here to ask for resources. I would love to read some things, join a facebook group or subreddit, about disordered thinking about food in high level athletes. Everything I have read is for people with an ED before they got into running, or are running their first marathon, or encourage the non-runner partner to be more supportive.\n\nI want to add that his actual diet is pretty healthy. It's the fixation on it that is worrying me. It's as though what he eats is more important than our relationship.\n\n  \nAny help is appreciated, and sending best wishes to anyone out there struggling.\n\n\\*Apologies for the throwaway account, I promise I have a real account with post history but trying to keep our privacy.

The fixation part, that is.  \n\nIn my case, I was dating this woman, things developed pretty quickly, but once they had...she let me know that she was the top-ranked female bike racer in our state.  I know a few things  about EDs, so rather than thinking \"Gosh that's wonderful\", I was more like \"Uh oh \" instead. \n\nYour situation sounds more complicated though. Not only is he fixated on food, he's fixated on sport and exercise too.  Which can make certain otherwise good people fall into obsession and craziness. \n\nWith the person I knew, it took the form of her lying to me about all sorts of big and small things. She was not a bad person, but...there were symptoms.  I only saw her cry twice : Once when she said \"I just want to be perfect\", and the second time when she confessed that she trained so much because it \"helped her not think about things.\"\n\nSo I think you are right in thinking that there's an emotional component to this, even if he is being really successful with his running.   \n\n(Not sure why the AutoMod bot is here : Your post sounds fine to me, plus other people seem to be getting this too, today.  So some kind of glitch it seems ?)",

People are aloud to want to be healthy I don't understand how people are acting like professional doctors in the comments diagnosing him it's ridiculous. These comments are an echo chamber or diagnosing a person you read a couple of sentences about. Just talk to him he's ur husband u should be able to sit down and have difficult conversation. People jump to conclusions when it comes to food b/c they are projecting their problems. he's def not malnourished he's a marathon runner ppl generally cant be an elite athlete while malnourished. This is not an ED, but a clash of life styles IMO. BUT I could be wrong I'm not going to make statements about someone I don't know and act like they are facts. Talk to him if yall both agree there's an issue get help from professionals, not a bunch of people projecting their problem on reddit. I don't want to sound rude, but good god ppl are actually trying to diagnose him of this little info and that's ridiculous. YOUR CONCERNS ARE VERY VALID THOUGH, I just think the comments are fear mongering an insane amount, he could very well have an ED, but nothing you said should have random ppl diagnosing IMO. if the issue persists get him a simple therapy session or visit with a nutritionist simple as that. No need to try and figure out the exact issue we have professionals for that",
