  "title": "Request: Post request: Disordered eating vs eating disorders",
  "selftext": "Hi there, \ndisclaimer: *(1) this might be an unpopular opinion post. (2)I'm speaking from a perspective of ED survivor.*\n\nI have noticed a considerable amount of *\"Do I have an eating disorder?\"* posts on this sub and could not figure out what makes me feel so uncomfortable about them. These posts seem innocent, advice seeking and the members of community can reassure each other and help validate experiences and emotions. And then I realized that it was the lack of differentiation between disordered eating and eating disorders that left me feeling uneasy.\n\n**Disordered eating** is an epidemic in our culture. It is easy to develop an unhealthy relationship with food when it is made out to be the enemy. Food then turns into something to be feared or develops the allure of the forbidden fruit, paving the way for disordered food behaviours. [1] So lets face it - it is difficult to find a woman nowadays who has never tried dieting or some sort of other restrictive eating (from keto and veganism, to raw-plant based and paleo diets). \n> 53% of American girls age 13 are \u201cunhappy with their bodies.\u201d\u00a0 This grows to 78% by the time girls reach seventeen. [2]\nLow self-esteem, pressure to match unrealistic body types and connection of self-worth to ones perceived beauty -  are issues known almost universally by all woman.\n\nYes, disordered eating patterns should be taken seriously and it\u2019s important to reach out to a professional team to help you find balanced ways and nourish your body. > While studies show that up to 50% of the population in the USA demonstrate problematic or disordered relationships with food, body, and exercise; the rates of clinical eating disorders are much lower, estimated from 1%\u00a0to 3% percent\u00a0of the general population. [3]\u00a0\n\nSo where do we draw the line between disordered eating and full-blown eating disorder? It is all about degree.\u00a0An individual with disordered eating is often engaged in the same behaviours as those with eating disorders but at a lesser frequency or lower level of severity.\u00a0[3] As with other mental health issues, it is important to explore how and to what extent disordered eating is affecting an individual\u2019s daily functioning.\u00a0Issues to consider include the following [3]:\n\n* Concentration\u00a0and ability to focus\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Do thoughts about food, body, and exercise prevent concentration or impede performance at work or school?\n* Social life\u00a0\u2014 Is socializing restricted because it might require eating in a restaurant, consumption of foods that are scary or uncomfortable, or disruption of exercise routine?\n* Coping skills \u2014 Is food consumption and/or restriction used as a way to manage life\u2019s problems or cope with stressors?\n* Discomfort or anxiety \u2014 How much discomfort do thoughts of food and body cause?\u00a0Are these thoughts hard to shake and anxiety-provoking?\n\nIn treatment, I remember visualizing my eating disorder as a dark, beautiful angel. It was my best friend, my only friend. It understood me and provided comfort, **but only when I complied with the rules**. Eds are similar to abusive relationships - they hurt you but you love them\u2026 I guess I\u2019m writing this paragraph to show that EDs in clinical representation are not solely about food and body; Eds became a strong and prevalent coping-strategy (you can almost parallel it to addiction - addicts know that what they do is wrong, would lead to destroyed relationships, financial problems and possible death, but the high is sooo good that they can\u2019t resist it).\n\nThank you for taking time to read this post. I hope it was informative. \n\n*P.S.1 If you recognize the eating disorder patterns in yourself, if you consider them abnormal or unhealthy, then you are in a good shape!  From my own experience (and from talking to multiple people while inpatient/outpatient) people with full-blown EDs usually refuse to accept that they have a problem: they assume their eating/exercise patterns are normal, their weight doesn\u2019t have a bottomline, they attribute multiple skin, hair, menstruation problems to lack of vitamins or poor genetics.\nSo if you notice the problem and feel the desire to change, you have already accomplished a great milestone. Congratulations!*\n\n*P.S.2 Finally, if you are reading this and if you are concerned for your loved one, it is possible that they don\u2019t \u201csee\u201d what you \u201csee\u201d. People with full-blown Eds prior to treatment would have a hard time admitting to having a problem and this is the stage where your help is crucial.* \n\n*References*\n[1] https://www.eatingdisorderhope.com/blog/eating-disorders-disordered-eating \n[2] https://heartofleadership.org/statistics/\n[3] https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/contemporary-psychoanalysis-in-action/201402/disordered-eating-or-eating-disorder-what-s-the",

In any way. As someone who has been in and out of treatment for most of their life, this is an incredibly complex illness. I spend every day wishing for death, tearing myself to shreds, vomiting and fasting, shaking and dizzy.

This post is certainly one that comes from a very good place and has no intentions of nullifying anyone's ED or disordered eating pattern.

There has to be a reason as to why we are getting so many requests about this. What I have been told regularly is that some people do not have the ability to seek help.

The lack of moderation is something we have to speak about internally. \n\nHow we will move forward, I don't know. I am however open for ANYONE to openly DM me how to improve things or share their experiences. I really want this sub to be a safe, informative place with a clear purpose.

      "body": "I've been struggling a lot with the extreme uptick in \"do I have an ED?\" posts here in the sub.  This may be an unfair assumption to make, but I suspect that many of the posters are completely aware that something is wrong with their eating/exercise patterns but are just seeking validation.  As a general rule, needing reassurance isn't a bad thing, but I think that with EDs it can get really tricky.  These disorders get really competitive and can often feed off of other people's concern/attention, so I feel like responding to these types of posts can just fuel that person's ED.  Again, I know this is a generalization, but it's just hard for me to imagine that someone typing \"I skip x number of meals every day and purge x days a week and use x other extreme behavior\" is *truly* in the dark about something being wrong.  I know that denial is a thing (I've struggled with it myself) and that information about EDs isn't widely taught, but it just seems like someone could use google and find resources about warning signs.  Going into a lot of details on a page like this doesn't feel necessary to me, and I think that even without numbers it can fuel a lot of comparison or an unhealthy need for validation.\n\nAnd I think the other piece is that, at least for me, being inundated with these posts gets mentally exhausting.  I am not a professional and most of the posters here aren't either, but I think there's an expectation that we take the role of a professional when being asked to judge someone's behavior patterns.  It's hard to describe, but I feel like there's this pressure put on me that just feels uncomfortable.  And it's hard to know how to respond to the posts.  If I say that it sounds like the person does have an ED, am I just feeding into the disorder they already know they have?  Or what if I'm wrong and I'm setting them up to feel invalidated later?  Or what if I don't think they have an ED--how do I say that gently and not trigger them?  And really, how can I truly tell if someone has an ED or it's just disordered eating, without knowing the extent to which the thoughts take up their headspace and the behaviors take over their day to day lives?  It can get really complicated really quickly regardless of whether the person presents as having an ED or not. I try not to respond to those posts anymore and just skip reading them when I can, but that underlying discomfort surrounding the whole thing somehow stays there.\n\nI guess it just feels like a lot of people are using this sub as a diagnostic tool of sorts.  I know that the intent of the sub was to be a place for people with EDs to get support about common struggles, like how to respond to triggering family members. But lately it's just felt like it's mostly turned into a place where people come in to ask those with EDs to make a judgment about whether their behaviors \"count,\" which isn't something we really have the capacity to do.",

That's not stopping me.

Health, life, love  - everything was horrifying and dull anyway, and I just wanted to know, for once in my life, what it was like to be thin.

          "body": "I've been struggling a lot with the extreme uptick in \"do I have an ED?\" posts here in the sub.  This may be an unfair assumption to make, but I suspect that many of the posters are completely aware that something is wrong with their eating/exercise patterns but are just seeking validation.  As a general rule, needing reassurance isn't a bad thing, but I think that with EDs it can get really tricky.  These disorders get really competitive and can often feed off of other people's concern/attention, so I feel like responding to these types of posts can just fuel that person's ED.  Again, I know this is a generalization, but it's just hard for me to imagine that someone typing \"I skip x number of meals every day and purge x days a week and use x other extreme behavior\" is *truly* in the dark about something being wrong.  I know that denial is a thing (I've struggled with it myself) and that information about EDs isn't widely taught, but it just seems like someone could use google and find resources about warning signs.  Going into a lot of details on a page like this doesn't feel necessary to me, and I think that even without numbers it can fuel a lot of comparison or an unhealthy need for validation.\n\nAnd I think the other piece is that, at least for me, being inundated with these posts gets mentally exhausting.  I am not a professional and most of the posters here aren't either, but I think there's an expectation that we take the role of a professional when being asked to judge someone's behavior patterns.  It's hard to describe, but I feel like there's this pressure put on me that just feels uncomfortable.  And it's hard to know how to respond to the posts.  If I say that it sounds like the person does have an ED, am I just feeding into the disorder they already know they have?  Or what if I'm wrong and I'm setting them up to feel invalidated later?  Or what if I don't think they have an ED--how do I say that gently and not trigger them?  And really, how can I truly tell if someone has an ED or it's just disordered eating, without knowing the extent to which the thoughts take up their headspace and the behaviors take over their day to day lives?  It can get really complicated really quickly regardless of whether the person presents as having an ED or not. I try not to respond to those posts anymore and just skip reading them when I can, but that underlying discomfort surrounding the whole thing somehow stays there.\n\nI guess it just feels like a lot of people are using this sub as a diagnostic tool of sorts.  I know that the intent of the sub was to be a place for people with EDs to get support about common struggles, like how to respond to triggering family members. But lately it's just felt like it's mostly turned into a place where people come in to ask those with EDs to make a judgment about whether their behaviors \"count,\" which isn't something we really have the capacity to do.",

          "body": "Hello, guys, I am one of the mods that approves requests and handles the subreddit. I will be speaking from my own point of view and not of all mods when I refer to myself.\n\nA post like this has been long overdue. The thing is that while this post is extremely well written and informative it could also push the idea that those who post \"Do I have an ED\" most likely don't have an eating disorder but a disordered eating pattern. The problem is that we don't know and that none of us can confirm if you have an eating disorder. This post is certainly one that comes from a very good place and has no intentions of nullifying anyone's ED or disordered eating pattern. But if we were to deflect all requests from people who haven't been diagnosed then this sub would have way less participants. Less participants means less answers, less support, etc ...\n\nRequests like \"Do I have an ED\" happen a lot. I'd say about 60% of all requests are questions if they could have their post because they are concerned they might be developing an eating disorder or that they suspect they have an eating disorder and are seeking validation of some kind.  A common thought with anyone who struggles with any disorder is:  *Am I hurting bad enough to seek help? Am I \"sick enough\"*. This is one of the reasons as to why we allow these posts to come through. We never know which post might \"save a life\".\n\nThe majority of the time I reply with the same kind of response - I even have a prefab reply that I copy and paste for those posts - and while that blocks a whole bunch of the requests I can't help but think... There has to be a reason as to why we are getting so many requests about this. What I have been told regularly is that some people do not have the ability to seek help. Regardless of money, some requests talk about the OP not being able to speak to their doctor or legal guardians about this. Others seek help for beloved ones. \n\n\nWe, the mods, know that allowing these posts wont fix anyone's (possible) ED. None of us, mods or readers, can actually help diagnose an eating disorder. Even if some of us were licensed professionals. \n\nThat being said, I think this post definitely brings up a great point. The original intent of this sub was for people to have questions about eating disorders like:\n\n* How to deal with the common struggles about eating disorders\n\n* How to deal with certain situations. (Public eating, how to tell someone you trust about your struggles)\n\n* How to seek help\n\n* etc...\n\nThe sub has changed from mostly asking questions about eating disorders to people mainly venting and people who seek validation. This is due to lack of moderation on certain aspects and the fact that we've grown a whole lot. The lack of moderation is something we have to speak about internally. \n\nHow we will move forward, I don't know. I am however open for ANYONE to openly DM me how to improve things or share their experiences. I really want this sub to be a safe, informative place with a clear purpose. Cause now it is somewhat all over the place.\n\nI am also available on our Discord server.

It never ends well for those who are predisposed to having an ED, which is why I think they need to remain as separate entities.",

I will be speaking from my own point of view and not of all mods when I refer to myself.\n\nA post like this has been long overdue. The thing is that while this post is extremely well written and informative it could also push the idea that those who post \"Do I have an ED\" most likely don't have an eating disorder but a disordered eating pattern. The problem is that we don't know and that none of us can confirm if you have an eating disorder. This post is certainly one that comes from a very good place and has no intentions of nullifying anyone's ED or disordered eating pattern. But if we were to deflect all requests from people who haven't been diagnosed then this sub would have way less participants. Less participants means less answers, less support, etc ...\n\nRequests like \"Do I have an ED\" happen a lot. I'd say about 60% of all requests are questions if they could have their post because they are concerned they might be developing an eating disorder or that they suspect they have an eating disorder and are seeking validation of some kind.  A common thought with anyone who struggles with any disorder is:  *Am I hurting bad enough to seek help? Am I \"sick enough\"*. This is one of the reasons as to why we allow these posts to come through. We never know which post might \"save a life\".\n\nThe majority of the time I reply with the same kind of response - I even have a prefab reply that I copy and paste for those posts - and while that blocks a whole bunch of the requests I can't help but think... There has to be a reason as to why we are getting so many requests about this. What I have been told regularly is that some people do not have the ability to seek help. Regardless of money, some requests talk about the OP not being able to speak to their doctor or legal guardians about this. Others seek help for beloved ones. \n\n\nWe, the mods, know that allowing these posts wont fix anyone's (possible) ED. None of us, mods or readers, can actually help diagnose an eating disorder. Even if some of us were licensed professionals. \n\nThat being said, I think this post definitely brings up a great point. The original intent of this sub was for people to have questions about eating disorders like:\n\n* How to deal with the common struggles about eating disorders\n\n* How to deal with certain situations. (Public eating, how to tell someone you trust about your struggles)\n\n* How to seek help\n\n* etc...\n\nThe sub has changed from mostly asking questions about eating disorders to people mainly venting and people who seek validation. This is due to lack of moderation on certain aspects and the fact that we've grown a whole lot. The lack of moderation is something we have to speak about internally. \n\nHow we will move forward, I don't know. I am however open for ANYONE to openly DM me how to improve things or share their experiences. I really want this sub to be a safe, informative place with a clear purpose. Cause now it is somewhat all over the place.\n\nI am also available on our Discord server.

          "body": "I've been struggling a lot with the extreme uptick in \"do I have an ED?\" posts here in the sub.  This may be an unfair assumption to make, but I suspect that many of the posters are completely aware that something is wrong with their eating/exercise patterns but are just seeking validation.  As a general rule, needing reassurance isn't a bad thing, but I think that with EDs it can get really tricky.  These disorders get really competitive and can often feed off of other people's concern/attention, so I feel like responding to these types of posts can just fuel that person's ED.  Again, I know this is a generalization, but it's just hard for me to imagine that someone typing \"I skip x number of meals every day and purge x days a week and use x other extreme behavior\" is *truly* in the dark about something being wrong.  I know that denial is a thing (I've struggled with it myself) and that information about EDs isn't widely taught, but it just seems like someone could use google and find resources about warning signs.  Going into a lot of details on a page like this doesn't feel necessary to me, and I think that even without numbers it can fuel a lot of comparison or an unhealthy need for validation.\n\nAnd I think the other piece is that, at least for me, being inundated with these posts gets mentally exhausting.  I am not a professional and most of the posters here aren't either, but I think there's an expectation that we take the role of a professional when being asked to judge someone's behavior patterns.  It's hard to describe, but I feel like there's this pressure put on me that just feels uncomfortable.  And it's hard to know how to respond to the posts.  If I say that it sounds like the person does have an ED, am I just feeding into the disorder they already know they have?  Or what if I'm wrong and I'm setting them up to feel invalidated later?  Or what if I don't think they have an ED--how do I say that gently and not trigger them?  And really, how can I truly tell if someone has an ED or it's just disordered eating, without knowing the extent to which the thoughts take up their headspace and the behaviors take over their day to day lives?  It can get really complicated really quickly regardless of whether the person presents as having an ED or not. I try not to respond to those posts anymore and just skip reading them when I can, but that underlying discomfort surrounding the whole thing somehow stays there.\n\nI guess it just feels like a lot of people are using this sub as a diagnostic tool of sorts.  I know that the intent of the sub was to be a place for people with EDs to get support about common struggles, like how to respond to triggering family members. But lately it's just felt like it's mostly turned into a place where people come in to ask those with EDs to make a judgment about whether their behaviors \"count,\" which isn't something we really have the capacity to do.",
