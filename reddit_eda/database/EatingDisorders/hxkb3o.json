  "selftext": "So, I posted on here about being ashamed of eating and I got a lot of positive feedback. \n\nTruth is I'd been dealing with eating disorders and stuff since I was a teenager.\n\nI opened up to my psychologist who is a really good person (he's the same person that diagnosed me with autism) and he told me I'm dealing with anorexia and body dysmorphia.\n\nWe've been talking a lot about my trauma and family abuse, so when I opened up about this he wasn't surprised.\n\nBut he did tell me I needed to take care of myself because anorexia could potentially be fatal. I told him I'd make sure I was okay.\n\nObviously, this is only the first step. I'm going to get more help for my anorexic behavior. I just wanted to let you all know I took that first step.",

I also have struggled with self love and self acceptance due to some pretty nasty abuse I suffered as a kid. Everyone has their demons. Everyone has a battle. This is just ours.",
