  "selftext": "I\u2019m 21 and my mom would\u2019ve been 49 but she passed away 2 years ago. \n\nMy mom\u2019s passing was unrelated to her ed, I was just thinking about it and wanted to get it off my chest. When she was much younger she struggled with bulimia and I didn\u2019t know how bad her fight with this was until I was about 16. She posted a blog about how she would throw up multiple times a day and that she would take boxes and boxes of laxatives. When I found this out it just totally broke my heart that she struggled with that at one point in her life. I remember as a kid occasionally I would hear my mom throw up in the bathroom, and it didn\u2019t happen a lot, but I still remember those moments and now realizing why she was doing that is mind blowing to me. \n\nAnyways, fast forward to a few months before she passed away. I was walking by her bathroom and we had just eaten together and I had to do a double take. I could hear her throwing up in the bathroom and I was shocked. I had no idea she began struggling with this again. After she got out of the bathroom I asked her about it and she said that she just gets nauseous because she was taking anti-depressants and that\u2019s the only reason she was doing that, but I didn\u2019t buy it. My brother and I tried to help her feel like she didn\u2019t need to do that, but I don\u2019t think we made any sort of impact on her whatsoever. Anyways, it just hurts me to know that I was unable to help my mom, and I think about it a lot, and everything that she went through.",
