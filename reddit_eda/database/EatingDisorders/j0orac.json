  "selftext": "I\u2019m currently recovering for atypical anorexia, which if i understood it right is anorexia + self-induced vomiting? Idk, the point is that I\u2019m in recovery and I just feel like giving up. I\u2019ve gained about a little weight and I need to gain a little more and it sucks. I feel like my whole body have gained a lot, and my face even more. I\u2019ve been in a relationship ish with this girl for about 8 months and I am totally in love with her. There\u2019s a problem and that is that I am very very very afraid what she\u2019ll think when see will see me having gained weight, mostly afraid of her losing her feelings for me. Right now it\u2019s already too much - I\u2019m really scared of her seeing me - and we haven\u2019t seen each other because of lockdown. I\u2019m pretty f\u2019in sure that we\u2019ll hangout really soon. I know this probably isn\u2019t the place to vent those kind of problems but I don\u2019t really have a lot of friends and I feel like I\u2019m pathetic for worrying over that kind of stuff. Ok s\\*\\*\\* ya\u2019ll I\u2019ll stop talking now. (Thanks if you\u2019ve used your precious time to read this idek)",
