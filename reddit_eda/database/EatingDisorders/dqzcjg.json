I was succesful at losing 30 pounds quickly, however once it came to the last 10 pounds I could no longer control myself. I was eating less than what I had originally calculated. Somewhere aroubd 1200 calories a day. I would all of a sudden binge eat, then to try and compensate, I would fast for 24+ hours. Then right after the fast I would binge eat again. One thing led to another and soon I regained all of the weight back within a couple of months. Now anything I put into my mouth is calculated. I analyze the macros in every single food I eat now. Even when there is no label on the food like at a restaurant, I will still calculate in my head how much I am eating. I can no longer enjoy any type of treat like a cookie or icecream without feeling the need to fast for the next 12 hours. Every time I try to compensate through fasting or restriction, I almost always end up failing and ending up eating even more. I wish I never calcualted my food in the first place.",

(I've gotten more anxious about health things that I weren't worried about before which feels a bit ironic since I'm trying to heal myself from that.)\n\nI don't trust myself enough at the moment to stop counting, but I guess it would be good if I could try to eat more intuitively soon since it was what I did before developing orthorexia.",

If you think you didn't eat enough today, eat more. That's it, you don't need an app to tell you that. Easier said than done of course but I think it's true that counting is more on he disordered side than the helpful side.",
