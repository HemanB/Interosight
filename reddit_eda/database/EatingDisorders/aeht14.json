  "title": "Request: Coping With Rude Comments On Weight Gain",
  "selftext": "I\u2019ve been struggling with ED since I was 15. I\u2019m 32 and it is a lot better now with tremendous support from my partner but yesterday one of my students told me \u201cWow! You\u2019ve gotten fat!!!\u201d. She did it in front of other people, loudly. I had been really sick for 1,5 months, this was my first day at work and she really caught me off guard. I think people here will understand the effect of such words: this phrase triggered me very similarly to that first meltdown when I was a teenager and I had a very painful flashback yesterday. Now I am swinging back and forth between hating myself and wanting to hurt her in a similar way. Neither is healthy, of course. \n\nHow do you cope with such rudeness? How do you help yourself after something like that? Thank you!\n\n",

It would be inappropriate to humiliate and insult her back, however- though I would discourage it in general. You're correct in that it's not healthy. If she was an older student (at an age that should absolutely know better), you could maybe have a mature conversation with her, or simply avoid her to the best of your ability. Perhaps another teacher or administrator could speak to her about her behavior. I imagine if she said it to you, she's said it to other students too- let them catch her in the moment.\n\nAs another commenter said, how much it gets to you is up to you. We can't always help how we feel- *initially*. But sometimes we do have to take control of how we process those feelings. You've been sick, and now your better. Remind yourself that health is a process, and it's not determined only by a mirror or a number on the scale. Take a few minutes each day to reflect on how far you've come from your lowest point. One comment or setback shouldn't be enough to undo all of that, so don't let it. You're so much stronger than that. Take things just one day at a time, and focus strongly on your progress- forget your weight, just focus on all of your health- emotional, mental, and physical. Your body is amazing already for overcoming years of disordered eating and a 1.5 month-long illness. Now it's time to recuperate. Her comment doesn't matter because you are still recovering and rebuilding, and with a bit of time and care, you will be okay. You're at day one of it, and you have a little ways to go, but you can get there. \n\nI want to also add that if you are not in therapy, go see a professional. If you are, tell her about this experience and how you've been feeling. If nothing else, venting to a professional will help you process it more easily. Health is a process, and ED recovery is an even longer one. A professional will help you cope with obstacles like these in a much healthier way so that all the progress you've made so far isn't set back. ",
