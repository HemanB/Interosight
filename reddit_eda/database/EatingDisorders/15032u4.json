And every time i tell her to eat she just says it\u2019s okay and she refuses to talk about it. I don\u2019t wanna push her or anything but 3 days is not okay. And I don\u2019t know what to do. We don\u2019t live together so it\u2019s not like i can make sure she eats. And i feel like whenever i tell her to eat she gets annoyed and distance herself from me. I\u2019m begging her to eat at this point. Please help me I don\u2019t know what to do.",

Don't talk about eating, don't ask her if she want to eat, nothing like that. \n\nInstead, do something that you both often do and that bring joy to both of you, and that you usually both do while eating. It can be going outside, watching a movie, talking in the kitchen, etc... Spend time together doing something that comfort you both, and just happen to have food near you, and eat a bit if you want to (even better if it's something that she love AND that is light and easy to eat). But never talk about the food. By creating a bubble of comfort for her, she might unconsciously take few bites of food. And even if she does, don't mention it, she might get nervous and regret it. \n\nIt's not 100% guarantee that it works, every ED case is unique, but it's how my friend helped many of her friends, including me, to eat. She always made sure that if we were having a conversation, it was in the living room or in the kitchen, and that there was a bowl of fruits near us, or a plate of pancakes (she always makes pancakes). And when you are caught in a conversation that you enjoy, simply watching my friend sometimes take few bites of food made me eat aswell, even tho I was in a moment where the thought of food would make me nauseous. \n\nYou don't lose anything by trying, and I hope it will work. I know it can be scary, I know how it is to feel powerless in this situation, I've been on both sides of it. And because of that, I can guarantee you that caring for her and being there when she need you already matter a lot. You will feel frustrated everytime you will face the fact that she's the only one who can save herself, but that doesn't mean that you are useless in this process. Be there for her, listen to her, comfort her when she need it, and do not hesitate to seek help when you need some, like with this post. Even if it doesn't always feel like it's enough, it matter a lot. I hope things will get better for her soon, I hope she's able to receive the psychiatric help she need, and never hesitate to post again here, or contact professionals, any small action matter",

          "body": "I was in a similar position in my last relationship and even now as we remain friends I struggle with this very issue, I don't want to betray her trust or push her to do anything but it doesn't sit right to me to let it happen either, it's a tough spot to be in but I believe the best advice that I can offer is to simply be there for her, I've noticed in my case in particular that when she is in a good mood she seems to want to eat more, she is never hungry and has no interest in most food, but when she is happy she seems to think about it less and sometimes will eat at least something. In other words I've found that the best way in my case has been to distract her and not even mention the food at all. This obviously does not always work and I'm also open to any advice that's recieved on this thread because I often do worry for her safety and just want her to be happy without feeling like I'm pushing her away. I hope that this helped even in the slightest and again I'm open to any other advice anyone has as I am very much not an expert on these situations. Thank you.",

But as I said everyone is different. But if this could help you a little. As someone with ed I would like from close friends to not point out my ed a lot, I would also like to be encouraged and distracted from my ed. and talking about it sometimes helps. Overall i think that you are a really good friend and remember to take care of yourself too. Thank you again.",

          "body": "I'll base my advice on my own experience as someone with ED, and with tips a friend used to help another friend and I to eat. \n\nSpend time with your girlfriend face to face and don't talk about food. Don't talk about eating, don't ask her if she want to eat, nothing like that. \n\nInstead, do something that you both often do and that bring joy to both of you, and that you usually both do while eating. It can be going outside, watching a movie, talking in the kitchen, etc... Spend time together doing something that comfort you both, and just happen to have food near you, and eat a bit if you want to (even better if it's something that she love AND that is light and easy to eat). But never talk about the food. By creating a bubble of comfort for her, she might unconsciously take few bites of food. And even if she does, don't mention it, she might get nervous and regret it. \n\nIt's not 100% guarantee that it works, every ED case is unique, but it's how my friend helped many of her friends, including me, to eat. She always made sure that if we were having a conversation, it was in the living room or in the kitchen, and that there was a bowl of fruits near us, or a plate of pancakes (she always makes pancakes). And when you are caught in a conversation that you enjoy, simply watching my friend sometimes take few bites of food made me eat aswell, even tho I was in a moment where the thought of food would make me nauseous. \n\nYou don't lose anything by trying, and I hope it will work. I know it can be scary, I know how it is to feel powerless in this situation, I've been on both sides of it. And because of that, I can guarantee you that caring for her and being there when she need you already matter a lot. You will feel frustrated everytime you will face the fact that she's the only one who can save herself, but that doesn't mean that you are useless in this process. Be there for her, listen to her, comfort her when she need it, and do not hesitate to seek help when you need some, like with this post. Even if it doesn't always feel like it's enough, it matter a lot. I hope things will get better for her soon, I hope she's able to receive the psychiatric help she need, and never hesitate to post again here, or contact professionals, any small action matter",
