I would restrict and then binge, and also obsess over my body and over-exercise. It was all for control. It was my solution to life. Fast forward to today... thank goodness that solution I used is no longer how I handle life. I found a new way to handle life's problems and challenges, and it was the only thing that worked to help me stop this behavior. I would be happy to share more with you anytime, or my experience.
