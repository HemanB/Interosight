  "title": "Girlfriend's eating disorder ",
  "selftext": "My girlfriend has struggled with disordered eating for many years. When she was a teenager she starved herself and her family made her regain the weight back because she had become extremely thin, didn't have her period etc. This obviously did not make her eating disorder go away, and she has continued to restrict her eating and thinks about food in a very unhealthy way + she thinks she is overweight despite not being. Over the past few months she has told me she has started to throw up her food after eating, probably because she is now back with her parents over the summer and has to eat at mealtimes. \n\nI have no idea how to support her and I'm really scared for her. This is beyond my control and I know I can't prevent it but I want to know how I can support her. Any advice would be so much appreciated.",

The best way to support her is to encourage her to seek professional help, like a therapist who specializes in eating disorders. You can gently suggest that she talk to someone who can provide the right guidance and support.\n\nBe there for her emotionally by listening without judgment and letting her know you care. Avoid focusing on food or body image, and instead offer reassurance and understanding. It\u2019s also important to take care of your own well-being; supporting someone through this can be challenging, so consider seeking support for yourself as well.",

Trust me ANY kind of ED is horrible, it's like a time loop you cannot get yourself out of.\n\nYour girlfriend is sadly in quite serious state, and I bet she wouldn't recover easily sadly, would she want it? YES. BUT can she? That's hard to answer.  U need to understand that it's not \"her fault\" from the objective meaning, it's really mental disorder you need to cure, it can take YEARS to recover or at least get better in my experience.\n\nYou can of course seek professional help BUT i think the treatment or anything of this kind needs to be personalized and general medical care can be sadly not enough. I don't know where you live but some treatments can be expensive, or not if your insurance covers it. Or get some psychologist that HAD some experience with that. BUT NEVER put value onto that stuff, you can save live with that. \n\nHaving ED is like living in hell everyday, I'm grateful that you care and want to help her, I wish you both the best.",

But if it's not ideal and not supporting enough just stop the treatment, because i know of few cases that got even worse with bad counselor/therapist so just try anything, what matters is the outcome and life you will live. \n\nAlso in UK it's definitely gonna be better or cheaper than US, so pretty good, and I bet if some free therapists weren't good or suitable insurance could cover something nice. \n\nAlso don't be scared to change therapists if they're not suitable, it's like shoe, find one that fits best.",

          "body": "Hey OP - this sounds like she will need professional help from your description. No one can force her to recover and she may not realize how sick she is. The best way to support is to just be there for her when it\u2019s super tough and carefully/thoughtfully nudge her toward getting the help she needs little by little. Planting loving seeds. No ultimatums or criticisms over something she has no current skills to control at the moment - just loving little seeds. One day she may decide she just can\u2019t live like this anymore (as many people with ED do) and choose to accept professional help - because you\u2019ll have planted seeds that getting help is what she needs and deserves. Again, when she is in the thick of it, she really truly may not realize how sick she is until she decides to get help one day. It could take some time so please be patient and kind to yourself - there\u2019s only so much you can do or that she can do without the skills you both need to manage it. Good luck, I\u2019ll be thinking of you! You\u2019re doing great and she will have you by her side when the time is right to kick ass.",
