  "title": "Request: My family is constantly pointing out my flaws despite my bulimia.",
  "selftext": "I've had bulimia for 5 years. Recently, I finally got the courage to ask for help and now I'm seeing a specialist for my disorder. My family knows how severe my bulimia is/was. But last week on Thanksgiving, it felt like everyone had a right to say something about my choice of food or my weight. My father kept asking \"Did you stop working out? You're looking a little unfit. You should start a routine again.\" My sister said, \"Oh look at that, you're not thin anymore; you have boobs again!\" My mom said \"Are you sure you want sweet potato casserole? You don't need that much sugar.\" And finally, we were looking at old family photos and in one, it was me from two years ago, when I was very deep into my bulimia and exercise addiction. and my sister-in-law said, \"Wow you were so thin and fit. You hardly look like the same person.\" Comment after comment, I just smiled, but was absolutely distraught on the inside.At the end of the night, I purged all my thanksgiving dinner, cried, got drunk, and cried some more. It wasn't only on thanksgiving though, this happen every other day in my home. I feel like I won't get better with no support from my family. I do not understand why they are so insensitive. or is it just me?\n\nCan anyone offer advice on how to deal with this?\n",

I don\u2019t care how \u201ctough\u201d or other society-enforced BS were told to be, when you suffer from an illness like this comments can and will slow down the recovery process. \n\nI remember when I did 6 weeks for Anorexia recovery in 2013, I came back to school for the last day. My principal told me I \u201cdidn\u2019t look anorexic\u201d and jokingly asked if I faked the disorder.

And even the little things add up. But these aren't little things, what you described was an onslaught.\n\nYou need to communicate to them how hurtful it is. I know that might be really difficult. People don't say things for nothing -- maybe they're projecting their own insecurities, or something else, but they have their own (selfish) reasons for saying those kinds of things to you. Or they're completely unaware, potentially. Which is why they might not want to hear that they shouldn't say them. I'm not sure how you can make it clear how much it hurts and wears you down, but you have to try. You could start by writing out your feelings about it, getting them straight and clear. Don't make it about them directly, make it about how you feel as a result. If you sound accusatory they'll shut down.\n\nHey and good luck and I hope it gets better, I really do. You're being so amazingly strong.",

      "body": "I feel like eating disorders just aren't taken as seriously as other disorders. My family has a lot of history of depression, gambling addiction, alcoholism to even as far as heroin addiction. It's part of the reason why I haven't told them about my food addiction. After 2 years of recovery from this I'm still almost always overly obsessed with food. Every bite I take I still worry about the calorycontent. I went from being severely underweight to overweight so quickly I can just feel the judgmental stares from everyone. All I can say is don't let it slow you down. Write down how you feel now as opposed to how you felt back then. Say to yourself that you have made real progress and that you're taking steps in the right direction. Those people just aren't aware how difficult it is to overcome this.",

      "body": "Wow, how insensitive. I don't know how old you are, but if you are old enough and able, you need to remove yourself from them. That's what I had to do with my family. I had struggled with anorexia since puberty and my family \"noticed\" (finally) how thin I was and how I avoided eating around 16 I believe. However, they still continued to comment on whatever they did see me eating. And my brother and uncles would constantly try to poke and pinch at me and say \"Oh I do see some meat there, okay, you are filling in!\" even though I was steadily losing weight (and they KNEW it)! They never took it seriously and I seriously hated them for it. As soon as I could, I left home for college. I have never been back. \nSome people in my family have (finally) openly asked me and/or my mom about what the falling out was about and I think most of the rest just assume it was about the weight and I think the rest honestly don't care. I have reconciled and come to peace with the fact they honestly don't care about me. There are so many times over the years that I have gotten so sick and could have died and they never knew and never cared enough to step in or DO anything. They just watched silently as I dropped down lower and lower. Then they have the nerve to ask me why I don't come home. I am honestly trying to live a normal life and I wouldn't risk being triggered by them again. I think the best revenge in these cases is to just leave and cut them off. Only then will they realize how awful they are. ",

I mean, any reasonable person should know commenting on the appearance or weight of someone with an ED is not cool, but (playing devils advocate a little) is it possible they\u2019re scared for you and treating you differently would make it more real for them?\nThat is no excuse and I\u2019m angry for you but is that worth confronting them about?",
