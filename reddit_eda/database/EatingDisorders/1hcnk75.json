  "selftext": "This year I\u2019ve suffered a relapse (starting around July) and my eating disorder is now the worst it\u2019s been since 2019. My boyfriend  (M28) and I (F26) met and got together in 2021, so while he\u2019s been with me through my eating disorder and has been aware of it right from the start, he\u2019s never seen it as bad as it is right now. Obviously it\u2019s hard on him for a number of reasons, but the issue that\u2019s really getting to me is knowing that the more weight I lose, the less attractive I am to him. He\u2019s never used those words but he has made it clear that he wants me to gain weight. We previously had a very active sex life but in the last few months, his desire to be intimate with me has decreased significantly. (Truthfully the eating disorder has killed my own sex drive but I still crave the intimacy of being physical with him).\nI\u2018ve confronted him about it and he\u2019s said he\u2019s worried about hurting me/that I\u2019m too frail. He keeps reassuring me that he\u2019s still attracted to me but last night he said that looking at my body as it is right now \u201cbreaks his heart\u201d.  \n\nIt kills me knowing that I\u2019m hurting him so much but god, it feels like such a gut punch when on top of all my existing insecurities about my body, I now feel so ugly and rejected. Does anyone have similar experiences with a partner? How do you cope with the impact the eating disorder has on your intimacy? \n",

It sounds like your bf is worried about you and is less attracted to your increasingly disordered-looking appearance. That\u2019s a good thing in a way. You shouldn\u2019t recover *just* to be more attractive to him, but it\u2019s good for you to know that when you begin recovering again, he will be more attracted to you rather than less. He wants you to be healthy. \n\nI don\u2019t think you should learn to cope with it; I think it should be listed in the Pros column as you consider restarting recovery.",

He claims to like big ladies (came to realize this after awhile somehow even though he's never been with a big person) and used to beg me to gain weight (which I refused). Now I've lost weight and am very uw.  I am so terrified of my husband seeing how thin I really am and commenting. I try to avoid intimacy at all costs as a result. He doesn't ask for it as often which might be from not being as attracted to me.",
