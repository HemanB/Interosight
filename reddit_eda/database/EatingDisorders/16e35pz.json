  "selftext": "This morning my daughter (11) shared with me that she feels fat all the time and cried about it too. The feeling started this summer.\n\nI already noticed she eats less and less (eg. skipping snack after school). She also regularly checks on her abs at random times.\n\nI'm very concerned as she is already very athletic because of the sports she does and had very little fat.\n\nWhat are some things we as parents:\n(1) should start doing\n(2) stop doing\n\nWe will also look for a therapist with my wife asap (in Toronto if anyone has recommendations).",

When looking for a therapist please make sure they are specialized in eating disorders. Unfortunately, in Canada there is not a lot of resources for higher level of care. FBT ( family based treatment) is the only proven method for helping eating disorders in children and teens. Look into Eva Musby books and You tube videos with help to get her to eat. 3 meals and 3 snacks are the goal if she is medically stable. Unfortunately, recovery is a marathon not a sprint. Private message if you have questions. The earlier this is addressed the better. And as a bit of hope, my child is doing incredible after being hospitalized with a feeding tube and spending months in residential care over a year ago.",

      "body": "I'd argue that her telling you isn't alarming, it's a blessing.  She clearly genuinely trusts you, which can't be said for a lot of kids.  And her reaching out to you has given you important information you need to continue supporting her and nurturing that trust.\n\n\n\nHere's my actual advice:\n\nFind her a therapist that SPECIALIZES IN EATING DISORDERS.  Seriously that is so important I cannot stress that part enough.  Also be flexible to change therapists if your daughter says things aren't working.  Learn as much as you can about eating disorders from reliable sources.  Maybe have a couple group therapy sessions, not for therapy but for educational purposes.  Also, this subreddit may look like a chaotic mess, but it's a very good peek into how bad EDs can distort how we view things.  There's many posts talking about how they wish their parents did/didn't do/say xyz.  Work SO hard on changing how you talk to her.  Stop any mentions about her body (telling her she's pretty as is or is skinny or healthy will NOT help), don't comment on anyone else's body (positive or negative), don't discuss or argue about how much she's eating (or other people's eating habits), don't talk about food in general in terms of quantity or calories, and don't shame her for any strange habits you notice.  First instinct will be to try and stop bad habits as soon as possible when they appear, but that could easily lead to her hiding habits from you.\n\nYou have been given a gift.  You clearly care a lot about your daughter, so know that you have a lot of hard work ahead of you, and it will be mentally and emotionally taxing.  But she reached out and showed an immense amount of trust towards you... prove to her that the trust is well deserved.\n\n\n.\n\nI originally had these flipped, but the advice is more important than my anecdotes.  The below is my story.  It shows what a good support system looks like, and how much of a difference it can make:\n\n\nI was 23(?) when mine started, it was kinda like a switch flipped.  It sounds strange, but I could feel like a whole mental and bodily awareness shift.  As soon as I figured out what was happening to me, I reached out to the people I trusted most and told them.  That group did not include my family, and my parents still don't know I went through this.\n\nI told this group what was happening because I knew they would support me, that they wouldn't judge me, but that they would also step in and do something if things got bad.  I probably had one of the best experiences of an eating disorder in terms of support.  My friends did their best to understand, and accepted and acknowledged when they didn't understand.  They accommodated my strange eating habits, but lightly encouraged me to eat just one more bite if I could.  When I went bulimic, they didn't judge me for what is frankly a disgusting habit (we know it's gross, no need to tell us), but would hug me and say it was okay and that we would try to make tomorrow a better day.\n\nThey NEVER brought up the ED unless they saw something worrying.  They let ME initiate conversations about the disorder, which helped me feel safe and that I could share as much information as I wanted up to my comfort level.  At a certain point, I was working on separating my thoughts from the irrational eating disorder thoughts and my friends dubbed the eating disorder \"bitch brain\", so we could make fun of the thoughts as a separate entity from myself.  This was actually so helpful, but I had to be able to separate those thoughts first.  They never leapt on behaviors as being \"bitch brain\", most of the time they waited until I recognized a thought as being irrational before adding it to the \"bitch brain\" list.\n\nI was never forced into therapy or recovery, but the immense support I received was instrumental in my own decision to get help.  There was nothing but love and support and patience from my friends.  I ended up mostly recovered after about 2-2.5 years, and I'd say I'm fully recovered now 5.5 years later.  Thoughts do come back, but I can recognize them and dismiss them.",

Personally speaking my AN onset at 8 y/o and wasn\u2019t diagnosed until 12 because professionals were convinced I was too young and/or would outgrow it. I work in the field currently and each day I am reminded that I am far from the only one who suffered so young. If you can at all consider professional treatment (it isn\u2019t one I\u2019ve worked with personally or professionally but I hear phenomenal things about) I would check out Clementine. They are a Monte Nido affiliate and are fantastic with the kiddos. While a therapist or psychiatrist are an awesome start, it\u2019s possible she might benefit from a higher level of care (like a day program) with sooner intervention https://clementineprograms.com",
