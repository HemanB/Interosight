  "selftext": "I used to struggle so much with food I couldn't even fathom eating a grain of rice or a slice of bread. But now after recovering from the anorexia, finally being able to eat again and fighting the food guilt I'm stuck with being so uncontrollably hungry all the time. I'm always thinking about food, about when I'm going to eat, what I'm going to eat all day long. I can't help myself from craving bread every hour of the day. I could eat an entire loaf or package of bread or cookies if I let myself but it's like I have to fight myself to put the food back and not shove it down my throat. I can't help but think I'd rather have anorexia again but I know it's not good for me. But is this any better? All I want is a good relationship with food but it's either I'm starving or overeating theres no in between. I can't stand it because I'm so scared of gaining weight but I'm so hungry and I want food all the time. What should I do? I don't know what to do",

      "body": "Tbh, it took weeks. Anorexia causes lots of internal damage you can't see that needs a LOT of energy and nutrients to fix. I found that if you dont give into it, your body will keep fighting you.\n\nYour body needs time to trust you, too. If you were your body and ate for a bit, then reduced it again after a history of restriction, would you trust yourself?\n\nThe other thing to note is that I never became overweight at all! Maybe overshot what I was comfortable with a bit, but it came down again to a healthy weight and I've stayed there for 10 years sinc!\n\nPlease get the support of a dietician while in your recovery, too. It'll help you do it properly and healthily and also give you some assurance that everything will be OK :)",

I had it and eventually gave into it until one day it just...stopped, and it never binged again after that.\n\nSpeak to a dietician and a therapist while you are recovering and to monitor your electrolytes and nutrition.\n\nAnorexia causes a lot of internal damage, which takes extra energy and nutrients to fix. Often, you have to listen to your body here - it knows what to do.",

Make sure you stay hydrated, too, and check in with your doctor and/or dietician if you can, they might be able to help you determine what your body really needs/is missing. (For me, one thing was salt! I wasn't getting enough, which also left me dehydrated.)",
