  "selftext": "Hello, I hope all lovely people on this sub have a great day :)\n\nI have been struggling with ana since I was 12, and have defeated (haha, funny way to phrase it) it last October. I can eat what I want now without feeling anything unhealthy, and am better than ever - physically, mentally, emotionally. I made this post because when I was deep in my mental illnesses I didn't know who to talk to, I felt so alone and isolated, didn't know who I was anymore and my whole existence seemed to revolve this part of my mental state. Also, I think the anonymity here on the world wide web might just be the thing to help other people open up and ask questions they've been too scared to ask. \n\nI won't give away my highest / lowest weight, as that is triggering. I also reserve the right to not answer questions I don't want to answer, so please don't be offended if your question is unanswered.\n\nHave a wonderful day, stay yourself \ud83c\udf4e\ud83e\uded2",

There are two aspects to this, you and the frustration, and you and your environment. About you, I'd suggest to be kind. Once you're forgiving to yourself, you'll grow to be more kind to others as well. You are affected by an illness, and it takes time to fight it! Be proud of every step. About you and your environment, there is only one solution I fear - to overcome this. I'm not familiar with EDNOS, but at least with me the only way I found to become a better person was to recover.

I was completely alone in my eating disorder for a long time, no one knew about it, and the illness kept telling me I was not enough in everything I tried. It isolates you om purpose to keep you dependant on it. I understood I had to recover when I reached my goal weight and saw... I couldn't let myself eat. Even then, at the 'finish line', it wasn't enough. I understood it was either recovering or wasting away - I chose living.\n\n>Also did you have trouble accepting that you had an ED?\n\nNot really, I knew what I was doing to myself, I more so had trouble admitting to my friends and family - but what saved me was a conversation with a friend.

She wasn't angry, or shocked, she actually figured it out a few weeks before, and she told me what I was doing is bad for me. Not letting me stay in a puddle of self pity was so good for me, as she put me in front of reality. I remember she told me \"it's either recovering or dying\", and that really stuck with me... She also suggested making a list - one of all the things the illness took from me (being able to enjoy holidays, a working body, happiness, ect), and one of all it gave me (constant fatigue, a snappy and aggressive personality, ect). I would go so far to say that list saved me, as it put me face to face with my situation. Overall, being supportive but not letting your loved one wallow in their sadness is what really kept me going.\n\n>Did you have relapses, and were you able to talk to your friends and family about relapse?\n\nI'll be honest with you, yes. Last month I purged once, a moment of weakness, but I kept going. I didn't let that one moment define my life again, because that's what happened when I was ill - one meal, one snack, defined the next few days, and that's not realistic. Sometimes, people relapse. That's normal, to an extent. I spoke to my friends and my teacher about relapses, my teacher  specifically was really supportive and helpful. He made sure I felt safe enough to talk to him without judgment, but he still held me accountable to my actions.\n\n>Do you have any advice for friends and family to help their loved ones through recovery?\n\nBe kind, and patient. It's a long process. Most of all, I'd make sure my loved one understands that recovery is the only way to live. Point blank, it's either that or wasting away. It's a tough process with up and downs, and I know I wouldn't be able to do it without my friends and family :) I am guessing you are a loved one, so I'll say you are very important to the person who's close to you. I'm sure they appreciate you.",

Does the body hatred ever let up as you get further into recovery? \n\nOf course I dealt with that! I think every person recovering has. Honestly it was very tough, after such a long time of equating my body and weight to my worth, seeing, feeling, and knowing my body is changing was hard.. I remember a few weeks after I started eating I noticed something on my body and completely freaked out, but eventually calmed down. I remind myself everytime I look in the mirror this body, my healthy body, is what allows me to be happy. To be with my friends. I won't let myself waste away for a few kilograms, I was miserable. It's a fake it till you make it situation, at first you hate everything and want to give up, but slowly you come to understand A. This is worth it. Living is worth it. B. You *are* happier recovered C. You look better. I know some people don't like to talk about looks here, but I like my appearance much more now than when I was ill, because I can actually see my body, and not a morphed, dysphoric version of it. I like myself! Thighs and all.\n\n>how did you know when you were at the \u201cright\u201d weight for you/when it was okay to stop eating mechanically and start eating more intuitively?\n\nPersonally I don't think there is a right weight to eat intuitively. I like to think about it like holding your breath for a really long time, then taking big breaths to stabilize yourself eventually. After starving yourself, your body will want to prepare for the next \"famine\", so it'll require a lot of energy. That's normal! This is a period where you take 'big breaths' and eat a lot. It might feel uncomfortable and bloated at times because you don't have fullness cues yet, but that's exactly what builds those cues - trial and failure. I didn't recover in a facility so I didn't have a team, so I personally just started eating, after a month or so of eating too much everyday my body started to understand when it's hungry and when it's not. Also, after the body realizes there's no famine, it stabilzes in terms of hunger cues and starts requiring less energy.\n\nRecovery is more than possible, it's the best thing you can do for yourself :)",

I am so happy to hear you are recovering, good luck \ud83d\udc9d\ud83d\udc9d\n\nI dealt with extreme hunger too, yeah :) I got into a binge-purge cycle because I was trying to 'fight' the hunger, which wasn't healthy. The only way I found to make the extreme hunger subside was to honor it. It's hard, may leave you bloated and confused, maybe even shameful - but it's the right thing to do. I like to think of it as holding your breath for a really long time, then taking big breaths to stabilize yourself eventually. Currently, your body requires big breaths to stabilize ; it fears the next famine, and wants to put on security weight. One it understands no famine is coming, it'll put off the security weight back to your healthy one, and activate your hunger cues back :) the only way to go through this process I found successfull is to take this time to rebuild your trust with your body. My brain tells me to eat a full bar of chocolate? Well, I guess we're doing that. Don't ignore your hunger + fullness cues. Your wrote \n\n>If I eat one thing more than I had planned\n\nEating is intuitive! It's okay to eat spontaneously, that's how healthy people eat. :)\n\nAbout the bloating, it is very common on the first few months of recovery as your stomach and metabolism have gotten smaller, so now everything you eat takes a bigger toll on your body. Once your stomach and metabolism 'wake up', the bloating will get better. It's also normal to get bloated, I get bloated after dinner most days because it's the end of the day and I'm after 3 meals - that's normal.\n\nThe illness is about control. It controls every aspect of your life. To let go of the illness, you need to let go some of that control, to eat what you feel is right. I believe in you :)",

Does the body hatred ever let up as you get further into recovery? \n\nOf course I dealt with that! I think every person recovering has. Honestly it was very tough, after such a long time of equating my body and weight to my worth, seeing, feeling, and knowing my body is changing was hard.. I remember a few weeks after I started eating I noticed something on my body and completely freaked out, but eventually calmed down. I remind myself everytime I look in the mirror this body, my healthy body, is what allows me to be happy. To be with my friends. I won't let myself waste away for a few kilograms, I was miserable. It's a fake it till you make it situation, at first you hate everything and want to give up, but slowly you come to understand A. This is worth it. Living is worth it. B. You *are* happier recovered C. You look better. I know some people don't like to talk about looks here, but I like my appearance much more now than when I was ill, because I can actually see my body, and not a morphed, dysphoric version of it. I like myself! Thighs and all.\n\n>how did you know when you were at the \u201cright\u201d weight for you/when it was okay to stop eating mechanically and start eating more intuitively?\n\nPersonally I don't think there is a right weight to eat intuitively. I like to think about it like holding your breath for a really long time, then taking big breaths to stabilize yourself eventually. After starving yourself, your body will want to prepare for the next \"famine\", so it'll require a lot of energy. That's normal! This is a period where you take 'big breaths' and eat a lot. It might feel uncomfortable and bloated at times because you don't have fullness cues yet, but that's exactly what builds those cues - trial and failure. I didn't recover in a facility so I didn't have a team, so I personally just started eating, after a month or so of eating too much everyday my body started to understand when it's hungry and when it's not. Also, after the body realizes there's no famine, it stabilzes in terms of hunger cues and starts requiring less energy.\n\nRecovery is more than possible, it's the best thing you can do for yourself :)",
