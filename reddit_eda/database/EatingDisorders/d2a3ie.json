  "title": "Informational Post: Have you heard of a disorder called ARFID?",
  "selftext": " \n\nA lot of people saw a BBC article about a boy recently who went blind because of malnutrition caused by his own poor diet. While the BBC briefly mentioned ARFID in their article, their title heavily capitalized on the stigma around picky eating, and other articles even went as far as to blame the victim, calling him fussy, or to blame his family.\n\n[https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/a-british-teenager-is-blind-but-not-because-of-junk-food-or-fussy-eating/](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/a-british-teenager-is-blind-but-not-because-of-junk-food-or-fussy-eating/)\n\nThat boy suffered from ARFID, Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder. ARFID is a more recent discovery among food disorders, being only a few years old, making it a recent addition to the DSM5.\n\nARFID is characterized by an unwillingness to eat anything except for certain \"safe foods.\" People with ARFID come in all shapes and sizes and vary in what their safe foods are and how many they have. For some, ARFID seems to stem from childhood experiences with food, but that doesn't hold true for all. They often blame texture for why they don't like new foods. For someone with ARFID, trying new foods causes great anxiety or even panic attacks. Trying something new comes with the fear of throwing up. It doesn't matter how hungry you are, with ARFID, one will gladly starve instead of eating a non safe food.\n\nWith the stigma around picky eating, it's often difficult for someone with ARFID to eat out at restaurants or at friends' houses. People try to push eating new things without understanding how difficult ARFID makes it, and if you turn down any offers of food, people become worried or judgemental. People wonder how you can say you don't like a food you've never tried. Sometimes parents who's children have ARFID will force them to try new things or try to wean them off safe foods, but this tends to do more harm than good. More info here: [https://notapaperjournal.wordpress.com/2019/09/06/arfid-awareness-101/](https://notapaperjournal.wordpress.com/2019/09/06/arfid-awareness-101/)\n\nThere's very little awareness about ARFID compared to other eating disorders, and it can be hard to find information about it. Right now, our subreddit is having a mass growth because of the BBC article. Many of us have suffered ARFID all our lives thinking that we were alone, suffering some strange, nameless thing that nobody else has. If you think you or someone you know may be suffering from ARFID, you are not alone.\n\nWe may not have a national ARFID day, but we have a support subreddit over at [/r/ARFID](https://www.reddit.com/r/ARFID) . We also have a discord server you can join from there. Our subreddit has a WIP food encyclopedia pinned, which may help ARFID sufferers find foods that are very similar to their safe foods to try. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and best of luck to everyone no matter what you're going through <3",

My brother had severe ARFID growing up and still struggles. He would literally gag food up he couldn't handle the texture/taste of. It is a sensory thing, but it's also very much a disordered way of eating that effected him a lot physically and socially growing up and sometimes still does.\n\nNGL it sometimes feels like people are somewhat dismissive/uninclusive of any ED that isnt anorexia or bulimia with on the main ED subreddits but no one seems to notice lol",
