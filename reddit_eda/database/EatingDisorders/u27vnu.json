      "body": "Hi, friend!\n\nRecovering from eating disorders can be a hard path. Checking the scale all the time and looking yourself in the mirror can be stressful sometimes. My advice to you is don't overthink too much. Recovering is a long way to process. I have been there too. What you are going through right now is to have a healthy life. We will try to look everywhere to see something odd about us, but the truth is we are more than our external appearance. Our worthiness and sufficiency can't be found in how we look. Go easy on yourself. Take one step at a time in your recovery process. Let the past in the past, learn from that. You will be able to get fully recovered.\u00a0",
