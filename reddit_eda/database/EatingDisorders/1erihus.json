  "selftext": "So I\u2019ve modeled my whole life. I\u2019ve maintained a pretty good healthy mindset considering what I had to go through in the industry. I\u2019ve had people tell me all the time I need to lose weight and I need to lose my dancer thighs. I never rlly let it get to me. I was young and didn\u2019t rlly care what people thought. As I started to develop in the industry it started to hurt a lot more when I got turned down because of my body. It\u2019s just so frustrating bc they want me to be underweight. I\u2019ve had an eating disorder before and I\u2019m just worried it\u2019s coming back. I find myself eating less and less because there\u2019s a little person in the back of my head telling me I need to look a certain way to book good jobs. I go to Milan for fashion week next month and I\u2019m dreading it. Im trying my hardest to work on myself. I love modeling, it\u2019s almost like an art to me. I don\u2019t want this to deter my goals. Trying to work on bettering myself and realize that if someone body shames me then I don\u2019t want to work with them in the first place. I just wish the industry would change. Guess just looking for some advice or support. ",

Countless of castings I\u2019ve been to for companies seen as \u201cinclusive\u201d I was told my hips and waist was too wide (and they don\u2019t say it in a nice way if that\u2019s even possible). It is all about mentality and realizing that if they are rude then you don\u2019t want to work with them in the first place! It\u2019s just training my brain to be ok with that lol. Thank you!
