Keeping in mind that I\u2019m not a clinician, nor do I think all ED stories are the same\u2014my teen years looked a lot like this prior to developing anorexia in my early 20s. You\u2019re so smart to be thinking ahead and asking questions. Don\u2019t hesitate to reach out and get therapy if you feel like it\u2019s something you want to talk about. I wish I would\u2019ve talked about my eating in my teen years!",

It is a viscious cycle. I started having weekend binges because i restricted all week I was so hungry when it came to thee ed of the week. This turned into bulimia. I am now recovering from my ED and working on self love. Please, just know that you are perfect the way you are and you do not need to feel guilty about what goes into your body. For me, it was an obession. Honeslty, it was all I cared about. I lost a lot of weight a first, and then friends, and then hobbies and even some family members. It really takes a mental toll on you.",
