  "selftext": "I 15f have struggled with bulimia for about 2 years. I know, I know, it's very bad. My question is when I tell people that or it comes up in conversation they always sorta freak out (\"omg are you okay?\" \"i had no idea\" ect.) but then they will immediately go to \"wait your not in active recovery?\" no lol. i understand people concern but I really didn't think its that big of a deal. and idk if its because that's my normal now or what but i will always answer any questions and be open. so, is my take odd? (sorry if this is bad im shivering and it's very late at night) ",

It\u2019s like hearing about someone\u2019s in progress drug addiction or self harm: it\u2019s stigmatized and taboo and makes everyone concerned and uncomfortable. I wish it were different, but that is the reality of the situation. \n\nI\u2019ve had my ED for\u2026wow, longer than you\u2019ve been alive (damn I\u2019m old; when did that happen\ud83d\ude2d). Even though I\u2019m in and out of recovery, it never gets less awkward for people outside the recovery community to have those talks with me. \n\nYou\u2019re not doing anything wrong, and that doesn\u2019t mean you **shouldn\u2019t** talk about it; it\u2019s a societal issue. We just have to make informed decisions about how much we want to make public about our illnesses given that there is that stigma.\n\nAlso, talk to adults about it! Doctors, teachers, counselors, etc.. you deserve help. The earlier you start, the less permanent damage the ED will do to your brain and body.",

You\u2019re close friends absolutely it\u2019s ok but, we don\u2019t get to choose how people respond. It\u2019s something if you choose to share (learning the hard way - being selective with your vulnerabilities is a good life lesson), except people to get weird around you even those who are close. For those who care they\u2019d be worried and automatically want to help you get treatment. For those that don\u2019t like the person said it\u2019s like a person in the throes of addiction and self harm admitting that but doing nothing about it. They wondering why are you telling me, and if you don\u2019t want help why are you talking about it. The thing people who don\u2019t suffer from it don\u2019t realize acknowledging it is important, that the secrecy is what keeps a person ill.\n\nMay I ask what your motivation for telling people is verses seeking help and talking to a professional? As someone with an ED their is no judgment (I\u2019ve just been down this road with my ED, we\u2019re all different but I get it.) perhaps getting to the bottom of why you need to tell everyone but not seek help is a good start. They have help lines if that\u2019s an easier way to begin. I wish you recovery and hope you get the support you need. Take care.\n\nIf you have a student counsellor or trust your parents they would be the most helpful. But, again they have free lines to connect you with help and services.",

You\u2019re close friends absolutely it\u2019s ok but, we don\u2019t get to choose how people respond. It\u2019s something if you choose to share (learning the hard way - being selective with your vulnerabilities is a good life lesson), except people to get weird around you even those who are close. For those who care they\u2019d be worried and automatically want to help you get treatment. For those that don\u2019t like the person said it\u2019s like a person in the throes of addiction and self harm admitting that but doing nothing about it. They wondering why are you telling me, and if you don\u2019t want help why are you talking about it. The thing people who don\u2019t suffer from it don\u2019t realize acknowledging it is important, that the secrecy is what keeps a person ill.\n\nMay I ask what your motivation for telling people is verses seeking help and talking to a professional? As someone with an ED their is no judgment (I\u2019ve just been down this road with my ED, we\u2019re all different but I get it.) perhaps getting to the bottom of why you need to tell everyone but not seek help is a good start. They have help lines if that\u2019s an easier way to begin. I wish you recovery and hope you get the support you need. Take care.\n\nIf you have a student counsellor or trust your parents they would be the most helpful. But, again they have free lines to connect you with help and services.",
