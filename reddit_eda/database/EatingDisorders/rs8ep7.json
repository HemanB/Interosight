  "title": "Request: being triggered by partner",
  "selftext": " i have a new partner. she's great and everything but she's much smaller than me (5'1'' to my 5'9''). She has a small appetite to begin with but she recently started taking meds for her ADHD. The pills are causing her to have an even smaller appetite. Like yesterday, she didn't until dinner and her dinner was small. she's triggering the fuck out of me. she picked up that she was triggering me and pressured me to get into the details of what, exactly, is triggering (and to me it's like.. obvious, but whatever). i didn't want to get into it with her because: 1) it feels unfair to her to demand she eat more, more often 2) i'm worried that even if i tell her what's triggering she won't make the changes. or she would try to make changes but it won't last and then i will get resentful because it's something we've talked openly about. 3) i'm embarrassed by the whole thing i guess i don't know what i'm asking here. i just needed to get that off my chest and also see if anyone else has a similar experience.",

      "body": "I definitely understand\u2026 my partner also eats one meal a day (though it is pretty large) and often fasts. It has helped me to be totally honest with him about my experience with EDs and how it triggers me. He does not change his behavior because eating is obviously a personal choice, but we openly talk about it when I feel triggered and he reassures me that there is nothing wrong with the way I eat. \n\nI would advise being totally honest about this, if not it will absolutely cause resentment if you don\u2019t openly share how you feel with her. If your relationship with her is something you hope to be long-term, this is not worth hiding or feeling embarrassed about. Also, don\u2019t expect her to change how she eats. You will need to accept and support both of your differences to create a joyful relationship. Honesty is key. Blessings!",

      "body": "After my 6 year long relationship ended last year, I dated a guy for a couple months who would forget to eat all day and basically had to struggle to keep the lbs on. It wasn\u2019t the only reason I broke it off but there\u2019s no way I could have been in a relationship like that long term. It was too triggering for me. Obviously I didn\u2019t have a big stake in that relationship yet because it was so new, so I\u2019m not advising you to break up with your partner, but I definitely recommend having a conversation with her about your feelings. Sometimes that\u2019s all that\u2019s needed. You can preface it by telling her you know there\u2019s nothing she can do about it but that it\u2019s triggering for you and you just wanted to get that off your chest. You can\u2019t expect her or ask her to eat more\u2014that\u2019s you projecting onto her. But you can let her know you\u2019re feeling concerned but that you don\u2019t want to be controlling. It\u2019s a nuanced situation and I think the answer is just communication rather than taking any specific action. Just be honest and express yourself!",

In my eyes there are two choices. Choice number one is communication. You can communicate that her decisions are triggering for you and can mutually decide to take mealtime separately. That way you don\u2019t see how much or little she consumes and can focus on your eating, not hers. You can also be open in the moment when she\u2019s triggering you so you can talk it though and she can hopefully make you feel better. Obviously you can\u2019t say \u201cyou\u2019re triggering me\u201d every meal time but every once in a while when you\u2019re feeling really bad you can say \u201chey ___, I\u2019m having a hard time with food and my body at the moment.

Something like this is a big deal, the way she fuels her body is harming your mental health. Neither of you can really change that, just avoid it for a time. If you harp on her about it then she will feel villainized for her eating patterns which she doesn\u2019t deserve. It seems like she might have issues with food as well which is a whole other issue if that\u2019s true. If you keep this all to yourself your resentment will grow until you explode. I don\u2019t see this relationship lasting particularly long with an issue like this. I\u2019m sorry if it sounds harsh, it\u2019s just a strangers opinion online so don\u2019t take it too much to heart.",

      "body": "There is nothing weird about your feelings, OP. They are so normal when it comes to having an ED; no one really understands these things unless they've dealt firsthand with one.\nI would recommend reframing your thinking as much as possible; remember how different you both are in size/shape. Even if you both were the same size, her needs would be different from yours depending on factors that I can't begin to list because they all vary. \nIf you aren't already, can you check into seeing an RD to help you ensure you are eating enough? maybe hearing from a professional would help solidify your own need to feel ok about eating what is right for you. \nYour own recovery comes first; that is before any other relationship, since life (your own ability to live/thrive) is essential to be in relationships. If she does not understand, there are many resources that help support those in relationships with others who live with EDs. Youtube has a ton of videos, along with NEDA (www.nationaleatingdisorders.org) to help people understand the most common issues surrounding EDs.\nHang in there, don't stop fighting.",

      "body": "Coming at this as someone with ADHD (and a mostly-recovered ED) myself - \n\nAs someone with ADHD, I find myself often asking questions or making comments that are too invasive/personal without  knowing it or just without thinking first. \u2014 This is your partner and I imagine you know this about them. \n\nGenerally speaking, people with ADHD also don\u2019t mind or sometimes simply prefer blunt responses - or responses that are to the straight to the point. I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about the direct communication from their end.\n\nMy advice is open communication, if and/or when you are ready for it. Talk about is triggering you and you can both talk about ways to go around it. Maybe even write down a few points that you want to raise so that it\u2019s all covered. \n**(Sorry if the last point is irrelevant, I can\u2019t remember anything if I don\u2019t write it down)\n\nThe communication can also go both ways - from experience it took me 1-2 years to stabilise my eating routine when I started my ADHD meds - so know that your partner is also currently on their own food-related journey. Maybe you can find ways to both support each other. \n\nMy best wishes to you both",
