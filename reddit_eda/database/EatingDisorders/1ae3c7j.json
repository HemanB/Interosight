You don\u2019t have to wait any longer. Or you can plan on eating later. Your body is well prepared to burn a few hundred calories, so bake some cinnamon rolls or chug a pop. Just remember your value isn\u2019t a number on a scale or how much weight you lose. Much love. Recovering anorexic/bulimic/binge",
