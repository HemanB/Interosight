  "title": "Request: How might one find feelings before a binge eating crisis?",
  "selftext": " \n\nHow might one find feelings before a binge eating crisis? What does it feel like in the body?\n\nI\u2019m bulimic. My therapist suggested that when I have an eating  craving/hijack, I try explore those feelings for a few seconds (3-12s)  before grounding myself using techniques like the butterfly hug. This is  called desensitization. \n\nProblem is I have trouble finding those feelings. \n\nHere are the scenarios that end up in bulimia crisis\u2019: \n\n1. **Gradual:** I\u2019m bored or restless (usually linked to  procrastinating on tasks I don\u2019t want to do, which are most things in  life) so I get a (sweet) snack to distract myself, then have a bit more,  then a bit more, and before I know it it\u2019s: \u201cI\u2019ve eaten too much,  F-this I might as well go all in an purge after.\u201d  \n \n\n2. **Planned:** I\u2019m out an about and a craving starts to  build up but because of people \u201cwatching\u201dor because I won\u2019t able to go  purge I\u2019ll resist, however, I\u2019m itching to get home and be alone to  \u2018relief\u2019 myself. By the time I do, I go strait into a crisis.  \n\n3. **Hijack:** When I resist a crisis or had multiple  crisis in the day, I get food craving \u2018hijacks\u2019 where I feel like an  addict and there\u2019s nothing stopping me. I can\u2019t think and the one and  only mission is to relief myself asap. \n\nBackground: \n\n\\* I\u2019ve been struggling with eating disorders for 20+ years and thanks to  years of psychoanalysis have a good idea about its roots (lack of  self-actualization, attachment to mother, etc.). \n\n\\* Problem is knowing this isn\u2019t helping me deal with my ED.\n\n\\* That\u2019s probably because I\u2019m numb and don\u2019t feel my feelings. \n\n\\* When I do have feelings they are usually negative and extreme (and  related to situations where my \u2018ideal\u2019 identity is threatened or fear of  abandonment from a partner, my father wasn\u2019t in my life), in these  situations I go into food deprivation mode (anorexia). \n\n\\* Life feels like a chore. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to do things for  fun or out of love anymore.",

      "body": "Goodness gracious this was enlightening. I'm having the same experience. It's a bit different for me since I have health issues and eating any solids makes my body react badly. Major digestive issues they couldn't diagnose. Even small amounts of healthy foods that look perfectly normal to others make my body react and cause extreme bloating and discomfort. I eat to self harm sometimes bc I am so frustrated with my body, but it doesn't \"look\" like self harm to anyone else. I've realized the core is mother issues and lack of a father as well (ironically this condition has landed me living with her and even sleeping in her bed bc I don't have my own room) Thankfully she's a different person now but I still have to let go of the trauma she caused me in my earlier years. I need to \"parent\" myself and use self control to heal but my mother was super angry and controlling so I resist/rebel against my own self control mechanisms. Your triggers sound like mine, I just hadn't been able to articulate them to that extent. Thank you for this post. Just reading it has helped me understand myself a lot better. Before a \"binge\" I feel frantic. I don't always throw up but I have to take a lot of laxatives to get things to exit. I suspect \"holding onto\" my feelings and not letting myself feel them has caused that. My whole front torso feels rather disconnected feom me and numb, and I have pressure in my solar plexus area that makes breathing odd and difficult. Like lifting a weight, so even breathing causes major anxiety. It's funny how emotional issues manifest in our physical body symptoms. Yoga has helped me a lot. Cold showers. Breathing exercises. Being out in nature and getting sun. Trying to express creativity in whatever way I can, even if I don't \"enjoy\" it or don't feel like it. I can't draw well so I've been making collages. Juicing has helped me stay alive as well. There's something called \"rap\u00e9\" (pronounced \"hapay\") which is a tribal medicine and it is very grounding and has saved my life. I'm still working on feeling my feelings. If I can cry I usually feel relief afterward. I feel clarity for a bit instead of being foggy and anxious/irritable/numb. I just want to feel like myself but like you, when I do feel it is usually negative and scary af. I've had panic attacks where I almost passed out. I think my soul is having trouble staying in this body bc I have been so miserable (I'm rather spiritual, hence my language). People report having out of body experiences during particularly traumatic situations and that's what it felt like was going to happen. I somehow held on and hyperventilated until the anxiety meds kicked in. Anxiety meds have helped me TONS to think more clearly and slow my brain down. I have to have a plan though so I don't sabotage myself. They make me feel rather \"normal\" mentally and emotionally so it's easy to just go eat something I immediately regret because my body still reacts the same. My family has to hide food and it has been a huge strain on them in so many ways. I've been watching vids about multiple personality disorder and I don't think I have it, but I kind of identify with the dynamic. It feels like there are two sides of me fighting for control. One is a perfectionist (thanks mom) and the other wants to self sabotage out of pain (it finds comfort in self destruction somehow). Food offers a few minutes of pleasure I can't find elsewhere, bc like you, I don't find joy in anything or \"feel\" love. I'm trying so hard to balance between them and find a middle ground. I miss \"me\". \"Me\" was a cool person.\nIf I think of anything else I will post again. Sorry to be so long winded. Keep going. It's all we can do. \nOh yeah, it also helps me to make gratitude lists and watch videos of people who overcame seemingly impossible situations. People who have lost limbs and shit and still actualized themselves. It makes me feel that if they can do it, so can I. After all, I still have my arms and legs!!!\nAnyway, \u2764\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udcaa.",

      "body": "I definitely know exactly where you are coming from. I find it tough to pin point my exact feelings when I binge too. Sometimes it\u2019s so random and such a strong impulse that I can\u2019t explain what happened. I think a lot people who struggle with bulimia disassociate while binging, so it\u2019s probably very hard to pinpoint the emotions. Disassociation is a coping mechanism, so there definitely are major emotions lying underneath. I also have issues with my mom that have lead me to cope with my bulimia. A lot of my issues stem from my difficult relationship with my mom and my childhood. It\u2019s hard to accept these things and move on without using self harming behaviors like bulimia to cope. I also have pretty bad anxiety and that plays into my binging sometimes. Then sometimes when I obsess over calories and restrict for too long that also causes me to binge. There\u2019s so many factors, but I know the main one is me not being able to confront my own emotional issues head on. It\u2019s difficult, but I\u2019m going to try to be more present before a binge and possibly try to write my emotions out to deter it. Thank you for sharing your thoughts! It was interesting to read.",

      "body": "I'm so glad you're getting the help you need and working on this! You deserve a life that is fun and doesn't feel like a chore. I know what it's like for life to revolve entirely around bingeing and it's so draining.\n\nSince you said that when you do notice feelings, your feelings are negative and extreme, my guess is you're kinda like me and if feelings are on an intensity scale of 1-10, you don't even notice they're there until an 8, 9, even 10. But they are there wayyyy before that and the way to start noticing them earlier is mindfulness. Mindfulness is something you need to practice, not just something you use when you're about to hit crisis. Could you set aside some time every morning, midday, and night to check in with yourself? Just sitting quietly, no distractions, and really ask yourself: what am I feeling? What am I thinking? What are my body's sensations?\n\nI've also found the app RiseUp very helpful this because when you write down what you ate (its not like mfp or anything, doesn't log calories, it's up to you how detailed you log) it gives you a list of emotions and ED behaviors to check off and a space to journal. I find it helps me be aware of what I am feeling before and after I eat and noticing the urges I have. And the emotion list is nice because it's easier to know what you're feeling if you look at a list.\n\nEdit: it's also nice because sometimes when I write down the urges, they're no longer stuck in my head and they have less power. I think sometimes the feelings just need to get out, and my brain doesn't seem to care much if they get out on paper or in action, as long as they're out.\n\nAnyway, I think in general what you're needing is some mindfulness practice. It's a practice, by the way, it's really hard to get good at. It sounds like you have a lot of awareness about your past, but mindfulness will bring you awareness about your present. Try googling \"mindfulness dbt\" or \"mindfulness cbt\" to find specifics about it.",

      "body": "So I am not a therapist or anything, but from what I have learned in studying mindfulness, it is totally normal for some people to struggle with feeling feelings inside the body. As you say, there can be numbness that occurs. I might try to clarify with your psych what they mean exactly, but it sounds like they are suggesting to simply \u201ccheck in\u201d with yourself. To just pause and see what\u2019s there. It sounds like what you are noticing is that there is a numbness. Perhaps you don\u2019t need to find anything else right now? Maybe feelings will be revealed with time. Be well.",

I couldn\u2019t place ANY feels related to be ED... mostly because I felt like my ED replaced most of my feelings. I was completely distanced from it. All I felt was pure determination. Most of my instances were like your scenario two, so I would have this planned moment where I could finally eat after not eating for so long and I needed exactly the foods I wanted and needed to be alone for a certain amount of time and if it didn\u2019t all go to plan (friends came over unannounced, the food I was planning to get wasn\u2019t available) I would get SO anxious. I never could connect with stress, anger, loneliness, etc. because I was so focused they didn\u2019t register with me. Mostly I just felt pure determination and almost desperation to follow through with the perfectly thought out plan I had somehow gotten into my head. That just describes my experience.",

Some of it i think is addiction \u2014 it\u2019s a rote thing, muscle memory to keep eating once you\u2019ve begun. \n\nI had to begin by identifying my feelings after \u2014 I was aware enough to stop the binge, but afterward I tried to reflect on what I was feeling. Sometimes I was completely dissociated and I have to figure out what made me dissociate (which is really hard not gonna lie). But sometimes I can identify it. For example, I often feel shame when eating around others (\u201cam I eating too much/too little? are they judging me? they can all eat \u2018normal\u2019 and I can\u2019t\u201d) and i get embarrassed and ashamed.

I felt like i wasn't worth my mother's affection anymore. I wanted to be and look perfect for her. Growing up she would often compliment me on my body. Now that was gone. Since she was constantly dieting and worried about her own weight, being thin has always been important to her.\n  \nAlso growing up my mum struggled with (postpartum) depression and was quite overwhelmed with raising me. Since my dad worked a lot I would spend a lot of time by myself (I'm an only child). I remember feeling lonely and sort of empty since I can think, even though I had plenty of friends in school or in the neighborhood. We never really had a healthy routine/structure at home. I had to play mostly by myself, she couldn't really help me with school, she rarely tried to teach me new skills.\n  \nMy bulimia was something that was always there for me. I love my mom, she's the person I trust most. She tried her best, she loves me and genuinely tried to help me with my ED. But during recovery she would also put a lot of pressure on me and had certain expectations I couldn't fulfill. I think I grew up without my mum being attuned to me and my needs. She hasn't always been a source of comfort when I was stressed or hurt. I never learned how to cope or self-regulate in a healthy matter.",

So, to a certain extent, we also inherit from a very young age our parents brains.\n* More in [Tim Ferris' podcast interview of Gabor Mat\u00e9](https://youtu.be/H9B5mYfBPlY).\n\nHow this reflects in my case:\n\n* I have a good (though cold) relationship with mother. She has trouble showing emotions.\n* My mother as a child exhibited many of the same behaviors as I did: thumb sucking, getting bored easily, not having enough loving touch from mother.\n* Because of the latter, my mother tried to give me all the love and touching she could. As a child I was in her arms all the time. Yet I realized the that the only emotion I've ever *felt* from her is anxiety (manifested in her voice).\n* So despite all of my mother's efforts to change things, she wan't able to make me feel  loved.\n* This is also what I saw in my MDMA-assisted therapy session (compassionate use): when I was a baby, my mother loved with all her heart but she couldn't *show* it to me because she didn't know how to.\n* As a result I've had trouble feeling safe and soothed all my life (ref. [this article](https://www.edcatalogue.com/hidden-trauma-eating-disorders/)), which is making it hard for me to have self-confidence and detach from her.",
