  "selftext": "It always feels like I don't actually have an eating disorder, I'm just faking everything, or a \"wannabe anorexic\" or whatever. Im 16F, diagnosed with anxiety and depression, and currently seeing a therapist. So for about 6 months now I've been heavily restricting, eating very little during the day but almost always ending up by binging at the end because I can't control myself. It makes me feel worse, which then makes me want to restrict more, etc... But ive barely lost any weight, so every morning when I restart restricting, it feels like I'm \"trying\" really hard to prove that I have self control and that I can be skinny, when really I'm just eating and eating and eating and just trying all over again. I don't know if that made sense but basically I just feel like nothings actually wrong with me, I just suck at weight loss.\n\n",

      "body": "That absolutely falls under the parameters of an eating disorder. I struggled with similar issues and was diagnosed with \"Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (EDNOS)\" a few years ago. I think they've taken out \"not otherwise specified\" diagnoses at this point in time, but whatever they're calling it now, it's definitely a real problem. \n \nYou're not faking. Your problems are valid. \n\nStarving yourself is never going to provide the results you want. When I was really starving myself, I did *not* look better. My skin and hair was dry and awful. Some of my hair even fell out. (Not fun, haha) I wasn't even happy with my body! I *looked* unhealthy, and I felt terrible.\n\nOne thing that helped me was educating myself on the nutrients/calories my body needs to be healthy and really taking control over the things I eat. You can refocus the energy you're using to restrict into developing a healthy eating plan. By making my own food, I can relax and know that things I'm eating are healthy. That way you don't feel guilty for eating and you don't build up that hunger that urges you to binge at night. \n\nIf you can see a nutritionist, I would highly recommend it. They can help make sure you're giving your body the nutrition it needs. Appointments with nutritionists generally aren't covered under insurance. However, some doctors have a nutritionist on staff and bill under the head doctors name so you only end up having to pay a co-pay. Doctors who practice \"integrative medicine\" are more likely to do something like this.\n\nAlso, it's very easy to find yourself feeling proud when you successfully restrict yourself from eating. Restriction is not something to be proud of. Your body *needs* food. Eating is *not* something that should make you feel guilty. If at all possible, make eating healthy and taking care of yourself your new goal/sense of pride.\n\nSorry for the mega-novel but I've gone through similar issues and I know how difficult it can be. However, you can definitely overcome this!",

Also you don\u2019t have to have an eating disorder to suffer from disordered eating. Sometimes what people struggle with does not neatly fit a particular set of criteria. You have described a problem, you agonise over eating on a day to day basis, that is real for you and it is real for us.\n\nAlso, one of depression\u2019s greatest tricks is convincing you that you don\u2019t really have any problems and that you are an imposter. This feeling of self doubt, that you can\u2019t even do depression right, will ferry you to crisis faster than the depression by itself. Your experiences are real, you are suffering, this is real. You get to feel bad sometimes, and at times we have to feel bad, so if your mind tries to take that away from you, tell it to jog right on.",

It ended up saving me though. \n\nI was wrecking myself on the inside to try and change the outside, and after some time (and a long journey to self love) I realized that I was torturing myself for nothing. I wanted to feel the control an ED provided me, and I wanted somebody to recognize that I was fighting a demon, myself, and needed help. When that didn\u2019t happen, it was hard. I felt like an ED poser, but looking back I recognize this was a gift! A hurtful and shitty gift, but nonetheless a gift to my future self. I got to work on and improve my relationship with food and myself before it was too late. \n\nI am standing a decade later, healthy and happy to be on this earth. It took a long time to get here, and there are still dark days/weeks, but I\u2019ve crawled out of my hole and am filling it up shovel full by shovel full so I\u2019ll never fall back in.

So admitting you may have a problem is a huge step, so rather than feeling like you're fake you should be proud that you know there is an issue and you aren't in denial.",

But there are many EDs and not all of them \"require\" to be underweight. Maybe it helps to know that I once also had the same thinking as you. I was convinced my problem wasn't big enough, real enough until I reached a certain weight. Terribly afraid of people not taking me serious.\nWell, I of course deserved help. The same as you do.
