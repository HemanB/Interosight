      "body": "Honestly, I think this is fairly common.  I know I felt like this as a teenager struggling, and even sometimes as a young adult.  It was really helpful for me to get into therapy and be able to use my words to tell someone that I'm struggling instead of using actions and hoping they would notice.  It was - and still is - very validating and helpful to hear my therapist say that she knows I'm struggling or scared or whatever, and that she's there.",

      "body": "I agree with the others suggesting you reach out to someone.\n\nIt really hard for someone who may see you struggling to know whether it's OK to talk with you about it.  They don't know if you'd be OK with them \"crossing that line\" and getting into personal discussions.  Out of respect for you, they may not reach out even if they think something is going on.  That said, if you reach out to let them know you are struggling and are looking for help, I'd bet they'd not hesitate one second to do whatever they can to help.",

People just don\u2019t know what to look for. Being the one to ask for help is so scary, but I believe you can do it :) and recovery is possible I promise",

Unfortunately it\u2019s not people\u2019s jobs (other then your parents) to make sure you\u2019re okay and safe, everyone has their own struggles and mostly focus on themselves. Please try to talk to a trusted adult or even doctor, nurse, teacher, ect. It takes strength to realize you\u2019re struggling and I promise it will be worth it later",

They are over worked and don\u2019t have the spoons to watch for every kids silent struggle. If you want help I have no doubt they will happily help you and support you, but you have to tell them first.\n\nETA: my partner is a teacher and often comes across situations/notices things where he cares \u2014even a lot\u2014but can\u2019t say anything without it becoming a problem.",
