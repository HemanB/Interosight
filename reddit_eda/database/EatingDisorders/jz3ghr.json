So that was hell didn\u2019t go for a second time and I binge and purge at least 4 or five times a day people tell me I\u2019ve gotten skinnier but i feel fatter than ever and one day because of my puffy face someone told me \u201cyou\u2019ve gotten fatter since the last time i saw you huh?\u201d So yeah lol i want to die so so bad the only thing keeping me alive is the fact that i have to take care of my sick mother (who was mentally and physically abusing to me) and my father and brother who I can\u2019t stand but I can\u2019t say anything because i feel bad but they always make fun of me when I binge \nIdk this was just a rant I needed to talk to someone :(",

I still remember when I decided to eat something, after not eating all day, my sister made a joke that \"I was not going to keep it down.\" and my ed became a joke for my family to mock. the best thing you can do right now is try your absolute best to ignore those around you and focus on yourself and find coping mechanisms that distract you from ed impuses and find some way to start recovery. I have a ton of podcasts you could listen to and people to follow, but your ed is a big deal. I know how difficult it can be to recover in a shitty family situation and it takes all of your strength, but I full beleive in you. when you start to recover you will hear a lot more comments on your body and the best thing is to ignore or call out those people for their ignorance. If someone says youve gained weight, nothing is more powerful  than being like \"I didn't ask for your opinion, but when I do I'll let you know.\" Because at the end of the day this is about you no one else and your life means more than being dictated by others approval or comments. You are a queen and I think that you can overcome this challege.

I have a ton of podcasts you could listen to and people to follow, but your ed is a big deal. I know how difficult it can be to recover in a shitty family situation and it takes all of your strength, but I full beleive in you. when you start to recover you will hear a lot more comments on your body and the best thing is to ignore or call out those people for their ignorance.

I could see how young girls could be super impacted by constantly seeing these edited Kylie bots and thinking this is what you should look like \n\nI def had my \u201cangst\u201d when I was about 17. I was working a lot back then as a teen because I liked money and it was starting to be a lot with school. I began partying and hanging out with the wrong crew,.. I had depression for sure and masked it with partying... \n\nI never had body issues but I did get comments on my weight. I noticed if I was skinny I got compliments and if I gained weight I got comments about it... \n\nCould this stem from not only body image issues but seeking some form of control? You need a good therapist.. my mom sent me to one when I was 17.. there is a root to this issue .. \n\nI know my words are just words but please know , it gets better after high school. You need nutrients and vegetables so please get help and be open to it ... \n\nI\u2019ve been your age and I know it\u2019s hard but getting tot the root will get you closer to treating it",
