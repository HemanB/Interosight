  "selftext": "I (twenty five f) am working towards recovery from my eating disorder. I\u2019ve started therapy, and I\u2019m doing so have really been looking at moments from my childhood where I exhibited ED behavior. Like, as young as seven.  Everyone in my family is overweight, and I am as well, so it was largely brushed off. There are moments I can clearly remember binging and my parents knew about it. They scolded me for eating so much and hiding it but never actually did anything to try and address it. Anyone else have similar experiences? It\u2019s very frustrating to look at as an adult. I\u2019m also the youngest of 6 kids, so it\u2019s not like I was their first.",

Ya know when you look back at little-you and you're just like UGH SHE JUST NEEDED HELP.\n\nI had a mental breakdown getting ready for an Easter celebration when I was 15/16.... my dad's solution was to DVR a documentary on a French woman who lived her entire life with active anorexia and died, them forced me to sit and watch it by myself a day or so later.\n\nMy mom's solution from 9 and up was to offer me tips!!!!!! Think about gross stuff to make yourself nauseous, if you're just going to throw it up make sure you don't eat expensive food, here is some generic brand Adderall alternative to suppress your appetite. \n\nIt's really easy to get angry and feel down about it. When that happens I try to remind myself that I am here for me now, even though I wasn't always on my own team, and I can care for and love myself better than they ever could, and then we try to do one thing to support current-me.",

I developed my eating disorder when I was around 11 and was heavily influenced by a family member. At 27, I look back at those days with genuine compassion for my younger self- even though I actively battle with ED. Internal Family Systems (IFS) is a really effective therapy that I\u2019ve used for other parts of my life; I think it would be helpful to look at that part that feels angry and validate it. And then ask it how it\u2019s going to help you moving forward and give it lots of understanding and love. You are doing the best you can/ when you were a kid and where you are right now.",
