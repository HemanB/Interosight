  "selftext": "I\u2019m a teenager and I\u2019m not professionally diagnosed but I can tell that my eating habits and mindset are not healthy or normal. Just recently I started aggressively counting calories, feeling nothing but guilt when i eat anything, being obsessed with my weight, and a few other things. \n\nFor the past few days my mom has been in my parents room almost 24/7. Their bedroom is where the scale is located and I usually sneak in and out just to check my weight. On normal nights, my parents are watching tv in the living room but my dad has been doing renovations there so they can\u2019t do that for the time being. It also means I can\u2019t weight myself at night. \n\nI know I shouldn\u2019t be obsessed with my weight and it\u2019s not healthy but when I can\u2019t see it I feel like I don\u2019t deserve to eat anything. If I wanted even the tiniest snack, it feels like I\u2019m going crazy because I don\u2019t know what weight I\u2019m at. The past few days I get super stressed and frustrated and end up crying in bed. My thoughts start wandering to places they shouldn\u2019t and my body falls asleep around 9 or 10. I was just wondering if anyone else has similar experiences/feelings.",

It\u2019s hard to do since weighing yourself feels so obsessive and needed, but I had to work my mind up to doing it. I also replaced the scale with measuring my waist. It\u2019s still not healthy, but it\u2019s better than the scale, since you waist measurement will fluctuate a lot less than the numbers on the scale (and remind yourself that it\u2019s totally normal for the numbers to fluctuate).

I have a scale but make myself only weigh in once a week, and from then if I get better maybe every two weeks, and every month. It\u2019s tough.",

You know you have an issue, which is a huge positive sign that you\u2019re able to recognize that, so getting the help you need right now is the best chance for you to not let the next years, maybe decades, of your life be ruled by this disease. It will only get worse if you let it, and ED recovery is a long, difficult path.",

Even if you\u2019re going to go back to weighing yourself, just be curious about what it\u2019s like to go without. Think about how weighing yourself makes you feel. Without the scale you no longer have to meet some sort of numerical standard\u2014 you are just you and you are good enough. I have found that choosing not to weigh myself is very powerful and has helped me along recovery tremendously. \n\nStay strong\u2014 sending you good vibes!!",
