  "title": "Request: I went to the doctors and they want me to come back........",
  "selftext": "Thursday I went to the doctors it was the normal routine go in get your height and weight and go wait for the doctor to examine you. Me and my dad are waiting in the room and the doctor arrives and the first thing she said was \u201cit seems you\u2019ve lost quite a bit of weight were you trying to do that?\u201d I responding with \u201cyes\u201d I was actually trying to lose some weight since I was overweight and now I\u2019m classified as a healthy weight. There were some papers there for me personally to fill out while she asked me about my calories intake which I told her and she told me it was too low and asked me how I was feeling but I felt fine she dropped it after that. The papers asked me if I had tried starving myself or bingeing, purging, any type of disordered eating I looked at the yes checkbox and decided to skip the question and come back to it but after she asked me those questions about my weight and calorie intake I quickly went backed it checked the no box.... a few more questions later it asked me how often I thought about weight loss and had anxiety about food I checked the several days a week box, I gotta be kinda honest right? Then a nurse came in took my blood and I got some shots and I left. Later that day the doctors called back and I guess they told my parents that I had lost thirty pounds in a year and my blood sugar and vitamin  D was very low im a 16 year old girl that isn\u2019t normal... and they wanted to see me again on Tuesday. That night I deleted myfitnesspal and decided to stop counting my calories and just eat what I wanted, and the the 3 meals now recommended by my doctor... I never ate breakfast but the next day I did and it honestly wasn\u2019t bad except I had to wake up early to fit it into my day which was new since I usually woke up at 12:00 in the afternoon everyday, that day I didn\u2019t track anything and I felt okay it kinda displeased me that I couldn\u2019t count but I also wanted to be healthy I still hadn\u2019t reached my \u201cgoal weight\u201d but the doctors visit scared me and I\u2019m pretty sure my parents are starting to think I have an eating disorder and maybe I do too.... I just don\u2019t have the common symptoms I don\u2019t ever starve myself as long as it\u2019s in my calorie budget I\u2019ll eat whether it be cookies or chips of course there are foods that I avoid like fast food but I feel like everyone who\u2019s trying to watch there figure does that right? I don\u2019t binge because it scares me to eat that many calories that\u2019s not normal is it? I get a bit repulsed when I walk past foods in the store I deem unhealthy.... I\u2019ve purged maybe twice and after the second time I know I won\u2019t do it again because it just didn\u2019t feel good doing that too myself. But today was the second day of me not tracking and all I could think was \u201cdon\u2019t weigh this food out\u201d, \u201cdon\u2019t step on the scale\u201d,  \u201ceat this it\u2019ll be good for you\u201d, \u201cI don\u2019t want too it\u2019ll make gain weight..but you have too, they\u2019ll think something is wrong if you don\u2019t\u201d, \u201chow many calories do you think you ate?\u201d....I feel sick right now because I\u2019m scared that I\u2019ll gain weight back I planned on slowly adding back calories to my diet after I lost a few more pounds but since I decided to stop counting since it put in a bad place I don\u2019t know what to do.... I don\u2019t want them to diagnose with an ED I don\u2019t think I have one I just think I have some bad habits that I can work on by myself I don\u2019t want my family to be upset with me I know they\u2019ll try to blame themselves he\u2019ll they tried to force feed me a smoothie yesterday and make it seem like they weren\u2019t. I\u2019m just so confused I plan on asking my dad to let me go in alone at the doctors on Tuesday though so I can be honest because maybe I do need help and I\u2019m just too sick to see it.",

      "body": "Going alone might help if your parents being around is what\u2019s making you nervous! Sometimes when you are nervous about gaining weight but you aren\u2019t starving yourself, you have \u201cdisordered eating\u201d which is like not a formal ED but means you have an eating disorder, from what i understand. being honest with ur doctor is definitely #1 priority, even if it makes you feel nervous/guilty/doing something wrong. it\u2019s brave to just go in!!!",

Write down everything you want to talk about so you don\u2019t forget it at the doctors office. That way you can find out if your goals and habits are healthy. Trust your doctor.

      "body": ">Copying another post I wrote to another Redditor that I thought would be helpful:  \n>  \n>First off, be proud of yourself for reaching out and being able to talk about your struggles. Both are HUGE steps toward recovery so congrats on this first big step!  \n>  \n>Second, are you seeing a therapist and nutritionist? . If you've been engaging in disordered eating for a long time, it can be a process to recover your metabolism, which I think you should have professional help with. I\u2019d highly recommend seeking help from a nutritionist and ED-specializing therapist who practice the health at every size (HAES) and intuitive eating approach. You can search for providers on the HAES website or search your town, the type of provider, and intuitive eating or health at every size in google. I'd look into HAES and intuitive eating yourself to see what they're about.  These two theories have been MONUMENTAL in my recovery and finally feeling SANE and normal around food/eating.  \n>  \n>Third, working with a therapist to uncover the deeper root causes of your struggles. Many modern treatment centers often overlook this step and only treat the eating issues, not the mental/emotional patterns, trauma, etc. that is causing the disordered eating. Think of disordered eating as the symptom caused by some unaddressed internal issues (i.e anxiety/stress, depression, perfectionism, etc.). The mental/emotional struggles may seem to have no cause, but by working with a therapist, you may uncover parts of your past that may have influenced you. It helps a lot to sit and work through suppressed emotions, memories, and so on, and can really help clarify and make sense of what you've gone through and what you're going though. Therapists can help you develop self reflection practices, healthy coping mechanisms, self care routines, and more, so you don't rely on the disordered eating to manage stress/life. (I used disordered eating and compulsive overexercising to manage stress during college/life transitions, and have learned that I need to prioritize self care (journaling, joyful movement, fun, etc in order to feel mentally balanced.)  \n>  \n>Fourth, I highly recommend JOURNALING! Journal your thoughts, feelings, emotions, etc. Practice self compassion, let yourself cry if you need to, and most of all FORGIVE yourself. We are not perfect and we are always learning. Forgiveness is huge. Explore creativity, explore expression through dance, song, colors, cooking, whatever calls to you!  \n>  \n>Fifth: Regarding body image: It's virtually impossible to live in western society without  some form of body image struggles. Working on body image and reversing fat-phobia are KEY in recovery. Here's something I wrote to another redditor struggling with negative body image thoughts: Whenever I have a body conscious/bad body image thought, I try to recognize it as a  \"negative body image thought\" and respond with something like \"I am not  my body\" or \"my body does not define me\" or \"my body is my vessel\" or  \"the shape of my body does not matter\" or \"all bodies are worthy of  love\"... find some little mantras that resonate with you. I'd recommend  following fat-positive social media accounts (models, athletes,  influencers,  etc.) that are actively celebrating diverse body types and people in  larger bodies. This will help with restructuring your mindset to be less  fat-phobic.  \n>  \n>In addition, I have found journaling about my feelings to  be super helpful as I remind myself where our fat phobia/body  dissatisfaction comes from in the first place. We live in a  society/economy that glorifies a body type that only a small fraction of  the female population naturally has. Capitalism media/marketing has  insidious psychological tactics to make you hate your body and fear  being \"fat\" in order to SELL YOU THINGS (diets, exercise products,  beauty products, clothes, the list goes on)! They profit off of self  hatred they instill within us- It's truly evil. We must remember that  \"modern\" times are only a glimpse of human history. Women in larger bodies  have been worshiped for millennia by other cultures since they saw the  full feminine form is a sign of fertility, beauty, and prosperity. See  these prehistoric goddess statues  for example. Try to remember that we have all been subconsciously  programmed by social construction, media, and marketing to fear the fat  on our bodies. There is truly NOTHING wrong with your body no matter what size it is.  Journaling  down these reminders and self affirmations to encourage body acceptance  will help restructure your mindset. It is totally possible to create new  neural networks (brain connections = thought patterns) and overcome the root cause of your struggles!  \n>  \n>More resources:\n\n* The food psych podcast\n* the love food podcast\n* the fuck it diet podcast\n* Eating in the light of the moon\n* Intuitive eating book and workbook\n* Local support groups\n* Link to MORE resources: [https://alissaswankcounseling.com/new-page](https://alissaswankcounseling.com/new-page)\n* instagrams such as: nourishandeat, danaisabellaaa, bodyposipanda, bravespacenutrition",
