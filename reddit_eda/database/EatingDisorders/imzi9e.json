  "selftext": "This is more of a general body issue than an eating disorder one, but it was the result of one so I'll count it. Anyway, I've been sucking in my stomach pretty much 24/7 since I was old enough to be self-conscious about my stomach. I literally can't remember what it feels like to relax it. I only noticed last night when I was physically too tired to suck it in. It's ingrained into my muscles and I can push out my stomach, but just can't relax it. I know it's a minor problem compared to others on this sub, but it's making me panic and I can't afford to relapse after spending years recovering from it.",

My therapist was suggesting ways to, over time, lower my anxiety levels, and she said lying down and breathing in a way that my stomach lifts instead of my chest might help, and that I should start at 5 mins of this and eventually work myself up to 15 mins a day to help rebalance some of my blood oxygen chemistry. \n\nThat shit hurted. \n\nI did like 3 mins before I felt like I couldn\u2019t get any oxygen and my torso hurt so bad. \n\nI hate it here lmao",
