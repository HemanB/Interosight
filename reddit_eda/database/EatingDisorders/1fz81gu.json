  "selftext": "im a 22 year old female that has been dealing with anorexia and bulimia for 7 years. im at a point where i cant keep fluids or solids down, and im in the hospital at least once a week due to electrolyte imbalances and i have a chronically low potassium. ive had heart, kidney and liver failure in the past, but it had corrected itself through a treatment stay. now, my kidney failure is back and my ekg gets more abnormal every time im back in the hospital. i have a job i have to stay physically able and present for in order to pay my rent. i\u2019ve been to treatment over 6 times in the past, and every time i relapse. my therapist told me that im the most critical patient shes dealt with, and most of the hospital doctors have basically said theyre about to deem me as gravely disabled & put me on a hold and tube me (this has happened a few years ago, so i know its a real possibility). i dont know what to do for myself, the discomfort that comes with eating or drinking anything is so strong and distracting. i dont eat at work because i cant focus, and when i eat at home i throw it up instantly. \n\ni dont want to die & i dont want this to be my life but im starting to feel like a lost cause, and that im basically just waiting to die. any advice or anything please, TYIA",

I'd really appreciate it.\n\nDon't worry about me talking about myself too much because honestly i wouldn't mind if we mostly spoke about you. I think i can be a very valuable friend to have and i think that's what i want, to help someone out.\n\nYou're the first person i have reached out to, in years. I actually made this account today, just to message you. As i feel like my main account doesn't really reflect who i actually presently am. Although i feel that way every couple of months ahah.\n\nMy discord name is Im\\_on\\_a\\_master\\_quest    Please add me, and you can call me if you like. If you get bored after 2 minutes we can hang up. Nothing to lose everything to gain. And i'm imagining you as the person to benefit most, but honestly perhaps it could be me.",
