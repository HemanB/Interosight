  "selftext": "Does anyone else feel sad that they can\u2019t try diets?\n\nI suffer from bulimia and I\u2019m currently in therapy to help with that. I\u2019ve had a lot of issues with weight loss and gain throughout the years because of it. To make matters worse, I\u2019m bipolar as well so my moods really affect my eating. Because of COVID, I\u2019ve gained a little weight back after losing almost 30 lbs (the healthy way). \n\nLike I mentioned, I\u2019m in therapy now and she REALLY looks down on restrictive diets. I used to calorie count but she\u2019s really hesitant to encourage that because I get carried away so easily. I know dieting isn\u2019t good for you. I just see all of this \u201cintermittent fasting\u201d, \u201cjuice cleanse\u201d, \u201ccounting macros\u201d, etc. that I want to try. It sucks not being able to engage like normal people. Why do I have to take everything to an unhealthy place? Does anyone else feel like it\u2019s just one more reminder of how you can\u2019t be like others?",

That is how my ED truly started with the restricting and I used to sometimes purge.

Then I started increasing the schedule and then I cut more food back. By the time sophomore year started I was in full blown restriction, then my twin sister taught how to purge.

      "author": "jeabgrenouille",
      "body": "Cool! I can think of a few pieces of advice:\n\n1. Social media. When I follow athletes and fitness people, I am very careful to only follow people who I think are good role models to me and/or speak about the science related to fitness (not stupid diet hogwash that is harmful long-term). I really like Natacha Oc\u00e9ane for the science and Kara Saunders, Amanda Barnhart, and Lindsay Dawn Webster are some of my favourite female athletes to follow. I also continue to watch specifically ED content from Tabitha Farrar to make sure I keep my brain vigilant against ED thoughts. I have to deal with them less and less and less and it gets easier and easier, but I feel I have to always be vigilant about it. The more I have learned about how my body and brain work, the better I have become mentally. \n\n2. Control. I do not decide how much I workout. I used to feel a lot of stress and thoughts would go around and around in my head about should I workout? What kind of workout? How long? Is that enough? Is that too much? It was very stressful and sometimes I'd spend all day debating about what would be perfect. I found that a great solution has been to put control in others' hands. I currently do group training with a trainer who I adore. I just come to his workouts as they are scheduled and do what's planned. No more than that what's on the plan. Bam. No problem. Whenever I don't have that option, I have purchased fitness plans (I have two of Natacha Oc\u00e9ane's plans... I love her style. I have also bought two of Stephanie Buttermore's plans, but they aren't as fun to me.) And then I have just done them as prescribed. No more. If others are doing more, good thing I have practiced telling myself that my body is not affected by other people's choices and I have practiced not acting on thoughts about needing to do the most.\n\n3. Practicing breaking routine: the best thing that ever happened to me was taking extended time off of fitness and eating foods I was scared of. I did these things at the same time, and nothing bad happened at all. Once I went back to exercising, I had to build back up, but it was no big deal at all. I then knew I could take a break whenever I needed to or wanted to and nothing bad would happen. This was very important to my relationship with exercise. I just kept those previously scary foods in my diet because I realized they were just food and not magic or evil. This was also important. These things allow me to live a balanced and flexible life where I can workout, but I can also skip it if I need to, and I can eat \"healthy\" and make sure I fuel myself to perform well,  but I can also go out for ice cream, for example. \n\n4. Practicing discipline in a new way: Having had anorexia, I think there is something in me that makes me inherently very disciplined, and I've learned that sometimes, being disciplined means following my plan when I want to do more, taking rest days when I don't want to, slowing down when I need to, building up more slowly than I want to, eating when I don't want to, doing the opposite of harmful thoughts as they come, etc. I am also exercising discipline by not trying to \"cut\" or lean out because I know that I'm at a weight that is sustainable for the lifestyle that I want to have (I want to be fast and strong and continue to improve those things and feel good in my workouts, but I also want to be able to relax and be flexible) and I know that being at the weight I'm at helps me to feel good and perform well. If I were to try and lose weight, I know that it would be vanity weight loss and my performance and energy would suffer. I feel very proud of myself for being disciplined in this way because I know that it took a lot of work and practice to do it.\n\nThat's all I can think of for now. I had to go through a lot of trial and error and extreme hunger and weight gain and insecurity and lots of failure, but I really feel like I'm on a good track and I feel very proud and happy and free in general, especially when I reflect on how messy my journey has been and how IMPOSSIBLE almost every little thing I now do on a daily basis would have been 7+ years ago. It can get better and better and better bit by bit by bit by bit.",

Once I found foods that were more filling in smaller portions I stopped counting and just started adjusting my meals to include those things (rice, potatoes, cruciferous veggies, etc). \n\nBut I totally agree dieting isn\u2019t a healthy option. I\u2019ve seen all my friends so keto, paleo, Atkins, etc and they gain in all back in days. I just wish I could try to do something like a cleanse or intermittent fasting. That may be the ED talking though \ud83d\ude30",

          "body": "Cool! I can think of a few pieces of advice:\n\n1. Social media. When I follow athletes and fitness people, I am very careful to only follow people who I think are good role models to me and/or speak about the science related to fitness (not stupid diet hogwash that is harmful long-term). I really like Natacha Oc\u00e9ane for the science and Kara Saunders, Amanda Barnhart, and Lindsay Dawn Webster are some of my favourite female athletes to follow. I also continue to watch specifically ED content from Tabitha Farrar to make sure I keep my brain vigilant against ED thoughts. I have to deal with them less and less and less and it gets easier and easier, but I feel I have to always be vigilant about it. The more I have learned about how my body and brain work, the better I have become mentally. \n\n2. Control. I do not decide how much I workout. I used to feel a lot of stress and thoughts would go around and around in my head about should I workout? What kind of workout? How long? Is that enough? Is that too much? It was very stressful and sometimes I'd spend all day debating about what would be perfect. I found that a great solution has been to put control in others' hands. I currently do group training with a trainer who I adore. I just come to his workouts as they are scheduled and do what's planned. No more than that what's on the plan. Bam. No problem. Whenever I don't have that option, I have purchased fitness plans (I have two of Natacha Oc\u00e9ane's plans... I love her style. I have also bought two of Stephanie Buttermore's plans, but they aren't as fun to me.) And then I have just done them as prescribed. No more. If others are doing more, good thing I have practiced telling myself that my body is not affected by other people's choices and I have practiced not acting on thoughts about needing to do the most.\n\n3. Practicing breaking routine: the best thing that ever happened to me was taking extended time off of fitness and eating foods I was scared of. I did these things at the same time, and nothing bad happened at all. Once I went back to exercising, I had to build back up, but it was no big deal at all. I then knew I could take a break whenever I needed to or wanted to and nothing bad would happen. This was very important to my relationship with exercise. I just kept those previously scary foods in my diet because I realized they were just food and not magic or evil. This was also important. These things allow me to live a balanced and flexible life where I can workout, but I can also skip it if I need to, and I can eat \"healthy\" and make sure I fuel myself to perform well,  but I can also go out for ice cream, for example. \n\n4. Practicing discipline in a new way: Having had anorexia, I think there is something in me that makes me inherently very disciplined, and I've learned that sometimes, being disciplined means following my plan when I want to do more, taking rest days when I don't want to, slowing down when I need to, building up more slowly than I want to, eating when I don't want to, doing the opposite of harmful thoughts as they come, etc. I am also exercising discipline by not trying to \"cut\" or lean out because I know that I'm at a weight that is sustainable for the lifestyle that I want to have (I want to be fast and strong and continue to improve those things and feel good in my workouts, but I also want to be able to relax and be flexible) and I know that being at the weight I'm at helps me to feel good and perform well. If I were to try and lose weight, I know that it would be vanity weight loss and my performance and energy would suffer. I feel very proud of myself for being disciplined in this way because I know that it took a lot of work and practice to do it.\n\nThat's all I can think of for now. I had to go through a lot of trial and error and extreme hunger and weight gain and insecurity and lots of failure, but I really feel like I'm on a good track and I feel very proud and happy and free in general, especially when I reflect on how messy my journey has been and how IMPOSSIBLE almost every little thing I now do on a daily basis would have been 7+ years ago. It can get better and better and better bit by bit by bit by bit.",

      "body": "I'm glad I could help!! Yes, I really recommend finding people who talk about eating disorders specifically because we definitely have different things to work on when it comes to improving our overall wellness than many other people.\n\nWhen it comes to motivation, if you truly feel that you are in a place where movement can be a part of your life, I found the best thing to do was to set very low standards. I'm such a perfectionist like many of us, and sometimes I would think a workout had to be a certain length and a run had to be a certain distance. I started to love moving when I set lower standards for what movement is and what it means to me.\n\nSometimes I walk with an audiobook or podcast. Sometimes I have just run for 1 minute and then walked for 1 minute for only ten minutes total. Sometimes I run and take 100 breaks to take pictures of the river. Sometimes I play frisbee with my husband. Sometimes I spend a few minutes learning tiktok dances. In the past, I have joined intramural sports teams. I consider myself very fit, and I do push myself and work hard sometimes, but I am in a place where I want to work hard because I stopped pressuring myself to always work super hard, if that makes sense. I notice that only working super hard a few days a week helps me make more progress in my fitness anyway. \n\nGetting stronger and faster helps me with my confidence. HOWEVER. If I were being honest with myself, and I knew that fitness was not something that I was ready for, I would do myself a favour and do whatever work I need to do on rewiring my brain and take more time off of exercise, and making that choice that I know deep down is best for me would make me feel good about myself, even if it would be uncomfortable and not necessarily what I wish I were doing.",
