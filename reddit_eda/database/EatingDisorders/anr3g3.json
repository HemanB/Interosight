  "selftext": "Big rant. Sorry in advance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I have a 16 year old eating disorder (strictly non-purging anorexia) schizoaffective (bipolar 2 subtype), severe depression, anxiety, and OCD. I\u2019m currently in a serious relapse with my ED and my weight is way down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently I was (am) fairly suicidal. I only told one person. She met me with compassion and understanding. She provided me amazing nonjudgmental support when I shared my feelings. She also is supportive (in a helpful way) of my attempts at recovery.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, then a group of my other friends noticed I wasn\u2019t doing too hot, and then figured out how hard I was struggling and decided to throw me an intervention; alone, three inexperienced women who know nothing about mental illness, and no professional insight or support.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey sat me down and berated me for an hour and a half. That I\u2019m bad for not opening up to them. They\u2019re mad that I\u2019m still struggling. I should be getting better faster. I\u2019m not doing enough to help myself. I should have reached out to them first.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLike.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Truly depressed people with mental illness on the verge of suicide seldom reach out. So don\u2019t get fucking OFFENDED when you find out I didn\u2019t tell you. Maybe you should feel like..what could I have done better for D to trust us? They NEVER text me first. Ever. So why would i share my suicidal ideation with them??\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. Recovery isn\u2019t a straight line and nobody\u2019s fucking perfect. Yeah, I\u2019ve been struggling consistently for about a year, but like..it\u2019s not my FAULT. I have multiple mental illnesses and they all aggravate the others. It\u2019s out of my god damn control.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Don\u2019t berate the person you\u2019re trying to \u201csupport.\u201d Beating down on someone (with no moderator!!) will, in fact, make whatever the bigger issue is, worse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. Don\u2019t pretend you know what you\u2019re doing!! The first thing one of them said was, \u201cso we\u2019ve never done this, and we have no idea what we\u2019re doing, but here goes!\u201d Interventions are DANGEROUS if not done correctly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5. Have a fucking goal at least!! They didn\u2019t even have a desired outcome of the intervention. They had no plan. No follow through. I don\u2019t even know what they expected from me. I think they just wanted me to agree with them, apologize for not telling them, and then listen to their every piece of advice and treat it like it was made of gold.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n6. They told me that my therapist must be really bad. They said I needed to fire her and find someone new. Or see two therapists. Which is SOOOOOOOOOOOO unethical to each therapist! No better way to get two sets of instructions and accidentally fuck it up. (For me anyway)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n7. Do not EVER tell someone who is suicidal your personal stories of loss. Jesus Christ. Really?? I want to die and you\u2019re GUILTING ME? Fuck dude really? My best friend passed from suicide in 2012. I\u2019m still fucking demolished over it, not to mention the three other friends who have gone that way. I do NOT need to be told about the affects of suicide on friends and family. I\u2019ve experienced more loss via suicide than all three of them together. So don\u2019t fucking give me the guilt trip.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey literally had no clue what they were doing. And for some reason i just sat there and took it. Before the intervention they said that if I don\u2019t do it they won\u2019t hang out with me anymore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen here we are two days later and one of them tells me I\u2019m toxic and that she doesn\u2019t want to know me anymore. UH OKAY. So fucking traumatize me, berate me, make me feel worthless, then bail out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOkay. Gotcha.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo here I am now, picking up the fucking pieces. Glad there was a point to all of this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh, and my boyfriend told me he didn\u2019t love me anymore last week. By text. While I was working.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI seriously have never felt more worthless in my life. I feel like an absolutely waste of space. I\u2019m obviously \u201ctoo much\u201d for people that they want to get away from me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt\u2019s been a hell of a week and my mental state is much worse than it was before Friday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIm struggling harder with food right now than I have in a long time. Between my boyfriend dumping me, my friends abandoning me because I won\u2019t listen to their uninformed advice, and my job sucking, I\u2019m not doing a very successful job at staying healthy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI WILL say that through this whole month, I haven\u2019t caved and self harmed. It\u2019s been almost 4 years since I last did it, and apparently men or shorty friends won\u2019t bring me down that far!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, this was a pointless post, and I\u2019m sorry. But I figured you all might know how I\u2019m feeling and may have some solid advice or words for me. Have any of you all been given an \u201cintervention\u201d before? How did you handle it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere\u2019s no tl;dr for this post. Sorry.",

The fact that it\u2019s in my head makes it difficult to treat bc you have to completely change your perspective/outlook on life. So I feel you on your friends not being supportive or helpful.

I came home to find my parents, aunts, and a pastor waiting for me... completely bombarded. It only made me pull away from them more. So, know that your feelings of anger are completely valid. \n\nI can sit here and say to go speak to someone about your suicidal thoughts; but ultimately: you need to make the choice to hang around this planet yourself. Life is HARD and it\u2019s SO much harder with a cocktail of mental illnesses. I am anorexic (recovered but still struggle time to time), have major depression, anxiety, and body dysmorphic disorder. While I cannot understand your own cocktail, I do get how they all bounce off one another and when you feel like you finally have a handle on one disorder, another decides to be a reallll asshat. \n\nI know how lonely it can get when people just don\u2019t understand; when they sit there and say to get help, look at the big picture, see the sun between the shitty clouds. Here, on this forum, know that you are not alone.  PM me if you need to vent! You are surrounded by some sucky people BUT that does not mean that you suck. Your situation sucks. Really, really sucks. It takes a lot to get through things like this, but it is possible. Look at how long you\u2019ve gone without self harm! That is HUGE! I am ten years from the last time I engaged in self-harm, so I know how much of an accomplishment that is for you. I also know that when things are spiraling, when people suck, when nothing feels like it\u2019s in your control, food can be controlled...so we control it. It\u2019s not as simple as, \u201cjust eat!\u201d Try: just being kind to yourself. Reach out to your therapist to let him/her know what\u2019s going o, and tackle each day as it comes; nothing more, nothing less. ",

I can only hope at least one of these \u2018friends\u2019 of yours gets a clue some time in the future, thinks back on this and realises just how awful, damaging and accusatory their actions were. To me it almost sounds as though this was a bunch of people who\u2019s only experience of interventions is what they\u2019ve seen on TV, and actually got excited about running one themselves because it was their chance to pretend they\u2019re in a fucking movie. As horrifically traumatic as this sounds, you can take comfort in the fact that you have been mentally strong enough to identify that what THEY were doing is what\u2019s wrong here, and know that you were not the problem. That shows a huge amount of mental resilience and healthy thought patterns on your part! You\u2019re already handling this incident in a healthy way by correctly identifying that!\n\nNot that this is at all comparable to what you just went to, but in answer to your second question of if anybody else has experienced something similar, I can relate on a small level. I recently told my best friend of 12 years about my ED. We text and email every day, spend hours on the phone together, used to live together, and now when we\u2019re in the same country we usually just end up sleeping in each other\u2019s beds. We\u2019re close AF. I finally got up the courage to talk to her about it this Christmas, and her reaction was...not what I had hoped. She was horrified. She got really angry at me for not telling her sooner. She saw it as me lying to her. She told me I have to stop and when I tried to explain that it\u2019s not really that simple, she just didn\u2019t get it, or really make any attempt to. She brought up one of my massive pain points/guilt sources - that I\u2019m 30 and this is a disease that primarily affects teenagers, and more or less told me to grow up. She didn\u2019t ask me any questions or seem to want to talk about it at all. Since then, she\u2019s not once brought it up or asked me how I\u2019m doing. It\u2019s like she\u2019s pretending I never told her and that the issue doesn\u2019t exist. I\u2019m kind of crushed. This is the reason I never tell anybody I\u2019m close to about this. It\u2019s a very complex issue that\u2019s shocking to people, and they find it hard to deal with. Often that leads to them reacting in very damaging ways.\n\nSo I do totally identify with what you went through, although I\u2019m very aware that the two situations are not at all comparable. Thinking of you, and as I said I hope at least one of your friends comes to their senses and offers you an apology, at the bare minimum.",

      "body": "Hi dear! I just want to start off that I don\u2019t like this incorrect use of \u201cintervention\u201d to describe what is really an attack. My close friend who struggles with depression was recently trapped in a so-called \u201cintervention\u201d by her old friends who berated her because they didn\u2019t agree with her life choices. This is absolutely NOT supportive or helpful, which a true intervention should be. These \u201cfriends\u201d used the guise of an intervention to vent about their anger directly at you in an antagonistic, selfish way. You said it yourself: they are NOT medical professionals, they have NOT reached out to you to talk first, and this fake intervention was in their self-interest not yours. Please continue to confide in your therapist and keep seeking true, professional help. And never be afraid to continue coming here and venting. We are all here to support each other through our very similar struggles.\n\nI know life feels like it\u2019s crushing you right now, but I absolutely positively promise you that if you keep making the push to get better, you will find happiness elsewhere. Though I didn\u2019t go through the same situations you have, I spent my high school years and earlier than that feeling as if there was nothing to live for. I didn\u2019t desire to live or eat for the matter. It\u2019s been a long and heavy battle but I\u2019m still here and I\u2019m happier than ever even when dealing with some issues here and there. I\u2019m so happy I am where I\u2019m at today. But I would not be here if I didn\u2019t grit my teeth through the pain of life and keep pushing forward. I know you can do the same. I have so much faith in you, and I need you to find that faith in yourself. You ARE worth it. You ARE loved. And you are STRONG, even when you feel weakest.\n\nLeave the people behind who are only trying to drag you back. Keep moving forward and you\u2019ll find people on the same path who will help you keep moving ahead. I know this is a long post. I just needed to tell you that even though I don\u2019t know you, I am supporting you with all my heart. I know you can do this. Please please please don\u2019t give up on yourself. ",

Life is HARD and it\u2019s SO much harder with a cocktail of mental illnesses. I am anorexic (recovered but still struggle time to time), have major depression, anxiety, and body dysmorphic disorder.

Here, on this forum, know that you are not alone.  PM me if you need to vent! You are surrounded by some sucky people BUT that does not mean that you suck. Your situation sucks. Really, really sucks. It takes a lot to get through things like this, but it is possible. Look at how long you\u2019ve gone without self harm! That is HUGE! I am ten years from the last time I engaged in self-harm, so I know how much of an accomplishment that is for you. I also know that when things are spiraling, when people suck, when nothing feels like it\u2019s in your control, food can be controlled...so we control it. It\u2019s not as simple as, \u201cjust eat!\u201d Try: just being kind to yourself.

This is absolutely NOT supportive or helpful, which a true intervention should be. These \u201cfriends\u201d used the guise of an intervention to vent about their anger directly at you in an antagonistic, selfish way. You said it yourself: they are NOT medical professionals, they have NOT reached out to you to talk first, and this fake intervention was in their self-interest not yours. Please continue to confide in your therapist and keep seeking true, professional help. And never be afraid to continue coming here and venting. We are all here to support each other through our very similar struggles.\n\nI know life feels like it\u2019s crushing you right now, but I absolutely positively promise you that if you keep making the push to get better, you will find happiness elsewhere. Though I didn\u2019t go through the same situations you have, I spent my high school years and earlier than that feeling as if there was nothing to live for. I didn\u2019t desire to live or eat for the matter. It\u2019s been a long and heavy battle but I\u2019m still here and I\u2019m happier than ever even when dealing with some issues here and there.

I have so much faith in you, and I need you to find that faith in yourself. You ARE worth it. You ARE loved. And you are STRONG, even when you feel weakest.\n\nLeave the people behind who are only trying to drag you back.

I just needed to tell you that even though I don\u2019t know you, I am supporting you with all my heart. I know you can do this. Please please please don\u2019t give up on yourself. ",

They actually traumatized you because they were bullying and ganging up on you.  That is never OK!  \n\nSounds to me like THEY are the toxic ones.  I am mad at your friends for you.  Totally uncalled for.  \n\n",
