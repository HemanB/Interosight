  "selftext": "I\u2019ve posted here a couple of times. But during quarantine and this pandemic it\u2019s been hard. I haven\u2019t been able to see my therapist since March. I find myself going to my medical chart and seeing the weight that I was at last year compared to this year. And it makes me feel super shitty. I always CONSTANTLY feel my stomach/look at it so much people probably think that I\u2019m pregnant. I\u2019ve been told that you ships the be gaining this much weight in recovery. My bf thinks I\u2019m fine. My gym has just reopened so I hope that helps. But I always find myself feeling my stomach, comparing, and ALWAYS ask my mom/bf \u201cam I gross for eating this? Is it bad that I just ate this? I drink diet soda every day is that bad?\u201d My mom doesn\u2019t know that I have an ED, but she might have a clue. I don\u2019t know. I wish I had this under control. We\u2019re not allowed to discuss numbers in this thread which is fine but...I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just at a loss.",

      "body": "Hi there, everything you\u2019re experiencing is super normal and challenging so be patient  and kind with yourself. I highly recommend the food psych podcast and the book called Intuitive Eating by Evelyn Tribole and Elise Resch. Intuitive eating is the only way to make peace with food and your body. I would set a personal goal to stop weighting yourself, stop checking your chart, and body checking. When you feel the urge, remind yourself that you\u2019re worthy regardless of your size and you\u2019re committed to your recovery! \nI follow a bunch of fat positive models and influencers on Instagram and it really helps with the fear of weight gain. You do not need to weight yourself, I literally haven\u2019t weighed myself in years since starting recovery and ask the Drs to not tell me/show me when I get weighed. \nDo you think your mom would be compassionate, understanding, supportive if she knew? If so, Maybe try telling her. Openly discussing being in recovery and expressing your emotions can really help. Sending love and support!!!\ud83e\udd70",

      "body": "Hi, I was diagnosed with an eating disorder in 2015, I did groups, therapy, inpatient and outpatient. For the time that I was inpatient, I had a nutritionist at the hospital who made our meal plans based on our weights and BMI, etc. And gaining weight is normal, it\u2019s usually more water weight than anything else and it will go to your stomach first! It\u2019s also bloating, so I get it might feel big or stiff but don\u2019t worry it\u2019s mostly water and because your body isn\u2019t too used to eating a lot/ or holding onto food! I still struggle everyday some worse than others, but will get better:) your stomach tends to hold on to the most because it has to protect internal organs :) so it uses fat to cushion all those areas to keep us safe, I\u2019m still myself trying to grasp that fat is good and not always bad and we keep a good healthy amount to protect our bodies and everything inside. So if that helps to look at it in a better light. I don\u2019t want to name what eating disorders I\u2019ve had/ have because I\u2019m new to the sub and don\u2019t want to trigger anyone, but adjusting to a healthy body and seeing it change after we\u2019ve deprived it is the hardest, it\u2019s usually the last thing we have to tackle mentally after going into recovery because it can be the hardest and longest battle. It\u2019s normal to be scared and feel like a failure for gaining weight I sure as heck did. I still have days we\u2019re I feel \u201cbig\u201d even though I am not at all it\u2019s just my body dysmorphia, that\u2019s probably what you feel also and why you can\u2019t stop feeling your stomach, try and do some things that keep your mind and hands busy and maybe that will help a bit! My dms are open \u2764\ufe0f",
