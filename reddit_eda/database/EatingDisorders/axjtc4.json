  "title": "Request: want to be healthy, but I feel as though a darker part of my mind doesn\u2019t care about being healthy",
  "selftext": " \n\nNot going to lie \u2014 the past few months have been rough. Around 5-6ish months ago, I began to restrict my calories to a very small amount. I'm thin, but not technically underweight according to BMI. However, during that span of time I lost my period & underwent multiple other side effects.\n\nThis slowly morphed into a binge/restrict cycle, where I'd reduce my intake even more to try and recover from the binges I\u2019d have throughout the week. This has been happening for a while now (about 3 months).\n\nI\u2019m sick and tired of it. I hate living my life like this. I avoid events with food as much as possible, and usually decline my friends\u2019 offers to hang out because it\u2019s my \u201cstarvation\u201d day to make up for a binge.\n\nI\u2019m heavier than my lowest of few months ago, but still in the lower end of normal BMI . I feel disgusting, and I hate it, but I know I need to break out of this cycle.\n\nHonestly, I struggle with how much I\u2019m supposed to eat in a day. I generally believed that the low number of calories I ate was enough for me. I\u2019m 15, 5\u20191, and am currently in track. I try those online \u201ccalorie calculators\u201d but all of them give me vastly different amounts, all much higher than what I'm eating.\n\nNot only this, but to anyone who\u2019s been through something similar: how do you stay motivated? Is there any advice you can give me to help me power through this? I really, really want this to end. I want to have a normal relationship with food. I\u2019m sick and tired of this.\n\nI\u2019m just so terrified of gaining weight. I used to be heavier \u2026 towards the upper end of the normal BMI range, and can\u2019t imagine ever going back to that point. I want to be healthy, but I feel as though a darker part of my mind doesn\u2019t care about being healthy and just wants to be thin.\n\nI\u2019ve never told anyone about this, and this seemed like a good place to let my heart out and open up. Thank you for taking the time to read this. :) I\u2019m not sure if anyone would be interested or if it mattered at all, but I\u2019m thinking about posting my progress here in order to hold myself accountable. I really hope I can power through this and stop this miserable fucking cycle.",

      "body": "I'm noticing a common theme when I speak to people with disordered eating. I struggled with a binge eating disorder very similar to yours where I would restrict and then binge. I feel like we've been programmed to think certain foods are healthy and other foods are not. I've actually found that if I go against this programming and eat foods like butter, eggs, bacon, and red meat, I become satiated on less calories and have absolutely no desire to binge. A lot of your food that you listed is high in carbohydrate, you occasionally eat a little bit of protein but without the animal fat you are unable to derive proper nutrition. I'm guessing the chicken that you eat is usually boneless skinless chicken breast not cooked in very much fat. Honestly I think chicken is relatively inferior as far as meat goes, not to mention most chickens in Western industrialized societies are not raised in the most Humane conditions. Beef, especially grass-finished beef if you can find it has a much higher quality of life and their meat yields a higher nutritional value. I would also recommend looking into purchasing lard or tallow. You can find very high quality lard and Tallow online for relatively cheap for a large amount. Also look into the benefits of eating nose to tail, which means eating something other than muscle meat, such as organs like liver. I know it sounds kind of crazy but this is the only thing that works for me. It also helped me with other issues such as insomnia, anxiety, and depression.",

Not very happy with myself but I\u2019m hoping to get better.\n\nOn \u201cregular\u201d days where I try to \u201crecover\u201d from this cycle, I have Oatmeal/banana for breakfast, maybe some cottage cheese for lunch, and a sweet potato and maybe chicken for dinner. I\u2019m basically eating the same thing I do on restriction days, only I up the portion sizes. However, if I\u2019m being honest with myself, I doubt it totals to my maintenance calories. \n\nFor the most part, with the amount I\u2019ve been binging, normally it\u2019s either junk or nothing.
