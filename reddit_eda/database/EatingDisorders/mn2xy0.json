  "title": "Request: Do I have an eating disorder?",
  "selftext": "Hi, I\u2019m a 15 year old male and I\u2019m slightly overweight. I\u2019ve been struggling hard with my body image and I can\u2019t even stand to look at myself in the mirror. A few months ago, I decided I wanted to start my journey to weight loss. I\u2019ve lost weight but I still hate my body. In the past week, I\u2019ve struggled to eat. Every time it\u2019s time for me to eat I feel like crying and throwing up. I skip breakfast and lunch and don\u2019t eat until dinner. I\u2019ve been consuming half the amount of recommend calories in the past week and I feel physically exhausted. I just want to eat without feeling the guilt and self hatred. Can someone help me?",

      "body": "Hey man, what you're describing sounds really worrying. It is really good that you are recognising what is going on and reaching out. Your problems are definitely real and you deserve support. The earlier you get help for this the better, so you can work on your self-esteem, body image and other issues you may have and which might play into this. Working with a dietician could also help you make a meal plan that is right for you, and help you recognise appropriate portion sizes as well as hunger and fullness, so you can ideally work your way to a healthy and intuitive way of eating.\nBut you need to get a therapist. Eating disorders don't discriminate between genders, weight or body or size and if you're struggling you're valid.\nHave you ever talked to someone in your life about this?",

Your brain will gaslight you and tell you you\u2019re overreacting. You\u2019re not. I\u2019m 20 and I\u2019ve been doing this shit for 7 years now. It doesn\u2019t ever just go away on its own and the longer you wait the harder it is to get out of. Please please please seek help of some kind.  Because youre male people might try to dismiss your concerns. Don\u2019t let them. They\u2019re wrong. Your struggle is never invalid because of ignorant people.

This things have helped me, but they never replace profesional assistance.\n\nIve been trough what you describe and i want to tell you i undestand exactly how you feel. I need you to know that not being perfectly skinny or fit will not get you what you really want. Sound obvious, but for me being skinny meant acceptance and validation. And to some point, it did work. But there was nothing after that. The people that just accepted you bc you lost weight dont really care about who you are, how much of a good friend or date you can be. \n\nSo please open your eyes and try to see yourself from outside. Im sure you have so much to offer to the world, whether that is kindness, talent, loyalty or a million other things. You are enough no matter the number. You are valuable allways. \n\nPlease take care and message me if you feel like talking.",

      "body": "I've had an eating disorder since I was a kid, but only had it diagnosed this year. The best advice I can give you is to eat as many whole foods as possible and it's better to eat more for breakfast or lunch than later. A bigger, 600+ calorie, planned breakfast is better than an impulsive, 1000+ snack in the evening. Your body is telling you to eat more for a reason. Nip it in the bud before you're 25 and need to go to a clinic for months",

I destroyed my body for years and was in denial. Take the silver I hope it cheers you up. I want you to know there are always people who love you and are willing to help you. It was hard opening up, and at first I got laughed at and dismissed. But eventually they saw how horrible it was, and now I\u2019m getting the help I need. You are never alone. If you feel alone and helpless, come to this sub. Believe me  everyone here is nice and willing to help. Sorry for long rant. It might be really hard, but try and have a nice day \ud83d\udc4d.",
