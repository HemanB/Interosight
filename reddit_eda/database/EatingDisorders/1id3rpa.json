  "title": "my best friend and I are in some kind of anorexia competition",
  "selftext": "So, for some backstory, my best friend and I are both girls and 15 years old. We became friends in 7th grade and we are now in 9th. She has been struggling with an eating disorder since like 6th grade, but I haven't. I just recently feel sick. I\u2019m not diagnosed so I know I\u2019m not valid, but my best friend knows I've been kind of struggling for a while. The thing is, while she said she 'doesn't want me to fall into that trap' it's like she's always subtly competing with me about who is more sick. She is into forced recovery and I\u2019m not even noticeably sick, no one really knows how I struggle. Most of the things she talks about 24/7, is literally consequences of her ED. She complains allll day about how cold she is, how she has frostbites, how she had bald spots, and talks to anyone that will listen about them. It's like she wants attention so bad, except from her parents that are trying to help her recover. I know for a fact that she eats a fulfilling breakfast every day, but then at school she's acting all dizzy and shit, and when the teachers ask her if she has eaten anything, she'll say no. just for them to be worried. whenever I say I\u2019m cold or anything like that, she always doubles down on me trying to act like she has it worse. she's showing me her frostbites at least 7 times a day and keeps bringing up every single consequence of an ED that apparently she has in a 'you could never struggle like me' manner, and I feel like she knows that I know its a side effect of anorexia. am I just delusional and the competence is one-sided or what?

      "body": "It sounds as though she is trying to validate her own symptoms because she doesn't want to be in recovery. It may not be that she's competing, but repeating how she is feeling so that her own mind feels satisfied that she is still 'sick enough' \n\nAlternatively, she could be competing with you, that's something that is very common with eating disorders, they force you to compare to others. It can often come across as obnoxious or attention seeking \n\nHer being ill doesn't invalidate or dismiss you. \nYOU DO NOT HAVE TO LOOK SICK OR BE A CERTIAN WEIGHT TO BE ILL. please please remember that! You are sick at any weight, or stage of eating disorder, diagnosed or not. \n\nYou could let her know that the constant 'im this and you're not' 'youll never be like me' is actually just rude.\n Not the best advice but you could say that if she continues to be so flippant about recovery, that you'll take your concerns to her parents, because it's also not fair to them to be putting in the effort to help her and she's lying to them too. I'm only suggesting this because you're young enough that parents can make medical decisions",

I know i know, saying this wont help you recover, but the AN unicorn mindset is real and she might've meant not wanting you to suffer like her, whilst your deadly illness interpreted it like \"i'm sicker than you\".",

And you both do trigger each other. AN is capable of driving you two far from each other. Also OP, you seem to be more introvert and therefore it\u2019s possible you struggle in silence more than your friend. But please realise that AN is very mean and takes over our thoughts. It\u2019s destructive in every way. \n\nI\u2019m somewhat older and back in the days when my ED started, the doctor told me to not talk about it with the other girl who had this ED too. Because, as he said, the symptoms will be stronger when having ED related conversations. \n\nThis is what I mean by the statement you both need help if you want to stay friends. Try to talk to coaches, teachers, therapists, parents, doctors, just someone who can help you with this. You\u2019re both so young and I know from when I had your age, in hindsight I know I couldn\u2019t oversee all those consequences. And help from grown ups was very much needed. \n\nI hope you\u2019ll recover both. I hope and wish that you both will grow into happy and joyful women. Bless you both\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f",
