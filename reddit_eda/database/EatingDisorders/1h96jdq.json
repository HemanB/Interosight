Anorexia is a REAL mental disorder.\n\nStereotyping. I hate those stersotypes the most. What about you?",

I am actually afraid of high volume foods so I'd rather eat something small and calories than a lot of a low calorie food.",

      "body": "\u2022 People with eating disorder are all underweight and you can see who has it because of this\n             > No. One can be in their \u2018ideal\u2019 weight or be \u2018overweight\u2019 and still be struggling with eating disorder. BMI and scale don\u2019t matter in these situations as much as the habits and behaviors around eating and food overall. Of course those things do play a part in some cases and some professionals makes those things be the most relevant thing when talking about Ed but the fact is that those aren\u2019t the things to be focused on.\n\n\n\u2022 Only teenage girls have eating disorders\n             > yeah and cows are only source for getting milk to drink. (sarcasm obviously). You can be any age and gender & have Ed. \n\n\n\u2022 People with ed hates food and doesn\u2019t eat anything anytime.          \n              > We\u2019d all be dead if this were true. There are many thoughts behind everyone\u2019s head, we can\u2019t know for sure what someone is thinking. In my case I love food - especially GOOD food (taste, not as some foods being bad or good). I am just hating myself and feeling guilty when eating, like I don\u2019t deserve to eat if I haven\u2019t done something to eat. Of course people have to eat to stay alive, but some people eat so little they possibly can and restrict themselves to cope - even though this isn\u2019t them, it\u2019s Ed speaking.\n\n\n\u2022 Only eating healthy and \u2018good\u2019 foods.\n            > Again, we are different. But this is something I often hear when people speak about eating disorders and that\u2019s just not true. For me it\u2019s easier to eat something that has more calories in and is smaller size than eating something with lower calories and sizing up my plate size. If I do eat more of a \u2018normal\u2019 sized meal with less calories, it gives me huge amounts of anxiety and guilt because I have eaten more than usually BUT I get hungry more quickly.\n\n\n\u2022 Not eating and losing weight just to get attention.\n          > I don\u2019t have enough words in my knowledge to express how wrong this is - again not all are the same. I would have been so much happier if people wouldn\u2019t have started commenting and noticing my weight loss. For me this Ed behavior lifted up its head when I had hard and stressful times in my life & I started to feel that this is the way for me to control my life (oh how wrong can one be). Now when I am seeing psychologist etc and trying to get better from Ed, I am thankful that my psychologist noticed my weight loss and other symptoms because of her I realized how badly I need help & I am not doing what\u2019s best for me and my health. But at first when she had counted 1+1\u2026 I felt irritated, anxious, mad and like a failure. Was scared that now they are going to take away this one thing from me that I am good at. Gladly my psychologist has been able to open my eyes and make me understand so many things that I wouldn\u2019t have been able to see without help.\n\n\n\u2022 When looking at the mirror, always seeing themselves as overweighted and nothing else.\n         > this one is hard for me, because it\u2019s kind of 50-50 situation. I am able to see and understand that I have lost weight - a lot and in a short period of time. But I am not and haven\u2019t been underweight at any point - and I didn\u2019t get to \u2018go to my goal weight\u2019- before psychologist noticed my situation so I have the feeling of being a failure because of this. At the same time I do see that I am \u2018normal\u2019 looking, but because I have been gaining a weight back a little now (it\u2019s a good thing for sure!) I feel like I don\u2019t look as good as I did before. Mirrors are huge enemy of mine, now that I don\u2019t jump in the scale all the time - but then I don\u2019t want to put mirrors away because I\u2019d like to think that it\u2019s important for me to learn to love myself and the way I am.\n\n\n\u2022 Anyone with eating disorder should just eat normally and not make such a big deal of it.\n         > if I could, I would. If it would be that simple, there probably wouldn\u2019t be eating disorders.\n\n\n\u2022 Once you get better, you\u2019re fixed and that\u2019s the end of that story.\n         > IF OBLY THIS WERE TRUE!! But no. I believe this is and will be life long journey, the thoughts and habits might try to lift their head up later in life if there is some harder situations going on etc. We can try and will learn to see the difference between our thoughts and Ed\u2019s thoughts & work on listening ourselves and loving our bodies and so on. But I don\u2019t believe in the theory that I could get rid of Ed for good. I believe it can be in some kind of box in my head and sometimes yells louder and other times I don\u2019t even remember that box exists.\n\n\n\u2022 Being able to work/see friends/attend parties or smth like these means that you can\u2019t be that sick or you don\u2019t need help. \n           > just no. For me, being active and seeing people was my way of trying to prove even myself that I am doing okay, even though I was able only to lay in bed or sleep after getting home because I was too exhausted.\n\n\n\u2022 Eating around people means that you\u2019re just faking to be sick.\n           > I hate people sometimes. No. I can\u2019t stand eating around people, it is overwhelming and exhausting & the anxiety levels are so high up, but at least around the right people/situation; it\u2019s somehow easier to eat, even though it is stressing tf out of me. But because others are eating, it\u2019s more natural for me to eat - being at home alone is maybe less stressful when eating but the guilt is bigger & harder to start eating when at home alone.",

One study the MRI images showed that women with bulimia had decreased blood flow in a part of the brain called the precuneus while viewing food images after completing the stressful math problems, whereas blood flow significantly increased in that part of the brain among women without bulimia. The\u00a0[precuneus is\u00a0](http://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/precuneus)associated with self-perception and memory. There's also a huge genetic component, eating disorders run in families. Now researchers have found two genes that help determine the risk of acquiring the disease. The results suggest that variations in genes involved in mood and appetite can put women at risk for anorexia. \n\nI was even under the impression the first ten years I had ED that it was just because I wanted to be thin for appearances. BUt then I realized I was engaging in behavior to relieve a bad mood or fight I got in, also was doing it when I wasn't looking for a partner at all was way too busy with work and school, so why did I care if I gained a 5pounds (as I never gained a lot of weight when I stopped doing it). \n\nAfter inpatient treatment I saw that it was a negative coping mechanism, a way to deal with trauma even plus the vulnerability of my genes and brain. Plus, PROZAC worked! If it wasn't a mental issue, then why would taking 40 mg of Prozac a day stop me from binge/purge episodes?",

People don't know anything about eating disorders, and don't realize that they are a complex network of deep-rooted psychological problems, with the physical behaviours only being the tip of the iceberg. \n\nNot all eating disorder are restrictive, and even for the ones that are they're not all body image based. And even for the restrictive EDs that are body-imaged based, it's not always about not wanting to be fat. It can simply be wanting an observable way to measure how much control you have, can be making yourself thin as an act of self-harm, can be making yourself look as sick as you feel on the inside, can be because of sexual trauma, can be because of gender dysphoria, etc. And even for the ones that are about not wanting to be fat, in the majority of cases the person only holds that belief for themselves and not anyone else. \n\nWe live in a society where needing to \"you lose weight and not be fat or else you're worthless\" is plastered everywhere, it's not your fault if you end up internalizing it. In fact, a lot of people with those kinds of eating disorders were overweight themselves at some point, and that's where it started. It's insane to me that people consider those with body image based eating disorders to be the perpetrators of diet culture, and not some of the most obvious victims to it.",

I'm attracted to fat people. I LOVE big women especially. But the world taught me a lesson pretty early on, that the majority of people are not like me... \n\nBecause when I was overweight I was bullied. I was always reminded how I'd be more attractive if I lost weight, girls in my class were always bragging about their restrictive diets and how much weight they'd lost, which size clothes they can fit. When I lost weight (not by choice, but by not eating for weeks because of anxiety) people started to notice me. They were nicer, kinder. All the girls wanted to know \"my secret\", all the boys who previously bullied me suddenly wanted to fuck me. It was addictive. I'm here now so you can guess how it turned out...",

They aren't nice about me being skinny ish but in my mind, that something to be happy ish about! That's how it sort of started. People kept saying, \" You're too fat. You need to be thinner.\" or \" Go diet or restrict it will do you some good\", well I've done it, but they still aren't happy",
