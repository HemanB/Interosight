  "title": "Request: Class documentary while currently struggling with an eating disorder",
  "selftext": "I am a 23 year old college student currently taking an online developmental psych class. Right now we are on a unit of eating disorders. As a psychology major I KNOW I will have to learn about this and do the assignments. But right now the next thing due is a notes sheet on a documentary about eating disorders. Just in the first 5 minutes I couldn\u2019t handle it and had to turn it off due to how triggering it was for me. Would it be appropriate to ask my professor for a different assignment/explain why I am mentally not well enough to do this assignment right now? Or is that too personal and I should just take the 0? It\u2019s only 20 points so it\u2019s not too weighted into my overall grade but I pride myself on doing my hardest to achieve good grades. I\u2019m unsure of what to do. Any advice?",

Before we got onto the topic my tutor explained that if any content was distressing/triggering etc to contact her to arrange an alternative way to learn the content. She worked with me throughout the semester for the topics and supported me with the option to research a different topic for the same assessment task so maybe try contacting your professor to see what they can do! \nnot sure if this may help but personally for me I found that a lot of the videos were triggering for me however reading the information on a screen and reading research studies etc was a lot easier to absorb the content! best of luck and I send my love xx",

I emailed the instructor and she was super understanding and just gave me an alternate assignment to do. Def talk to your prof if you feel comfortable- eating disorders are really widespread on college campuses so it likely won't be the first time they've gotten this request.",
