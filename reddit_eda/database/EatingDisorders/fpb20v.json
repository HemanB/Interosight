  "selftext": "Hi \n\naround 4 years ago I had an eating disorder where I lost weight very rapidly within the space of about 6 months but although this seems like a long time ago now and I\u2019m at an healthy weight, my body is not the same as it was pre eating disorder and I\u2019m more self conscious (I\u2019m stuck at a lower weight than before it happened). I\u2019ve been having loads of regretful thoughts lately about how I may have almost messed up my puberty and should\u2019ve just appreciated the body that I had back then because there was nothing wrong with it. But don\u2019t feel like I can talk to anyone because on the outside my body \u201clooks\u201d fine but inside my head I regret the damage done and scared it\u2019s permanent.\n\nSo have I ruined everything forever (I.e. puberty and the body I had back then)? Does anyone have any thoughts/tips? Thank you.",

So you can\u2019t build bone after that point, but if you\u2019re still in that age range you may restore some lost bone density. Generally speaking weight restoration is considered restoring to your pre-ED biologically accurate weight. Since you were so young when yours started, wed want to look at where you were on your growth curve (%ile weight, %ile BMI) to get an idea of what full restoration weight would be. It can be hard to get over a hump with weight, but the struggle may be due to lacking appetite cues which don\u2019t tend to come back fully until you\u2019ve been eating adequately for some time. \n\nAs far as menstruation that\u2019s fantastic you got your period back and definitely a good sign! It is possible to have a period and still be under biologically accurate weight, but I\u2019m not sure if this is what\u2019s going on for you. It\u2019s hard for me to judge what might be going on without doing a full assessment. You may have your doctor test your estradiol (estrogen) levels to make sure they\u2019ve returned to normal range - if not that will at least give you some idea that you might need to restore further. It\u2019s okay to take time to do so though - recovery is a journey not a marathon!",
