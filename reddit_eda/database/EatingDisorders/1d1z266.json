  "selftext": "I'm actually not sure how far into recovery I am, but suddently I started feeling better about myself than in years.\n\nI have had severe body dysmorphia for the most of my life. I have tried so many ways on getting my weight down. Nothing ever makes me happy with myself and no matter how many friends I had I was still unhappy with my body.\n\nRecently however I decided to drop a friendgroup I felt bad in. I was really alone for a while and going through some really rough times because of that but after I regained my hold on life everything just kind of flipped for me.\n\nI was still somewhat lonely but for the first time ever I actually did something for myself without thinking what others would think about it. I feel like that improved my love for myself because for once instead of doing what makes others happy I did what makes me happy.\n\nRight then I decided to stop fasting (which I had been doing a lot for a long time at that point) and just decided to eat however I want and food that I enjoy. I started liking how clothes look on me and it didn't bother me as much to see a little tummy.\n\nCurrently I'm two months off fasting and I haven't weighed myself once. I still see content recommending ways to lose weight but now I just skip it because I know it isn't good for me.\n\nI still feel somewhat lonely and I'm still trying to gain new friends around me but overall I feel better about myself than in such a long time and it makes me really happy.\n\nAlso if there is something wrong with this post I'm really sorry it's my first time in this community and I just wanted to share this somewhere because it feel so big to me:)",
