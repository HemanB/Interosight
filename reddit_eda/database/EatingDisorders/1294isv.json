  "selftext": "Last fall after not having a primary doctor for years I got told I\u2019m overweight and prediabetic. That hit me hard so I was determined to make changes. I became active, stopped snacking and ate 3 balanced meals a day. I lost more than half of what I needed to by November and was feeling great\u2026until the holidays. Thanksgiving day I was getting compliments about my weightloss from family. I told myself just wait till they see you lose that last couple of pounds. Those comments led me to restrict that thanksgiving dinner. After everyone left though I binged. I felt sick and ashamed and I wanted this disgusting food out of me. I googled what I should do after overeating and landed on a YouTube video were there was a random comment about laxatives and puking. I had no time to get laxatives so I tried puking. It felt so nasty and I cried myself to sleep saying I will never do that again. Next morning I woke up and liked the feeling of not feeling bloated. I stepped on the scale and it didn\u2019t move. I started thinking if I had added a laxative I probably would have felt even better. That was the beginning to the issues I suffer now. I take laxatives daily and puke on the weekends when I binge. I\u2019m still active and still keep my balanced diet on the weekdays. I\u2019ve lost the last couple of pounds and some but I feel I\u2019ve lost myself as well. Doctor being impressed with my labs and weightloss and the congratulations I get from people on losing weight has had me keeping these unhealthy ways. I would feel so embarrassed admitting this to a doctor for help because even in society eating disorders are looked at as a teen/young adult issue. Maybe writing this post to a bunch of strangers is a step to help me into a healthy path.",

It really takes a toll on your body and mind and the longer you are in it the harder it is to get out. I can\u2019t tell you how many moments in life my ED has controlled and I have missed out. So much time I can never get back. It\u2019s so hard when people make assumptions on outer appearance instead of checking in on how you are otherwise. Weight loss does not equate wellness or happiness for many people. I would strongly encourage you to see an intuitive eating dietician and a therapist and doctor that have good experience with treating ED. Those pounds are not worth the suffering and isolation that comes with them. Best of luck darling \u2764\ufe0f",

I've seen several specialists for various reasons, some related to complications of my ED, some not, but I've come to realize that specialists stay in their lanes. They treat the condition, not the root cause, necessarily. Many of them also don't even know the first thing about EDs with regards to treatment, so even if they skim the surface, they don't really seem to know where to go beyond that. It was a really strange experience, in hindsight, because I was TERRIFIED of being \"accused\" of having an ED, but equally WANTED someone to say something.\n\nWhich unfortunately led to me having to straight up ask for help, myself. It was probably the scariest moment of my life, but I am so glad I did. \n\nDo you have coverage/assistance for therapy? Like extended health or anything? If so (or if you can afford it yourself!) I would do an extensive deep dive on therapists in your area (or who do remote counselling, like on zoom) who focus on EDs, read their reviews, google their name and see what others have to say. It's so important to find the right fit, and it took me three previous counsellors to find my current one, who is right for me. \n\nI would be more than happy to help in any way, if I can.
