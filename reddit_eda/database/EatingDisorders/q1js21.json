  "selftext": " \n\nI go to her for something else but she knows about my messed up relationship with food so every session we spend at least a small amount of time talking about it (she insisted on it so if she does care)to check up on me and make sure it doesn\u2019t get completely out of hand.\n\nDuring our last session she asked me how it was going and at some point I asked her if she thinks I have an Ed, and she responded that she thinks that it seems that it\u2019s still a hobby to me and that I just like spending time being busy with body image and calorie tracking and that an eating disorder becomes a disorder once you physically can\u2019t do things anymore like going to a school etc and also that I didn\u2019t look that unhealthy anyways and damn it really messed me up \ud83d\udc80.\n\nBefore she said that the amount of cals I consumed a day was already like toddler sized but now even that seems too much for me and I just don\u2019t want to eat anymore and start hating the feeling of food in my body. I already think I might have some type of b/p ana bc i am underweight now but I still binge and I already feel invalid and gross for binging but her comment straight up made it worse and now I just feel like I have to prove to her that I can get skinnier and that I can look unhealthy and part of my wants to tell her that her comment messed me up but at the same time i am just so uncomfortable talking about my struggles around food I just never want to talk about it with her again.\n\nOur next session is on Wednesday and i am for the most part wondering if she was right about the whole Ed thing and that maybe i am just overreacting and a \u201cwanarexic\u201d\ud83d\ude15Idk I just feel bad and was wondering if people here have advice for me.",

I have before too, and they also always made it worse with similar comments.",

No. I 10,000% recommend finding someone with real training and experience in EDs in your area who can do an intake or screening appt with you. It will be so much more validating, I promise. They won\u2019t downplay any of your struggles (unless they\u2019re shit at their job) because they are 100% real!  \nAlso- I really really really resonate with the wanting to prove to her that you do have a problem.  I\u2019ve been the exact same way. One of my therapists pointed out to me that it\u2019s basically because a need is not being met. From what I can tell from your post, it sounds like you feel like you\u2019re not being heard.  That therapist gave me a list of functions for an ED and you basically just checked off what you think your ED is there for. One of the ones I checked off I thought was so embarrassing and I didn\u2019t want to share it (I did bc I really trusted her). That function was attention. I was embarrassed by it bc I didn\u2019t want her to think that I was using it to be an \u201cattention whore\u201d or some other bad connotation of the word.  She assured me that that reason is completely understandable and valid and it\u2019s not fake. It means that I want people to listen to me and notice me and that need isnt being met.

Basically all I can think of is that meme \u201cyou wanna see some real speed??\u201d  You don\u2019t need to show her any real speed. You don\u2019t need to look a certain way or function a certain way for something to be real. If it\u2019s negatively interfering with your life and/or you have a concern about it, then that\u2019s valid enough. \nSorry this was a long ramble. I kinda just typed my brain train. I hope even one sentence of this was even a tiny bit helpful to you (or anyone else reading it). \nOh I forgot- as for advice with your therapist, just mentioned like \u201chey so the ED stuff is actually kinda bothering me\u201d and then maybe ask for a referral or something to an actual ED professional. And if you wanna try to ease the awkwardness, then you can be like I just wanna check to make sure and see what someone else has to say.  And if she\u2019s offended by that, then fire her (ok maybe not, but any good therapist would be totally ok with you wanting to seek more help and guidance). Then if you do talk to someone, you can talk to your therapist about it and have more of a discussion on the whole situation.",

I\u2019ve been in/out of therapy for years and often felt like I could never be honest about my ED. 1.5 years ago I started w/my now therapist who focuses largely on ED/Trauma & have been in recovery for a year. \n\nI only share my story out of hope, that your provider can make a major impact on your life, hopefully in a positive light, but your therapist (based on what little context we have) is doing the opposite. \n\nGood luck.

Therapists are not friends, you shouldn't feel the need to be careful to not upset them. Most of the therapists I've seen genuinely want to help, but remember that clear communication is key so being silent about how what they said hurt you is only going to impede their ability to help you. \n\nAlso you can find another therapist. It may not be easy depending on your situation, but it's usually doable. \n\n(also yeah she is wrong about your ED)",

I was obsessed with calorie counting and macros. Always having like 500g of protein a day. Had to keep single digit bodyfat. \n\nSo I went plant-based to help cut out a lot of foods so I wouldn't have to worry about them. I lost cravings because it was like a rule that erased them for me. I was also able to binge lower calorie foods like carrots, celery, low-calorie pastas whenever I needed to feel full. I also lost my fear of carbs and started having 500g+ a day.\n\nAnd over time my desire for binging has left and calorie counting OCD are seemingly gone. I had to convince myself of burnout though. I recommend it, just make sure you have iron and b12.\n\n\n I then became vegan for ethics. \nAutist are the best militant vegans haha. \nI'm still fucking miserable though.",

Therapists are like doctors\u2014there are some quacks out there who truly don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about or extend into areas they have no place being, and that is straight up malpractice in my opinion.

Little bits of good things each day can add up to a good day lol. \nI guess it depends on how much you trust you therapist, but if you really do, you can tell her that when she said x, you thought y.  When I first started seeing my current therapist, I know if she said anything that made me think bad thoughts, I probably wouldn\u2019t have told her (probably happened irl but I can\u2019t think of a specific instance). After seeing her for like 9-10 months, she had mentioned me possibly seeing a therapist outside of The Emily Program. I tried to hide my crying but she could still tell over zoom. She asked what I was thinking, and it was really hard for me to say, but I was like yo I feel like if I\u2019m not at TEP, then it\u2019ll be so easy for me to just fall back again and I opened up more about having some other thoughts that I had kinda been trying to hide or downplay (like calorie counting and fasting and stuff). That was about a year ago and I\u2019m still with her. We\u2019re at a point where if she says something and I feel a trigger, I can tell her right away. Like recently she brought up self weighing and I was like \u201cwell actually I hadn\u2019t even thought about that in awhile but now that you mention it, it sounds like a good idea \ud83e\udd2a\u201d she was like \u201cNo! No let\u2019s not do that.\u201d I thought it was hilarious tbh. But being able to say something right away definitely helped me not spiral thinking about it. That was like 2-3 weeks ago and I still haven\u2019t self weighed (yay me lol). So yeah, think about where you\u2019re at in your relationship with your therapist and how/if you want to approach bringing this up to her. You certainly don\u2019t have to, as I know it can be hella uncomfortable. But maybe it\u2019d help ease some of your thoughts. \nI know I\u2019ve found the ED comforting bc it gave me something I felt like I had control over in my chaotic life. And it made me feel like I could actually accomplish something and be \u201cgood\u201d at something. \nBut bruh I had an appointment yesterday and my therapist asked me what function my ED has for me now and was like why are we still holding onto it. I was like dude idk I just like it. So I definitely understand not knowing what need it\u2019s fulfilling, just that it\u2019s there and it\u2019s doing something lol. But it\u2019s ok, we\u2019ll both figure it out eventually \ud83d\ude0a",
