I also have autism so that was part of it, but mostly I just thought \"I have this one thing that always stays the same and if I can keep it that way then I'll be okay\". This did not go well when I hit puberty and I was still eating the same amount as I did in second grade. Eventually I realized something was wrong when I could see people in my school had more food than me, but by then I'd forgotten what being full felt like so I genuinely thought I just needed less food.\n\nAnd then in Junior year of high school I noticed my ribs were visibly poking through my skin, and got really freaked out because I knew it was bad but had been pretty in denial that something was wrong. I tried to fix it by myself, and it worked a little, I didn't get *worse*, but I wasn't getting much better.\n\nHonestly I didn't fully accept that I had an ED until I was calling a therapist to set up a consultation and I asked if he had experience working with eating disorders. I remember my voice shaking when I asked because I'd never said it out loud, I'd never told anyone in my life that I had a problem.\n\nI'm doing a lot better now, it's not nearly as bad as it used to me. I'm going back to therapy soon to help with some lingering problems with it but I'm eating normally now and I'm pretty happy with my life overall",

      "body": "For me it kind of happened slowly. I knew I had body image problems around 10/11/12/13 years old, despite being a perfectly normal thin healthy child and preadolescent. Thinking I was fat and comparing myself to the girls in school who were favored and happened to be skinnier than me (like super stick figure skinny, just built differently). I knew I had a tendency to eat my feelings and find comfort in food going forward from there...around age 16 I remember realizing I had developed a full blown binge eating problem when one night I was shoving fettuccini alfredo down my full-to-bursting couldn't-even-stand-up-anymore stomach, but still continued eating. Unhappy with the weight I was gaining, still never knowing what to do about it or even what a calorie was. I was so inattentive and ignorant and pathetic. I experienced some trauma around this time that really nailed the self esteem problem stuff into me for good. Then I got to college and 17/turning 18 I said \"I'm going to fix this\", learned about calories and weight loss, and started a diet that within just weeks turned into full blown crazy restriction anorexia and overexercising, and when people started telling me how extreme and all or none I was being with things, and the weight started falling off, then I really knew. I also was unable to see how much I had lost until I had lost 50 or so pounds in 4 or so months. Like even when 30 pounds had come off I couldn't see it, so knew I was dysmorphic. Went on for another few months until I cracked and fell into binge eating, but this time I learned how to purge. So, hello bulimia. Then I started planning binge/purge days once a month or so where I'd \"hit my goal weight, so that I can enjoy the day looking great in my skinny clothes, eat whatever i want, be around people, participate in fun, gain some binge/bloat weight back, lose it again, rinse repeat\"...I felt strong and high on control when I could control nothing else/never be \"great\" at anything else. And during one of the huge planned binge/purge episodes where I was just alone, sickly underweight in my car with hundreds of dollars worth of junk food that I bought with my parents' emergencies only credit card, throwing up into bags to make room for more, sobbing, alone, playing Christmas music on the radio to comfort me....yeah I knew I was in tremendous trouble. 18/19 at that time. Also being on proanorexia and foodporn livejournals (before Instagram and garbage, around 2008).\n\nI'm 34 now and a lot better in a lot of ways, but have also gotten worse in a lot of ways, on and off, recovery being very nonlinear and never fully recovered, even if I do much better with taking care of myself and maintaining a healthy enough weight, I will always be sick. I just...hope I never get that crazy sick again. It's a sad lonely path I put myself on. But I can't blame myself fully for creating it. Things impacted me hard growing up, and I have always been a slow/late bloomer (idk if I'll ever make it to bloom at all, honestly) and didn't grow up on the more normalized time table that most people around me seemed to. At some point I just stopped developing. And I've been stuck, for a very long time, unable to mature. In and out of all kinds of treatment centers and places and therapists and psychs with medications and alternative treatments and things. It's horrible. Not acting out with my ED behaviors right now but that just makes my dysmorphia and depression and anxiety even stronger. I just feel there is no winning this fight for me. Some people are stronger. Maybe I'm stronger than I think...time will continue to tell I guess.\n\nJesus I'm crying just writing this. What have I done to myself.",

I didn't want to feel like death anymore. Dying a slow death due to starvation is torturous, I didn't like it, I wanted to feel better therefore I had to *get* better.

I kept making myself throwing up on Christmas Day, because I kept eating and couldn\u2019t control it. I cried so much that night, because it was so difficult living like this. I finally realized after that day that I possibly had two ED\u2019s that were feeding off of one another.\n\n I told my therapist, and I was immediately started in outpatient ED therapy.
