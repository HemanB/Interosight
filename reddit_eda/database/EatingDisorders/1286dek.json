I know the physician and other experts at the ED program at a large renowned hospital say it typically is about 5 years of treatment but do suggest you can and will move beyond your ED. That said, your experiences are still part of you. This can actually eventually give you more strength having gone through the battle! The Dr who actually started the program in the days before programs existed has decades of experiences and reflects on how amazing those who have gone through ED recovery are. He notes how they are some of the strongest and most incredible people he knows now. Keep your hope alive. Better days ahead and know you can beat this ED! Don\u2019t go it alone though. Get help, seek support, be patient and  be kind to yourself. Don\u2019t let the ED win. You are stronger than it. It is incredibly hard, but you are worth the battle! You deserve a life of freedom from the shackles of ED so you can focus on other things and achieve great things. Get yourself back, but remember:  patience, kindness, self love and on the days that don\u2019t go as well, know there is another day around the corner. Recovery is not linear, but rather an up and down journey. Every day and every experience in recovery changes that trajectory somewhat but it\u2019s moving, ultimately, in the forwards direction to getting you and your life back. Hang in there. You and your family and friends are worth the effort!! \ud83e\udd70",

I see people normally (not as thinspo), see my body normally, and all in all\u2026 it\u2019s just great.\n\nIf you want to recovery, please try. Before my ED recovery I\u2019d had it for 9 years. That\u2019s 9 years I will never get back. Please don\u2019t give up on yourself though. No matter how long it takes\u2026 reach for that happy ending. You\u2019re so worth it.",

Antidepressants really helped though. Made the logic voice take over the ED voice in my head. Therapy also helps you identify your triggers, get to the root of why you have an ED (for me it has always been about control and I relapse when I feel like I\u2019m out of control/can\u2019t handle feeling out of control in life) so you can have the tools to tackle it better. You\u2019re always going to be recovering. But it does get easier. Still have Ed habits that I\u2019m trying to kick (stupid shit like \u201cI have to stand when I eat so I don\u2019t get fat) but that\u2019s because they have been with me since I was super super young when my brain was still developing so they\u2019re abit harder to kick than the other things I developed more recently.

I have disordered thoughts around food or my body sometimes still, but instead of daily it is weekly or monthly and for a much, much shorter time than before, and it is easier to counter and let go of.
