  "title": "Request: Girlfriend not eating enough",
  "selftext": " \n\nMy girlfriend (15F) stopped eating full portion meals 3 1/2 years ago because she's a very very sensitive person. She takes everything said to her pr even others to heart and let's if get to her. So her parents always comment on her size (shes very underweight) and they say stuff like \"oh wow you're finally eating?\" Or \"I've never seen you eat that much, are you sure you'll finish it?\"\n\nAnd those words get to her causing her to eat like really really small sized meals and if she eats too much she feels sick to her stomach and ashamed for eating so much so she'll throw it all back up. Is there any way I can convince her to start eating normally again and to stop listening to her parents comments?",

So please help her in any way but mostly advice her to seek theraphy or consuelling . You two can go together as well",

      "body": "It may not help all the time, but are you able to eat together more often just the two of you? It doesnt have to be anything expensive, even just something like a picnic or making food together and coming to your room would help imo. I think that way, you can encourage and support her (note: do not force or pressure her though) so that she feels less anxious when eating and feels 'safe', so to speak. Many times, people with eating disorders are actually enjoy prepping food, so it may be a fun idea to choose a recipe together to follow too. \nI agree with the other commenters though, she will definitely require therapy but this may help a little with harm reduction if it works. Good luck & I wish you both the best \u2661",

      "body": "Ugh...you are in a tough spot. I was bulimic for 49 years off and on....mostly on until I finally realized I couldn't control the beast on my own. Therapy was paramount...a life and relationship saver. Here's one thing I learned. No one, and I mean No One should focus on anyone else's eating or bodies (compliments or put downs). Essentially by trying to talk to her about eating will be absorbed into the same category as what her parents do which is \"people keep focusing on my eating.\" It makes you crawl in a hole, retreat, and hide. Also, just as a side note in case this comes up, don't verbalize about yours or anyone else's eating or bodies either. She needs an ED therapist to get out of this. People who do this on their own (and I realize this is the only option for some) miss a huge element that makes staying ED free much easier because it is not easy. It lingers and waits for the right moment to trap you, even years later, and then your a goner....again. Check out the National eating disorder association website and if you feel comfortable share this with your girlfriend and her parents. There are lots of resources for all of you.",

If she starts eating better and gaining weight NEVER comment on her body even if it seems positive things like \u201cYou look healthier\u201d can be so damaging and seen as failure, when she does eat say things like \u201cyou look so much happier\u201d and NOTHING to do with appearance.

Many girls would choose not to tell people that they struggle with their weight, because they know that other people will scold them for having that mentality. And since your girlfriend is only 15, she should look skinner than a full-on adult. Chances are, once she goes through these transitional teenage years, she will most likely put on weight naturally.",
