  "selftext": "I\u2019m not sure anyone else has this issue or not. I\u2019ve been in recovery for about 3 years after an over 10 year battle with anorexia. I am guessing the constant suppression of hunger for so long has put me where I don\u2019t recognize hunger at all even after being in recovery. I\u2019ve managed so far by having an eating schedule. However, now having a baby, I find myself inadvertently skipping meals. The main reason being I never \u201cfeel hungry\u201d.  I do recognize I\u2019m on a slippery slope since I very much hate how I look post baby. Does anyone have advice to relearn it or how to not keep slipping into a relapse?",

      "body": "I would love it if your can share how you overcame and prepped your body for the baby. Like how long did it take and how much did you eat etc. I\u2019m not sure if these are too private to ask but I suffered for the same thing and I lost my baby at 7 weeks, doctors say it\u2019s chromosome abnormality but I can\u2019t help but to wonder if it\u2019s Cus my body just isn\u2019t fit for pregnancy. \n\nBut go back to your post, I think it happens a lot.. never feel hungry or can\u2019t tell when we are full.. it\u2019s a real struggle. My therapist told me to set times to eat, develop a regular eating schedule would help. That sounded easy enough til I start to feel I\u2019m eating too much (even if it\u2019s just healthy clean 3 meals a day). Have you tried the schedule tactic?",

Obviously I try and have these meals at more normal time or if i feel hungry but have reminders set on your phone to the latest times you want to have certain meals by.",

      "body": "Keep on the eating schedule, but I look for other cues. Set more alarms for food maybe? Like if you keep turning off a 4 o'clock alarm set another one for 4:05. Then 4.07. Then 4:11. I use times like this cause they feel more jarring and urgent. For other cues I look for stuff that isnt just the \"feeling of hunger\". For example, I get really quiet and stuff when I'm hungry. Noises feel louder and I get more overwhelmed and snappy. Meal prepping kinda helps cause then it's there and prepared and I dont even have to think about it, which is nice. I would also look over your current schedule and see if theres any way you could adjust it so that it fits in with your life now. \n\nAlso, weird one but carrying snacks helps me. That way I feel prepared to react to the alternative hunger cues.",

      "body": "Eating something small very regularly should help. Once you are used to not eating for extended periods of time your body produces less hormones that induce hunger. If you eat something small, like a couple of grapes, nuts, olives, a bit of bread, etc. every hour or so your body should get used to eating again and start giving you hunger cues.",

It takes a long time of noticing how you feel before/sharing/after a snack or meal to get to where I could feel again. I\u2019m a mommy to a toddler and honestly, having a snack basket at my breastfeeding spot helped me. Packing snacks in your purse, and even if the nursery helps. Eating meals with your partner or family helps too.",

I used to get famished and my stomach would hurt so bad it was almost impossible to eat anything. Now my stomach even growls sometimes and I know it\u2019s time to eat!! \n\nOther cues I watch out for are if my hands are shaking or I\u2019m getting irritable. It can be hard retraining the body, I\u2019m still working on learning and listening to \u201cfullness\u201d cues because I don\u2019t really feel full. \n\nThose snacks sound awesome I\u2019ll give them a try too, thank you!",
