      "body": "Definitely. Eating disorders can happen to anyone no matter their weight, despite what the media portrays. You can be underweight and have an ED, you can be a healthy weight and have an ED, and you can be overweight and have an ED. It's a mental illness, so even though weight loss/gain is a side effect, it is primarily something you suffer with in your head that manifests physically.",
