  "title": "My friend has AFRID and has lost one of her safe foods, the alternative she\u2019s doing is somewhat expensive and could use a better way",
  "selftext": "So my friend has AFRID, and recently one of her safe foods, being Grill Cheese is no longer a safe food. Something happened (she says she may have gotten COVID, had an awful sore throat ) and since then it tastes bad, kinda has a nasty fruity taste\n\nSpecially, homemade Grill Cheese. Something she has been doing instead is going to McDonalds and getting a cheeseburger with just cheese and the bun with nothing else. As you can imagine that\u2019s not really the cheapest thing but it\u2019s the only way she can handle it\n\nI suggested buying microwaveable grill cheese if she can find it and she figures that\u2019d taste gross\n\nI asked if there is other cheese she can get at the store she likes, there isn\u2019t\n\nShe tried to eat homemade grilled cheese again but couldn\u2019t\n\nNote she is from Canada\n\nShe says the cheese from anywhere but McDonalds has a gross \u201cfruity\u201d taste\n\nMaybe there\u2019s a way to proper emulate the taste of the Grill Cheese at McDonalds at home she has at home? Or some other solution?\n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do really, advice appreciated!",
