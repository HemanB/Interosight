  "selftext": "i feel like i want absolutely no one to know that i eat. like i know they know i eat but i don\u2019t like them seeing me eat. like i work at arbys and we\u2019re allowed to have free food but i never get myself anything because i don\u2019t want my coworkers to know. sometimes i get a milkshake because one of my family members asked for one and i always feel the need to make it clear that it\u2019s not for me. i hate going out to eat in fear that i\u2019ll see someone i know and they\u2019ll judge me. i know it\u2019s totally ridiculous and irrational but it\u2019s so embarrassing. does this have anything to do with an eating disorder?",
