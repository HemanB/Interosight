Few people talk about it, but the possible medical complications of undereating (undereating in itself, no matter the weight at which you are undereating) are too many.\n\nMy anorexia was classified as \"moderate\" (my weight wasn't too low and my anorexia didn't last too long), and I still developed complications, a few from which I still cannot recover and don't know if I ever will.\n\nIn fact, I developed the most serious complications during a brief relapse while I was already recovering, so I was already at a \"healthy\" weight when it happened. But the damage of each period of undereating can accumulate, especially if your body hasn't had enough time to recover from the last one. A seemingly innocent relapse can be the last straw for your body and break you.\n\nI'm at a healthy weight now and have been for a while, but my muscles have been damaged, including the diaphragm and abdominal wall, and I can't swallow or breathe normally.\n\nEvery day, I fear I may d!e from this (either by choking, undereating again because of how hard it is to swallow, or by not being able to breathe), and every day I wish I could go back in time, recover from anorexia much sooner and never relapse\u2014before my muscles were compromised.\n\nIt could be your muscles or any other organ affected. Don't risk it. This is the \"past self\" a \"future you\" may want to go back to and ask to do things differently if things go wrong.",

Few people talk about it, but the possible medical complications of undereating (undereating in itself, no matter the weight at which you are undereating) are too many.\n\nMy anorexia was classified as \"moderate\" (my weight wasn't too low and my anorexia didn't last too long), and I still developed complications, a few from which I still cannot recover and don't know if I ever will.\n\nIn fact, I developed the most serious complications during a brief relapse while I was already recovering, so I was already at a \"healthy\" weight when it happened. But the damage of each period of undereating can accumulate, especially if your body hasn't had enough time to recover from the last one. A seemingly innocent relapse can be the last straw for your body and break you.\n\nI'm at a healthy weight now and have been for a while, but my muscles have been damaged, including the diaphragm and abdominal wall, and I can't swallow or breathe normally.\n\nEvery day, I fear I may d!e from this (either by choking, undereating again because of how hard it is to swallow, or by not being able to breathe), and every day I wish I could go back in time, recover from anorexia much sooner and never relapse\u2014before my muscles were compromised.\n\nIt could be your muscles or any other organ affected. Don't risk it. This is the \"past self\" a \"future you\" may want to go back to and ask to do things differently if things go wrong.",

But if you're still struggling with those thoughts, I hope this can help.\n\nBut how LONG do they survive without having found a stable source of nutrition? When we do hear about people who survived for a long time at sea or on an island, it's because they figured out a way to feed themselves and keep themselves healthy, and would take every opportunity to eat when they could- But often times the strenuous labor that comes with survival will still break their body down.\n\nAnd even with a stable source of nutrition these people are by no means thriving- For every 1 miracle story of some guy living on a desert island, we have tons of other people who died almost immediately after getting lost because they had no supplies and couldn't sustain themselves. It's not surviving, it's crawling away from death praying someone finds you before it takes hold, and those survivors often come out of those situations with lifelong ailments and disabilities related to the toll it took on their body.\n\nVery very rarely do we actually get \"man survives on nothing and comes out unscathed!\" because those situations are the exception- not the rule by any means. And the ones who DID survive often times had some type of background or training that helped them through it. The thing is, people don't survive. They very frequently don't, and it's horrific. But of course we hear those miracle stories and think surviving without food must not be that bad, but in reality it's horrific and humans have been driven to cannibalism in similar situations to survive. In the real life story of a whaling ship called \"The Essex\" that had inspired the novel of Moby Dick, the crew is forced to use their small whaling boats as life rafts after their ship is sunk, and the ONLY people who ended up surviving the ordeal are those who ended up partaking in cannibalism to survive, and even then they were described as \"the picture of suffering\" when they were ultimately rescued.\n\nAgain, I know this is dramatic af and at heart you already know how it doesn't work that way, but hopefully this can be something helpful if it's still an intrusive thought.",

          "body": "I know this is ED brain logic and in reality you know that's not realistic, so I want to make sure you know I'm just saying this for dramatic effect and not because I actually think you're stupid or anything- I know you're not, so please forgive this novel. But if you're still struggling with those thoughts, I hope this can help.\n\nBut how LONG do they survive without having found a stable source of nutrition? When we do hear about people who survived for a long time at sea or on an island, it's because they figured out a way to feed themselves and keep themselves healthy, and would take every opportunity to eat when they could- But often times the strenuous labor that comes with survival will still break their body down.\n\nAnd even with a stable source of nutrition these people are by no means thriving- For every 1 miracle story of some guy living on a desert island, we have tons of other people who died almost immediately after getting lost because they had no supplies and couldn't sustain themselves. It's not surviving, it's crawling away from death praying someone finds you before it takes hold, and those survivors often come out of those situations with lifelong ailments and disabilities related to the toll it took on their body.\n\nVery very rarely do we actually get \"man survives on nothing and comes out unscathed!\" because those situations are the exception- not the rule by any means. And the ones who DID survive often times had some type of background or training that helped them through it. The thing is, people don't survive. They very frequently don't, and it's horrific. But of course we hear those miracle stories and think surviving without food must not be that bad, but in reality it's horrific and humans have been driven to cannibalism in similar situations to survive. In the real life story of a whaling ship called \"The Essex\" that had inspired the novel of Moby Dick, the crew is forced to use their small whaling boats as life rafts after their ship is sunk, and the ONLY people who ended up surviving the ordeal are those who ended up partaking in cannibalism to survive, and even then they were described as \"the picture of suffering\" when they were ultimately rescued.\n\nAgain, I know this is dramatic af and at heart you already know how it doesn't work that way, but hopefully this can be something helpful if it's still an intrusive thought.",
