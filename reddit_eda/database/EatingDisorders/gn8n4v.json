  "selftext": "Hello everyone. For a large portion of my life I have been stuck in a cycle of restricting and binging until last year I finally decided to work on myself and recover from my disordered eating habits. I began to start intuitive eating and I felt great. I was at the healthiest I had ever been mentally regarding my body image and physically because I had started exercising regularly now that I finally had the energy to do so. \n\nHowever, because I started to eat freely I had ended up gaining some weight. I already was chubby when I began intuitive eating so gaining the weight made me feel guilty, but I managed fairly well with it instead of relapsing. Now because of quarantine I have undergone a full blown relapse. In the beginning I had planned to lose the extra pounds in a healthy manor but I started to fast and restrict and then binge when I couldn\u2019t handle my hunger anymore. \n\nI feel miserable, but I worry that if I stop fasting I will end up gaining even more weight. At least before I had exercise as an outlet to make me feel strong and healthier, but because gyms are closed I can\u2019t cope that way. I am terrified of gaining anymore weight because I already weigh more than I should, but I also want to go back to living my life without worrying about how many calories I\u2019m consuming. Does anyone have any advice for this? How do you push yourself to recover when you\u2019re not dangerously underweight?",

Don\u2019t panic and send yourself into your disorder, that\u2019s what it wants. Accept that everyone is having a hard time right now, and honestly being a little overweight, I\u2019ll take it. I\u2019d rather be \u201cchubby\u201d than totally messed up and disordered and upset. It\u2019s just not worth it anymore. I know easier said than done, don\u2019t get me wrong I would prefer to be thinner, but it\u2019s not worth me losing my mind. Screw that, I did it for 20 years and I\u2019m so over it. I\u2019ll be chubby and enjoy my life, thank you very much, because living in diet and eating disorder hell sucks my life force out of me",

      "body": "1. weight gain is pretty much inevitable when you start recovery, no matter your starting weight. it\u2019s just your body taking advantage of that long awaited stability and it hasn\u2019t quite learned to trust you to keep it up, just yet. your body will adjust to this in time and will eventually stop gaining weight. \n\n2. eating disorders are mental illness that occasionally display physical symptoms. being underweight can be one of those symptoms, however, this is not something the majority of sufferers experience. not getting help because you\u2019re not underweight is like not getting help for depression because you have never self-harmed. mental illnesses are always serious, no matter if they threaten your physical health.",
