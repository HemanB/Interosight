I\u2019ve been in recovery for going on 10 years now and I\u2019m only just starting to restore balance in my life after many years of nothing. Not just in terms of diet and exercise, I\u2019ve been pretty much just existing for all this time because I taken literally everything too far.\n\nI work with a timetable and I set timers while I complete my tasks. I allow 30 mins each morning for exercise, 1 hour of reading, 1 hour personal care etc. It works for me because it limits my time at each but when I \u2018complete\u2019 my timetable I still get than sense of accomplishment",

      "body": "The only way I know how to be active is by having fun with it. If it starts to feel like a chore, I take a step back and either take a day off to reevaluate my goals or try another activity.\nAs for eating healthy, I go through phases of overeating a restriction \u2014 right now I\u2019m in a restriction phase, but I\u2019m trying to focus less on the whole eating part of it and just how I\u2019m feeling physically (training myself to acknowledge hunger cues). I suppose just making sure you actively check in with yourself, preventing the whole \u201ctaking it too far\u201d is possible and easier to accomplish.",

It will really help to address that all-or-nothing mindset that usually plagues people with eating disorders. If you want to stay in recovery, you\u2019ll probably have to give up dieting while you work on this. Best of luck!!",
