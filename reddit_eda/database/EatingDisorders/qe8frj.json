  "selftext": " \n\nHi so recently I've lost a significant amount of fat recently and the other day my family and I had gone to see this family friend. They have a son(10yrs)and daughter (18). The daughter was telling me about how much weight I lost and I was like ahahaa yeah... I just exercise. And see my brother and this girl have been really skinny since they were little. I have always been pretty big until like a few years ago when my ed came in and I became thin. So her brother that day was like see. my sister and your brother are as thin as sticks they're like matchsticks. You're not though. Like mf??? Istg I felt like a physical pain in my chest when he said that like my heart dropped. It just felt so trash because I've lost so much fucking weight and this fucking Ed has been killing me but he says you're not thin. And Ik he's just a child but like... Idk it felt really awful and I've begun restricting more after he said that. What an ass.",
