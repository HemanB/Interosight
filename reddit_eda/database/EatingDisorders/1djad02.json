  "selftext": "To make it short, i have a friend that when we met they was dangerously thin and confided in me their eating disorder, i do not to talk about it unless they bring it up and they haven\u2019t in a while so i do not know if they still struggle with it. \n\nHowever they have gained weight which I know they were trying to do and I want to compliment them on it (especially cause they have complimented me on my weight loss) but I dont want to be the loud dumb guy yelling some shit that will make them regress lol. Due to being raised the way I was I have the emotional intelligence of a cinderblock, so I wanted to ask people who have lived it, what should I avoid saying when trying to compliment them or should I just not in general?",

What does matter are efforts like hair, outfits, etc. Also school achievements and being a kind person. As people with EDs, we want to be seen as so much more than our bodies!",

It might seem like commenting on things unrelated to their weight (hair quality, skin, facial features) would be fine, but YOU DON\u2019T KNOW THAT. As someone who is recovered, very weird/irrational things have been deeply triggering to me. \n\nThis is going to sound weird, but I\u2019m autistic and you say you struggle socially/emotionally so I think it\u2019ll help:\n\n**If it\u2019s anything they\u2019d see on themselves naked and straight out of the shower, say nothing.
