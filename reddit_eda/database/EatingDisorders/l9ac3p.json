Adding on weight will allow me to be happier, stronger, faster, and have more energy. Participating in sports at such a low weight can lead to injury for athletes. You can do this",

I felt strong, played really well, and never looked fat in the slightest. \n\nIn college, I started the swim team, developed a restrictive eating disorder with compulsive exercising, and lost a lot of weight, like 30 pounds. I also stopped being able to perform athletically and felt like shit.\n\nFor a few years I had the same fear as you and would not allow myself to gain back some weight. Yet, I eventually got fed up, sought out therapy, and started gaining again\u2014 trusting that the outcome my ED was saying would happen wasn\u2019t true. Low and behold, I\u2019ve gained 20lbs, feel much better, and do not look fat in the slightest (even if I did WHO CARES because I have energy again).\n\nYou gotta trust that your ED is trying to scare you into being underweight. It\u2019s showing you your most feared outcome, not reality. You got this.",

I am still unlearning behaviors even after months of recovery... you are an athlete with a high muscle percentage. Your body needs food. I am also athletic and I could never stop obsessing about food until I allowed myself to have it. I know it\u2019s hard and when you see other people\u2019s recovery journeys sometimes it makes it feel impossible and you have no idea how they had the strength to do it. But you have the ability to recover. If you ever need someone to talk to just message me.",

You're opening yourself to less pain, more health, and greater self love and if three, five pounds creep up in there it is completely worth it. It is ultimately only you who is noticing and feeling it. \n\nAvoid checking your body in the mirror, avoid looking at the other athletes' food consumption, and continually remind yourself what your life will look like in five years if you continue your disorder, or if you can recover",

      "body": "I think it\u2019s important to work with a therapist who will help you do the work to unravel this fear. The fear of fat and weight gain is instilled in us by a culture that profits off of that fear. You\u2019re going to have to learn to stop equating fat with moral and personal failure, because weight and body shape is not something that is in anyone\u2019s control. Once you\u2019ve done this work, and you know that weight or fat gain isn\u2019t a result of some deep personal failure but rather a result of a body doing its job to try to keep you alive, you will feel so much more free in your recovery, and you\u2019ll have much more compassion for others too. \n\nLots of good reads to help with this, but something like Anti-Diet by Christy Harrison may be a good place to start, especially if you can\u2019t do therapy right away.",

      "body": "\nI had the same fear when I seriously considered recovering. It definitely takes a lot of work and persistence to change your mindset about what gaining weight really means. For me, ditching the scales permanently was the first step. I have not weighed myself in over a year. I don\u2019t avoid mirrors, I think it\u2019s important to recognise the process visually so it\u2019s less daunting. I began to think of food as something that would either fuel my body to function or something that would just be really delicious to enjoy. Tbh, for the first few months of recovery I baked cookies three times a week and just let myself have at them. Cooking is a nice way to acknowledge all the amazing, nutritious elements of a meal and help you feel more connected to food in a positive way. I can\u2019t tell you you\u2019re not going to gain weight but I can promise you that recovery is the best path you will ever take. I like the way I look more now than I ever did with an ED. And more importantly, I get to live a fulfilling life without constantly feeling terrible mentally, physically and emotionally. Plus, I still fit into all my old clothes - not that it matters and it\u2019s different for everyone, but I\u2019m sure that may be something that could be reassuring to you.",

Back in the thick of my disorder, I was competing in races and time trials, but I was performing like absolute garbage. My lizard brain couldn't make the connection that eating 1000kcal while training and racing = no bueno. Being under 110lbs as a 5'9 male is not good from any medical perspective, but strictly from an athletic point of view it's absolutely terrible for performance.\n\nNow I still train, but I eat 3000 and sometimes over 3000kcal without guilt. I'm about 10x better now that I treat my body right by feeding it what it needs to perform at its best. If you look at it from a perspective of eating more will equal better performance, it could help. I'm not saying that process will be easy, but I guarantee you'll be happier with your performance in the end.",
