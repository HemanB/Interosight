  "selftext": "So I guess this is kind of for me, but also anyone else who needs to hear it.\nFor those of you who deep down know you have an ed, but need the confirmation in order to get help, this is it.\n\n\u201cJust because you don\u2019t fit into the stereotype that social media portrays an ed, doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have one.\u201d\n\nFor the longest while I denied having an ed, this was because I didn\u2019t fit the stereotype that came up whenever you searched up or thought of an ed.\n\nI ate fast food. I didn\u2019t count. I didn\u2019t purge. I didn\u2019t starve myself everyday. I didn\u2019t feel guilty for eating. I wasn\u2019t a certain weight. I wasn\u2019t any of those, heck I would sometimes even over eat. Which meant I couldn\u2019t have an ed, right?\n\nI may not have done all those things, but that didn\u2019t necessarily mean that I was eating healthy.\n\n\n- I ate fast food, but only because I worked in fast food so I got it on a discount or free, and I couldn\u2019t afford anything else.\n\n- I didn\u2019t count, but I did fantasize about becoming vegan so I could lose weight. I never could because I couldn\u2019t afford to do so, but if I could have afforded it I would have.\n\n- I didn\u2019t purge, but that\u2019s because I have a fear of throwing up, and deep down inside I knew that purging would be admitting to myself that I had an issue with eating.\n\n- I didn\u2019t starve myself, but I didn\u2019t feed myself either. I would eat, but only after the pain of hunger became so unbearable that I felt I would die if I didn\u2019t eat. When I did eat I would never finish my food because \u201cI wasn\u2019t hungry\u201d and eventually, I actually wasn\u2019t hungry. Not because I was full and my body had all the energy it needed, but because my body was so used to me eating such small portions that it tricked itself into feeling full after a few bites, only for me to be hungry again after only an hour or so because I didn\u2019t eat enough. \n\n- I didn\u2019t feel guilty about eating. I may have not felt guilty about eating, but I did feel guilty about gaining weight. If I noticed I gained weight, I would pick apart myself, I would feel so bad and cry myself to sleep.\n\n- I didn\u2019t weight a certain amount. For the longest while I thought I couldn\u2019t have an ed. In my mind I thought \u201cif I had an ed than with how long I\u2019ve been like this I should be a certain weight by now, right?\u201d You do not need to be a certain weight to have an ed, an ed is not based on weight, but rather your mental health and eating habits. I may not have been a certain weight, but I was always cold. I may not have been certain weight, but I was extremely irritable. I may not have been a certain weight, but food was always on my mind. I may not have been a certain weight, but I wanted to be and that\u2019s what matters.\n\n- I would over eat. Why did I though? I over ate because my body would try to compensate, I would starve so much and eat so little that when my body got the chance to, I would just eat and eat and eat until I physically couldn\u2019t anymore. It was like giving candy to a child who wasn\u2019t allowed to eat candy at home. I never allowed myself to have certain things, so when I finally got access to them I would go crazy and just eat any and everything I could. It wasn\u2019t healthy either.\n\nOverall this post was partly for me, but also for those of you reading this who are like me. Who deep down inside knows that what you\u2019re doing to yourself isn\u2019t healthy, but because you don\u2019t fit the stereotype of an ed you think you don\u2019t have it.\n\nAn ed does not have a size requirement and there is no such thing as \u201cnot sick enough\u201d. Don\u2019t wait until you are \u201csick enough\u201d to get help, because there will never be a \u201csick enough\u201d It may be harsh, but it\u2019s true. \n\nFor those of you like me, this is the confirmation that you have been searching for, you do have an ed, and you do need help, so get it. I\u2019m getting help, I hope you will join me.",

I still can barely eat out with other people because my safe foods list is so restricted now. I still always hope people don\u2019t notice when I don\u2019t touch my rice (I live in Asia). I still purge if I eat something I\u2019m not \u201callowed\u201d to eat. But because I\u2019m not the tiniest or dying and I like to eat a bit for breakfast, I feel like I\u2019m not sick and people don\u2019t see me as sick. My friend who is close enough to know my food things just thinks of it as me being quirky and sort of jokes about it. And yeah, when I\u2019m fully in binge purge cycle, it doesn\u2019t make me skinnier necessarily. Not all eds make you lose weight.",

I don\u2019t calorie count anymore. I\u2019m not a 14 year old hanging out on pro Ana sites (anymore\u2026)- I\u2019m a mother and wife with a job and home- I don\u2019t weigh myself, I just keep getting physically smaller and smaller. \n\nI\u2019ve found this the biggest barrier in getting help now that I\u2019m not a child and I present otherwise \u2018capable\u2019; even though I\u2019m very underweight (I have been weighed by drs), there isn\u2019t an awful lot of help out there for adults, and because I\u2019m otherwise functioning, the only way I\u2019d qualify for help, at least where I live, is if I was sick enough to be committed. Oh well. \n\nAnd I totally agree with you about being \u2018sick enough\u2019; it\u2019s a shame that the medical world is still woefully uneducated about this stuff. They need to catch up considering anorexia is the most deadly mental illness.",
