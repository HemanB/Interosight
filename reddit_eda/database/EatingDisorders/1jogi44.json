  "selftext": "I (16f) have been struggling with my ed for quite a while now, and i don't want to get better.  I'm in therapy once a week, and my dad (who is a doctor) got me on antidepressants. My mom told me several times what her plan is (getting me to eat more little by little, making me feel better by telling me I'm not only my body...), but even with all the help I'm receiving, I still want to get thinner. I feel like im being ungrateful for not taking such a good opportunity I have to recover, and I feel sad for having my parents worry about me, but I've made up my mind and I don't want to go back to where i started.  How can I tell my parents / therapist this?",

Feel exactly the same, with the same thoughts and situations?\n\nI feel this might be an all or nothing lock you could be in. Maybe talk about it in this way to your therapist, say you don't want to go back to where you started and explain why. Dig in deeper on what \"where you started\" means for you and what fears or unpleasant difficult feelings it is tied to. Also examine if \"where you started\" is 100% the destination or maybe not necessarily. How will your body be when you recover? How do you expect to feel about it? Exactly like you felt when your ED started, or differently? Differently how?\n\nI would try to take it apart like this.",
