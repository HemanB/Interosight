  "selftext": "Hi everyone, so I'm not exactly sure if I have an eating disorder as such, I've always been on and off with my eating habits, though that is usually due to other mental health issues.\n\nHowever, although I'm feeling quite low, I'm not in a place where I'm feeling too crap or unmotivated to move, a few months ago I started exercising to try and gain some more muscle as I'm quite skinny and would do me some good to get some more meat on my bones. \n\nWhen I learnt that eating was just as important as the work out I would force myself to eat in the day, and then force myself to eat again at night, but for the past two weeks or so I just can't eat at all, to be precise I haven't ate anything since Sunday, where I tried to eat lasagna because I felt dizzy and sick, but ended up just eating the cheese from the top and giving the rest to my dog.\n\nI should mention that I don't feel weak or anything like that, I don't use much energy during the day so maybe that's why, but when I go out to walk my dog I'm fine with playing and running around with her, and I stay awake for usually 20hours at a time and probably only get 4hours sleep when I eventually do, yet, again, I don't feel majorly weak or withdrawn.\n\nI wouldn't really be fussed, as it doesn't seem to be effecting me physically (as far as I can tell), but I know the lack of eating is preventing me from making any real progress with my exercises (I'm trying to grow my glutes and legs but after 3 months or so, there doesn't seem to be much difference at all, and I've done some pretty extreme work outs in my opinion), I've also spent quite a lot of money trying to become more healthy, with protein powders, pre workouts, and lots of tablets to help get my chemicals more balanced, but I just can't seem to eat, and it's annoying knowing that something that comes naturally to everyone is the one thing that is most definitely holding me back.\n\nSo I guess I'm just wondering if anyone has had anything like this, and how they have managed to start eating or get an appetite back? Any foods that are easy to eat that don't make you feel full straight away? I just don't know what to do.\n\nThank you in advance for any tips & help, love you all & stay healthy x",

I guess what happens is that your body feels it\u2019s being threatened because it\u2019s not getting any food and gives you an extra boost of energy - it\u2019s most likely getting it from your muscles because there\u2019s no fat to go into, and that might be the reason for you not gaining muscle. Also sleeping for a couple of hours and waking up kinda frenetic, that\u2019s also a state your body gets when it feels danger. I got out by forcing myself to eat, very little amounts through the day, very slowly, foods that are not very fat, try toasted bread with nothing on it, plain rice, etc. until your stomach gets used to food and then increase the amount of food, once again slowly, that would be the best advice I can give you.",

If you want to start gaining muscle while you slowly get your appetite back, just drink supplements (i.e. ensure, smoothie drinks, etc.) There's also extra calorie packs you can add to smoothies or shakes you can get online or at GNC that increase nutrition without increasing volume. \n\nRegardless speak to your PCP. Please. Especially if you're exercising you need to fuel your body correctly.",
