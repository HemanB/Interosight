  "title": "Request: How to healthily lose weight without spiralling into binge/restrict cylce",
  "selftext": "request: binge restrict cycle\n\nI am at a normal (higher end of normal) weight. I used to be overweight, but I restricted calories to lose weight. I was quite strict with this restriction and lost my period for 2 months.\n\nI was afraid of all the negative effects dieting has had on my life. I was also under a lot of stress due to adapting to online school and other projects. So I let myself eat a little more and I kindof freaked out because I gained back some of the weight I lost and tried to lose it again.\n\nNow I am in a weird binge restrict cycle where I am just compelled to eat anything and everything at night until I am uncomfortably full, then going back into diet mode and running, and I hate myself through all of it. \n\nTried intuitive eating, did not work because I have completely fucked up my hunger signals. I hate how I feel so out of control, like I'm spiralling\n\nThe messed up part of it is that I am so afraid of gaining back weight and I still want to lose weight because I still feel fat. I know I could lose weight, I just don't know how to do it healthily and not spiral like I always do and end up eating it back\n\nHelp would be much appreciated",

      "body": "This gonna be a bit long, but I  can relate on so many levels...\n\nI first went on diet when I was 15, was around 70 kg (I am 164 cm, 5'4), went down to 51 in half a year, with rigorous cardio exercise and telling myself I was eating like 1000 calories a day (probably it was more like 700  or less and also hiding food around my cupboards so mum wont know I didn't eat my school lunch). Of course, I gained the weight back (like 13 kg in 4 months) crying while eating. What ensued was a never-ending circle of going of superbly restricted diets (like 500 kcal) for a period of time and then gaining it all back due to binge eating (usually plus some but never got back to 70). Sometimes I would manage to eat normally for like a month or so. When I first went on diet, lost my period and would sometimes get very dizzy; later I was lucky and my health didn't deteriorate too much - apart from bad skin and broken blood vessels in my eyes) Now I am 21. For the past two years, I've been struggling with mild bulimia, coming, going and intensifying in a cycle. But yeah. At the end of March, I've said \"enough\", freaking tired of never-ending yoyoing, binging, purging and feeling like shite. My job has closed and uni went ahead with online teaching, so I went back to my parents' house with loads of free time to cook and more energy to do things (I work in a fast food 4 days a week and I'll tell u its like super tiring both physically and mentally).  Stopped counting calories because it triggers me.  It took 6 years and a global pandemic, but for the first time ever, I think I am on the right track (or at least better than I was).\n\nAnyway,  the way I am doing it is (it might not work for you, just saying) - I eat protein and carbs at every meal - 3 meals a day at more or less set times (its 8am, 1 pm and 6 - 7 pm but I would fit them into ur own day plan), sometimes a small snack - like fruit or yoghurt if i feel supper hungry in between them), most of my meals are plant-based (not restricting, I just don't like meat that much, but I eat it when I feel a need) but occasionally I eat fish or chicken. Breakfast is usually porridge or yoghurt with muesli or chia pudding sth like that. Then salads or soups for lunch - loooots, with some bread or sth. My evening meal is the biggest - stews, tofu fried rice, tofu bolognese pasta - u name it, I am experimenting a lot and searching for new recipes. I exercise 6 days a week - some strength training and like an hour of walking or cycling or sth. I have one cheat day a week for now because I am scared that if eliminate sweets and unhealthy stuff completely I will relapse and that if i allow myself to eat them more often I will lose control. So, once a week, I let myself eat chocolate for breakfast, pizza for dinner or muffins for lunch... However,  it's nowhere near the amount of food I was eating while bingeing. Just because that urge to stuff my face with everything i can see in the shop lessened? Like fine, I want to eat a whole bar of chocolate and fries for dinner from time to time, it's not gonna kill me. Lost like 2kg in a month, which is much less then I was severely restricting but a healthy pace.  (This time starting weight was like 61 so I would attribute the weight loss, to like... fewer sweets and no free junk food from work plus not starving for half a day, just to eat the whole shop in the evening).\n\nI know I am still not in an ideal place. I obsess over my body too much, cheat days re not an ideal thing to do, either. I weight myself every week. But at least I am not bingeing anymore and my skin and hair got so much better... Also feel more stable mentally.\n\nLast but not least... Tell someone. I would be suffering in silence for years or joking about always gaining and losing. Finally told my sister and my best friend (who also struggles with an ED), it's just... Makes it a bit easier. Because maybe sb will notice that you are spilarring and even if they can't do much you have sb to complain to.  Maybe you could try looking for help with a specialist, I heard it helps a lot (never went to therapy myself, cause I was too embarrassed and scared, and I wish some much I have done it - probably would spare me a lot of nerves and self - hate).",
