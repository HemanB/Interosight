  "title": "Request: Seeking participants for an online academic study",
  "selftext": " \n\nHey, I hope you are all doing okay and managing to cope with this bad situation that we're all in.\n\nI am a psychology PhD student and am trying to recruit participants for an online study that I'm running. Please don't think that I am misusing this sub for my own personal gain. I say this as I have worked very closely with people with mental health difficulties (in a mental health hospital), including people close to me, and I have the ambition of improving our understanding of mental health conditions and improving diagnosis and treatment procedures. I am therefore hoping that you guys will help me out with my research and help me work towards my overall goal of improving mental health care (which is desperately needed)!\n\nThe study I'm running at the moment is an online questionnaire which looks at patterns in relationships, personality, mental health, and behaviour. Here is a link to further background info and study details: [https://lancasteruni.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_0H7BSqcFv46NNad](https://lancasteruni.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0H7BSqcFv46NNad).\n\nIt is best completed on a laptop/computer but can also be done on a mobile phone. Here is the link to the questionnaire for anybody interested and willing to help: [https://lancasteruni.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_6VarLE8yOBRitQV?fbclid=IwAR2SkFXR9znNfQ0Etp3yR9r1GIe4pGMUzGKjOo5wUnc3ivUdjrfqBhVuq\\_0](https://lancasteruni.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6VarLE8yOBRitQV?fbclid=IwAR2SkFXR9znNfQ0Etp3yR9r1GIe4pGMUzGKjOo5wUnc3ivUdjrfqBhVuq_0).\n\nThanks a lot :)",
