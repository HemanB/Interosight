  "selftext": "I have been making progress in recovering from my ED over the past few months, but things start to get more difficult when I spend long periods of time at home, around lots of food. I start stressing more about when/what I am eating and it\u2019s hard to focus on other things. \n\nNow that we\u2019re being encouraged to spend more and more time at home, I am getting really anxious about being at home for most of my day.  I feel as though I won\u2019t be able to control myself around all this food. \n\nDoes anyone have any tips on how to stay calm when surrounded by food, or tips to distract/comfort myself when it\u2019s all I can seem to think about?",
