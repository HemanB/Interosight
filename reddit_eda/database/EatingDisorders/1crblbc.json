  "selftext": "okay so yeah as the title says i often find myself being super aware of others eating habits and making sure that they eat properly but i feel awful every time because the only reason i do it is because i know if they eat less than me and i notice them losing weight faster than me (whether it be from intentional starvation or just happenstance) then i develop this really intense jealousy that just doesn't disappear. does anyone else feel this? and how do you deal with it",

      "body": "Oh my god. I thought I was the only one. I make sure people eat cuz I love to abstractly feed myself though seeing others eat what I can\u2019t. But I also make sure they are fed cuz deep down, I don\u2019t want them to get thinner. Not for them to get bigger but to stay their weight and not get thinner. I get so annoyed when one of my friends would say \u201cI haven\u2019t eaten\u201d and it\u2019s 3pm. Or once they asked what they eat during their break at work and they said \u201cjust water haha.\u201d Like ok congrats you don\u2019t have an appetite. And I would get mad I would have an appetite. And then I would feel guilty for getting mad. Cuz to be it sounds like a badge of honor or a boast and in my worst, I would feel so good and proud people knew me as the person who didn\u2019t eat. So it\u2019s this jealousy that others are trying to be this person. ED\u2019s are such a fucked up mental illness. How to deal with it? I don\u2019t know. I just try my best when I get these emotions to ignore them and block them out. I honestly don\u2019t know another way. The thoughts come here and there but if they are getting lesser, that\u2019s a step. :/",

      "body": "Yeah I kind of just do it as a means of deflection at this point tbh. I just don\u2019t have the energy to put emphasis on other people\u2019s eating habits anymore. People eat. It\u2019s not a cause for concern in most cases. At this point, it\u2019s because it makes me look better to say something positive that\u2019s backed up by science even though my own mind and body screams the opposite. \n\nSome people overexert themselves into the lives of others with eating disorders. I used to do this. But genuinely can\u2019t be assed anymore. Plus I\u2019m not gonna get much info from them tbh. This was mostly when I was younger and it\u2019s not like they really had any awareness. People just go through hard times. The knowledge I have now exceeds what I knew when I was younger by a long shot. I have everything I need now. I can\u2019t help others. I can\u2019t help myself. It\u2019s just not going to happen so I don\u2019t really try in the same way anymore. It\u2019s not that simple. And I already got what I wanted once so I can do it again, but better this time.",
