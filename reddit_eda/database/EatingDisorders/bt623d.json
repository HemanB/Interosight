I have also gotten into living more environmentally friendly and have restricted my plastic use severely. Are these all other ways for me to punish myself? Any advice for how much is ok?",

I also refused to purchase nice things for myself, or sometimes not even \"nice\" things, but ANY thing. \n\nWhat helped is that I was honest with what I was doing with my treatment team. They helped me set small goals to make changes.",

If I had too much free time I would make myself do something \"productive\" and I wouldn't allow myself to sleep for more than a designated period.\n\nThat being said, it's probably not best to try and justify any perceived restrictions you have. If you think it's a restriction good chance that your brain does too. It might just be a part of the same neural network as your ED and it's always worth challenging if you think it'll make life better for you.",

I perceived my lack of food and very strict rules of intake as a form of perfect behavior. I almost felt superior in a very stupid way for having \u201ccontrol\u201d over the parts of life that required great great self discipline. I\u2019d look around and scoff at others who couldn\u2019t resist a cookie at the dining hall, would make excuses to wake up early, or would fail their courses out of negligence. \n\nNeedless to say, I\u2019m happy thats not the case anymore. Don\u2019t know how former anorexic me would\u2019ve handled plastic restriction or shopping restriction.",

I hate my binging tendencies bc i carve time out of my day to burn it off afterwards, which sometimes means missing out on planned events. \n\nTake my words with a grain of salt of course. Ive never been diagnosed with an eating disorder, but might have developed worse habits if my teachers did not notice and discourage my tendencies around food.",

For me it\u2019s so much so that the rituals and routines are actually more important to me than what my body looks like. You should look up Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder, it\u2019s a diagnosis I have and it makes me restrict in similar ways to what you described, in order to be in control.",

Through budgeting, planned date nights, etc I was able to start seeing it was ok to let go and have fun. \n\nI don\u2019t think restricting plastic is bad and do feel that in some cases the ability to restrict can benefit (this is one area cause plastic is horrible) it\u2019s just a matter of using it in a way that doesn\u2019t hurt you or others. You can still get what you want it\u2019s just a matter of finding a way. If you\u2019re using the plastic restriction to keep you from eating when you need to then I\u2019d say ease up a bit and give yourself what you need until you can find a way to cut out plastic. It\u2019s not always all or nothing.",
