  "selftext": "Title basically says it all. I haven\u2019t been ever diagnosed with an eating disorder properly, but you can judge my behavior and make your own analysis. \n\nI have and awful relationship with food and eating around people. For as long as I could remember, my mom would be the one to shame me in front of the family for my choices at the table. Whether it would be getting a second serving, etc. Now, I was a slightly chunky child, but it wasn\u2019t anything extreme. I had baby fat. I wasn\u2019t obese, and I grew out of it. But she would always make me watch shows like The Biggest Loser, modify my diet, punish me for eating sweets, and hovered over the scale like a hawk. It was big and little things. I remember once when I got my braces tightened, it hurt to eat. She\u2019d continuously joke that I should get them tightened more often. Hell, I overheard that she joked about my severe anemia because she thought it\u2019d make me lose more weight. \n\nShe put me on MyFitnessPal and similar apps from a young age, and when I was 14 pressured me into going to see a weight loss specialist (Dr. Zisman, Miami, if you care to look into him) , who put me on metabolism boosting pills and a strict diet. I proceeded to lose a bunch of weight, and my mom was happy, but I was utterly miserable. \n\nI turned to purging, and restricting, and binging. I sneak food, whether it\u2019s hiding bread in my hoodie sleeve or an orange in the band of my underwear. Eating dinner with family members gives me extreme anxiety, as does eating around other people. My best friend is the only person who I really feel all that comfortable eating around, because deep down I know she wouldn\u2019t judge me like my mother. \n\nWhen I came clean to her about my ex-purging habits, she didn\u2019t bat an eye. She makes weight loss a condition for doing things that I like. For example, to go see my best friend in Iceland, she wants me to lose x amount of pounds by x date. \n\nI should clarify that I don\u2019t hate my mom, but she\u2019s left me with a deeply scarred sense of self and I fear that I\u2019ll never be able to truly love myself at any size. She\u2019s ruined my relationship with food and with my body, but at the same time I feel bad because it\u2019s not her fault. My abuelo died from complications of lung cancer and diabetes, and my abuela is obese. Being overweight runs in the family, and she often talks about being the only one to have \u201cbroken the mold\u201d by being skinny. She has baggage and she\u2019s scared that I\u2019ll turn out to be 500 pounds or something. \n\nI\u2019m NOT skinny by most standards, and I just wish I had smaller boobs and a thigh gap and thinner arms and a smaller...well, a smaller everything. I\u2019m so tired of obsessing over calories, feeling overly guilty for having an indulgent meal or not working out, and being ashamed of my body. I get so envious of people who have my \u201cideal\u201d body. \n\nI feel like I\u2019ve had much of my childhood and teenage years robbed from me because of my maybe-ED. \n\nTo anybody who\u2019s been in a similar situation to me, I really need advice. I\u2019m stuck and I feel so hopeless.",

I moved out and across the country it has helped along with therapy.    \n\nAlthough the demons come back when I go to visit.  I one time called my brother crying and apologizing because I had gained weight.     \n\nMy family did not mean harm and my parents only wanted us to be healthy.  So I don't blame them, they did the best they could with what they had.",

I hope that soon you can move out and distance yourself from such a toxic cycle. remember that your mum loves you and hopefully isn't trying to cause you harm, just keep you safe. it that was my mum I would've stormed out ages ago, so kudos to you. stay strong!",
