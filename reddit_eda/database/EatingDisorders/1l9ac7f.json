  "title": "After telling people about my ED, I can no longer eat in front of them.",
  "selftext": "Hi\nI struggle with restricted eating. I am not formally diagnosed as anorexic, but my symptoms are consistent with that disorder. Recently, I told my boyfriend about my struggles. Somehow, this has made my disorder worse when I thought it would make it better. I never usually ate anything around him before telling him about my ed, but when I did it was okay. Obviously I still had guilt, but I did not have guilt and anxiety to the point I have now. Now, whenever the opportunity presents itself to eat around him, I can\u2019t without crazy guilt. I am scared that he is judging me or that he is secretly thinking that I am making my eating disorder up. As he watches me eat, all I can think about are the things I\u2019m sure he\u2019s thinking, like \u201coh she\u2019s actually eating, she must be getting better, or maybe she was just lying about it in the first place.\u201d. I don\u2019t feel like my disorder is valid because I do still eat occasionally. I do not want my boyfriend to think I am recovering when I am still struggling just the same. I also don\u2019t want him to think I am lying. But I don\u2019t want to make a big deal out of it.\n\nHave any of you guys experienced this? What should I do? It\u2019s really making life difficult for me and is making my food anxiety so much worse. Please help!",

With your boyfriend, it would probably relieve a lot of your thoughts and anxiety if you had an honest conversation about this. You took the step to tell him about your struggles, but maybe discussing it further and letting him know could help to make him a support through those thoughts.",

      "body": "When I\u2019ve told someone, I also feel like now if I eat in front of them not looking uneasy, they think I\u2019m exaggerating or on my way to recovery. I myself am figuring it out, but I too feel like telling them about this would help.\nThis disorder can make you feel like you\u2019re overdramatic or sometimes you ask yourself if you\u2019re lying or are you just looking for attention. But this is real. Would a healthy person have so much anxiety around food or starve themselves, even for attention? It is valid to think others won\u2019t take you seriously if they don\u2019t see it, because not everyone understands right away. But the right people will listen, believe and be understanding, even if they don\u2019t understand. That\u2019s my experience anyway.",

I am in a very open and honest relationship and I tell my SO when I purge and I always feel like they think I\u2019m making it up even though they give me no indication they think that. Talking through the shame I think is the best course of action since eating disorders tend to feed on shame but man is it so hard.",

      "body": "I totally get this! While I have been diagnosed with an ED, I faced similar feelings after talking to my friends about my ED. for me, I faced a lot of anxiety and uncomfort eating in front of them after telling them. Something that helped me the most was just confronting it head on. It was verrrrreyyyyyyyyy hard to do but after telling my friends about how much anxiety I felt eating around them (or just being around them) in general, it lifted a weight off my shoulders. \n\nAlso, I think it\u2019s totally normal to not feel validated in your ED. feeling like you don\u2019t have one but still having all these feelings is incredibly difficult, and I think almost everyone who has an ED feels like that at some point (I did for 5 months before I realized). Just hope you know that it probably is an ED you\u2019re dealing with, and when you feel ready recovery is always the best answer! Hope everything goes well for you!!!!!",

I struggled after having my first child and my husband helped me through it so I finally told him I thought I\u2019d slipped back into it recently after the second. For some reason, voicing it and making it more \u201creal\u201d made it much worse rather than helped. He\u2019s trying to help though which is nice to have that support even though he doesn\u2019t understand it.",
