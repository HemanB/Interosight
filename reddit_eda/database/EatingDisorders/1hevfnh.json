Recovery looks so different for everyone, and it can be really hard when it feels like others are at a place you wish you could be. But recovery isn\u2019t about looking a certain way\u2014it\u2019s about finding freedom from the habits and thoughts that used to control you and reclaiming your life.\n\nSocial media can be so misleading, especially when it comes to recovery journeys. What people show online is often just a carefully curated version of their life, and it\u2019s impossible to know the full story behind someone\u2019s photos or posts. Comparing yourself to others is a natural instinct, but remember, your body is yours. It\u2019s gotten you through so much and continues to carry you every single day.\n\nYou\u2019re not selfish for wishing things were different, but I hope you can also remind yourself of how far you\u2019ve come. Recovery is hard, but being three years into it is something to be so proud of. That progress deserves to be celebrated. Be gentle with yourself\u2014you truly deserve kindness and compassion.\n\nSending you so much strength and support. You\u2019re not alone.",
