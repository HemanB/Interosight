It all started from getting comments growing up anytime I\u2019d eat more than \u201cnormal\u201d, like asking for another helping of food. Anytime I ate junk food, there were comments. \n\nThen I saw a photo of myself. I was not overweight, but I genuinely saw myself that way. I despised how I looked. I began dieting, hiding it, plus I was really young. I lost most of the weight I had, and have pretty much been struggling since. But I became extremely restrictive a few years ago, and is now full blown anorexia. \n\nThere used to be times where I was \u201cbetter\u201d, meaning simply maintaining a weight but not necessarily a healthy one. As long as I wasn\u2019t actively losing \u2014 I took it as a win. Those times have now completely gone away. I lose some amount every month, and my doctor has stated that if this continues, they will have to implement hospitalization. Currently struggling badly but receiving outpatient treatment/therapy. \n\nIt\u2019s very exhausting, frustrating and downright scary. Sorry for the long comment. Just being honest\u2026",

      "body": "Started tracking food on a certain blue app with the intent of gaining weight in the form of muscle. Got addicted to the dopamine hits I received from seeing the calorie deficit get bigger and bigger while still getting close to my delusionally high protein goals. Then the protein part subsided and now it\u2019s all about the size of the negative number. I somehow deluded myself into believing that I could subsist off of triple digit calories and that this was my \u201cnormal\u201d just because I was able to function at a bare minimum level while eating like this. Then I started failing lifts and instead of seeing the real issue, I decided to abandon my goal of gaining muscle. The strange part is that it wasn\u2019t really about how my body looked. Like yeah weight loss became part of the goal because I bought a scale and started weighing myself multiple times a day a few weeks after I started tracking, but I\u2019m literally addicted to seeing that deficit get bigger and bigger on a fucking app. Tried deleting it, felt distress and just started writing it out in my notes app instead. I taught myself to use Microsoft excel to do the projected weight loss equation using the bmr/calories from exercise data from my Apple Watch and that was\u2026 probably one of the lowest points I\u2019ve reached. I\u2019m not even addicted to losing weight, apparently I\u2019m addicted to doing fucking math. It\u2019s ridiculous. I already have a preexisting autoimmune condition that caused chronic mono to damage my liver, so having a sufficient appetite was already difficult for me. And then my stupid ass just had to go and give myself a psychological reason to not eat as well. The worst part is as soon as I logged a single bite of an apple into the blue app that shant be named, my bf, mom, and everyone else warned me and I didn\u2019t listen. Don\u2019t count macros if you\u2019re mentally unstable at all, kids.",

I remember being proud of being skinny in elementary school and later vowing to be only a certain weight until I would turn 16 (funny to think I\u2019m still that weight 10 years later).\n\nWhen I started middle school I started getting bullied for my looks. I started purging then and when I started high school I ended up reading some pro ana stuff and while being disturbed at first, I ended up believing in it and thinking that I couldn\u2019t change how my nose looks like or if people like me but that I could be the skinniest. And that\u2019s how it started for real.\n\nI saw 2 therapists at some point and had monthly check ups at an ED clinic for 2/3 years. Eventually they let me go because my condition was very stable and I guess not bad enough to make me an inpatient. I was very happy because I thought I would be able to be sick in peace lol. \n\n5/6 years happened since I stopped getting professional help and I am okay now. I do relapse occasionally, sometimes worse than others but generally I\u2019m doing fine as long as my weight is stable. I know my triggers (lack of control, feeling insecure about my looks etc..) so I guess it helps controlling the relapses. I also got plastic surgery and it helped me tremendously to get more self confident and to not need the rush that starving gave me to feel good.",

That along with CSA made me develop a cycle of comparing my body to guys whose approval i craved, knowing full well it didn\u2019t matter if i was thin, most of them didn\u2019t even like dudes. Once one of my friends saw me in underwear and laughed at me outright at the same time that he was openly questioning his own same sex attraction it kinda broke me and i developed restrictive eating habits somewhere between anorexia and EDNOS i guess. Maybe more like bulimia since i did the whole restrict all day and binge at night, still lost an unhealthy amount of weight. Im still recovering almost 10 years later since both the binging and restriction never really left. There\u2019s better and worse periods. Self love and compassion have done a lot and so has eating in an actual healthy way. Therapy too but realistically i need a lot more of that",

I have also been a dancer since the age of 2 so have the body dysmorphia that often follows.\n\nWith the development of my anxiety my emetophobia got worse to the point where i couldn\u2019t eat for days and crying over a yoghurt because i thought it would make me sick. \n\nMy mum had noticed one day, while trying on a top, that i had lost a significant amount of weight. I was a fairly chubby kid so it was easier to recognise. I immediately told her how i was feeling and we agreed to see a doctor. The wait was excruciating and things only got worse from there. \n\nAt this point i didn\u2019t know what was wrong w me. Every time i tried to eat i got an overwhelming wave of nausea which obviously panicked me having the phobia that i do. I never linked it to the anxiousness that i was experiencing at the time. I thought i could be something wrong with my stomach. So the doctor, thinking it could be physical, ran a load of tests and nothing. He referred me to a therapist which is where i got my diagnosis. Disordered eating caused by anxiety.\n\nAfter having counselling for about a year, my anxiety, and alongside it, my eating got better. For 2022 i felt amazing.\n\nYou know how when you\u2019re recovered you can often miss your sick body? I started developing these thoughts in 2023 as my mh/body dysmorphia started to get worse. And like that i started developing characteristics often associated with anorexia.\n\nI never told my parents as i couldn\u2019t bear to put them through what i did with my anxiety. In no means do i have the often stereotyped \u2018sick body\u2019 associated with anorexia but the thoughts and my behaviour patterns are very similar. For example, i can\u2019t eat on monday, wednesday or thursday as i have dance those days and i am happy when i have to work saturday, sundays as it means i can eat less. I got insanely deep into calorie counting and running.\n\nThis has been going on for two years now and no one (that i know of) knows. Obviously my friends know about my past struggles with anxiety and eating but they all think im fine now.\n\nI am now 18 and have just been offered a place at my dream musical theatre uni. However, i am worried on how it will affect my eating. In a place that is so competitive, where i will have a lack of control of me and my future, i am worried that i will turn to my disorder to gain that comfort that it provides me with.\n\nI hope that there is someone else out there who has experienced the same thing to me and could help me to better understand why and how to cope :)",

For the first week, all I ate was a gross bag of buggels chips my mom gave me.

It's been about 2 years since then. I'm living at home and I'm in a very healthy and loving relationship but now I'm suffering the consequences of that bag of chips.\n\nRight before I started transitioning last Summer (I'm a trans man, but I presented very overly feminine before), I assumed that taking testosterone would make my curves even out and my chest would get smaller. I thought that I had been mistaking all of this for my gender dysphoria and that transitioning would help with my disordered eating.

It all started from getting comments growing up anytime I\u2019d eat more than \u201cnormal\u201d, like asking for another helping of food. Anytime I ate junk food, there were comments. \n\nThen I saw a photo of myself. I was not overweight, but I genuinely saw myself that way. I despised how I looked. I began dieting, hiding it, plus I was really young. I lost most of the weight I had, and have pretty much been struggling since. But I became extremely restrictive a few years ago, and is now full blown anorexia. \n\nThere used to be times where I was \u201cbetter\u201d, meaning simply maintaining a weight but not necessarily a healthy one. As long as I wasn\u2019t actively losing \u2014 I took it as a win. Those times have now completely gone away. I lose some amount every month, and my doctor has stated that if this continues, they will have to implement hospitalization. Currently struggling badly but receiving outpatient treatment/therapy. \n\nIt\u2019s very exhausting, frustrating and downright scary. Sorry for the long comment. Just being honest\u2026",

So my problem has been that despite losing a dangerous amount of weight in a really short amount of time, I\u2019m still not technically underweight because I was pretty decently muscled beforehand. My parents subscribed to the toxic diet culture of the 90s and every time I show up skinnier they tell me how good I look and ask me how I\u2019m losing so much weight. Your sister doesn\u2019t rlly have to worry about you doing that, since you\u2019re here trying to do research for it. I\u2019d say the way my boyfriend handles it is much better. I don\u2019t do this on purpose but admittedly sometimes I\u2019ll tell him \u201cI\u2019ve lost x amount of weight since x date\u201d because sometimes I do feel proud of it, and sometimes I\u2019ll ask him if he can tell that I\u2019ve lost weight. I think that\u2019s what people mean when they say that EDs \u201cfeed themselves.\u201d His response is usually like \u201cok. That\u2019s not a healthy amount to lose. Anyways-\u201c and we don\u2019t dwell on it, since he knows that there\u2019s not much he can say to stop it and he knows when to intervene in a medical sense. But also, since he knows I\u2019m obsessed with tracking, he doesn\u2019t ask me to stop but instead to send screenshots of my calorie count to him every day. Sometimes the fact that I know he\u2019s going to see it is enough to get me to eat a little more than usual, and since I\u2019m obsessed with measuring and tracking, I don\u2019t ever lie about what I\u2019ve eaten today on the app. He\u2019s taken a \u201cbody neutral\u201d stance to the whole thing, and he\u2019ll still tell me I\u2019m pretty, but has avoided any weight-based comments since this started.

Got addicted to the dopamine hits I received from seeing the calorie deficit get bigger and bigger while still getting close to my delusionally high protein goals. Then the protein part subsided and now it\u2019s all about the size of the negative number. I somehow deluded myself into believing that I could subsist off of triple digit calories and that this was my \u201cnormal\u201d just because I was able to function at a bare minimum level while eating like this. Then I started failing lifts and instead of seeing the real issue, I decided to abandon my goal of gaining muscle. The strange part is that it wasn\u2019t really about how my body looked. Like yeah weight loss became part of the goal because I bought a scale and started weighing myself multiple times a day a few weeks after I started tracking, but I\u2019m literally addicted to seeing that deficit get bigger and bigger on a fucking app. Tried deleting it, felt distress and just started writing it out in my notes app instead. I taught myself to use Microsoft excel to do the projected weight loss equation using the bmr/calories from exercise data from my Apple Watch and that was\u2026 probably one of the lowest points I\u2019ve reached. I\u2019m not even addicted to losing weight, apparently I\u2019m addicted to doing fucking math. It\u2019s ridiculous. I already have a preexisting autoimmune condition that caused chronic mono to damage my liver, so having a sufficient appetite was already difficult for me. And then my stupid ass just had to go and give myself a psychological reason to not eat as well. The worst part is as soon as I logged a single bite of an apple into the blue app that shant be named, my bf, mom, and everyone else warned me and I didn\u2019t listen.

So my problem has been that despite losing a dangerous amount of weight in a really short amount of time, I\u2019m still not technically underweight because I was pretty decently muscled beforehand. My parents subscribed to the toxic diet culture of the 90s and every time I show up skinnier they tell me how good I look and ask me how I\u2019m losing so much weight. Your sister doesn\u2019t rlly have to worry about you doing that, since you\u2019re here trying to do research for it. I\u2019d say the way my boyfriend handles it is much better. I don\u2019t do this on purpose but admittedly sometimes I\u2019ll tell him \u201cI\u2019ve lost x amount of weight since x date\u201d because sometimes I do feel proud of it, and sometimes I\u2019ll ask him if he can tell that I\u2019ve lost weight. I think that\u2019s what people mean when they say that EDs \u201cfeed themselves.\u201d His response is usually like \u201cok. That\u2019s not a healthy amount to lose. Anyways-\u201c and we don\u2019t dwell on it, since he knows that there\u2019s not much he can say to stop it and he knows when to intervene in a medical sense. But also, since he knows I\u2019m obsessed with tracking, he doesn\u2019t ask me to stop but instead to send screenshots of my calorie count to him every day. Sometimes the fact that I know he\u2019s going to see it is enough to get me to eat a little more than usual, and since I\u2019m obsessed with measuring and tracking, I don\u2019t ever lie about what I\u2019ve eaten today on the app. He\u2019s taken a \u201cbody neutral\u201d stance to the whole thing, and he\u2019ll still tell me I\u2019m pretty, but has avoided any weight-based comments since this started. This approach may be a little invasive depending on how close you are to your sister, but the way he\u2019s handling it has been the most helpful to me thus far.",
