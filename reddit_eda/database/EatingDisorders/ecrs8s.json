  "selftext": "In the midst of my ED, I was going to the gym three times a day, and I had a very unhealthy relationship with both food and exercise. I did hours of cardio to try to make my body look a certain way. I felt like a failure if I was not at the gym at least twice a day. Now, I don\u2019t even want to step foot in a gym. I have a negative feeling about it, but want to get my health back in check. Has anyone gone through anything similar? If so, do you have any suggestions to build a healthier relationship with the gym? Thanks in advance.",

      "body": "What helped me was that i said 'I'll go to the gym 3 to 4 times a week' to myself and really tried to see that as the goal. What got me to the whole gym loop in the first place was that staying extra time or doing more miles or reps was always a good thing and I had to continuously remind myself now that that is counterproductive for my current goal, that every time i push myself too much I'm getting away from my goal and not towards it and that it actually, really is not a good thing. I'm not saying its not a good thing for anyone, but its not good for me. At first I felt secretly proud if I did more than I planned but you just have to keep reminding yourself why you're there. It's not to lose weight. It's to be healthy and 3x/week is enough to achieve it. It's to manage to be moderate at something, and not always on the extreme.. And that's not easy",

You\u2019ll have clear guidelines for exercises, reps, and weights. \n\nLike your work sets would be:\n\nBack squat, 6 reps at 70% 1RM\n3 minutes active rest\nBack squat, 6 reps at 70% 1RM\n3 minutes active rest\nAnd so on...\n\nSo I enter the gym everyday with a clear plan; a \u201cjob\u201d that I need to complete, that I\u2019m capable of completing. \n\nThere is no \u201c1 more rep\u201d or \u201c1 more mile\u201d I\u2019m playing the long game. I know if I bust my ass and complete the job everyday I will stay healthy and keep improving. For me there is no emotion in going to the gym, I\u2019m there to work.",

      "body": "I think it has to do with shifting your goals. In the past, your goals centered around the amount of time you spent at the gym, calories burned, etc. \nWhat are your goals now as far as getting your health back in check? Improve endurance? Build strength? Focus on what you\u2019d need to do specifically to work on these goals vs how it will impact your body. Instead of going as often as possible put limits on yourself. Give yourself a max amount of time/intensity. Ie, walk for no more than 20 minutes at a 3.5mph pace. \nI also second the comment about doing classes as those already have limits built in.",

I know that many people don't agree with me and of course everyone's recovery is different.  I just know from my recovery and from what I've seen with friends that it can be easy to convince yourself that you're all better and jump back into exercise too soon.\n\nI also think that even if you decide that you're fully ready to start an exercise routine again, avoiding the gym at this point is still a good idea.  Find other ways to move your body:  do yoga, go on a bike ride, go ice skating, join a tennis club.  There are so many ways to move your body that don't involve a physical gym, and often those ways are going to be more enjoyable anyway.  I've also found that less structured forms of movement can be less triggering, although we still have to be careful of course.  But if the gym brings back so many bad memories, there's absolutely no reason to go back right now (or ever, if you don't want to).  It's possible to have a healthy activity level without stepping foot in a gym and the most important thing is avoiding situations that could cause relapse.",

I think you need to ask yourself why you're pushing yourself to go if you're not happy when you go. \n\nI took a really long time off from working out in my recovery because it's what I needed to be at a point where I viewed movement as something joyful and not as a chore.
