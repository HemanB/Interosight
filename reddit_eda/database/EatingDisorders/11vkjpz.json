  "selftext": "For over a year I\u2019ve been suffering with orthorexia. This caused me to eat completely clean but I lost a lot of weight causing me to become underweight and losing my period. I\u2019ve had severe body dysmorphia problems about my weight for the past few years, currently trying to heal myself. \n\nBut I\u2019m just so proud of myself! I\u2019ve set myself a list of fear foods and I\u2019ve already had 30 of them this year. I was telling myself not to eat cake or I will get fat. But I pushed passed those thoughts and ate it. My mum was shocked that I did. Now I\u2019m going to eat my favourite food lasagne for dinner. \n\nDoing this is improving my mental health and help me care less about food. It\u2019s the best decision I\u2019ve ever made. I hope this can help someone recover :)",

Very much proud of you for having your fear foods!! Cake is delicious :)",

I haven\u2019t even enjoyed food for a whole year because I wanted to eat incredibly healthy. Now i will try to just eat what im in the mood for and listen to my body :) \n\nThanks for the support <3",
