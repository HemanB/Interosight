  "title": "[ADVICE] My girlfriend is in ED recovery but secretly doing 65+ workout classes a month. I\u2019m scared.",
  "selftext": "Hi everyone. I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed and unsure of what to do right now. My girlfriend began ED recovery in January after we had a serious talk about her sudden weight loss. In February, she was formally diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa, Restrictive Type.\n\nShe\u2019s been working with a therapist and was cleared by a cardiologist to start light exercise in April. Since then, she\u2019s gone back to the gym, but I quickly noticed she was working out twice a day, before and after work. I brought it up in a session when I realized she\u2019d taken 15 classes in one week. Her therapist was clearly concerned, but my girlfriend dismissed it, saying she was just trying to manage stress and that one of the daily classes was usually just yoga.\n\nLast week, I brought it up again during another session. She got defensive and insisted she was only doing two classes a day, and that one of them was always gentle like yoga or stretching. She reassured both me and her therapist that she wasn\u2019t overdoing it.\n\nOver the weekend, I bought her an iPad and was helping her set it up. A notification popped up for a gym class, but it wasn\u2019t on the shared Google Calendar we use to coordinate our schedules. It was from a separate calendar account I didn\u2019t know about. I wasn\u2019t snooping\u2014this just came up while helping her\u2014but when I saw it, I opened it to see what it was.\n\nThat\u2019s when I found out she\u2019s been logging all her gym classes on this hidden calendar. She hasn\u2019t been honest with either of us.\n\nIn May alone, she went to 65 classes. So far in June, she\u2019s already been to 25. The breakdown looked like this:\n\n\t\u2022\t10 cycling\n\t\u2022\t17 boxing\n\t\u2022\t37 HIIT\n\t\u2022\t8 yoga\n\t\u2022\t18 Pilates\n\nShe has been lying to me and to her therapist about the frequency and intensity of her workouts. This feels like a shift from restrictive eating to compulsive over-exercising, and the fact that she\u2019s hiding it makes it even more dangerous.\n\nI\u2019m not angry, I\u2019m scared. I want to help her, but I don\u2019t know how to bring this up without making her shut down or feel attacked. I love her deeply and I\u2019m terrified that she\u2019s slipping further into another dangerous behavior pattern.\n\nIf anyone has been through something similar, either in your own recovery or supporting someone else, I\u2019d really appreciate any advice on how to approach this.\n\ntl;dr:\nMy girlfriend is in recovery for anorexia and has secretly been attending over 65 workout classes a month. She\u2019s been hiding the true number and intensity from both me and her therapist, using a separate calendar to track them. I\u2019m scared this is turning into compulsive over-exercising and don\u2019t know how to help without making things worse.",

Creating an environment where she feels comfortable to talk about what she\u2019s been doing without judgement is key. But, you also have to hold her accountable. I know I struggle with keeping things from my SO bc I feel like sharing might prevent me from losing weight. It becomes a situation where I feel like if I just do it a couple more times, or if I just lose x more weight. I think as much as she might hate it, a system in place to hold her more accountable to prevent working out that much or talking with her therapist to come up with a plan to help her might be the answer. I would reiterate to her you love her and care about her. Also what she is doing is not light exercise and is very dangerous.\n\nKeep in mind too her defensiveness is likely the eating disorders effort to stay, as it\u2019s serving some purpose in her life. I wish I could be more help but I don\u2019t want to give the wrong advice since everyone\u2019s so different.",

Try and use \u201cI feel\u201d statements (\u201cI feel scared that you\u2019re taking this many classes, I feel worried that you lied to me about it\u201d), give her space to share without interruptions, then focus on the steps you need her to take to move forward (telling her therapist, class schedule restrictions etc).

It\u2019s very difficult and although she seems defensive and mad deep down she knows that this impacts you as well. \n\nHere\u2019s a few things my fiance did for me while going through this \n- game nights (a date night not revolved around food) at home where I was comfortable and a place I could be in pajamas or sweats so I could be warm. \n\n- your brain gets WARPED. During this. Don\u2019t necessarily love bomb her it\u2019ll scare her but making sure she feels loved, small gifts, making her tea in the mornings (I loved this because it was warm and zero ya knows, also promotes something hydrating) \n\n- don\u2019t be afraid to touch her (like with consent obviously) my fiance hated the feeling so he would see me and not want to give me any hugs or cuddle or anything, understandably. For me that made things worse. \n\n(Idea here is ways to open up more to you and can also take away from workout time)\n\nI would also try to see a therapist separate from hers/yours and get your own, this impacts you a lot and you\u2019re not a professional, don\u2019t try to be. Get help on how to help her! I did this for my fiance with anxiety, even if you don\u2019t see immediate results you can at least get a place where your words are safe and you can get your feelings off your chest. \n\nGood luck and so sorry you and her have to go through this.",

That was my personal experience at least. I still struggle a lot but knowing I have a support network and people who care about me help so much. I\u2019ve relapsed (multiple times, have just had one again after 4 years)  and indulged in behaviors I used to I can look back and notice how scary it is to watch. It was addicting like a frenzy for me and fueled me but that\u2019s how it was for me; except it didn\u2019t fuel them it debilitated them! You\u2019re doing the right thing and have the right intentions but you may get lots of pushback. That pushback is never anything personal really, it\u2019s someone doing what they think they need to do to survive even when it\u2019s killing them. It\u2019s such a hard battle and I\u2019m so sorry she\u2019s dealing with it. I just want you to know that going with her to therapy and admitting things that will knowingly upset her but In the end anyone I ever shared with made me realize that I have to get better. She may hate you sometimes but it\u2019s because you\u2019re taking some sort of control away and that feels so insurmountable when you\u2019re actively in your ed. It\u2019s entirely incomprehensible to understand adddictions fully, especially as a caring and good spouse  if you haven\u2019t been through one I think unfortunately. We still love you at the end of the day but we are so burdened with this relationship with our body that it can take up so much space and we cant let you invade that.  You have every right to your feelings and your nerves but know that showing up gracefully and patiently will make the difference when she is able to make it happen!! Best of luck to your relationship and her recovery!",
