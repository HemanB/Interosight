  "selftext": "Hi all! \n\nI noticed a lot of transgender individuals posting in the main ed subs. As a trans man myself, i felt like it would be beneficial to have another safe space for us all within the reddit ED community.\n\nI created r/transED to accomplish just that. It will be a strictly pro-recovery environment for trans people to discuss and vent about their struggles with disordered eating, especially in relation to their gender dysphoria.\n\nI really hope this sub is able to grow and blossom! Thank you to everyone who joins.\n\n\nps: memes ARE allowed!",

Actually I founded and ran a nonprofit all on my own, Mira Alto Foundation, that\u2019s purpose was to vet all residential and inpatient Eating Disorder Facilities to make sure they new how to properly care for this group of people and that it was done with dignity and respect.\nYou would think this wouldn\u2019t be necessary in 2020, but we have a long way to go!\nUnfortunately I had to shut Mira Alto Foundation down due to lack of funds and broken promises.\nJust contact me if you need help!",
