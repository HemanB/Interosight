I was trapped by my thought beliefs and rules. \n\nI just caught myself having a vegan chick*n wrap and I broke two rules: having a whole tortilla AND adding vegan mayo! \n\nEven a year ago I would feel disgusted with myself, but I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t feel disgusted with myself. You won\u2019t always feel disgusted with yourself. There\u2019s light at the end of the tunnel. I PROMISE, keep going! ",
