  "selftext": "Not sure how relevant this is to the sub but no friends I can actually share this with for obvious reasons. \n\nGrowing up I always had issues with my teeth which are probably due to binging tendencies looking back now. My dentist at the time wasn\u2019t the nicest of people around it even if he didn\u2019t know and always used to make comments like \u201cWhat procedure are we doing today then?\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019ve damaged another one *sigh*\u201d. \n\nGood I got the treatments but his small side comments and attitude made me so anxious about going to the dentist. Once I moved location for university I didn\u2019t really think anything about finding another dentist. Then something came up with one of my teeth a few years ago. At the time I hoped it would just go but obviously that never happened. About a year in I realised the only way to treat it was with antibiotics, but I still wasn\u2019t ready to go back to the dentist so I just left it again\ud83e\udd27\n\nRecently one of my uni friends got a dental procedure done and was speaking about how nice the dentist was so I decided it was finally time to face my fears and have my teeth checked. Before this I was expecting him to ask why there are so many cavities etcetera so I was rehearsing mentally how to tell him that I have problems with food\ud83d\ude05\n\nI went a few days ago and she was right. Super kind, didn\u2019t chastise me for my teeth and made sure to explain everything to me so that I could understand it. \n\nI know this isn\u2019t a step forward for the ED but it\u2019s definitely a step forward in my mental and physical health\ud83e\udd79",
