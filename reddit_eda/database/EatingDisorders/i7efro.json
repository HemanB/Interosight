  "selftext": " \n\nSo ive had a eating disorder since i was young years old.(trauma related) Ive been through them all. Anorexia, bulimia, binge eating. Anything eating disordered ive been there.\n\nWhen i met my boyf i was anorexic. This was over 10 years ago. I went through bulimia and binge eating since. Up and down in shape non stop. He acceptted it up till few years ago where binge eating took over and i put on extreme amount weight pretty quick in few years and i became pretty unhealthy. Im pretty tall lucky so its evened out over my body but im still alot heavy..\n\nAnyway he started saying to me he was worried for my health and it wasnt healthy and i needed to exercise so we could go on walks together and i needed eat better and stuff and Didnt find me attractive anymore.\n\nI agreed and i not happy how i looked or felt. I stopped binging pretty much at around xmas. Ive not binged once since. Ive lost alot weight. I wont say how much as im not sure a numbers allowed or not.\n\nHowever heres the issue. My boyf says i look no different and recently text me saying i looked like id put all my weight back on and looked fat and unhealthy again. When what actually happened is id just been eating normally for few weeks for a break from loosing.i didnt loose or put on any weight in those two weeks.i staid exactly the same weight. In those two weeks i stopped reporting every other day id lost a bit weight to him. So i think psychology he made me fatter in his head?? After he sent that i cried and cried for ages. I felt my big weight loss had meant nothing if i still looked just how i did before.\n\nIf i eat he rolls his eyes and judges me for it. Which really doesnt help me.\n\nI want to be healthy again but i still have binging urges constantly but im controling them but they are there daily.he has no idea how hard it is. He eats a big bar chocolate for pudding every day. I cant do that.\n\nI have a few health disorders that make loosing weight harder too like pcos and underactive thyriod ect.\n\nMy mum saw me after not having seen me for multiple months and said i looked quite alot better. So i know it is visable and the scales dont lie. Niether do the photos.\n\nI want to be healthy yes but i feel like theres alot pressure from my boyf and its making me feel really bad about myself. I should feel goid ive lost and im healthier. Im still classed as heavy so i have some more to loose but i should be pleased.\n\nLoosing all i did isnt easy when inside you wsnt to binge so badly. I have so many in dealt with emotional issues. I just feel like i cant eat right now. Parts me is greatful because i want be healthier but part of me is really annoyed. Id like to enjoy having a snack and feel not judged about it once in a while.\n\nIdk. I know he is just trying to help but it feels not so good sometimes. I dont know how to talk to him about it. I have pressure from myself i dont need it from him too.",

      "body": "Honestly, I think you should drop him. If he wants you to eat healthy that\u2019s good, but from what I read, he just criticizes your body and is very judgmental. Your boyfriend literally body shames you and isn\u2019t supporting you through your recovery journey. \n\nWhen he makes negative comments about your body, he\u2019s really just being toxic. You deserve to be loved no matter what you look like and having him judge you is not right. I\u2019m also glad that you are eating healthier, and you need to know that you deserve to eat well and have good health. \n\nIf he judges you for eating or looking a certain way, that\u2019s not a healthy relationship. If he doesn\u2019t care about your issues or refuses to take the time to listen and understand you, you need to leave him. You are worth much more than you think and you deserve way better than anyone like him. I don\u2019t know the full context, but this is my advice to you. Stay healthy and remember to love yourself!",

      "body": "I know it's not nice to hear from us that he does not sound like a supportive partner, but I hope perhaps it is tough love that is helpful. The last thing you need in a partner is someone who is going to criticize your eating habits and your body. That is the last thing you need... That feels like conditional love. I understand you have been together a long time, but there are people out there who will appreciate your physical appearance at any size and you can be examples for you in how to eat normally and who will cheer you on in just living your life without disordered thoughts or behaviours. I don't know the whole story though so I am really deeply sorry if you feel like I am being too blunt and unfair.\n\nIf you do actually need to lose weight for your health, it won't likely come from a place of hating your body and trying to please your boyfriend. \n\nIn all honesty, I feel like how dare you be made to feel like maintaining your weight is a failure. I feel angry about that because not bingeing is a pretty major thing, and it is not typical that people lose weight consistently every week, even with consistent effort. Extra sodium, extra carbs, eating late, not pooping, extra exercise, hormones, etc all affect your scale weight and have nothing to do with fat loss or gain.\n\nI really wish you the best. I hope that you take some time to reflect on what is best for you and you do what you need to do to advocate for that, whatever that may be.",

If he doesn't change things will get worse AND you deserve to feel good about the amazing progress you've made. And by feeling good, I mean just being able sit with yourself and celebrate your accomplishments and bask in a healthier you. You don't need any more chatter. It doesn't matter if he can't or won't change. The results are the same regardless. If you were giving your best friend advice who is in a similar situation what would you say? Best of luck to you.",

My weight is by no means dangerous to me. Im not extremely overweight. My doctors arnt concearned by it or anything. My mental health is by far more a priority. I think its something i will have bring up with my therapist and ask how best to approach this with my boyf. Thanks for your reply",
