  "selftext": "when i was in the hospital for an eating disorder, there was this little girl who was there too.. im not gonna name her but she was 8 and by the time i left she turned 9.. i miss her a lot because she was so sweet.. she had a feeding tube and she had one ever since i got there.. when i got tubed, she saw that i had been crying and she came up to me and hugged me and we like talked for a while and she was so sweet and genuinely made me feel a little better. she always knew the way to cheer someone up just by being her. dont get me wrong she had a lot of fits bc shes young but she was still the best. she left before i did to go somewhere else in a different state but since she was only 9 she didnt have any way to communicate with me when she left. i just hope she is doing well and i would like to know if she is okay so maybe one day ill be able to.",
