      "body": "You can absolutely still have anorexia. I have it and I don\u2019t exercise much. It\u2019s just too exhausting for me. In my opinion, anorexia is more about the thoughts and feelings around food, body, weight and/or exercise than it is about specific behaviours and physical appearance and functioning. It\u2019s a mental illness with varying physical and behavioural effects.",

      "body": "Yes! When I was my most ill with anorexia, I HATED any form of movement because I just did not have any energy, and my body felt so fragile. I was worried that I would die if I exercised. I would do anything to get out of gym class, and I was in a community sports program (that I loved before I got sick) and I would lock myself in the bathroom and refuse to go. I also hated walking. \n\nI did have some movement things like I refused to sit down between certain hours of the day, but otherwise, I didn't have any energy to exercise. When I was hospitalized, my roommate who also had anorexia, would walk around in circles on our floor and I thought she was being silly. I had no desire to do that.\n\nI'm just going to add that once I started eating regularly, I dealt with extreme hunger and at that time, I relied on exercise to keep me feeling okay about eating, and that was compulsive exercise and I had to break that in order to have the level of recovery that I have now.",

      "body": "I think this is pretty common. I relapsed hard into my ED and crossed into Anorexia territory with restriction (rather than bulimia which was my first diagnosis) because I couldn\u2019t exercise after donating blood. (I don\u2019t recommend donating blood as a minor at the bottom of the weight limit as an average height female.) I was using the exercise to rationalize eating enough. Exercise is viewed by many as a way to purge. (Ie I ate x so now I\u2019m going to exercise to burn it off) Exercise can be good for many people but it is not good for someone who is actively struggling with a restrictive ED and can easily lead to injury as your body can\u2019t heal itself as well. \n\nAlso if you think you have an ED you should talk to a doctor/therapist/psychiatrist/dietician.",
