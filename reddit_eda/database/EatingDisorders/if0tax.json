  "selftext": " \n\nHey, I\u2019m looking for tips. Basically, I don\u2019t know if I have an ED and tbh I don\u2019t think I do but I definitely need some help with some  healthy habits. How do you stop feeling guilty about eating? I have been restricting intensely for a long time now and this week I\u2019ve had quite a few slip ups and I\u2019m trying to move past it and pretend I don\u2019t care but it\u2019s eating me alive, I feel like I have to make up for it and that I\u2019m disgusting. My sister made me a cheesecake, because i used to love eating it, and so obviously I had to have it, and I do love cheesecake and couldn\u2019t control myself and I binged for about two days and now I\u2019m so upset because I\u2019ve probably gained so much weight. How do you guys move on and stop feeling so guilty?",

      "body": "It sounds like you\u2019re losing that perception. Your post includes some classic descriptions of ED behavior. Restriction, guilt after eating, not enjoying foods you used to love etc. Many people with EDs don\u2019t believe they have them because of warped body image or perceiving their ED behavior as necessary or normal. The behaviors you describe are not normal things that everyone does, they are disordered. It would be worth talking to a therapist or registered dietician about.",
