  "title": "Request: My Best Friend Has an ED",
  "selftext": "My best friend told me last night that she has an eating disorder and body dysmorphia. She didn't specify which one, just \"not anorexia\". She counts calories obsessively and always talks about and worries about being fat. She is on the lower end of healthy weight, toeing underweight. She asks me occasionally if I think she's fat. I don't know what to do because I know she isn't fat but also don't want to feed into her preoccupation with food and appearance. She knows she has an ED, I'm not asking how to get her into rehab. I just don't know what to say to her to not be problematic for her ED but also make her feel ok. I get so annoyed with the constant \"no I shouldn't eat that\". I hear her out and try to sort of balance her views on it but I feel like I enable her by acting like talking obsessively about calories is normal or ok (she knows it's not though). I need advice on how to act and talk about this sort of thing. I've never had to deal with it until now. When she says \"I'm so fat\" \"I shouldn't eat that\" \"I hate myself for eating this\" what should I say?",

This disorder largely involves self hatred and one ounce of judgment could make someone feel worse. I think you need to let them know you care about them for who they are, not what they look like but do worry about how they process feelings about themselves and offer to help find resources to treat. I told only 3 people in my circle about my ED and oddly, none of them ever asked or acknowledged it again after I finally told them. It hurts that it took a lot for me to tell my 10 year secret looking for support and at the moment they were great, but am really on my own. I dont blame them, people dont understand and are scared to say the wrong thing.",

Even though all my friends knew I had an ED (I didn\u2019t realize they all knew. I thought I was doing a good job at hiding it).... I didn\u2019t tell anyone for years. When I did finally become open to talk about it that was a huge step toward recovery for me. I think it\u2019s ok to tell her she\u2019s not fat or that she can eat something. \n\u201cI\u2019m fat\u201d \u201cnot at all, your beautiful\u201d \n\u201cI can\u2019t eat that\u201d \u201cyes you can\u201d",

      "body": "What my husband does, and I find very helpful, is that he never makes any comments at all about my weight or my eating habits. He lets me vent (to a point, he offers alternatives like distractions when I start to ruminate) when I am frustrated, and he supports me when I brag about accomplishing something that makes me happy and healthfully achieved. He voices neutral concern when I relapse into unhealthy or negative habits, but doesn\u2019t police me. Never peer pressures me into eating or not eating. \n\nHe also spontaneously praises me for other, non-weight related attributes and accomplishments.\n\nIt should be noted I have had therapy before. It should also be noted you can\u2019t force someone into treatment before their ready. You can keep the option open, offer resources when they ask, but you can\u2019t steamroll and expect success.",

I think one of the best things you can do in your case is to not allow her to normalise ED behaviours. And often ppl with Eds ask questions to other people to make them feel better - like reassurance that they are too thin/not fat. I think it's better for you to explain bluntly in those situations that it's not healthy for you to have those convos with her because it doesn't help with recovery.",

In  order to reach a dangerous weight, you still have the same mentality. My mom took me to the dr when I was 110lbs.. and kept going back until I was 35Kg. Only then, they said they'd help. Then when  I relapsed I was too heavy for help, which  led to another massive spiral. But this was 17 years ago so  I'm hoping things have changed. She  needs  to go and be 100% honest about the extent  of the issue or they'll be  super dismissive. She needs to  make it clear that although her weight isn't dangerously low, her mindset is in  need of help. Culture has become much better/removing the stigma of mental health issues but sometimes I feel like eating disorders are the very last are to see progress",
