  "selftext": "I'm just mainly really happy because as of this month, I have been 100% recovered from both my anorexia and bulimia :) that means no relapses, no starving, no purging, no binging and no SI. When my ED first hit, i never thought I could get out, I never thought one year clean would happen. And really I'm here to say it can happen, and it's a wonderful feeling to be free and you CAN do it. There is hope for all you.\n",
