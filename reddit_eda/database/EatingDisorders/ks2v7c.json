  "selftext": "So, I'll try to make this as brief as I can.  My daughter is 13, and very overweight.  I raised her as a single dad for most of her life, so I take full responsibility for her issues with food, as I have food issues, and am overweight myself.  In fact, the majority of my maternal family has food/weight issues.  They just say \"oh, we're just italian\". But that doesn't make it ok, for me.  \n\nMy daughter had been binge eating, I guess, and sneaking food.  Every time I turn around to get something to use for dinner or whatever, it's missing, or half the block of cheese is gone, or there's an empty container of something, with 1 left.  That's a trademark of hers.  Leaving 1 or 2 of whatever it is in the package.  Unfortunately, due to my work hours and her school hours, she is home for a little bit in the mornings and after school.  Maybe 2 hours combined.  I'm sure this is when she does most of it.\n\nI'm well aware professional help is needed, and we've been to a few therapists, who just didn't seem to care, and didn't make any progress, so I'm searching for another now.  However, I know that can take a long time to get under control, so I'm terrified for her, for the time being.  I've considered getting cameras in the house, I've considered putting locks on the fridge and cabinets, but both of these options seem like they could cause more harm than good.  I don't know what to do to control it for now.    \n\nPlease, I welcome ANY suggestions.",

I guess I wouldn\u2019t approach it like the problem is that she is overweight, but more that you are worried about her happiness.  And you could speak about your own experience with food as a touch point, that it makes you feel badly about yourself, or upsets or worries you, so you wonder if she feels that way?  And that it\u2019s been hard for you to manage in your own life.  And that you love her and think she\u2019s wonderful whatever she eats and whatever she weighs.",

If she is binge eating, there are multiple things to consider, including but not limited to:\n1. Speak with her about it from a supportive, non-judgemental place. Do NOT make it about her weight, the cost of food, etc etc. Shame/guilt is one of the WORST parts of eating disorders and it may just make things worse. \n2. Does she have an underlying medical issue ie. Celiac (any malabsorption disorder), PCOS, hyperthyroidism, etc. See your doctor and ensure there is nothing else going on before self diagnosing her. \n3. Is she restricting? It may not be intentional on her end or obvious to you (if you have your own difficulty with food). Maybe she has had food insecurity in the past or perhaps has felt guilty about her eating, which can lead to mental restrictions surrounding food even if she is not physically restricting herself... What I mean by this is that feeling guilty about eating certain types of food can actually feel like restriction to the brain, even if you are eating them or eating lots of other things. \n4. If your daughter needs help/support, find a WEIGHT neutral/body positive physician, therapist, or psychiatrist that specialize in EDs. Speak with them first and ensure their views align with your daughter's and yours. Ensure they are not focused on weight, BMI, \"health\". It won't help in the long term. \n\nHope this helps. Full transparency, I had an ED for 20 years. I'm now fully recovered and in the \"overweight\" BMI range. I have never felt healthier, more energetic or more happy. I have a completely normal relationship with food/body - I eat when I'm hungry, eat what I feel like (varies a lot) and stop when I'm full. I don't stress about food. I'm now a physician and I never could have got here with continuing restriction (which is the underlying cause of the majority of binges). This isn't meant to be medical advice AT ALL, just speaking from experience and it's important to point out that women with eating disorders often do not reach their potential in life and I feel SO grateful for my recovery so I can do what I love as a career and have the life I truly want.",

I can remember how it felt to be overweight and the compulsion to binge is very difficult to control at such a young age as a child\u2019s brain is not fully developed. A professional with experience dealing with children specifically would be able to give the best steps for your daughter. I had locks put in the house but this may not be the best approach for your daughter. I know it helped me, as my father explained to me calmly and with love that it was to help me and not to punish me. Definitely if you approach your daughter with patience and understanding, together you can help her get better. It may also be a case of outgrowing the behaviour. It is tricky for kids to implement skills learned in therapy, but do not give up. All the best \u2764\ufe0f",

      "body": "Disclaimer: Blame is not my goal simply awareness of potential triggers. \n\nI was sneaking food, because my mother had already started trying to control my weight. Every snack I\u2019d attempt to eat would be scrutinized or shut down, so I stopped wanting people to know that I ate at all. The thought of you installing cameras or locks literally made me cry. The thought of how wrong it would make her feel for following probably very urgent-feeling urges she\u2019s having is very upsetting. \n\nYour post is self critical, which is fine, but I would say one step you can take is to not criticize your daughter\u2019s weight or make her feel guilty or wrong for being hungry or in a larger body. Also she\u2019s a teenager! Many young women gain weight at the outset of puberty.\n\nOne of the most detrimental things for my eating disorder was my mother doing these things:\n\nA. Making me feel wrong for having extra body fat\nB. Equating happinesses with weight/size\nC. Stopping me from having things I wanted. \nD. Constantly analyzing both what I was eating and the way my body looked. \n\nSome phrases as a 13 year old that were triggering for me \u201cyou\u2019re really getting kind of heavy.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not something girls your size should wear\u201d \u201cThe kitchen is closed! No more snacks!\u201d \u201cWhy are you eating? You can\u2019t possibly be hungry\u201d \u201cshe can afford to eat that. You can\u2019t\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re a wonderful parent for trying to understand and get ahead of this. I STRONGLY recommend the book Anti-Diet by Chrissy Harrison (for your understanding, it\u2019s a bit dry for a 13 year old). My therapist recommended it to me. It covers a lot of things regarding weight stigma/psychological, efficacy of diets, the dangers of weight cycling vs staying heavier, etc. \n\nSomething to remember is this. It is not morally wrong to have a larger body. It is not morally superior to have a smaller body. Trying to treat an eating disorder with \u201ca healthy diet\u201d or further limiting access to foods can literally just shift the type/manifestation of the disorder. \nMy experience at 13 sounds very similar to your daughter\u2019s. Shortly after the binging, I began restricting/anorexic behaviors. Since then, I\u2019ve spent 20 years cycling between binging, anorexic, orthorexic, and bulimic behaviors. Having a young girl thinking there is something wrong with her body is a recipe for continued disordered eating.\n\nEvery young girl is bombarded with the message that she has to be thin to be worthy. Some people are genuinely just genetically larger bodied. Be one of the voices in her life to let her know that her body is fine at whatever size it is and that she should never be ashamed or guilty about her body.",
