  "selftext": "It looks like I will soon be going back to the office after working from home for a few months due to lockdown. I've lost a lot of weight in that time, and knowing how diet-focused the women in my office are, I'm worried about their comments and questions. I don't think that the answer of, \"Healthy diet\" is going to convince anyone.\n\nPlease help me out - how do you answer when people ask you how you lost weight?\n\nWhen I used to cut myself and people would ask what my scars were from I had a really outlandish story that involved me being attacked by a lion. People never questioned it and it was hilarious to see reactions. I'm almost tempted to come up with something similarly odd about the weight loss. I'm just so nervous though.",

Telling people straight up that I have ED and it\u2019s not healthy, and it\u2019s not something to try. People get embarrassed sometimes, but it doesn\u2019t make me feel so bad anymore, because it\u2019s really not okay to comment on people\u2019s weight. We have no idea what someone may be dealing with, and comments like that can be very detrimental to a person w ED. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if that makes sense but when I was in the pits of my ED people asking me about my weight and commenting on my body made it ten times harder to recover bc in my mind I was able \nto rationalize it and made me feel justified in what I was doing. \n\nI understand and empathize with your anxiety, I used to also be afraid to say anything and felt a lot of shame around my ED. I feel being blunt and honest helps give me some of my power back. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable going into detail or discussing it, here\u2019s a few different options:\n-redirect the conversation to something else\n-\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it\u201d \n-I got sick with a stomach virus/food poisoning\n-I\u2019m not comfortable discussing this\nAnd the other lovely tips posted by other users. \n\nMy heart goes out to you and I hope that everything goes smoothly. :)",
