  "selftext": "I\u2019ve been having more binging sessions because I\u2019m at home all the time. I\u2019ve also been snacking a lot out of boredom but also stress. It doesn\u2019t help that we have extra food at home. \n\nIt\u2019s not good because whenever I go shopping, there\u2019s not a lot of food left at the grocery stores. I feel bad because we need to make whatever we have last. Just so that we don\u2019t make too many trips to the store. \n\nI can\u2019t seem to stop even though I feel disgusted with myself and guilty but I keep doing the same thing the next day. Food is constantly on my mind. \n\nAny advice on how to cope with this?",

But, if you are anyhing like me, after you finish with a binge you feel worse.\n\nI always try to pause when I can, try to slow down, especially while binging and ask myself if I am really feeling hungry or if I am eating because I am stressed/tired/bored and then try to address what it is.\n\nUsually reading, calling a friend, playing a video game, or going on a walk really works to help me destress or be less bored. \n\nIf I am actually hungry I eat, but these days I only have healthy things in the house and so I figure if I do binge, binging on apples and greens and beans is an okay choice.",

I totally feel you in the feelings of guilt/shame surrounding going to the grocery store in the midst of a global crises and having to get more pasta because you ate way more than necessary in one day. It\u2019s kinda what I\u2019ve been struggling with as we\u2019ve been in in quarantine. I\u2019ve been bingeing on some days and not eating on others which is terrible and not good for me but makes me feel like I\u2019m not completely blowing through all my food. Something I\u2019m trying to work on is eating after a binge. I don\u2019t know if you purge or restrict but eating the day after a binge is important \u2014 the more we restrict/purge the more likely we are to indulge in a binge again. I\u2019m not sure if you do that but it\u2019s definitely a huge issue for me. So eating after a binge is really important and I also second walking. Taking walks has not only helped me with me ED but also really helped when I\u2019m struggling with depression and/or suicidal ideation. Walking is one of the best things you can do and it\u2019s super accesible and quarantine friendly!  Sending my love to you and everyone struggling with this over quarantine. We have to remind ourselves of our value and worth and work hard to surrender those feelings of shame and guilt",

All I can say is I've been there, I feel for you and feel free to DM, quarantined and more than happy to help. Also thousands of people are volunteering for mental illness right now so do not feel at all hesitant to call or texting a crisis hotline. Your health is worth it!! \n\nAlso: had a really bad relapse with mental health and binging with it that lasted 3 months, just now am getting out of it and 1) really grateful that I don't have FOMO because I would have kept myself home in shame and 2) I actually told all of my friends about it, and they actually understand, and even though I haven't seen them and gained a lot of weight after they used to make sure I was eating... we are teaching each other some yoga classes on zoom and a LOT of us gained weight because the winter and this too. You're verrry not alone. I turned off my video on zoom but realized my friends and I have been teaching and practicing together for so long we are kind of used to each other's bodies and movement evolve. I would never call anyone before a binge of course but when it was dormant and now that it is passing I'm fine not only telling them but letting them see me. I don't know if that helps but I promise I understand and we are all here for you.",
