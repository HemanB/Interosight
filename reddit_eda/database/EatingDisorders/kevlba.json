It\u2019s all that repeats in my head from the time I wake up to the time I go to sleep and it\u2019s so exhausting. Idk how to begin to explain it to my husband.

If you have a normal routine with food, it's practically impossible to gain weight.Breakfast, lunch and dinner, all comprised of reasonably healthy and filling foods, it will never go over.\n\nHell, in my calorie counting days, I had plenty of day where I was way way -under- my target for the day despite trying to level out. Fruit and vegetables have so much bulk it doesn't warrant worrying about in the slightest.\n\nAll in all, it helps being *aware* of calorie density... but we have to learn to trust ourselves. Our bodies know what to do with the food they're given. Micromanaging only harms our sanity.",
