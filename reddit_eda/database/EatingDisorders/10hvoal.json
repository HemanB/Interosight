  "selftext": "It\u2019s just so exhausting, having guilt and emotion EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU EAT.  Whether you\u2019re restricting or purging or doing any ED behaviors, there is still the guilt. I can only imagine how peaceful of a life it is when you can eat something, feel nothing and go about your day. Does this mean that even when behaviors aren\u2019t performed, you\u2019re still not actually recovered because of the feelings you still have surrounding food and self worth? If so how can you ever make those go away. After 21 years of dealing with my issues I just always wonder if there is an end in sight.",
