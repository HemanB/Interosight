      "body": "No!!! I certainly didn't copy anyone when I was sick.\n\nI had been insecure about my body since kindergarten, and I kept wanting to go on a diet. I had heard of diets from family members. I didn't even know what calories were, but grade 5 was a stressful  year for me, and I 'finally' started dieting. I didn't have any guidance. I just started eating less and less, and feeling amazing about it.\n\nI did not need to lose weight whatsoever, but I thought I did. I just kept making new ruled and getting stricter and stricter. I didn't even know what anorexia was. I thought this was a special secret hobby that made me happy and made me feel special and everyone in my life was an enemy to me if they tried to make me eat or sit down. \n\nI told myself I would keep it up until I hit a certain weight, but I found I couldn't stop. I was a little worried when I realized this, but I also didn't think much of it and kept up my routines. I felt I had to live that way forever and I felt like I was content to do that as that became easier than eating properly. \n\nI did have some scares. One day it was when I saw what my body looked like and saw something that scared me. One day it was when I blacked out and had to lie on the bathroom floor until I felt better. \n\nBut even so, I would keep going and those things would become a new standard. I would feel not good enough if I didn't black out, for example.\n\nI don't think I ever would have admitted truly to myself or anyone that something was wrong. I heard the word anorexia for the first time when I was admitted to the hospital. \n\nIn a way, I was lucky that I was so young because I didn't need to ask for help myself. My parents were taking me to a lot of doctors that whole time. The doctors would talk to my parents behind closed doors, and my parents would never share what they were talking about. \n\nSo to answer your question, this was very much something that was within me. I didn't know what I was doing at all. My sisters developed ED's after me. They could have conceivably been seen as having \"copied\" me, but they both became sick in different ways. Some people have a genetic disposition to develop these compulsions after a period of prolonged restriction. It is a great way to survive a famine. Not a great way to survive modern life.",

      "body": "I\u2019m honestly not really sure. I have BED and tend to frequently go through restriction phases that then lead to massive binges. I have never been and am not fat, but I\u2019ve always been an overeater when it comes to snacks. I remember coming home from elementary school and eating so much that I would be too full for dinner. This of course annoyed my parents and led to them limiting my snack intake, which then just led to me snacking in secret and then also forcing myself to eat as much of my dinner as possible. I think that this is what ended up leading me to eat large quantities of food. I\u2019m also really weird about snacking now and pretty much always do it in private, and I have pretty major food guilt. The restricting I think comes from having a very thin best friend going up. She was naturally thin but was obsessed with staying that way and I remember from as early as age 11 she would have us weigh ourselves every single time we hung out so she could compare her weight to mine. She also ate like a bird, she wouldn\u2019t even eat a goldfish cracker in one bite. These things of course obviously made my young self very insecure and it basically ended up becoming a competition of us trying to eat less than the other. It was rough.",

My mum commented on my weight a lot and compared me to my friends of the same age who were built more slim. \n\nI gained weight after my first year of university (think freshman\u2019s 15) and my mothers comments didn\u2019t stop. I then started using apps to count calories and started restricting heavily. I lost a lot of weight but received nothing but praise. I didn\u2019t think that I was doing anything wrong for a long time but the guilt I felt from eating was immense. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I went to a music festival and got really drunk on an empty stomach and completely broke down into tears because I hated my appearance and thought I was fat (looking back I was actually very slim). My boyfriend at the time had no idea what was going on but tried to comfort me. I realized how irrational this was and that was the moment that I considered I might have an ED. \n\nI don\u2019t think it came from social media at all but I definitely used social media (particularly 2013/14 fitspo era) to \u201cmotivate\u201d myself to restrict. I broke down and told my mother one day and she also insinuated that I was overreacting. Reflecting now I do realize that so many ED behaviours are secretive so I can see why parents struggle to understand or believe their children when they tell them, but I\u2019m sure everyone would appreciate more empathy.. I think/hope the next generation of parents will be more understanding.",

      "body": "My mom has an eating disorder.\n\nI didn't realize it for a LONG time but she would always call herself fat when I was younger (at most she was 130 and 5'3). She's not 5'3 and like 105 pounds and thinks she's fat because she has a permanently boated stomach (gastrointestinal issues). \n\nWhen I was younger, she refused to have any snacks in the house (which I actually think made me and my siblings crave junk food more in the long run). She would binge whenever we had sugary foods around (try to hide, or out it in her purse, and basically eat as quickly as she could, usually without a utensil). She would drink diet coke alll day long, decided to become a vegetarian as an excuse to get out of eating with us (nothing against vegetarians! Its really just a way for her to get out of most dinners!)...\n\nSo I consciously and subconsciously noticed this. I also noticed how my dad would always comment on my sister's weight (she's 38 now, absolutely gorgeous but she's naturally curvy and doesn't work out). She's 5'3 and probably 160 right now.\n\nMy dad and brother have commented on my weight since I hit puberty.  They mainly comment on how puffy my face is or how I should eat better for my own self confidence...\n\nThings got worse with my ex. We started dating when I was 21. I was very depressed when we met and underweight because I had no appetite. We dated for about 8 years and the only time he complimented me on my appearance was 1) When I could barely stand I was so frail (he told me I had the perfect body) and 2)... He would tell me I was the best girlfriend because I was small (he clarified that he meant my vagina was small).\n\nRight now, Im at my biggest. Im 130 and 5'4 and I am not happy about it but I'm with a good guy who loves me first as a person and finds me attractive regardless of whether I weight 104 or 134.\n\nMy weight is still up and down.
