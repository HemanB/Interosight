  "title": "BRANDY MELVILLE DOC WARNING",
  "selftext": "Hi everyone. I bet a lot of people here have heard about the new Brandy Melville documentary that just came out on Max last night. I watched it last night and really wanted to warn anyone about it before they watch it as it includes some extremely triggering things. I have been in recovery for the past 4 years and do not get triggered by certain things easily anymore, but god damn there was something about this doc that was brutal to watch at times. Please Please do not watch it if you are not in a really good place with yourself and food. please take care of yourself, all love \ud83d\udc9c\ud83e\udef6 ",
