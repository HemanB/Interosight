  "selftext": "so like the title says she barely eats. It started 3 years ago. Idk how it started, she never told me. But the first month i also didnt handle well. after the first month i calmed down a lot and i would calmly talk to her about it. She's always been under weight too. For what she does eat I've been adding extra calories. an she also takes vitamins. well its finally come out that she just doesn't wanna be fat like me. Thats cool i don't mind i know she still loves me. Well I've talked to her about healthier ways to go about that an we do eat as healthy as possible with our budget. She's also in therapy and I'm constantly having as positive of conversations as i can about this but I'm at a loss nothing has improved. Please i need advice.",

Give her compliments based on her personality. \nSpend quality time with her. \nMake her focus on something unrelated to food, weight etc. \n\nI had an eating disorder in my teens, It gave me a sense of accomplishment and control as I had low self esteem and self worth. \n\nBeing told that I mattered, that I was valued as a friend, that I had talent and a good heart. When people treated me kindly. Seeing that people cared. \n\nIt motivated me to get better, I realized that life had more fulfilling meaning. \n\nI remember dwelling deeper into my destructive habits when people started distancing themselves from me, when people made awful comments about my appearance, pointed out that I looked frail and unhealthy.

      "body": "I've suffered with bulimia since I was 11 (currently 18). I want to advise you heavily not to comment when she eats more than usual (if she ever does). Or when she eats in general. This illness (especially anorexia) is a way for her to have control. In most cases, it's a subcategory of OCD. If you're really strict on her, it may make it worse because she feels stuck and ashamed when you mention food or her appearance. She might start hiding what she does eat from you. Try your best not to make comments and give her space during meals. It's very stressful on a person with an eating disorder to be asked little things like \"what do you got there? What are you eating? Etc.\n\nI started out anorexic. Then, I eventually developed a binge eating disorder, which then turned into me puking my guts out after every meal. It is isolating and scary, and you feel stuck in a cycle. \n\nPlease be patient with her. She can not control a lot of her thoughts properly. If it's been as long as 3 years, she's trained her brain to associate things together. She rewired her brain to view food as an enemy. In her mind, she thinks she doesn't deserve food or she's not worthy of being happy in general. \n\nI'm still struggling every day, so I don't have the answers. But I do know that it's a very lonely road, especially when no one around you understands why you act the way you do.\n\nIf you have any questions. I might be able to help you understand her better. Feel free to dm me anytime. I wish you and your daughter the best.",

      "body": "So this is my experience, and I don\u2019t share this to accuse you of anything (I think you\u2019re doing a wonderful job), but rather to share a different perspective. I developed an unhealthy relationship with food and eventual eating disorder due in part to my mother\u2019s eating disorder. I grew up with an extremely warped perception of what self-image and eating habits should look like. My mother developed her own eating disorder due to her mother and sister\u2019s obesity and constantly being praised for being thin. This led to her becoming severely anorexic for most of her life, and in turn, led to me being bulimic for the majority of my adolescence.\n\nMy mother did nothing but tell me how I was perfect exactly as I was. But unfortunately, monkey see-monkey do. My mother starved herself. My mother did not treat herself. My mother did not wear bathing suits or shorts. My mother relentlessly exercised. My mother constantly spoke of diets, and cellulite, and weight gain, and ugliness. Just because it was directed towards herself and not me didn\u2019t make a difference - she unwittingly taught me that SHE was fat, and if I was bigger than her? That meant I was worse.\n\nShe learned her own behaviours from watching her family overindulge growing up. She watched her sister binge on sweets until she vomited. She watched her mother become diabetic. She watched as the women in her family grew out of their clothing and into morbid obesity. She was \u201cgood\u201d. She learned nothing of moderation, only extremes.\n\nSometimes, it isn\u2019t how you treat your child, but how you treat yourself (or how others treat themselves). Modelling healthy behaviours is so beyond important for little ones because they\u2019re smarter than we think. They can see when people don\u2019t practice what they preach, and they know when they\u2019re being treated differently (even if it\u2019s positive). Take note of how the people she looks up to treat themselves. Start noticing *all* body talk, be that in yourself, other family members, TV, commercials, etc. Have honest conversations with her about it. Kids are smarter than we give them credit for.\n\nI wish you, your daughter, and your family nothing but hope. She will get through this. She\u2019s very lucky to have a Mum like you.",

What are you eating? Etc.\n\nI started out anorexic. Then, I eventually developed a binge eating disorder, which then turned into me puking my guts out after every meal. It is isolating and scary, and you feel stuck in a cycle. \n\nPlease be patient with her. She can not control a lot of her thoughts properly. If it's been as long as 3 years, she's trained her brain to associate things together. She rewired her brain to view food as an enemy. In her mind, she thinks she doesn't deserve food or she's not worthy of being happy in general. \n\nI'm still struggling every day, so I don't have the answers. But I do know that it's a very lonely road, especially when no one around you understands why you act the way you do.\n\nIf you have any questions. I might be able to help you understand her better. Feel free to dm me anytime. I wish you and your daughter the best.",

He's asked her several times what she got to eat during the day. She usually happily tells him. I'm the one who's in control of her meals. I think its always been a year since she's ate more than half a plate of something. I don't remember if i said anything about it, its been so long ago. But i more than likely did. So if out ever happens again I'll make sure to not say anything",

There's a possibility that it might not apply to her, so take it with a grain of salt. If possible, maybe you could ask her if anything makes her anxious or embarrassed?",
