  "selftext": "hi, my boyfriend knows i have an eating disorder as i have opened up to him about it. i honestly think he was a major trigger to me developing one (im not blaming it completely on him, ive always been unhappy with myself) however he had always said to me that he \u201clikes skinny girls\u201d and would often comment on healthy looking girls and call them \u201cfat\u201d. since being with him i\u2019ve lost quite a lot of weight and have actually developed an eating disorder (starving myself and forcefully vomiting). he knows about this and i have cried and vented to him about it multiple times. however today we were in an argument and he said \u201ci keep you happy, skinny and hot\u201d and when i questioned what he meant by keeping me skinny he goes \u201cwell i only like skinny girls\u201d. i told him that what he is saying is triggering for me given he knows what im going through . he kept shutting me down and saying he doesn\u2019t see how it is triggering. am i in the wrong?",

In my experience, I\u2019d have a phone call to break it off and then go no contact to best help you move on / heal from the relationship. There are better men out there. Maybe consider being single for a bit to center your recovery and support network.",
