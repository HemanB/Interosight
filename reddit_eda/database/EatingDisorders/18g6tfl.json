  "selftext": "I miss my sick body\nShe was angular and\nher words were as sharp as her protruding bones\nPeople didn\u2019t know how to reach her, so they stayed away\nInstead of talking to her, they talked behind her back\n \nThe mask she wore dared them to face her, knowing they never would\nShe didn\u2019t need them for she had no needs\nOnce she saw our mom crying because of what this sick body had become\n \nIt was a superpower really\nShe could go longer, farther, harder\nA secret game no one signed up to play, but damn it, she was good at this\n \nFor being so good it did feel bad\nThe lies, crashed blood sugar, pressure sores and all\n \nI\u2019ve watched her shrink so many times\nThe soft place that held our babies, sunken in\nThe breasts that nourished them, reduced to nothing\nShe had no womanhood\n \nEvery pound she lost she was closer to achieving the invisibility she longed for\nSee, that is what kept us safe from prying hands\nBut it wasn\u2019t infallible, because as it does, the darkness still found its way in\n \n\u201cThis time will be different\nWe will never be hurt again\u201d she told me\nNo one can hurt us as bad as we hurt us\nAnd we did hurt us\nA lot\n \nPeople say recovery is brave\nBut is it truly brave when you\u2019ve had no other choice: Sink or swim\nI am tired and I don\u2019t want to be brave\nI don\u2019t want to do the hard things anymore\nI miss the safety of her consuming presence\n \nNow I am alive\n \nShe is too but she is quiet. She doesn\u2019t yell as much\nAnd she is smaller, at times, almost invisible, just like she always wanted us to be\nShe whispers comfort when I feel too much\nBut she can\u2019t offer the healing my soul has tasted\nThere is a world beyond our sickness\nEven when I miss her",

      "body": "A common aspect of recovery that many struggle with is missing their \u201csick body\u201d but romanticizing our sick body can just keep us stuck in romanticizing our illness and body obsessed. I think it\u2019s important and there\u2019s a difference between GRIEVING/letting go of the entire idea of your old body in recovery and staying stuck in the disordered mindset through romanticizing your sick body. Romanticizing my sick body has led to relapse in the past. I no longer romanticize it and find myself stuck in nostalgia over it but rather I genuinely grieved the idea of my sick body and felt the emotions that come with that and embraced change so that I could let go of the past. My sick body is a thing of the past and I do not want to\u201dher\u201d back. My sick body no longer serves me the same way it used to and that\u2019s why I don\u2019t find myself daydreaming or longing to become ill. I\u2019ve fixed that part of my brain that wanted to shrink and become ill through years of therapy trauma work and reframing disordered thoughts. My body is the LEAST interesting thing about me truly which is why I don\u2019t even find myself romanticizing and longing for my ill state.",
