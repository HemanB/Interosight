  "selftext": "I have nothing against veganism and have been vegetarian and vegan at points in my life. I love my mom but she\u2019s vegan and LOVES to talk about it. Shes one of the stereotypical smug recruiting vegans. \n\nI am not vegan. She loves to talk about how everyone should be vegan and eat the way she does. She likes to point out how different our diets are. She loves pointing what I\u2019m eating and saying she would neeeeever eat that. I know that she\u2019s not doing it to be malicious, but it is extremely triggering and I haven\u2019t been able to eat in front of her in years. I can\u2019t stand having people comment on what or how much I\u2019m eating. I\u2019m curious if anyone else has someone in their life like this that is a massive trigger to them.",

      "body": "I can\u2019t personally relate to that, but this made me think of a close friend who had/has a restrictive ED and used to be vegan before and during her ED before starting recovery. She is pretty far in her recovery and has tried to go back to eating vegan for ethical reasons (not trying to shame any non-vegan people at all, just saying it wasn\u2019t for ED reasons) but had to stop her attempt to become vegan again because restriction of any kind, even if it\u2019s not for ED-related reasons, is so triggering for her and triggers a relapse almost immediately. Just telling you this to show you that some people even struggle with veganism when it\u2019s their own choice. I imagine it\u2018s so much harder when other people force you to be confronted with this kind of restriction. Does your mom know about your ED? Then maybe you could have a talk with her about how it\u2019s triggering for you when she talks about her veganism and especially when she comments on what you eat \u2013 I think most people with EDs will agree that having people commenting on what you eat can be a huge trigger. Maybe she would appreciate being aware of this? If you can\u2019t talk to her about it because she doesn\u2019t know about your ED or for other reasons, I hope you can remind yourself that torturing yourself with an ED is a lot more unethical than not being vegan, and that no diet, vegetarianism, veganism or whatever is healthier than having a healthy relationship with food and your body. (As someone else commented, it can actually be a form of orthorexia and extremely unhealthy.) I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with this, recovery is hard enough without such extra hurdles. I wish you all the best!",

It was a problem in my HS friend group. It was the 00s/early 10s in the awful A&F VS fashion show era. I remember proudly announcing the jeans I was wearing were a size 0 and my best friend coldly said \u201cthat brand runs big\u2026. I wouldn\u2019t count it.\u201d\n\nSo yes I believe part of her vegan bragging and pushing is orthorexia.",
