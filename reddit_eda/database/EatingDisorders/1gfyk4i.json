  "selftext": "So, ive struggled with binge food eating disorder for a while now, I eat mostly when I am able to, and not in public, I dont like eating in public, because I eat really fast, so fast that its sometimes hard to swallow. And Ive noticed that I'm actually getting bigger. I'm eating, and eating, and eating over and over again.  I cant stop eating and it really concerns me. Ive eaten so much once that I actually threw up. I really want to stop but I don't know how.\n\nI really need tips, because I'm overfeeding myself, and its extremely uncomfortable. Does anyone have any tips to help me stop eating so much?",

      "body": "Other than the recommendation to seek help, most of these responses are confusing. I suggest speaking to a professional,  but in the meantime, you can think about your overall relationship with food. \n\nHow much do you eat at meals and snacks? Do you even have meals and snacks? Do you depend on the binges for all your fuel? If you aren't eating meals and snacks, then the binges may simply be a physical reaction to restriction. \n\nBut let's say you are eating regular meals and snacks and you are bingeing outside of those times. Do you binge on the same types of foods? Do you have particular triggers for a binge? In those cases, you need to make sure you allow yourself complete access to the \"binge\" foods at other times of the day. \n\nOk, but let's say you are eating regular meals and snacks and you are allowing yourself access to so called trigger foods, what else? Do you have particular emotional triggers? If so, you'll need to try more mindfulness techniques like urge surfing that get easier over time. It's highly individual, so advice to chew gum or drink water or avoiding certain foods are, well, not what most professionals will tell you.",

Statistics show the sooner you get help, the sooner you can recover.  I learned that the hard way!  I waited so long to get help...I kept thinking, \"Today I will stop...I can do this on my own.\"  Initially I was just overeating and then I discovered throwing up.  That created new issues of lieing and secreacy. \n\nThrough counseling, I learned my overeating was a symptom, not the problem.  Overeating was masking my emotions of sadness, procrastination, loneliness, fear of failure, wanting to be perfect and knew I would fall short, laziness, self-pity., tiredness..  Through counseling, I learned to identify my emotions and deal with them productively, rather than turning to food.  Call a friend, take a nap, exercise, cry, journal, attend small groups and Bible studies, work through a 12-step program.  \n\nRecovery takes time and willingness.  One day at a time. There is HOPE!",

      "body": "I\u2019m so sorry to hear of your struggle\u2026\n\nI\u2019m a 54 year old female.  Shortly after my father died, when I was 17, I began binge eating. I had a tremendous fear of becoming fat. I was thin at the time but began putting on the pounds. I would binge eat junk food all night long, crying at the same time. To attempt to balance this, I would struggle like crazy to fight the weight gain by obsessive exercise. Nonetheless, my clothing started feeling too tight around my waist and I began to develop a phobia of tight clothing. I became claustrophobic of waistbands and bras. This made my life a literal nightmare. This claustrophobia causes me to struggle to breathe. I feel as though I am being suffocated, constantly. Not to mention I also developed severe headaches at that same time. \n\nThis eating disorder went on for 10 years and it was pure Hell. No matter how hard I tried to free myself, I was hopelessly ensnared. My battle with this wretched disorder brought me the revelation I needed, that my life on earth was, truly, a living Hell. This convicted me of Jesus\u2019 words that there is a literal Hell to be saved from.  \n\nA Hellish life on earth is designed by God to get our attention. To let us know that we are in danger.  And that\u2019s exactly where I was, hopelessly lost in despair!\n\n\u201cBut God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved me, even when I was dead in trespasses, made me alive together with Christ. By grace I have been saved\u2026\u201d (Ephesians 2:4-5)\n\nAfter salvation, it was no longer just me struggling alone in the middle of the night with tears streaming down my face. I now had the Creator of the Universe to help me through.  Every night I pleaded with God for help.  About 10 months after salvation, I became free of the eating disorder. Twenty-seven years later, I am still free. Glory be to God, my Savior!",

Don\u2019t keep tasty foods at home, keep healthy foods and eat them. They\u2019re gonna make your blood sugar levels more stable and you will be craving less foods eventually it\u2019s not easy but after a few years it\u2019s gonna be so worth it, you\u2019ll be more healthy and way happier.\n\nI\u2019ve been bulimic, I\u2019ve been anorectic (dunno if it\u2019s the right word, English is not my native language, sorry), I know what an eating disorder is. No therapist helped me as much as a nutritionist did. The combination of them both was the best combination tho.",
