  "title": "Request: Question: has anyone ever experienced distorted eating in relation to anxiety?",
  "selftext": "I struggle with anxiety and often when I feel anxious enough, I tend to not eat very much at all - well below what I should eat in a day. It's like I feel sick and can't bring myself to each hardly anything at all. This occurs at a varying rate, depending on my anxiety but when it happens, it can last for a few days to even a couple of months. I don't have any issues with food normally, or have any particular body issues or dysmorphia. I am a pretty small person, though, and not eating hardly anything for even a couple of days can make me drop in weight, which I don't desire. \n\nTo sum it up, I essentially have some sort of distorted eating that occurs as a side effect of anxiety and it's noticeable and concerning enough for me to be seeking advise. Has anyone ever experienced something like this?\n\nI have been in therapy for awhile now and my therapist doesn't seem to be that concerned about it or at least thinks that if we can help my anxiety we can fix my eating patterns. I'm wondering if it's more than that, though. It's something that really bothers me and I'm just trying to find any way that I can break out of this pattern and eat normally.",

I realized it was because I had been feeling really anxious. That\u2019s never happened before, I usually over eat when I feel  anxious. \n\nI think you need to find a therapist who deals with eating disorders. The fact that you mentioned yours isn\u2019t concerned is concerning. good luck\ud83e\udd0d\u2728",

However, your case my be different than mine, and although working on your anxiety can help, you should also find tricks to help u eat when you are feeling this way. I would also suggest making sure that your therapist understand that this is an issue you want to fix with them because it is making you feel unwell and nervous, which is probably not helping you. Maybe you could try changing therapist too and getting one who can focus on disordered eating and anxiety",

      "body": "Hi there, I have had the same thing (this year in particular). What I\u2019ve done is eat even just small more calorie dense snacks even if I don\u2019t actively want food so that my stomach doesn\u2019t make me regret eating a full meal later on. If there is any food you consistently enjoy try going with that to see if it will prompt your appetite a bit more than it has been. I\u2019ve also seen my acupuncturist after a particularly rough panic day that prompted me to not really eat or sleep and by a few hours after the session I started to be able to eat and have an appetite again; acupuncture works for stress/ anxiety as well as digestion. \nI hope this helps in any way!",
