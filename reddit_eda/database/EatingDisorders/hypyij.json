You still have an ED, you just have a different sized body than you did before. \n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, in recovery, it\u2019s typical to restore your weight but still be dealing with disordered thoughts for awhile. The weight comes back before the healthy mindset. Please talk to someone.",

Just make sure that if it's truly like, you're eating in a way that should be causing weight loss, but you're experiencing unexplained weight gain, you talk to your doctor because unexplained weight gain could be a physical health problem.",

      "body": "As far as I could tell, it has happened to me! Sometimes it isn't so much what we're eating, as are our bodies' responses and reaction to the stuff we bring into contact with it. Hormonal imbalances and stress can also have a significant impact on how and why you're gaining weight despie eating less. \n\nI've done some research on nutrition and healthy eating/lifestyle, and have come to a point where I'm not losing wieght, but at least I'm not gaining any either. Regular vigorous exercise has been helpful to me. Also chucking away negative thoughts and inaccruate self-perceptions, and instead taking a more correct view of my own value as a human being--created by God, loved by God, and redeemed by God (that applies to you too, if you trust in Him!) has helped me bring back balance into this area of my life (struggles with wieght and eating). \n\nAs a start, maybe try to take a step out of being so fixated on your own troubles and calories, and instead focus on how you could be more productive and help other people? Sometimes that could help you feel better. Then after a while, when you're less frustrated, come back to this and start doing some research on what calories really are, how your body works with carbs, proteins and fat, and how/what you should eat, and when for your own body type. \n\nHope that helps! Blessings.",
