  "selftext": "(Nineteen, F) \nThree years ago I relapsed and couldn't get better no matter how much therapy etc. I went through. Welllll couple months ago I decided to do it myself and I started slowly increasing my calories week by week, struggled but today I had a breakthrough and had enough calories and ate a whole freaking avocado (fear food). I feel stupid writing this since it is, but I feel kinda proud and I don't have any friends or family that understand so I wanted to share here : )",
