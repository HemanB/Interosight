  "selftext": " \n\nMy wife and I have been together for 4 years now, and she recovered from hospitalization a couple of years ago. The issue I'm having is when she brought up she's self-conscious about her gaining weight, and I'm not sure what to say. Often she will say something like \"I think I'm gaining weight\" when she clearly isn't. Often more than not I'm in silence thinking of what I could say because I don't want to trigger anything for her. I know what not to say, I just don't know what to say back. I've looked around the internet and they just deal with what not to say. She's also taking a medication unrelated to her ED that lists a side effect of weight gain, and she tells me she's worried about gaining weight.\n\nIf anyone could help me help her that would be fantastic, cause I want to help her through her anxieties about weight gain.",

As for now you just need to remind her that you love her no matter her size. Maybe try and to remind her of how she loves you no matter your size. She is more than a number, she is perfect in your eyes and the only thing that could ever make her more beautiful is if she was truely happy and she can\u2019t be happy while she\u2019s struggling. She thinks she\u2019s in control but it\u2019s in control of her, the illusion isn\u2019t worth the pain anymore. She may think she feels happier when she is smaller but in truth no one is when it\u2019s at the point of starvation and hospitalisation. Don\u2019t lie to her and say she looks the same because that\u2019ll lead to her distrusting you, just be honest and supportive. Steer the conversation towards the positives of recovery. I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t be more helpful I truely hope the best for both you and your wife. I think it\u2019s beautiful that you care so much to ask how to help her, she\u2019s very lucky to have you.",

Ex: \u201cyou have a much nicer flow to your body than you would if you had a smaller chest and it makes your whole silhouette really gorgeous\u201d or \u201cyour face is a soft heart shape that makes you look lively and friendly\u201d things like that.

You could post positive affirmations on sticky notes on your bathroom mirror or things like that. It really comes down to her working on her mindset though. Just be there for her. Ask her why she is afraid to gain weight when she is perfect just as she is. Ask her what she really needs. The problem isn't her body, it's what she thinks of it. We can change our thoughts. I would recommend seeking out an eating disorder specialized therapist for help. It's hard to be on the outside looking in on someone struggling with body image so props to you for reaching out.",
