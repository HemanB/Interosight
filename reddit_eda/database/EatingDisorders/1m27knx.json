      "body": "I think there's too many negatives hang on. Is this what you're trying to say?\n\"I think the only people capable of being an effective ED specialist are those with lived experiences of EDs?\"\n\nI disagree wholeheartedly. Providers use evidence based models of treatment, which is pretty standard across the board. Regular, adequate nutrition is key. Clinical psychology to address underlying stuff sure. But the knowledge these professionals have can be taught. They can't learn what it truly feels like, but I believe that is not a necessary part of treatment. There is not one thing that a person can say that can make you want to recover. It has to come from you. And it's as simple and as difficult as eating regularly, restoring nutrition (and weight, FULLY) and consciously, consistently choosing to go against the ED. And you don't need a person with lived experience to tell you that.\n\nPeer support has its place. In fact can be very useful for some illnesses, but ED's? Mmm, not always. I think people with lived experiences with EDs should be very careful about going into work in the field. A lot of people with eds are driven into nutrition/psychology/mental health nursing degrees/careers and it does not come from the right place. We're obsessed with food, it's expected that we'd go into a job that could focus on food, weight and eating disorders - we want our lives to revolve around it. It is about you, rather than the people you treat. \n\nI couldn't think of anything worse than having someone with lived experience of an ED treating me (unless it was a very long time ago) because I wouldn't trust their motive to be there.",

Almost all the therapists I encountered while in residential were people who had recovered from an ED. And it's honestly kind of hard to imagine having a therapist in that situation (i.e. crisis) who hadn't recovered from an ED. But I also saw a lot of problems regarding that. Hell, even the *site director* at the last residential I went to clearly had major counter transference problems with one of the residents. \n\nBut when I think about the therapists who benefited me the most in the long-term? Two thirds had no ED history. Rather, they were more fitted for understanding me outside of my ED. Where they had gone through similar philosophical struggles I had - senses of otherness, existentialism, nihilism, etc. \n\nHowever - those two without a history of ED were extremely sensitive in addressing the topic while also seeming to understand a) that EDs were somewhat outside their scope and b) when they needed to draw the line that I required a higher level of care. I feel extremely fortunate for that. The vast majority of therapists I've met - ED specialist or not - have not fit that bill.",
