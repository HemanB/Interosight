My anemia is better as well, which resulted in my blood pressure and heartbeat rising to normal!! I\u2019m becoming healthy and giving my body life again. Your reminder that it\u2019s really worth it, go enjoy your summer and make memories\ud83d\udc4d (Btw even if you never lost your period during your ed, you\u2019re still very much valid)",

      "body": "Thank you!! I don\u2019t think anyone with an eating disorder fully \u201crecovers\u201d, ever. What I mean is that we let go of our disordered habits and try to regain a healthy and positive relationship with oneself and food, but the mindset and thoughts regarding all of this still exit somewhere in the back of your head. I believe Ed\u2019s are psychological and most of it is not because of numbers or looks but because of our brains. When in recovery it\u2019ll feel like it all become even worse, or at least it did for me. You\u2019ll go back to restriction maybe or you\u2019ll have a really hard time throughout the whole process. I\u2019ve had bulimia which I \u201crecovered\u201d from, which later came back as anorexia a year or so later. But I have myself to blame for that, because I never really healed my mind and body, I just moved on. Don\u2019t get me wrong recovery is very very much possible!! I started a few months back and got into some old habits. You just have to relearn what your body and mind needs to feel satiated and happy, (which is hard). I myself would not call me fully recovered because I sometimes think about going back to my illness, but then I remember moments from before my illness, and moments after trying recovery, and how much freedom I had. I didn\u2019t have to think about food and my body all of the time, I actually had energy and strength, and I could pay attention to the people around me. I\u2019m not sure if I helped in any way. And I think when you reach the point of \u201cnormal\u201d and have had a wif of what it feels like to have food freedom, you\u2019ll want to go back a little less. I also believe recovery on your own and not in hospitals is much more effective. Good luck, I know you can do this!!",
