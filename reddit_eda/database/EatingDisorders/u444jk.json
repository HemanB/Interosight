  "selftext": "F19\nI don\u2019t know where to post this. People close to me have mentioned (with good intentions) that it\u2019s very obvious I had a ED but I never looked into it. \n\nI have struggled with food my entire life. We were poor growing up. I am not exactly rolling in cash as a first gen college student either. Always been a chunky kid, struggled with weight yk how it goes. I was a athlete. Played sports my entire life. Water, contact, XC you name it. Worked, full schedule etc. \n\nI just can\u2019t eat. I truly think if a medical professional saw my eating habits they\u2019d put me on a feeding tube. I hardly eat 800 calories daily. I don\u2019t really eat junk. Nothing high calorie either. Just barley eat one meal a day. But when I do I am always so full. \nOr if for example I had yogurt for breakfast why would I eat three hours later at lunch? If I wake up I\u2019ll just go about my day and maybe before I leave, \u201coh I forgot I was gonna grab something, well\u201d. I have no appetite but I know I need to eat. I work a demanding job, have sleeping troubles, my mood swings, depression, anxiety attacks. These all can be traced back to my eating habits. I want to get better but I don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nI also wanted to ask\nIs this self harm? Sometimes a part of me convinces myself that I don\u2019t deserve a meal. Don\u2019t need to buy groceries this week. Can anyone relate ?",

This for sure sounds like you have an ED to me. If you are intentionally restricting your intake because you don't feel like you deserve it, that sure meets what I would call self-harm. You should seriously consider seeing a mental health professional if that is an option open to you.",

In other words, it's not just about how little you're eating, it's about *why* you're eating so little.\n\nBut regardless of what it is, it sounds like you need professional help.",
