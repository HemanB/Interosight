  "selftext": "My girlfriend has had an ed for about 2 years. I\u2019m really glad she trusts me and tells me about her experience but i\u2019m struggling to support her in a safe way. \n\nShe has a list of safe foods that i pick from when we eat together. I help her get out of meals with her family and I find myself making excuses for her when she disappears to go purge. I want to support her and make her feel comfortable but at the same time i feel like I\u2019m somehow enabling her ed. While I\u2019m really worried about making her feel uncomfortable, I\u2019m even more worried about her safety. I know I can\u2019t force her to recover but am i doing the wrong thing by making it easier for her to continue this lifestyle?",

      "body": "Yes definitely, you are making her bad lifestyle more liveable. I do understand why but the shame and all the hiding she normally would have to do, should actually make her realize how bad her situation is and make her willing to recover. She should also talk to a professional because this can cause a lot of harm to her body  but also to her mental health. You covering her probably made her think that it's kind of okay, which it isn't.\nBut it's not really you fault because who knows how to handle these situations? \n\nTry to talk her into seeing a psychologist because if she doesn't want this to go on and killing her body and worsening her mental health, she will have to see somebody because she will not be able to do it alone. Also talk about you feeling guilty, maybe it makes her think twice about recovery. Just don't make it all about you of course. I know this is a lot but just tell her how you feel.\n\n(I'm not really good in this and I don't know your girlfriend of course) \nBut I hope it helps a little?",

She might not be willing to go to therapy and you can't force anyone to get better but you certainly can take care of yourself. Therapy has been monumental for me in stopping my enabling habits and starting to care for myself instead of constantly thinking about my partner and what he will do next, I think you would really benefit from it too. And hey! Maybe if your partner sees you taking steps to get healthier mentally she might follow suit.",

Let her know you\u2019re worried about her, and that you love her and want to support her and would love to help her find a therapist or a program that would be supportive for her. It\u2019s likely she won\u2019t be ready or receptive at first but let her know you\u2019re doing your best to support her, and you need to prioritize her health. Eating disorders are life threatening, and purging is EXTREMELY hard on the body.\n\n\n\nSupportive things you can do for her in the meantime: try to keep her favorite foods on hand but don\u2019t force it on her. If you notice she\u2019s not eating, mention it to her: \u201chey, I haven\u2019t seen you eat since Sunday and I\u2019m worried about you. How can I support you right now?\u201d Try to keep an open dialogue as much as possible, but don\u2019t force it. You\u2019re doing your best, and at the end of the day her mental health is her responsibility, but like I said eating disorders can cause death in patients that do not look near-death (heart issues are especially common in those with EDs). I\u2019m not trying to scare you, but trying to impress how extremely serious her situation is. Sending you love and support.",

      "body": "You can start talking to her about how you feel about the situation. Letting her know you feel bad whenever you cover up for her because inside you know that this is damaging her. Basically let her know how you feel about doing these actions that you know will eventually hurt her body and mind, and will lead to her going to the hospital or even worse, her death. Try to be very careful with your wording because people with ED may believe you\u2019re against so you have to let her know you are worried because you love her and don\u2019t want to hurt her.",

But you can only suggest recovery so many times before they tune you out so then harm reduction seems like the best step. I wish I knew the right answer but no matter what I never judged and tried my best to make her feel better and happy",

      "body": "I\u2019m in this same boat my girlfriend recently told me of her binge eating disorder followed by bulimia. I joined to learn peoples thoughts on this and to get an idea how to help her get better. I\u2019ve had many a sleepless night in the barracks because of worrying completely about her life, she\u2019s told me her heart feels strained and one time she couldn\u2019t get up from the floor and she accepted her death right there. All I can say man is keep her motivated to do better if she sees this is negatively affecting you she\u2019ll alienate herself in shame. You are the only one that knows just as I am, don\u2019t force her to tell anyone she seeks help when she wants to seek it out. I recently got her to start looking into therapy I didn\u2019t force her to I just gave her information given to me by my MFLAC. To answer your question, yes you are enabling her don\u2019t feel shamed by that just become better, stop making excuses for her, encourage her to talk to someone, look up this website ANAD to educate yourself on the gravity of the situation. Do not force her to get help let her go at her pace but that doesn\u2019t mean to help her hide the sickness, she trusts you man don\u2019t lose it by telling people and don\u2019t lose her by letting her fall deeper and deeper you\u2019re stuck in the middle and it sucks man, but keep your head up and don\u2019t lose yourself worrying about her.
