      "body": "I had an eating disorder for 10 years. From about age 16 to 25. I had spouts of recovery but the longest I went without throwing up was maybe a few months. Luckily (that\u2019s how I see it now), my hair started falling out from my body not getting enough nutrients. That was my final straw. \n\nI am turning 30 in six months and am so relieved with the relationship I have with food and with my body. I haven\u2019t thrown up in almost 5 years! It was a long journey but I will always attribute it to therapy, mindfulness, yoga/meditation, intuitive eating, and SUPPORT. You should really open up about it to people in your life. They will keep you accountable and motivated. The power of vulnerability is so strong!!",

I was a chubby kid growing up getting bullied being called fat and a pig but I never dwell on that because eating feels good, and I grew up in a household where there's lots of food and there's no shame in eating a lot. But then when I started high school everything started. The restriction started at first. I started not eating breakfast, then I purposely made my lunch smaller, and yes, it did make me lose weight. I got compliments and I love it, so every Saturday and Sunday I would only eat lunch and dinner. The snacks that I often eat, I cut them down, my portion size got smaller not only for lunch but also for dinner. Then pandemic strikes. I don't know what happened but I ate then ate then ate then ate, then I didn't realize I was enormous. I was big, the biggest that I've been. I realized this when the ban had been lifted when I was called fat and shamed for it. So this is where it got worse. I searched a lot of ways to lose weight then I found a lot of ideas but then I learned about calorie counting and those apps that help you with it. At first it was not toxic. I started at 1500 calories but then I want fat change so I lowered it to 1300 but then I want to fasten my weight from 1500, it become 500 calorie then I started exercising rigorously while fasting then I did lose weight weight I was very happy about it I feel the sense of accomplishment that I love so much and in those times I would watch movies, k-dramas and videos of people having eating disorder and Instead of looking at their suffering I was looking at their body at how skinny they were and how many years and months did it take so I can do it to then school started I was not able to do the things I been doing so I stopped it but then someone told me that I was starting to get fat again and I saw the people around me too they were very skinny and I wanted to like them so I started again I would fast for 20 hours and eating so little then I lost weight I become skinnier than before and every time I look at the mirror and pictures I feel so accomplished and very happy yet it's not enough I started doing those HIIT workouts and would exercise till I drop I would lose 1000 calories for doing HIIT workouts and I started eating a lot and would feel guilty and it's tiring so tiring.\n\n( I'm sorry for my grammar and punctuation I didn't proofread this because it hurts so much)",

Yes ITS HARD to get better and want to but seeing we are the same age I understand. The thing that has helped me is thinking of my future. For me it\u2019s being able to help others. I know it\u2019s also hard to see a future for yourself but I can\u2019t sit here and say that it will get better but I can say you have a future. I really do hope for you that you can find a will to want to get better. I hope you have a good day!!!",

I was a chubby kid growing up getting bullied being called fat and a pig but I never dwell on that because eating feels good, and I grew up in a household where there's lots of food and there's no shame in eating a lot. But then when I started high school everything started. The restriction started at first. I started not eating breakfast, then I purposely made my lunch smaller, and yes, it did make me lose weight. I got compliments and I love it, so every Saturday and Sunday I would only eat lunch and dinner. The snacks that I often eat, I cut them down, my portion size got smaller not only for lunch but also for dinner. Then pandemic strikes. I don't know what happened but I ate then ate then ate then ate, then I didn't realize I was enormous. I was big, the biggest that I've been. I realized this when the ban had been lifted when I was called fat and shamed for it. So this is where it got worse. I searched a lot of ways to lose weight then I found a lot of ideas but then I learned about calorie counting and those apps that help you with it. At first it was not toxic. I started at 1500 calories but then I want fat change so I lowered it to 1300 but then I want to fasten my weight from 1500, it become 500 calorie then I started exercising rigorously while fasting then I did lose weight weight I was very happy about it I feel the sense of accomplishment that I love so much and in those times I would watch movies, k-dramas and videos of people having eating disorder and Instead of looking at their suffering I was looking at their body at how skinny they were and how many years and months did it take so I can do it to then school started I was not able to do the things I been doing so I stopped it but then someone told me that I was starting to get fat again and I saw the people around me too they were very skinny and I wanted to like them so I started again I would fast for 20 hours and eating so little then I lost weight I become skinnier than before and every time I look at the mirror and pictures I feel so accomplished and very happy yet it's not enough I started doing those HIIT workouts and would exercise till I drop I would lose 1000 calories for doing HIIT workouts and I started eating a lot and would feel guilty and it's tiring so tiring.\n\n( I'm sorry for my grammar and punctuation I didn't proofread this because it hurts so much)",
