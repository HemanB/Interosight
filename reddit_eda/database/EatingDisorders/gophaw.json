  "title": "Request: worried about my sister, can I post this?",
  "selftext": "I (18F) am worried. First, I apologize if I'm being insensitive in any way, I'm new to the concept of this and it's my first time posting here. My sister is 16, and I have noticed that she's been eating less and less over the past year. At first, I figured she was just doing a slight caloric deficit to lose a little weight, as although she's not fat, she is a little overweight which she had told me before she wanted to do something about. I think she looks beautiful at any weight, but she dismissed me. Over the past few months, since quarantine started, and I've been home from University more and able to see what she eats all day, it's a startlingly low amount! Yesterday I heard her talking with my brother (10), saying \"omg, I ate Soo much today\". He asked what she ate. She said she ate some blueberries, and a protein bar. As a regular gym goer and lifter, I'm used to tracking calories (for weight GAIN so I can build muscle!) So I quickly realized that this was far less than a healthy intake! \nNow, Im athletic, and toned, so naturally I've become slim from exercising so much. But I also eat a LOT because I lift weights. I eat more than 4x the Cal's a day as she does, and I know that she envies my body, because we've talked about it before. And I myself have very good self confidence and I've never had an ED so it's really hard to understand where she's coming from? I don't mean that to sound bragging but that's how it is.\nI've tried talking to her about nutrition, and how she needs to eat  when she's hungry. She says she never feels hungry. I offer to make her food, and I go out of my way to show her that she does not need to next to nothing to lose weight. I try to eat big meals when she's downstairs to show her that food isn't making me overweight, and that you can still enjoy food and be fit and healthy.  Right now, my sister is still \"overweight\", but I know that you don't have to be rail thin to have an ED.  I don't know what to do about helping her...I don't know how to talk to her? I worry about making things worse somehow? Do you guys have any ideas?",

      "body": "First of all, let me just say that you\u2019re an amazing and attentive sibling. Your care and concern for her is rare amongst family members, and just having one supportive person in her life will make all the difference when she recognizes that she\u2019s ill and needs to recover. You\u2019re right that you don\u2019t need to be thin to have an ED; and it definitely sounds like she has one. The restriction, bragging about not being hungry, and trying to get validation of how little she\u2019s eaten from your other sibling all sound very familiar to me. You should sit down with her and talk about the reality of this disorder. If she lets this get worse, it WILL dominate her entire life and rob her teenage years. Believe me, my disorder took away so many of my formative experiences that should have been nothing but happy; now my senior year, high school graduation, birthdays, hanging out with friends, summers, etc. are remembered as incredibly bitter, anxious, and scary times. And the disorder doesn\u2019t just go away; I fight it every single day despite being in recovery. Eating disorders are the #1 fatal mental illness, and she needs to ingrain this in her mind. She needs to get real help before it gets any worse. I would tell your parents as well, honestly. She\u2019s a minor and they should get her in therapy before she turns 18 and can refuse any help. This isn\u2019t something that just \u201cgoes away\u201d. Professional help is 100% necessary.",

      "body": "I mainly agree with the other comments here, but I do want to add something that perhaps hasn\u2019t been said yet. This is a personal opinion of mine having gone through diagnosed anorexia before, so I understand if it isn\u2019t applicable to your situation. \n\nWhen you talked about how you are generally much more toned than she is & work out more etc, you were right that she probably/does envy you. However, it is probably to a greater extent than you realize. Further, talking about it (your body) with her is, in my humble opinion, a very bad route to go. When I had my disorder, I hated people who looked how I wanted to. I don\u2019t have a sister so it could be different, but any time the conversation was about somebody else\u2019s seemingly perfect body, it made me even more upset & hate them more. As such, even discussing your own body with her in the sense of \u201cyou can get here too if you do this and this!\u201d is just not a good way to go. Comparison is the devil when it comes to eating disorders. Do not even open the door for conversation about your own body, even as inspiration. She will never look like you, so it is simply in vain to even mention that. Encourage her to work to be the best version of herself. You two sound like you\u2019re different body types, & that\u2019s okay, but you both would do well to realize this. \n\nAgain, not that your sister hates you, but you need to understand the thought process behind disorders. Simply eating big meals around her to \u201cshow her it won\u2019t make her fat\u201d is something that would have triggered me immensely. The way a disordered mind sees that, they won\u2019t think how you\u2019re thinking about \u201cOh, look, it\u2019s okay to eat,\u201d they\u2019ll probably envy you even more & restrict even more. I hated eating around people for this reason; how can everyone eat so much & stay skinny, but I can\u2019t? Metabolisms & workout habits vary from person to person. Your sister could work out as much as you do but her metabolism could be slower & thus scientifically she may not be able to eat as much as you without gaining weight. It\u2019s important for you to realize that your body works differently than hers does, & so does her mind. Initially, this may seem obvious, but do some thinking on it. Whatever her internal motivations are, I guarantee you they are far different than your own. \n\nI apologize if this came off as rude at all. That wasn\u2019t my intent. I just tend to find that being blunt is a better way to communicate a point than beating around the bush. Again, this is all from my own experience & my process of thinking. My point in writing this was to perhaps open your eyes to her point of view.",

Not in sizes, but she will refuse to eat certain foods under no circumstances. \nWhen I was 12, I went vegetarian and gluten free just so I had an excuse to not eat certain foods. \n\nI know she\u2019s telling you that she\u2019s only eating a little protein bar, but all of us can tell you that with restricting comes bingeing. A lot of it. Does she eat secretly in her bedroom and hide the wrappers? \nDoes she have problems eating in front of others (friends/boyfriends). \nAs you said she\u2019s a little bit overweight, and she could simply be mimicking your habits to strive for what you have (since she looks up to you). Do you talk about eating protein bars and lifting weights? She could just be trying to mimic her older sister who she likes a lot :).\n\nA lot of us on here will say she has an eating disorder. It\u2019s because a lot of us can\u2019t fathom losing weight without an unhealthy relationship with food. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s to the point yet so far where you need to tell your parents or seek outside professional help. But I do think it\u2019s really sweet that you notice and are concerned about her <3\n\nBeing a teenager is weird. Especially as a girl. I don\u2019t really think there\u2019s any girl who hasn\u2019t gone on some diet. Going on a diet doesn\u2019t equal an eating disorder. I just think from your perspective, who is super athletic, eats a lot and never worries about body image, it could be hard for you to grasp that. There are some red flags I would look out for though, but nothing right now scares me.",

A big factor in my eating habits, like you, is my lifting and exercise regimen. If I don\u2019t eat, my lifts and workouts are junk and I don\u2019t feel good overall, and that forces me to stay honest with my intake.
