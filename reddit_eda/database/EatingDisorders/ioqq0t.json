      "body": "1. Know that if your partner doesn't want help, there's nothing you can do (except for point 5)\n2. Know that giving an ultimatum doesn't work\n3. Know that whatever you say or do the ED will make you the devil. every. single. time.\n4. Know that your partner needs love and support, *but that you do as well*\n5. Know that you have the right to set boundaries and not be bullied by your partner's ED\n6. Know that your love and support might not be met with the reaction you want and/or expect (see point 4)\n7. Know that eating disorders are extremely lonely diseases (no matter how *not* alone the person actually is) and the ED community makes your partner feel less lonely\n8. Know that the happiness your partner gets from the community (although it's nice of you to not want to take that away) is not so much happiness as it is a relief (see point 7) \n9. Know that you shouldn't engage with the ED, stand your ground and don't answer questions like \"do I look fat/ugly?\", \"should I eat this?\", \"did I eat too much?\", \"I haven't eaten all day, isn't that great?\" no matter how many times he asks or how he interprets your silence, because **there is no right answer.** (see point 4)\n10. Know that your partner doesn't choose to have an ED, the ED chooses him\n11. Know that it's not an easy or straight road to recovery, and you need a lot of patience\n\nLastly, and most importantly for you, know that it's not your job to cure or treat your partner. I repeat: **it's not your job to cure or treat your partner**. This might seem harsh, but it's the truth. Your job as his partner is to be there, support him and make sure he knows he's love. Leave the rest to the professionals.",
