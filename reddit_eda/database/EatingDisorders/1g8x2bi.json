I told my sister about how it made me feel, and she was like \"I'm sorry it made you feel bad\". Like, no, it made me feel more than just bad. It made me feel like complete shit that I've treated my body this way. I told my wife that the only real reason I bought the table that we took with us, is so I could try and hide behind it. I feel like I don't want to go out in public.

I\u2018ve been wanting to go on Bumble (the version for friendship) for a while now because I have literally no friends I see regularly, but the four pictures you need of yourself doing something you enjoy or at a place you like feel like an insurmountable obstacle. I have 4,500 pictures on my phone and could only find a single decent one of myself that I could upload. \n\nI\u2018d like to use a dating app for finding a partner too someday, but taking and uploading a picture for that purpose feels even scarier.",
