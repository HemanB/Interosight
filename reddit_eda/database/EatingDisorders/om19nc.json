  "selftext": "Hi all, I am currently teaching seventh grade science for summer school. The curriculum that the school developed is focused on nutrition, but they are asking students to count // track calories. I find this super problematic, especially for the age that I am working with. I am in the process of emailing the department head with my concerns, but was wondering if anyone here had resources for articles related to the relationship between calorie counting, body image and disordered eating in young people so that I can include these in my email. Thank you so much for your help!",

Perhaps you could be the fulcrum for a new way of educating regarding eating disorders. I find there is so little awareness or accurate understanding until you or your family is faced with this. Thank you and please let us all know how it goes. I have a feeling that you\u2019ll have a lot of backup from people here if you need it!!",

They may be open to this important change. I find, best initial approach is to assume they will welcome the importance of addressing this once they know more. You sound like an amazing educator! I love that you care about your students so much and I can see you will be presenting them with a great solid foundation to support your view! You win educator of the year in my book!!",

I\u2019ve heard some stories about how professors and teachers create assignments where students have to track their intake and I feel like it does more harm than good. It leads to insecurity and an unhealthy relationship with food. Seventh graders are already going through a lot of changes so they already feel judged by their peers and insecure adding an assignment like that could be a gateway to an unhealthy relationship with their bodies.",
