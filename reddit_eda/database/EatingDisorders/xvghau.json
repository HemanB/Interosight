      "body": "Yup, was one of the main reasons I chose to recover. I had zero interest in it at my lowest and my partner lost his interest in having sex with me because he admitted he didn't find my body attractive being so underweight and he was scared any kind of movement would hurt me.\n\nNot be attractive to him was the worst feeling, I love this man. We have been together 15 years, I wasn't about to let that fall apart because I was to scared to get help.\n\nNow after 6 years of never being in the mood, I've gained some weight and we are both at it like high school kids again. When I didn't have it I didn't miss it, but now it's back and I crave sex, it's like \"woah 6 years wasted\"",
