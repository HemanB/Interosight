  "title": "Request: I miss the care I got before I began recovery. How do I get over that nostalgia?",
  "selftext": "This is a hard post for me, especially because I know people wrongly portray people with Eating Disorders as \u201cjust begging for attention.\u201d That said, I really feel like I miss the care people showed me before I started weight restoration. \n\nI used to go to a nice doctor\u2019s office every week because she was worried about me. Now she\u2019s telling me that she\u2019ll see me in a month, and if I\u2019m still weight-restored, we can do once every three months. \n\nAlso, how did it become the case that I have the biggest appetite of all my friends? My friends used to have to trick me into going to restaurants or getting food, Now, if we\u2019re together, they say things like \u201cit\u2019s so nice to see you not concerned about eating anymore\u201d while I\u2019m the only one at the table who ordered food. \n\nHeck, it even bothers me that my parents will bring me food, and I eat it without any thought. They like to hug me and tell me how I look so much happier these days. Oddly enough, I\u2019m not happy that people think I\u2019m happier.\n\nIt\u2019s like, when I was underweight, I was really afraid of weight gain, but I was also afraid that my friends and family would think I\u2019m content with what is happening to me in recovery. Now, that seems to be the case. I just kind of feel alone because I both want and don\u2019t want to relapse, but it seems to be because I want people acknowledge I have an eating disorder. I want them to know how powerless I feel to stop the recovery process, and how much grief I feel toward my changing behaviours. \n\nIt\u2019s a mindset I\u2019m not proud of, and I\u2019m wondering if any people have endured something similar and can share some advice. Thank you.",
