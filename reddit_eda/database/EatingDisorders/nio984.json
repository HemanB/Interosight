  "title": "Request: My girlfriend has been struggling to eat and her parents don't help her.",
  "selftext": "I want to post this. please. I don't know what to do\n\nWe are both 14 and she's been trying not to eat since she was 11. some random guy called her fat and she says that this started all. since 2021 started her mom has been making comments on her when she eats like \"you are eating too much\", \"you are gaining weight\", etc. when she's around with other people she has to eat so she does it but when shes alone sometimes tries to avoid it. she drinks water and smoke to calm hunger and a few times tried to vomit but she couldn't. she told her mom that her comments were hurting her and that she has been struggling to eat but her mom just got mad. she also self harms and wanted to kill herself a few times but luckily she never tried it. her parents don't believe in therapy. after a lot of months of pushing they finally sent her with a therapist but after a month they stopped because \"it won't fix anything\" and \"it's a waste of money and time\". we've been together for a few months and I've been trying to be the most supportive I can for her. yesterday she told me about her eating problems. I knew that something was going on and tried to talk to her but she wasn't ready. I didn't knew it is that bad. her parents won't help her and I do everything that I can but its not enough. another thing that worries me is that she has a friend who is also struggling with this and they talk about it. the problem is that she's not supportive at all. she tells my gf \"tips not to eat\" whenever she asks. due to online classes it's impossible rn to see a school counselor so we agreed that she will try to write and email and send it to her school tutor and if she can't we will do it together the next time we see each other. we talked a lot about this yesterday. she told me she doesn't believe she's fat but I think she's scared of gaining weight. I think she also doesn't want to get better. I asked her if she wanted but she told me that she didn't knew what she want. she's not sure that therapy will work. she thinks that she will lie a lot because she doesn't trust adults. I don't know what to do besides staying by her side and keeping showing her how much I love her. what should I do? I'm really scared and I don't want to lose her.",

      "body": "Firstly: you are very sweet for being her friend and caring about this. Secondly, try to remember that while you want to support her, this is her problem, and her problem alone. You cannot \u201cfix\u201d this, she has to be the one to do that. That being said, she may very well be able to do that. But it will take time. Listening to her, gently encouraging her to go to therapy and providing calm, clear feedback about what her parents say may help her immensely. For example: her:\u201d my mom said I need to not eat that\u201d you: \u201cwell, you aren\u2019t your mom. What do YOU want to do? I\u2019m going to eat a bit, if you\u2019d like a bite I\u2019d love to share it with you!\u201d. Journaling may help her as well, so if she\u2019s open to it, suggesting she do that for herself may be a good idea. It\u2019s helpful to see thoughts on paper.\n\nEating disorders are both about food and not about food at all. Often it\u2019s about control, and attempting to understand identity. Gently and consistently encouraging her to think separately from her mother and other body negative adult figures/media would be helpful. Also encouraging her to get in touch with herself and her own needs may be good too, and perhaps therapy if she\u2019s ready. But remember, please, this is her own thing. You can be as supportive and loving as possible, but try to remember this is her thing, not yours. You are not responsible for her actions, but you can certainly be a source of friendship and support for her while she sorts through a very hard, and likely very long battle with self image, body, and relationships.",
