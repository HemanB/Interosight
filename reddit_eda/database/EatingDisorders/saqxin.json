      "body": "Hi! I was actively bulimic for about 11 and have been binge/purge free for the past 4 years\u2026 it took my digestive system a while to recover- as in not feeling bloated/gassy/excessively full after eating. Seeing a nutritionist who specialized in ED recovery was super helpful for me to understand the science/physiology behind my body healing and what to expect, and the healing process. They also helped me with making a game plan for how/when to eat and how to get back to intuitive eating over time. If you have access/funds to get counseling, and/or see a Ed nutritionist, I highly recommend it! \nWishing you the best and know that you can and will heal! You aren\u2019t broken. Your body isn\u2019t broken. It just takes time. \ud83e\udde1\nEdit: Also- I recommend not looking at yourself in the mirror too much\u2026 it can really exacerbate the feeling of being too full- especially in reference to you saying you can see a difference with drinking a glass of water\u2026 for a while I only had mirrors where I could see my face, and not my whole body. It helped me get away from fixating on how I thought I looked, and move towards noticing how my body felt/how I felt in my body.",

It will get better, but, if you have the chance maybe ask a doctor about some medications for gastric protection and for booating. Your stomach might be a bit damaged and it\u2019s definitely very sensitive right now so they might also tell you to avoid certain things that might irritate your stomach, such as spicy dishes or overly greasy stuff, also garlic and legumes can cause bloating. Definitely try to keep up going to the gym, this is what has helped me most for opening up my appetite, and helps me eat a lot more now. Also drink enough water because that will help with bloating and to have better digestion. Avoid high sodium intake because it might lead you to fluid retention. Try spreading your caloric intake throughout your day in small meals so you do not feel so full but still eat healthy amounts. I\u2019m not going to lie, it\u2019s a tough process but it will get better.",

The ACV helps keep me from having a rock of food in my stomach, helps break it down, and relieves heartburn (I know it seems counterintuitive, but it truly feels like a miracle) I\u2019m not a doctor, but this has helped me immensely. Also, I\u2019m eating and craving lots of processed foods.

I got a stomaching emptying test done they said  I had slight gastroparesis nothing too extreme. During the test they give you eggs or oatmeal that are radioactive they then take pictures every half hour or so to measure how long it takes your body to digest the food.  What you are describing is exactly how I felt so I highly recommend you speak to your doctor about maybe getting a stomach emptying test done.  I should also note this was over 2 years ago for me and I am able to eat almost like I use to more than I was able to when I was recovering sometimes gastroparesis is temporary but I am not a doctor.
