  "selftext": "I was overweight when I first started restricting, and I'm currently at a healthy weight, if it matters. The problem is, people keep telling me that I look great, they're so proud of me, or what's my secret, they wish they could do what I did, etc. This happens both with people who don't know I was anorexic and people who do know. I just have no idea how to react. I hate the idea of saying thanks when someone compliments me on the weight loss, and it feels uncomfortable to lie and say \"just diet and exercise!\" when someone asks me how I did it. I really don't wanna make a big deal out of it or tell people I don't know that well about my history, so I need help navigating these comments.",

I don\u2019t say thanks. I say \u201cYou think so?\u201d And tell them I have a history of ED.

If it's someone close who doesn't know you're anorexic, maybe you tell a little more truth like, \"You know, I was way too strict with myself to lose this much weight. I'd rather try a healthier way going forward.\" With close people who do know you're anorexic, maybe say, \"Thanks for the compliment but I need support from you to be healthier with myself.\" With strangers, I think you can just say thanks and move on. You're not thanking them for celebrating the WAY you lost the weight, just that they are noticing you and trying to connect with you. ",

Protein shakes and pilates! That makes me feel bad though because some of them are overweight and really want to get in shape and I feel like that is misleading information but I can't just tell them I starve myself obviously. I am also at a healthy weight, but gained a ton of weight from a 3 year binge cycle which I have lost. So its not like I look like a skeleton- I HOPE they would be concerned if that were the case, not saying congrats like they do now. I don't really know how to deal with it either, so I don't have an answer to your question, but I can relate <3 ",

      "body": "a girl i went to high school with and worked the same job with came to visit me when i was living in NJ. i had previously moved from where we had been friends at (by about 6/8 months). before i had moved, i weighed about 110 lbs at 5\u20194/ 5\u20195. i had a flat stomach. i had toned legs, thanks to dancing at home every day and night, as well as walking for hours and hours during the day at car shows multiple times a week. my body was beautiful. i wasn\u2019t underweight, though some would argue. but, whatever. \ni became a heavier smoker in NJ. i started eating more again, because i was high all the time and had the munchies, you feel? \ni remember when she came to visit. she said \u201cyou look good, you look different\u201d. and i could tell off the bat what that meant. not long before she came to visit, i began feeling insecure about my weight again. i was at 125/130 at that time, and that was the most i had weighed since HS. (at this time, during this visit, i was 19, almost 20). \nlet\u2019s set that aside. \n\ni moved down to GA later that year. i was about to move again- this time, out west. she randomly showed up to my house which is about nine hours from her own, to surprise me, and to help me make my move. \nside note, of which is irrelevant but shows you that she\u2019s kind of shitty: she only came to NJ because she needed a concert ticket out of her hands and money in place of it. as well as a place to stay, and another car to utilize so that she wouldn\u2019t have to put more miles on the rental car. \nused. \nnow this time, she\u2019d been wanting to go visit the place i was moving to since before i had even the slightest idea i was moving there. \nshe wasn\u2019t here to be my friend. not entirely. i believe and know a small portion was for that, but not the priority. \ntruthfully, i didn\u2019t want her to come. \ni didn\u2019t need the help. \ni\u2019ve moves more times in my life than anyone i\u2019ve ever met, and i wish that that was an exaggeration. i\u2019m a fucking pro ok \n\ngoing back now. \nwithin the first half an hour of her being in my packed up home, she looks at me and goes \u201cdamn girl, you\u2019ve lost a lot of weight! you\u2019re looking way better than when i saw you up north\u201d. \n\n\nshe didn\u2019t know. \n\n\ni never told her that i began passing out a couple months ago. \nshe didn\u2019t know i was starving myself. \nshe didn\u2019t know i lived alone and had even more fear consume me about my collapsed, forfeited body on my floors. \nshe didn\u2019t know my mom cried the first time it happened, and then came over the next morning and made breakfast... in my own kitchen- something i had never done after living in that house for a year. \nshe didn\u2019t know that after that first time passing out, after telling my mom about that first time, that my mom no longer gave a shit about the second time i passed out. not the second time, not the third, fourth, or, to keep it short- the twelfth time i had passed out. \nin an empty home. \njust my dog, and i. \nno neighbors in sight with the exception of one across the street. \nno one to find me, and wake me up but my precious dog. \nshe didn\u2019t know how much physical pain it took to lose almost thirty pounds within 5 weeks, tops. \nshe didn\u2019t know how my mind consumed my body.... literally. \nshe didn\u2019t know i didn\u2019t care to make myself eat, even with all of these factors. \nshe didn\u2019t know how much more difficult it was, because of exactly that. \nshe\ndidn\u2019t\nknow\nshit. \nin fact, she never even bothered to ask how i did it. \nno encouragement, had i have had done it in a healthy manner. \nno concernment for the possibility that i dropped weight too quickly, or too much due to starving myself. \njust a simple compliment. \n\u201ccompliment\u201d.\n\ni didn\u2019t know what to say.  i didn\u2019t know what to do, feel, think.\njust had to remind myself that, though were the same age, she\u2019s naive, and young, and immature. no depth to her adolescent mind. \nso i let it go. \ni smiles and said, \u201cyeah dude, right? thank god. it was the weed man, telling you, hahaha\u201d\nand even then, with that comment having been made back to her... still didn\u2019t ask the obvious question: \u201cwell, did you sober up?\u201d \nnothing. \nshe literally, simply, changed the topic on how excited she was to see something off of the east coast. \n\n\nnow a days, when anyone, at any point in time comments on my weight-\nwhether it is:\n\u2022 \u201cyou lost weight\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cyou\u2019ve gained weight\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cyou\u2019re looking better\u201d\n\u2022 how did you lose that weight\u201d\netc. \n\ni answer abruptly with, \u201ci have an eating disorder so it makes weighing in at 108 lbs (what i\u2019m at currently) just that much easier. nonetheless, i\u2019m stressed. like, all of the time. so. that helps. i also get exercise by running from my problems and staying hydrated.\u201d \n\nthat\u2019s it. \nthat\u2019s all it takes for them to realize that they are a fucking douche wad for even thinking it was okay to be talked about. \nbecause, here\u2019s the thing- and this thing goes for a whole lot of things: \nyou don\u2019t know. \nyou don\u2019t know what someone is going through. \nyou don\u2019t know there train of thoughts, or how it changes and varies, depending on mood, sometimes the weather, a day at work, a poor evening with a significant other or family member. \nyou. do. not. know. \nyou can guess. you can assume. you may know that person a good amount. you may have known them since the first grade. and guess what? \nyou don\u2019t know. \nyou don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on behind closed doors, behind their eyes, inside of their spirit, body, mind, heart. \n\npeople have got to become more aware of this. people have got to quit ignoring this. people must stop and think before they spew out words, and don\u2019t taste them first. \nso, you train people. \ni promise you, when i give anyone that answer of which i shared with you all.... they\u2019re not going to make that dumb ass, mindless comment to someone else. \nsure as hell not to me, \nguaranteed. \n\nwe don\u2019t deserve to be reminded of our pain from someone who is ignorant to it. \nnot only to \u201cit\u201d, but to ignorance in general. \n\ngive them the straight, cold, abrasive answer. \n\u201ci don\u2019t eat. that\u2019s how i look \u2018 this good \u2018 . \n\n\nin closing, i just want to pass on a quote i read once somewhere. \nit goes as follows: \u201cit\u2019s funny to me that when we see ribs and can count fingers on spines on animals, we say \u2018 that animal is sick \u2018 . when we see it on humans, it\u2019s considered \u2018beauty\u2019.\n\n",
