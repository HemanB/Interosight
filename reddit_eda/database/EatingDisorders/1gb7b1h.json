  "selftext": "Hi so me and my girlfriend have been losing weight together for the last 8ish months. We\u2019ve been doing it healthy, or at least I thought we were both doing it healthy.\n\nAfter dinner today I caught her eating a bar of chocolate and a bag of crisps and chewing it up before spitting it into a plastic bag, and rinsing her mouth with water. I was shocked of course and she just didn\u2019t care. Said the y\u2019know what doesn\u2019t count if she does it that way.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how to come at this. I noticed that she\u2019s been getting a bit on the unhealthier side of the weight scale but she just told me her appetite hasn\u2019t been that big. This is the only thing she does that is disordered and I\u2019m really scared for her going down this path. She\u2019s 18 and I\u2019m close to 17 so I can\u2019t do anything really since she\u2019s 18 already but any advice would help ",

      "body": "Chewing and spitting behavior is a pattern of disordered eating that occurs when someone chews food but spits it out instead of swallowing it. The behavior is typically considered an attempt to get pleasure from eating without ingesting calories.\n\nChewing is the first step in the digestive process, which typically sets off a chain reaction in the body, anticipating an influx of food. However, when no food arrives, some of the mechanisms put into motion by chewing can potentially cause problems.\n\nCHSP is a very dangerous disorder in my opinion and I speak from experience. It took over my life like an addiction.",

I think making a list of therapists in your area who specialize in male eating disorders (might be hard to find someone specifically for males but would be awesome if you could) and support him in calling. You can\u2019t fix this for him, the professionals can\u2019t either but they are best equipped to help. \n\n\nAs a 30 year old now, I would be so unhappy with my husband for telling another friend or family member without my knowledge. ED can be so private and about finding a sense of control. If that friend or family member cannot provide professional help, you are just breaching your partners trust. It would also be helpful for you to see a therapist for yourself if you don\u2019t already, it can be a lot for you as well and you will need support",

If he hadn\u2019t told anyone I don\u2019t know where I would be now. \n\n\nIf your gf is only chewing and spitting now, it will progress to include more behaviors and cause more damage as time goes on. You can\u2019t fix this for her, she needs professional guidance. My college had services available for me, her school may offer something like that? My bf sat down with me and supported me while I called them. I got a therapist, psychiatrist, nutritionist and a doctor I met with on campus. When this wasn\u2019t working they furthered my care and connected me with other professionals. \n\n\n12 years later I don\u2019t see or talk to this ex boyfriend often, our relationship ended related to the stress my ED caused but we were also young and not meant to be together forever, but every so often I get a call from him/ I call him and just tell remind him of the huge impact he had on my life. \n\nIt\u2019s going to be hard but she needs help. You\u2019ve only witnessed one incident, her beliefs and views about weight loss are clearly unhealthy and there are likely more behaviors she is finding and lying about. She may be upset with you for wanting her to get help or even suggesting something is wrong. \n\nThere are resources for people supporting those with eating disorders, maybe educating yourself a little more on what behaviors may looks like and how to communicate your concerns to her would be beneficial. \n\n\nI\u2019m so sorry your girlfriend is going through this, you are a good partner for asking for guidance and wanting to help her.",
