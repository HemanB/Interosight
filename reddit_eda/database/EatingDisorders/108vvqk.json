There are real consequences that may seem so distant right now, but the longer you do this the worse it gets. I know it\u2019s hard but you\u2019ve got to try to get it under control.

We are a big community that can offer help in many ways, if even just to talk about going through hard times. I will warn you, a lot of the stories and serious consequences going on in that group will scare the absolute shit out of you, but sometimes that is what a person needs to jumpstart recovery.  It took a coma and long-term hospitalization for me to get my shit together, and I still have permanent damage that will only get worse as I age. Please get help, it's not worth it. They don't call it the world's deadliest eating disorder for nothing.",

All EDs are hard but I think diabulimia is a little harder because it is not well known or understood even in the ed/treatment world (There is not a clear dx for diabulimia and ive had doctors that dont fully agree on the best course of action). Its so important to work towards recovery because, as much as I hate to say it, diabulimia tends to give less time than others to do so.",
