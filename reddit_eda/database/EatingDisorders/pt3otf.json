I have a disability that I stopped receiving help for because the knowledge of how this will affect me is more dangerous to my well being than not seeing a doctor is. I'm getting to a point where I've been putting off surgery for a few years and I'd like to get help for that. If I explain the situation and request not to know the number do you think they'd go for it? ",

If they give you any paperwork ask them if it has your weight on it before you take it and if it does ask that they block it out for you! This may feel awkward but it is super common for many people especially those in recovery! Good for you for keeping your recovery in mind!!!",

I have simply told doctors that I am in treatment for eating disorder and I\u2019m being weighed regularly by my dietitian and prefer not to be weighed at their clinic. They are very understanding and just bypass weighing me completely. When they do insisted that I need to be weighed, I have them weigh me backward and not tell me the number. Some doctors implicitly understand this and do it with ease; however, sometimes you have to tell them precisely what to do. For the most part, the reaction I have had has been very understanding and positive.",

A note is added to your patient profile(provider view) that will have that as a note above your picture. So I\u2019m the future, they won\u2019t ask/show/tell the weight.",

If so, and your doctor is ethical, he or she may advise against it before getting the proper help you need to treat your ED/body dysmorphia. If you can\u2019t acknowledge the number on the scale, elective cosmetic surgery might not be the best option for you right now. Could actually make things worse. I say this without judgement as I\u2019m in the same boat as you, kinda. I\u2019m in recovery but I still suffer from the after effects. It\u2019s a lifelong thing, we just have to learn how to manage. If it\u2019s not cosmetic surgery, then ignore me!",
