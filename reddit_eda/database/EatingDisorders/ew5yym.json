  "selftext": "My boyfriend just bought a scale for our apartment. I\u2019ve been in recovery for such a long time, and I go to my second therapist appointment on Valentine\u2019s Day. He said that he bought the scale for working out, and he\u2019s not trying to lose weight. He knows I have a history of ED. I told him last night that I wasn\u2019t comfortable with the scale, and that it makes me nervous. And he was like \u201cwell you can either ignore it, or you can address the problem.\u201d That kinda hurt me a lot. I\u2019ve been avoiding buying a scale for the apartment. Because I know that I\u2019ll just excessively weigh myself. And that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing. It\u2019s like every time I step on I get a different number. And if I don\u2019t like the number I panic. I want to lose weight but I don\u2019t want to do it in an unhealthy way. But we\u2019re also living on our own so like healthy food and drinks are really expensive right now. I need help. I know every single tome I\u2019m going to go into that bathroom I\u2019m going to weigh myself. No normal person does this.",

Until my husband hid the scale I was weighing myself up to 12 times per day. When my therapist suggested that he put it up, I panicked, but after some adjustment, I recognize that it has been a great thing for me. I think asking that he keep the scale out of sight is a reasonable request. In the end, keeping it around and in sight could be detrimental to your health and wellness, and this is something that I think he should be willing to compromise on.",

No.  That is what he is doing to you, though he may be ignorant of it, because he doesn\u2019t believe that Ed is a disease that kills and ruins lives.  If it takes having a doctor tell him, then seek out an ED doc online and ask them to confirm, via email,  how important not having scales around is to your recovery.  You are a normal person with a serious disease.  Your partner needs to understand that.",
