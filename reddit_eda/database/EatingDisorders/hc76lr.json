  "selftext": "       Hopefully I\u2019m messaging in the right place! I don\u2019t use reddit often. \n\n\n\nI\u2019ve been in recovery for a few years now and I\u2019m finally at a place where I don\u2019t feel completely overwhelmed with food thoughts. I\u2019ve always exercised my whole life but during quarantine I\u2019ve found myself getting maybe a little bit obsessive about it. I can see my body changing and I think it\u2019s triggered some bad habits again. I feel like I\u2019m not eating enough for my workouts because I haven\u2019t been able to finish them anymore. But I\u2019m anxious about eating more again. Anyone have tips for dealing with this during quarantine and unable to access therapy?",

      "body": "I have 12 years of recovery since my last relapse, and I am struggling with this currently, and I struggle with it every time my life loses structure. Therefore, for me, the solution is to add structure.\n\nI want to keep working out. I know I don't have to workout because I have challenged that in the past and I know that nothing bad will happen if I stop. I know that I truly enjoy it and want to do it.\n\nMy solution is to let someone else dictate how much I workout to give me structure. I have signed up for in person group training programs in the past where I just listen to the trainer and do no more than what they ask. Since I can't do group training right now, I purchased a 12 week home workout program and I just do it exactly as prescribed. No more. And I take all the scheduled rest days. At least. Sometimes I add rest days as needed.\n\nI also try to keep a focus on performance. I don't workout if I know my performance will be poor for whatever reason (not enough sleep, not enough food, etc) and therefore, I'm motivated to sleep enough and eat enough. I know I get lethargic if I don't eat so when I feel hungry, I'm motivated to eat, and I'm motivated to eat consistently and in a way to fuel my workouts. It helps to have a general structure to adhere to and add to on hungrier days. \n\nMy other solution is to add other structure to my life. I keep a consistent general sleep schedule, and I try to have other goals and projects going. This keeps me occupied so I am not getting sucked into that obsessive thought pattern.\n\nIf you are feeling a lot of fear and aren't ready for that stuff, I would say that you need to go back to my earlier point, which is to challenge your fears and prove to yourself that nothing bad will happen. Doing this changed my life and really helped me to have balance in my life with exercise.\nFor me, I took several weeks off. I made it a rule that I would do NOTHING in terms of exercise for a given amount of time (for me, it was about a month and a half) and keep eating consistently. The point of the whole thing was to have time to think about other things, and, more importantly, to prove that I didn't NEED to exercise. Nothing bad would happen if I stopped. My body didn't change in any way that I noticed during that time. I have carried that lesson for my whole life so I know I can take time off when I need it or if I feel myself getting obsessive.\nBecause I thought in advance to make it a RULE to not exercise at all for a given period of time, I felt I have permission to not do it and didn't need to feel guilty. Whenever anything would trigger me, I would remind myself that I'm on my own path and my body doesn't change based on what others are doing.",
