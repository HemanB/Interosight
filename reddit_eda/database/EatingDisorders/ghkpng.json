  "title": "Request: My Mom Encourages Disordered Eating, I Need to Set Boundaries... help?",
  "selftext": "I fought my battle against anorexia with bulimic tendencies for 8 years (11 to 19). Been in recovery for 6 years \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb I went from being severely underweight, to swinging to normal or slightly heavy for my frame. Working with my therapist and my nutritionist to find my new normal. It\u2019s a daily struggle. Ugh. \n\nMy mom has never had a healthy relationship with food herself. But since I started recovery she has started to have really bad anxiety about me gaining weight... (I was very underweight. I needed to gain weight).\n\nShe will text me every week telling me how I \u201cused to be so pretty\u201d or \u201cjust eat xxx (small number) calories today and you will start to look so much better\u201d. I tell her about my struggles and pain and all she says is \u201cI would rather that you be beautiful than healthy\u201d. \n\nI don\u2019t want to cut her out of my life, but I need to learn how to set boundaries with someone who won\u2019t get it. This isn\u2019t just straight forward... help? Does anyone else struggle with this? I feel so alone when I tell my story about my mom encouraging disordered eating.",

She's scared of gaining weight (which isn't always about weight, maybe it's a fear of \"losing control\" or something else), and seeing you recover may trigger her. It's really hard for people to let go of the mentality that smaller = better, and seeing you recovered and healthy may be challenging her beliefs. Boundaries are definitely necessary, but maybe your mom may also need to talk to someone to realize her behaviors too? She may be completely unaware that what she is saying is harmful.",

Hang up, text her you'll call later once she's had time to calm down and then turn off your phone. Wait a day then try calling her again.  \n\nOr you could do everything through text.
