Don't make assumptions like that which could quite easily undermine and dismiss someone's struggles through recovery. They're simply providing some hope and motivation - and when you're in recovery, you have to grab every bit of motivation and hope you can and hype it up to make it a little easier, because it is still incredibly hard journey and a constant choice. OP probably has had years of negative health affects, and this one's just got through to them or scared them just enough to make a choice and try to stick with it - like the case of many ED sufferers. \n\nThat saddest thing about ED recovery is to achieve it, you gotta want it some way or another. Don't shit on someone having a moment of clarity through the shit storm we're all in.",
