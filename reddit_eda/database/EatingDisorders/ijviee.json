  "selftext": " \n\nI\u2019m so happy to be in recovery, but one thing no one talks about is how expensive it is...\n\nwhen my eating disorder was at it\u2019s worst, I would only eat at work, so my food costs were effectively zero.\n\nIt\u2019s so nice to be cooking again & getting groceries for myself but it is a big financial adjustment. & with this pandemic, i\u2019m making like half of what I used to.\n\nbut overall what is most overwhelming. is that i can\u2019t afford to get myself new clothes to accommodate my new healthier body. wearing clothes that are too small for me is really damaging to my self esteem & my recovery. and not to mention extremely physically uncomfortable.\n\nright now I have 14 pairs of pants that no longer fit, & one single pair of stretchy pants that do.\n\n& with my shirts the only ones that fit me are my comfy pajama type shirts. or shirts that were once cutely oversized are now just an awkward fit.\n\nI\u2019m surprisingly ok with my new body, it\u2019s soft and curvy & cute ! but as soon as I put clothes on, i feel so incredibly ugly & unfashionable.\n\nI\u2019m at a loss, I know that if I had nice clothes that fit I would feel soooo much better about recovering.\n\nBut I really can\u2019t afford to get new clothes.\n\neven thrifting is a bit too expensive for me right now & I struggle to find clothes that fit properly & that are still nice. plus shopping can be somewhat triggering for me.\n\nbut I know I can\u2019t be losing weight just to fit into these old clothes.\n\nnot sure if i\u2019m looking for advice or not.\n\njust wondering if other people in recovery can relate & share their wisdom <3",

If you are weighed by an MD or your RD, that's best - please don't weigh yourself at home.\n\nRecovery is costly, but so worth it.",

I am now quite overweight, and I had to throw away some clothes as a result - they were no longer wearable.

I would love to be able to eat healthier, but my ED doesn't allow me to without getting sick, so it's a harsh struggle. Plus, the healthier foods tend to run more money.\n\nSolidarity, my friend.",
