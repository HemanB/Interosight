I\u2019ve never had issues with weight or appearance. My ED comes from financial trauma and recently because I\u2019ve wanted to shut off my period. Anyone else like me?

I actually don't really care what I look like, and weight is kind of just a number to me. \n\nMy ED manifests more as an OCD type thing that revolves around food, exercise amounts, numbers, etc. \n\nI think deep down it probably also has a little to do with not wanting to age, since I have memory loss from the accident and the idea of waking up older and not remembering it is just so awful to me. \n\nUnfortunately I don't have any recovery advice, but recovery is a very individual thing anyway. You need a good therapist who works well with you and your needs specifically, as well as a medical team for any physical issues.",

When I feel guilty, shame, or bad about something, or like a burden to others, I feel like I deserve to physically feel as bad as I believe I am, so I restrict. It allows me to manifest those emotions and have control over them in some way. I have been underweight my whole life not due to restricting, and I have wanted to gain weight my whole life\u2026 I could care less how much I weigh as long as it\u2019s over 100 lbs.
