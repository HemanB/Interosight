In those gums are a ton of ingredients that are kind of poisonous to us, no need to worry with the intake of a small amount, but yes: intake of a big amount is worrying. \n\nOP it\u2019s very good you reached out. It sounds like an addiction. Are you able to get treatment/help to heal this? I wish you have and hope for the best for you.",
