      "body": "I got diagnosed with bulimia when I was about 16 (I'm 22 now) but started binging & purging when I was around 12/13. It took years to surface because as we all know, eating disorders are progressive and a lot of us feel ashamed.\nWhen I first got hospitalised they began to cotton on, as my behaviours we too obvious to miss. I would even say I'd was self harming to try & hide it.\nSooo now up to today, thanks to intensive therapy, meds & supportive peers I have been able to become much better at coping with my intense urges. \nBeing able to chow down on a pizza (although I only managed to take a few bites because the feeling in my mouth made me gag) is monumental for me!! \nThanks y'all \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",
