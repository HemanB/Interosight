  "title": "Request: Eating Disorder and relationship question",
  "selftext": " \n\nI've had anorexia since I was 14. There was a brief period in high school where I was a healthy weight, but other than that, I've been underweight. When I met my current boyfriend, I was probably about 10 pounds heavier than I am now. My boyfriend usually doesn't talk about my weight or eating disorder because he knows it upsets me. He also doesn't believe in marriage because he thinks it's outdated and has a negative experience with it (his parents and a lot of his friends' marriages have ended in divorce). I've always wanted to be married, but I love my boyfriend and want to be with him, so I've put the topic aside. Recently, I brought up my eating disorder (I forget the specific context), and he said, \"What if you got to and maintained a healthy weight, I would marry you? Would you do it then?\" I honestly am not sure because we have some communication issues that we're currently working on in couples' therapy. Any advice or input would be greatly appreciated!",

An eating disorder is not something you can change just like that, lets say he marries you, an eating disorder is not that simple and wont just disappear (that\u2019s how I experience it atleast). He should respect that. I don\u2019t think he means it like that though, I bet he really cares about you but marriage shouldn\u2019t be about \u201cif you do this, I\u2019ll do this\u201d it should be an mutual feeling that you both wanna do for yourselves out of love, not out of a compromise.",

Reading between the lines he loves and cares about you a hell of a lot. \n\nThat being said I don\u2019t think that his approach is necessarily the best idea even with the best intention. I tried to do something similar once and it just blew up in my face. I was like when I\u2019m a healthy weight we can have our third baby and then got caught pregnant and it was frankly a disaster that has set me back a long way. \n\nPeople who have not personally struggled with eating disorders tend to really struggle to grasp how they work. Maybe if you\u2019re opening dialogue about your eating disorder it might be helpful to provide him with some resources he can read through in his own time to aid his understanding? Also with respect to the offer I think it\u2019s something best discussed again in your relationship counselling because you would be completely reasonable to say \u201cthat\u2019s not what I want or why I want you to marry me\u201d etc and if you guys sometimes struggle to communicate it might be difficult to get the across in the way you intend and he may have a hard time hearing what you\u2019re actually communicating even if you do. At the end of the day we are all only human. \n\nLike I say this is my gut reaction based off limited information and no knowledge about you/your bf/your relationship so take it with a pinch of salt and wishing you all the best.",

Having a partner with an ED or a history of one can be tricky, and being educated on how to support someone recovering is very important. This might also be an opportunity for you to bring up your different views on marriage. It sounds like he was trying to help, I'm glad that you have a support system!",

I guess he\u2019s desperate and just want the best for you and wants you to be healthy and happy but you won\u2019t get healthy when you just put on some weight because he promised you to marry you then. \nI mean he said he don\u2019t believe in marriage?! Will this change with a different weight? \nYes in relationships you always need to find reasonable compromises but compromises who put a lot of pressure to one person and not to the other aren\u2019t fair, are they? \nYou should never put such pressure on your significant other, specially when it comes to mental health. \nMaybe I\u2019m all wrong but I think he should try another way of supporting you in your recovery. \nIf he really loves you he will marry you no matter what weight you have.",

He really must love you if he went out of his way to do something he knows you love and he doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s a good man. You should try telling him or explaining how you feel and what it is like to suffer with this disorder and make sure he understands. Then set up little rules for yourself like eat 2 meals and a snack at least every day. Or tell yourself one good thing every day. I am not a professional but I think you should also go to a therapist. I wish you luck on your journey!",

He needs to be sure you love yourself before he commits to you.\n\nThink about it this way. Your boyfriend has watched you try and starve yourself to death. That is fucking terrifying. I have watched a person I love very dearly almost drink himself to death, and it is the WORST feeling to be so completely helpless while he self-destructs. It also makes me so angry that he cannot see the beauty in him that I see, so he tries to destroy everything. I am so afraid to lose him and so afraid I will be powerless to stop it. \n\nHe\u2019s asking you to prove to him that you are serious about caring for yourself. The number on the scale is just one way to show that, but it means something. It\u2019s something he can see and verify and trust, because, look: you have lied to him. He has seen you check a calorie label and then cheerfully tell him you don\u2019t care, when both of you know that damn well isn\u2019t true. It\u2019s the equivalent of you asking him, if he were an alcoholic, if he never drank again would you marry him. \n\nMarriage, especially to people whose parents have been through it (and trust me\u2014divorce is usually good for the kids, it\u2019s just the lead-up that\u2019s the problem, and sometimes the aftermath), means fucking everything. He tells you he doesn\u2019t believe in it because he believes the opposite. Marriage is the most fucking important thing in the world to this guy because he means it and he won\u2019t do it lightly and he needs to know that if you\u2019re in, you\u2019re fucking IN.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to prove anything to him\u2014he\u2019s already convinced. You need to prove it to yourself.",
