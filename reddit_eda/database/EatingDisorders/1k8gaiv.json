  "selftext": "My 13-yr-old is in the grip of a really bad eating disorder (anorexia). Two hospital stays, two PHPs (briefly), three-month stint at a residential program. She's now in another residential program and is absolutely miserable and wants out. And in fact it does sound horrible -- fellow client spit food into napkin at lunch and no one noticed; cook or chef plays Spotify with ads and yesterday they loudly heard an ad for some diet pill. The comment from staff was \"we've talked to him but he does whatever he wants\".\n\nThe worst thing about it is it is not a recovery-positive environment at all it sounds like. One client drank all their supplement at a meal, prompting another to say \"Wow you drank that entire thing?\" . That sort of thing. \n\nShe has been there less than a week but I promised her to find a solution by Wednesday. She keeps claiming she can be at home and I haven't given her enough of a chance. Would i be insane to let her come home for a third time?? I'm a single mom and have another kid as well so just the meal prep involved is so hard for me, and the last two times she was here she did not do well. OTOH my other daughter, who's younger, really wants her sister home and keeps saying she can't go on without her sister (younger daughter has an anxiety disorder)",

I agree with other posters that its best to have another program lined up. \n\n\nAlso, I\u2019m not sure where you live and how your insurance works- but in my experience, if you were to leave treatment or take a child out of treatment AMA (against medical advice) it can affect future treatment options as your insurance may see that you did not \u201cneed\u201d the treatment as its a waste of their money and may make it harder to get coverage for other treatment.\n\n\nI would complain to the director and other higher ups about the behavior of staff and the poor quality of care.

When I got to the residential setting, there were so many crazy dramatic things happening; people were so far beyond my understanding of 'normal life', and I felt sure that my sheltered mother would hate that I was there...being exposed to 'rough' life. (I was 44 BTW). I would tell my H. that \"if people knew what I'm seeing, what I'm hearing, and how they treat us, they would want me out ASAP.' - Truthfully, that was the ED finding the proverbial 'hair in the soup'. \n\nNo, there is no treatment program that will ever be perfect. Quite a few tech staff at my program were awful to us. I wasn't allowed to rest even when we had 2 hours of sleep only; I wasn't allowed to be happy if staff were upset, as they would just glare and be rude. They would be snippy, rub my face in the fact that I needed to take the supplement (which was in addition to huge meal plan), be sarcastic, pick favorites, and more. \n\n  \nIt still was the best option available, however. No other place would take me, and this place - for all its flaws - still made a major impact for the better.  It's the lesser of the greatest evil - no help at all, and eventual death.\n\nWhy are the attending staff at Res treatment centers so awful? they are burnt out, sick of ED lying/manipulating, and they themselves may not fully understand how EDs are. In addition, the requisite measures to break down the power of an ED are often necessarily draconian. The tiniest bit of wiggle room will turn into a highway of enabling. Those who are starving cannot make logical decisions that threaten their propensity to starve. Once a person is refed and restored to a livable weight, only then can they start to be trusted to make decisions for themselves.",

(I was 44 BTW). I would tell my H. that \"if people knew what I'm seeing, what I'm hearing, and how they treat us, they would want me out ASAP.' - Truthfully, that was the ED finding the proverbial 'hair in the soup'. \n\nNo, there is no treatment program that will ever be perfect. Quite a few tech staff at my program were awful to us. I wasn't allowed to rest even when we had 2 hours of sleep only; I wasn't allowed to be happy if staff were upset, as they would just glare and be rude. They would be snippy, rub my face in the fact that I needed to take the supplement (which was in addition to huge meal plan), be sarcastic, pick favorites, and more. \n\n  \nIt still was the best option available, however. No other place would take me, and this place - for all its flaws - still made a major impact for the better.  It's the lesser of the greatest evil - no help at all, and eventual death.\n\nWhy are the attending staff at Res treatment centers so awful? they are burnt out, sick of ED lying/manipulating, and they themselves may not fully understand how EDs are. In addition, the requisite measures to break down the power of an ED are often necessarily draconian. The tiniest bit of wiggle room will turn into a highway of enabling. Those who are starving cannot make logical decisions that threaten their propensity to starve.
