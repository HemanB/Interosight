Especially being a wrestler, I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t need to tell you that that sport is a perfect breeding ground for eating disorders. If not for you, then do it for your gf, because when you\u2019re in wrestling season, you\u2019ll need to be careful of the way you talk about losing weight to avoid triggering her. You can only control that to a certain extent, but therapy is worth looking into so you\u2019re more knowledgeable, and so you don\u2019t get burnt out and harbor resentment for your gf.",

Often supporters can neglect their own needs and desires too. But it can also bring you closer together. \n\nFor some people, caring for someone with an eating disorder can bring some things up for them as well if they are predispositioned to it. Remember that it is important to take care of yourself before taking care of her. Your support is no good if you are struggling and burn yourself out too. Do what you need to do even if that means putting some boundaries up. It can definitely be hard! Supporters are so important though! I have been building an app to help people with eating issues if you or your gf are interested in it. One aspect of it is to include supporters on it too. We also put together a guide for relationships and eating disorders. You can find this all on our website. Take care! [https://www.beanbaghealth.com/](https://www.beanbaghealth.com/)",

The fact of the matter is, you think there is something up enough to warrant getting on an ED subreddit to ask people who have EDs, or who are very close to a person or people with EDs, whether you should be concerned *and* we're saying \"yes, get help now before it gets horrible.\"\n\nTrust us, you don't want to fuck around with an ED. Catch it before it gets bad and your life becomes a living hell.",
