When we are in some of those places, we might stop eating. Not because we want to, but because for some reason our appetite is not there anymore - our brain is telling us there is something more dire to focus on. It\u2019s important in those times to eat purposefully to avoid a pattern of disordered eating that then turns into a eating disorder. \n\nBut it\u2019s also important to remember that binging, purging, overeating, etc. can also be trauma responses. \n\nMoreover, as @Excellent-World-476 said, no one thing causes an ED. So it\u2019s best to consult a medical professional.",
