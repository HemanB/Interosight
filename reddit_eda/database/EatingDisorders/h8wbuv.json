I noticed for myself that recovery symptoms were way worse after I relapsed than they were the first time I entered recovery. It is something that I understand you just have to accept and grit through, knowing and trusting that your body knows what it needs and needs to do in order to heal. \nIT GETS BETTER.

It\u2019s really normal during recovery but if it persists in a year I\u2019d get it checked out. Eating disorders can cause a lot of health issues down the road.
