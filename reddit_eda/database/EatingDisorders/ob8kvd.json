      "body": "Please be honest, get the strength to tell your mum, or someone you can trust, about how you're still really struggling. She's not the enemy. She loves you so much and wants to help you fight this evil disease.\n\n The disease is so awful and it thrives on secrecy. It thrives on existing just in your own head where it can grow without being called out by reason/rationality. But hopefully your mum will understand it's not really YOU that has been behaving that way.\n\nIt is so so good you have great goals. You are so young with your whole life ahead of you. Choose recovery. Fuck the eating disorder - every time it tries to lie and tell you to do something that is going to get in the way of your recovery/restoration of your life - tell it to fuck off :P\n\nYou can do this. Your future self will be so proud and thankful for it. Choose recovery, and crack on and do what you gotta do (eat what your plan says). It will feel really hard at first. But hold on to that big picture. Keep talking to your mum etc about how you're finding it. And keep fighting. Xxx\n\nEdit: im really sorry - realised this is a bit old. But read your message and couldn't help but reply sorry. Hope it's not too out of place. Just you have my best wishes from afar :) take care",
