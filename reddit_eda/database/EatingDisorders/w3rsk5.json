      "body": "I never stopped really, but it helped knowing that I had people around me who loved me regardless of these feelings. That\u2019s the voice I had to change more than anything else; the one that told me the whole world *knew* I was horrible and gross and looked at me with disgust. I thought I had to be anorexic (skinny/pretty) for people to like or care about me and that\u2019s the main thing I was trying to control/avoid. Now I\u2019m super pregnant, about to have a baby, and definitely want to starve and workout and lose all the weight I\u2019ve gained, but it\u2019s not as bad. I know my bf loves me, I need to feed my baby (if you restrict too much you lose your milk), and I know I am genuinely loved by my friends and family, something I feel on a deeper level than I ever have in my life.\n\nI think it\u2019s about finding things that make you feel genuine happiness and a sense of importance. For me, that was mending relationships and accepting my value in them, and contributing in a way that made me feel important and fulfilled. Baby was just a happy bonus that happened along the way \n\nOnce you find what brings you those positive feelings, the negative ones and voices are easier to tell \u201cFUCK OFF\u201d",

When I didn't want to eat that greasy burger and I found myself nitpicking it into tiny prices I would smack my arm and tell my body \"No.\" I don't know how to stop wanting to feel like a stick. When my head told me one thing/ the negative voice told me no I would quietly talk to it out loud and debate it I guess in a way lol. That sounds rather odd, but it helped a little bit I guess. I don't know to be honest. I guess to develop a voice that tells me to repeat bad patterns I argue with it. Sorry, I honestly don't know. That's just one thing that I did to help myself.\n\n The only reason I no longer have the eating disorder is because I was triggered by my job and stress so I used bad coping mechanisms over time and I quit before the busy season started again to avoid any triggers. Develop a rational mindset you know like the 2 angels on your shoulders and when you get the \"devil\" angel (so to say), debate it and practice your argument skills I guess haha...\nThen be stubborn about it and when you are stubborn about ignoring that bad voice that tells you to do something you reward yourself with something (you can start a collection of something and get creative) idk...\nJust an idea lol \nI'm not a psychologist.\nWhen you reward yourself like that you also boost chemicals in your brain so it may help.
