So if anyone could explain the difference between the two disorders it would be greatly appreciated, as what i've read online has confused me a bit. thanks!",

Meaning that the person with this would fit the criteria for anorexia but would also engage in bulimic behaviors to a clinically significant enough extent to note it. \nBulimia is where the person primarily binges and purges and may (actually probably more likely than not) exhibit some anorexic behaviors but not clinically significant enough to meet that criteria.\nA person who doesn\u2019t meet criteria for anorexia or bulimia but primarily participates in anorexic behaviors with or without bulimic tendencies would be labeled as EDNOS. EDNOS, although without the criteria of being underweight and perhaps at less risk than the full blown bulimic for major issues, shouldn\u2019t be discounted as any less dangerous than the other two. In fact, it may be more detrimental in the long run. \n\nSubtypes exist because both sets of behaviors are dangerous but need to be treated differently to avoid making the other worse.

It's all restriction, ultimately, for a lot of people (restrict too much=body gets impulses to feast=binge=shame=restrict). Anorexia on its own doesn't really have that binge piece in there, but a lot of people ultimately develop that behaviour, even if they didn't do it in the beginning (not everyone. I didn't, but maybe I would have if I'd been sick longer). \n\nI started recovery without knowing I had anorexia specifically, and I was even admitted to the hospital without hearing anyone use that word. My mom finally told me what the doctors had been telling her I had. To me, anorexia was just a thing on doctor Phil, and I was just doing my special talent (restricting). That is to say, you don't need to have a name for it to get better. It might even be better because you won't identifying yourself by your illness and therefore have a harder time letting go of it.\n\nUltimately, whether it is anorexia or bulimia, the solution is to stop restricting completely and challenge fears to rewire your brain.\n\nNot a doctor, just sharing my understanding",
