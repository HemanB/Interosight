      "body": "Hey OP, I was in your same position. I was anorexic (& had binge/purge/exercise issues) and recovered (mostly) all on my own, without any treatment plan or external help. Not everyone can do it and every case is different, but I\u2019ll give you my two cents on the matter.\n\nFirst of all, congratulations on trying to recover. You\u2019ve made the right choice, my friend, and I\u2019m proud of you.\n\nFocus more on how you\u2019re feeling than how much you\u2019re eating. Don\u2019t worry about how much is a \u201cnormal\u201d amount because you aren\u2019t in a normal situation. If you\u2019re dizzy/cold/hungry/headache/etc, eat. Wear loose fitting clothes, don\u2019t weigh yourself and get rid of any home scales, try not to look at yourself in mirrors/pictures too much, drink lots of water, eat plenty of fibre and carbs, try to avoid looking at the calories on food or eat food you don\u2019t know the calories of if you\u2019ve memorised them, surround yourself with loved ones, put away any tight / too small clothing, and HONOUR YOUR CRAVINGS. It\u2019s very likely that you\u2019ll experience \u201cextreme hunger\u201d a little while after you start trying to recover. This is not binge eating and it is not unhealthy. It is a normal part of recovery coming from your body finally being out of starvation mode and wanting to make up for lost time. If you need to eat more than three meals a day, eat those extra meals. If you need to have a snack fifteen minutes after dinner, eat that damn snack. Listen to your body and try to care for it and give it what it wants after ignoring it for so long. It\u2019s trying to heal you, and you can\u2019t recover if you don\u2019t let it do so. On the flip side, if you experience low appetite / fullness even when not eating enough try drinking tea, getting nourishing liquids like smoothies/shakes/soup, and prepping meals that are easier to handle for when it\u2019s hard to get enough food in. \n\nIf you have the compulsion to exercise or purge, what I liked to do early in recovery was go on a short, slow walk and use my cellphone to take a picture of ten beautiful things. Flowers, dogs, cars, anything that struck me as lovely. It helped take my mind off of myself and my body, and that motion eased those self destructive feelings without hurting me or straining my body.\n\nAbove all else, never give up. It might be hard, you might feel shitty sometimes, but this will not be hard forever. In a year, or five years, or ten years, you\u2019ll be looking back on this time and thanking yourself profusely for not letting yourself waste away due to this disease.\n\nI\u2019d also STRONGLY recommend checking out @_thewellnessdiaries on TikTok and YouTube! She was my saving grace early in recovery, and is one of the only recovery accounts that has genuinely helped me a great deal with my eating habits and negative thought patterns.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how slowly you go, so long as you do not stop.\u201d\n\nI believe in you and I know you can do this! Feel free to DM me if you ever need any more advice or support :)",

I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. \n\nEverybody is very different with their recovery so take my advice with a grain of salt. \n\nFor years, I tried to recover on my own. I told myself it was just a \"willpower,\" thing etc. However, once it started impacting my job, I had to seek treatment. \n\nTherapy was a massive game changer for sure. Once I started seeing it as a medical condition and not a personal failure, it really helped. My therapist really helped me dig down into the issues of where my disorder came from. It was definitely helpful, but  I think I can mostly attribute my recovery to my change in lifestyle. In many ways, my disorder was never about the food. \n\nSo I quit my toxic job, stopped obsessing over my appearance/how people perceived me, and prioritized my health/wellness. Again, everybody is different, but I personally found it detrimental to have meal plans etc. since it just lent itself to my obsession with food and my body. I stopped labeling foods and \"good\"/\"bad\" and learnt to be flexible. \n\nAgain, I found therapy to be massively helpful in this regard (Particularly a very liberal one who specializes in attachment issues), but I had to change as well. New friends, social media breaks, etc. \n\nIf you can afford it, I would recommend getting treatment for sure. Sorry for the long post! Feel free to DM me :)",

Relapses will happen but they are not the end of the world. Be gentle with yourself and as forgiving as you are with your most beloved friends. \n\nPersonally I found that talk therapy didn\u2019t get me very far, though did provide a safe person to hold me accountable. I suggest finding someone in your life you trust that you can confide in, without judgement. Tell people about what you\u2019re experiencing- you may find that they are compassionate and understanding. Many people have a difficult relationship with food these days. \nRemove all scales from your house, or put them somewhere you can\u2019t easily access them. Along with every other triggering item that isn\u2019t helping your recovery. For me this meant putting away a favorite pair of shorts, and a beautiful dress that no longer fit. I still love them and hold onto them, but I no longer pine to fit into them again. \n\nFor me, what helped was having a semblance of a routine. Meaning a high protein breakfast (even though eating in the morning used to make me violently ill), a snack or two to get me through the day, and at least something for dinner. Being too strict makes me wanna vom (haha) but if I have no structure I just don\u2019t eat all day until I binge at the end of the night (& then really vom). \nExercise (not overboard) helps me eat with a lot more peace of mind. Not in a I-only-deserve-to-eat-when-I-work-out kind of way but in a \u201cif I don\u2019t eat I\u2019ll perish\u201d way. Being strong is a lot better of a feeling than feeling shakey and weak after a purge. Finding motivations in my future to look forward to has also helped a lot. Like I want to have kids and big family, but I don\u2019t want to still be leaching my trauma out onto them. So having a healthy body and mind\u2014 free from the torture of thinking about food/my body every waking hour of the day, is a hell of a motivator. \n\nEventually you\u2019ll get tired of living with an eating disorder but I hope and pray you can overcome this before then. You\u2019re already on the right path. You got this !",

      "body": "I actually overcame anorexia on my own, but I strongly encourage you to go seek professional help. It's always better done that way. \nFrom the beginning of my ED to full recovery, it took me 4 years. But during those, it took me 2-3 years to understand I was anorexic in the first place.\n\nHere's what helped me get my eating habits back to normal.\n\n1) I acknowledged that I was hurting myself by starving myself or eating so much in a binge that I actually ended up sick and vomiting. Once you see that what you think is control and just keeping a nice waistline is actually making you sick ( feeling dizzy, lack of energy, irritable, always cold, always thinking about food and the next meal, binging and getting sick), you'll start to understand that there is some changes to make.\n\n2) I allowed myself to actually enjoy what were \"prohibited \" meals or foods. This is really hard. Honoring my cravings, like cookies, burgers or ice creams, things that were totally off limits before, or even just have a nice diner out with friends without thinking about the consequences, just thinking about the good time I had, this helped me a lot. And this goes with next point\n\n3) To better honor your cravings and just go back to a normal life when you do enjoy some dessert, burgers, pizzas or whatever from time to time ( in a nutshell, when you have a balanced diet), also acknowledge that no food alone is or will make you fat. It's not because you eat that pint of ice cream that you will be fat or obese tomorrow. You could even do that every night during one week and actually only gain like a pound. This was hard for me to realize, but it takes to take the step and eat the thing to realize 1 week after that what you think was a horrible meal or the biggest cheat meal of your life, actually didn't change anything about your weight or appearance. So go ahead, eat your ice cream or whatever you enjoyed in the past and is off limits now, and trust me, when you'll see that you don't become overweight overnight, you'll understand that enjoying these kinds of foods doesn't mean you're loosing control over your life/health. And it will not only heal your relationship with food, but also with yourself, because honoring a fast food craving, even if is not that nourishing for your body, is nourishing for your mind and soul, because you ate what also makes you happy. And that's as important as being physically healthy. So please, eat out with your family, eat your icecream, but when you do, do not count macros or calories. Yes, you might be over what your body needs physically that day in terms of calories but who cares? Your body doesn't and even the scale doesn't so why would you? So just enjoy your icecream without focusing on the energy that it is bringing to your body, but focus on how it is healing your soul, your memories with people, and how good it also feels when meals are more than just numbers but also good times to be respected as such.\n\n4) If you have anorexia like I did, you might be underweight. This is, of course, not true for everyone. In my case, I was, and when you understand that being too thin doesn't make you look good, and that people don't admire your good shape, but are actually concerned about your lack of meat to cover your bones, you understand that gaining a few pounds might not only make you feel good, but also more beautiful. To shake myself up, I mentally accepted to gain about 10 lbs to get some curves back and just globally be healthier. Of course it is hard to see the scale numbers going up. But once you see that even with those new pounds, you are still in a healthy weight and you look more beautiful than with that stickman waistline, you stop thinking that you need to always shed pounds to be prettier or just to be accepted. And I loved how people thought I looked better once I gained that weight back.  \nIf you are anorexic but aren't underweight or just like very thin, it's good to acknowledge that being too thin isn't actually a beauty standard for most people. Whatever the beauty industry, celebrities or instagram is trying to make you believe, thinner is usually not always better. It raises concerns about your health and actually makes you feel less beautiful and really just bad about yourself. It's always the contrary that your mind is trying to make you believe: \" you will be pretty once you reach X weight or X measurements\" : truth is, you are never satisfied about them, no matter how thin you are or how perfect your measurements are. That's just how our nature is: never believe that you are good enough, when in fact, you have always been. So good things to keep in mind: you are valuable, you are beautiful now, and you will be beautiful either way with a couple of extra pounds.\n\n5) once you get past those stages, you might or might not have gained weight. Either way, it's ok. Just understand that you're worth more than just a number in a scale. The important thing is to be healthy. Being too thin isn't. Your weight being aligned with your health, that's what's important. Not fitting into X or Y size or being X pounds. So enjoy those gained pounds or your stable weight as a victory sign of you making peace with yourself. And by then, you won't see foods as good or bad, \" safe foods\" and \" off limits foods. You will just see food for what it is : nourishment for either your body or your soul. And therefore, you gain neutrality over food. So then, you can trust yourself to make good choices for you in your daily food intake. Nothing feels risky, you are just trying to be healthy on the outside but also inside.\n\n6) after some time, when you truly feel healed,  when you feel like food isn't controlling your life anymore, that you aren't constantly thinking about food or your weight, when at last you are back to a normal relationship with food and your body, you can then track your weight. Not in a way where you always aim to be thiner but on the contrary, in a way where you just try to keep your weight/ shape stable. If because X or Y events your weight went up, try to accept that a body changes over time and it is normal. If you are gaining too much weight because of your food intake, before starting a diet or anything, ask yourself: Am I medically overweight please go see a nutritionist who will guide you, either to loose weight if necessary but in a controlled way, or just to reassure you that these are normal changes and shouldn't be concerned because not a threat to your health.\n\nI hope these tips can help you. It's not easy, and if you don't succeed on your first attempts, it's not because you lack of willpower, you're just a normal human being. Changes take time, just take a few steps at the time, and one day you'll see how much of the road you've covered and that you actually did recover.\n\nStay strong,\n\nAll my best wishes on you recovery journey!",

Not everyone can do it and every case is different, but I\u2019ll give you my two cents on the matter.\n\nFirst of all, congratulations on trying to recover. You\u2019ve made the right choice, my friend, and I\u2019m proud of you.\n\nFocus more on how you\u2019re feeling than how much you\u2019re eating. Don\u2019t worry about how much is a \u201cnormal\u201d amount because you aren\u2019t in a normal situation. If you\u2019re dizzy/cold/hungry/headache/etc, eat. Wear loose fitting clothes, don\u2019t weigh yourself and get rid of any home scales, try not to look at yourself in mirrors/pictures too much, drink lots of water, eat plenty of fibre and carbs, try to avoid looking at the calories on food or eat food you don\u2019t know the calories of if you\u2019ve memorised them, surround yourself with loved ones, put away any tight / too small clothing, and HONOUR YOUR CRAVINGS. It\u2019s very likely that you\u2019ll experience \u201cextreme hunger\u201d a little while after you start trying to recover. This is not binge eating and it is not unhealthy. It is a normal part of recovery coming from your body finally being out of starvation mode and wanting to make up for lost time. If you need to eat more than three meals a day, eat those extra meals. If you need to have a snack fifteen minutes after dinner, eat that damn snack. Listen to your body and try to care for it and give it what it wants after ignoring it for so long.

          "body": "Hey OP, I was in your same position. I was anorexic (& had binge/purge/exercise issues) and recovered (mostly) all on my own, without any treatment plan or external help. Not everyone can do it and every case is different, but I\u2019ll give you my two cents on the matter.\n\nFirst of all, congratulations on trying to recover. You\u2019ve made the right choice, my friend, and I\u2019m proud of you.\n\nFocus more on how you\u2019re feeling than how much you\u2019re eating. Don\u2019t worry about how much is a \u201cnormal\u201d amount because you aren\u2019t in a normal situation. If you\u2019re dizzy/cold/hungry/headache/etc, eat. Wear loose fitting clothes, don\u2019t weigh yourself and get rid of any home scales, try not to look at yourself in mirrors/pictures too much, drink lots of water, eat plenty of fibre and carbs, try to avoid looking at the calories on food or eat food you don\u2019t know the calories of if you\u2019ve memorised them, surround yourself with loved ones, put away any tight / too small clothing, and HONOUR YOUR CRAVINGS. It\u2019s very likely that you\u2019ll experience \u201cextreme hunger\u201d a little while after you start trying to recover. This is not binge eating and it is not unhealthy. It is a normal part of recovery coming from your body finally being out of starvation mode and wanting to make up for lost time. If you need to eat more than three meals a day, eat those extra meals. If you need to have a snack fifteen minutes after dinner, eat that damn snack. Listen to your body and try to care for it and give it what it wants after ignoring it for so long. It\u2019s trying to heal you, and you can\u2019t recover if you don\u2019t let it do so. On the flip side, if you experience low appetite / fullness even when not eating enough try drinking tea, getting nourishing liquids like smoothies/shakes/soup, and prepping meals that are easier to handle for when it\u2019s hard to get enough food in. \n\nIf you have the compulsion to exercise or purge, what I liked to do early in recovery was go on a short, slow walk and use my cellphone to take a picture of ten beautiful things.
