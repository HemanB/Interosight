  "title": "Request: Worried about a girl in my sports class",
  "selftext": "So I do group workouts during the week at my uni's sports facility, and I keep seeing this girl who is extremely underweight - to the point where her leggings fit her like wide pants. I feel bad saying that she is skin and bones, but she absolutely looks malnourished. Now, I wouldn't immediately assume that it's an ED, as people can have many conditions, however her behaviour during classes makes me think it is. Even when we have rest periods during workouts, she stays in a plank or keeps doing some other exercises, she never takes a break, even does extra work when we're all stretching in the end. It's really concerning because I feel like her body cannot take that intensity of the workouts but I never spoke to her and don't know what to do.",

Those issues aren\u2019t going to go away because a university exercise group kicks her out or tells her to see a therapist if she does not yet want to get better. Anorexia tends to isolate you socially and some friendliness could help her mentally a little. If you get to know each other better, then express your concerns from a place of care.",

It might be good to provide some sort of resource if possible, because people can be scared and resistant to help but urging them to \"just try\" going to an appointment or seeing someone who might help could be a simple but life-saving first step\u2026",
