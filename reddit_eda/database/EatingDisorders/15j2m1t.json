Bodies are meant to consume food and energy. imagine a little monkey purposely restricting what it eats, or eating and throwing it up alone. it's sad, and it's not natural. they eat to have energy and a body to allow them to climb and swing on branches. we are little monkeys. just eat to feel physically well, to do the things you want to do. you dont wanna age prematurely, with illnesses in your late 20s caused by being an unattainable weight. my sister developed osteoporosis at age 22 because of restriction. you don't wanna be that person with no energy when you're young.\n\na skinny body is not normal and does not make you feel good in the long run. you'll just be hindered as you get older and regret it all.",

I could paint again, go to school, had dreams and thoughts about more than food. After a while I exposed myself to feeling the discomfort of my body in mirrors, I figured out my pants size.

Ultimately that is all that matters- how can you reinforce a positive relationship with yourself today in the present moment? -- instead of focusing on this looming need to gain weight-  or the fear about where you will end up. I was always scared I would gain too much. I never did.  In reality your body won't change THAT much week to week even if you are putting on a pound a week or something. But it will FEEL like it is changing a lot - because you are aware of being on this weight gain mission. It also will plateau when you reach your set point weight- aka where you really should be. Once I felt good there, I started weight lifting - feeling really strong and fit and developed a new relationship with myself. It is all possible it just happens in steps and you can not skip ahead all at once. I know how uncomfortable it can feel, trust me. You are not alone but this is temporary.\n\nI don't know what I weigh and for me, just taking that piece out of the equation felt really healthy- who cares, you know?  I know I weight more than when I was struggling with anorexia :) but I have to tell you- I am finally, after many years of being \"recovered\" but still struggling with body image--  understanding where my body is meant to be naturally and actually seeing it in a positive light. I fought it my whole life- so it is sometimes hard or weird to admit that there might even be things you like about how you look with some more weight on :) Flip the narrative - it is ok to reject what your mind is telling you. You have a habit of being self critical and when you start to imagine a new way of living- your ego mind is just going to try to tear you down because it wants to keep the habit- it is afraid of change.  So you actually have to start playing mind games with yourself - when you get silent and you hear a voice inside your head criticizing you- bullying you, speak back, and say no thank you. The more you shut it down and become aware of it- the more it the voice will diminish. It feels like there is safety in criticizing yourself but it's really just paralyzing and keeps you stuck in a loop.\n\nThe way to reinforce positive self talk is to do the things that give you real joy. It could be being with children, playing a sport, singing, Something that you can get yourself involved in. Get you into your body and out of your ruminating mind- remember that you are so much more than your outward appearance- and your experience on earth is not measured by your weight. It is about how much joy you have, how you impact those around you. The focus of the eating disorder puts you in a dark narrow hole- blocks your creativity or ability to thrive. It keeps you literally small. There is so much more that you can do and be in the world :) Recovery and gaining weight is just your bridge- and eventually you realize how little the weight control gave you and really how much attention it took away.
