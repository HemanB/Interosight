  "title": "Request: Does it count as an eating disorder if you haven\u2019t been officially diagnosed?",
  "selftext": "I\u2019ve been dealing with what I\u2019m pretty sure is anorexia for about 2 years now. It included (at its worst) unsuccessful fasts and very low calorie days, in addition to just trying to put off consuming food as often as I possibly could. However, for reasons involving my mom being very nosy I\u2019m not able to bring it up to my doctor and I really don\u2019t want to. It feels like I\u2019m dealing with all the eating disorder \u201csymptoms\u201d but I have no physical result. I feel like it doesn\u2019t count because I\u2019m not losing much weight and also I haven\u2019t ever gotten diagnosed for an eating disorder.. so does it count if you haven\u2019t even been diagnosed by a doctor?",

My mum was also super nosy and tried to get our GP to give her updates on mine and my sisters health, even when it\u2019s ethically wrong. I was finally diagnosed this year with anorexia nervosa, and I\u2019ve had no additional symptoms since my disordered eating first started. Bottom line is this, if you strongly believe that your symptoms and behaviours coincide with the symptoms described in the DSM, there\u2019s a large chance that you could be struggling with anorexia. You don\u2019t have to be diagnosed to recover, your feelings are valid and I hope that you try to fuel your body as much as you can\u2665\ufe0f",

That doesn't mean that they might not have another eating disorder. \n\nIt's not about diagnosis, it's about the disease itself. \n\n> Anorexia nervosa is also different from plain anorexia.\n\n'Plain' anorexia? Anorexia, as people generally use the term, is just a shortened way of saying 'anorexia nervosa'.\n\nAnorexia, as a word, literally means 'lack of appetite'. From the Greek. It's a medical term. \n\nThe 'nervosa' is there to indicate that the lack of eating comes from a psychological reason, not a physiological one (so for example, someone who is very sick with cancer and having chemotherapy might have anorexia because they just can't eat, but it's not because of psychological reasons).",
