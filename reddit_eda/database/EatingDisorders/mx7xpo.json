  "title": "Request: How to handle cravings while depressed",
  "selftext": "I have BED and finally accepted that my body needs way more calories than one might think in order to lose weight. I am eating all food groups and healthily without extreme restrictions (for ex. I can eat mac and cheese once in a while lmao), and I succeeded losing a healthy amount  in 3 weeks \n\nThe problem is that I live with my family, and my family keeps bringing very  calorie dense and unhealthy foods that can easily trigger  a binge session for me. I already talked to them, and it's like talking to a wall. I'm  already an adult, too, so I can't  blame anyone and force anyone to not bring what they want.\n\nDiverting my thoughts onto something else is very difficult for me because my depression just makes me unmotivated and fatigued most of the time (I'm  not excusing it either, and most of the time I do try to push it through, it's  just to let you know how I generally feel).\n\nI just want to know if any of you have any tips and tricks that can help with the anxiousness that cravings produce. Yesterday I binged on cookies that made me go WAY past my calorie deficit  and I almost had an anxiety attack over it. I legit don't  know how to handle these cravings other than to bite my lip and hope someone eats it quickly lmao.",

Part of the problem stems from my family  constantly  saying \"this will be the last time you eat x\", and the obligation to finish the plate. So, the feeling of \"I must eat this or I will never see it again\" persist (I've  been coping with that by telling myself: \"hey, you can literally drive to the store anytime to buy this, it won't  disappear, you don't need it right now.\" ) Doesn't  justify  my current actions of course, but it's a bit of explanation as to why I haven't  continued on to use my intuition.\n\nAnd just  to add, I might change my mind about intuitive eating once I get a professional to help me since I will finally have someone to turn to when I need it.

That way, it can be easier to get into it and won't necessarily feel like such a chore. The other thing is that while 10 minutes a day is a helpful model for some, meditation can be done with just 10 seconds. Even just pausing to take a single, mindful breath can help set you in a good direction. I like to incorporate meditation flexibly into my day, and it doesn't happen every day for me right now.

For now, I am only tracking the general amount of calories I consume (I try to not be exact with  numbers either) so that I can learn to eyeball how much is ok for me.Regardless, I'll have to implement  intuitive eating in the future, because no one should live their whole lives tracking anything. Your body is supposed  to do that for you. \n\nThank you so much for your input, though! I'll  make sure I check out those books since I do need to educate myself  more in regards to intuitive eating, and the science behind it. And once again, I'm  super happy for your improvement!

          "body": "Have you heard of intuitive eating? The root of binging is actually restricting. Think of it like a pendulum. If we restrict during the day, the pendulum will swing the other way and trigger a binge because you\u2019re not feeding yourself enough. People think they\u2019re \u201cuncontrollable\u201d but really our body is just trying to protect us.\n\nPerhaps check out the book intuitive eating be Elise Resch and Evelyn Tribole. Or check out Anti-Diet by Christy Harrison. The IE book focuses more on the process while Anti-diet focuses a little more on the science behind weight loss/gain, dieting, and intuitive eating. \n\nAll that being said. \u201cHealthy\u201d intentional weight loss has never been shown to be possible or effective long term in any scientific study. Each time we lose weight our body adjusts to prevent it in the future, so people are just weight cycling (yo-yoing) 98% of the time. Around 2% of people can keep weight off by being religious about maintaining restricting behaviors. \nThat is not to say weight loss doesn\u2019t happen naturally. If you neutralize your relationship to food, you can find your body\u2019s stable weight (though it may be higher than what you\u2019d like).  \n\nI\u2019d recommend repairing your relationship to food and your body rather than trying to lose weight and \u201cstop binging\u201d. I know several folks with BED that have found recovery only by giving up dieting and eating whatever their body asked for.",

          "body": "I've  heard about  intuitive eating many times before, and the \"intuitive vs mindful eating\" debacle somewhat. I wish I could just use my intuition to eat correctly (I recognize that it is something you need to work upon), but, I haven't  mentioned that I have never learned how to eat properly since I was 8 years old (I'm currently 22), and I had problems with how I viewed my body even before then. I've  tried a couple of times to eat whatever I wanted without counting calories, but I don't  think I can do that at the moment since I am in a precarious weight. \n\nI am simply scared for how long will my body survive by eating what it asks for until it gives. What I'm  doing right now is eating things that are mostly healthy, but also allowing myself to eat foods that are usually unhealthy if taken in big doses (I ate a healthy amount of waffles today, for example) and avoiding going hungry as much as I can. \n\nI just need to practice to feel \"ok\" with being around food without feeling it needs to be eaten.
