  "selftext": "Im so sorry if this isnt allowed on here but its the situation I'm in right now.\n\nIve been wanting to lose weight for a long time and nothing's ever worked. I don't have a history with EDs but I have had bad thoughts, just haven't followed through.\n\nIve had this thought in the back of my head that it'd be easier to just get an ED and lose the weight. I know its illogical but I'm so close to attempting to purge/calorie restrict. \n\nI know the health effects, both mental and physical. I know it wrecks the body and mind but I'm just desperate at this point. I know how awful they are and I have several friends with either past or active EDs (which kinda fucks with me too, since one of them is so much thinner than me yet claims she has to lose weight, she also includes numbers which fucks with my mental health a lot).\n\n I think I'm at a high risk for bulimia since at this point I've looked into it a lot and the only thing that's stopping me is not having access to a private bathroom to purge in. I dont want to fall into the bulimia rabbithole but I dont know what to do. Has anyone else struggled with this and how do you ensure you dont get an ED?",

Anorexic people often feel hungry and really want to eat, but try not to let themselves - it\u2019s NOT just a lack of appetite and it WON\u2019T make anything easier. You can restrict your calories without getting extreme to the point of an eating disorder, and you will still lose weight. Also - I\u2019d recommend telling your friend that they\u2019re triggering you, so maybe they\u2019ll try to avoid mentioning numbers in the future :) I hope things get better for you!",

I just cant do it due to what I suspect might be binge eating disorder, though its not diagnosed. Might just have bad food habits lol.
