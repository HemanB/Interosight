  "selftext": "TW: relapse\n\n\nI have been fighting with my urge to restrict again.\nI have been in recovery for almost a year and I\u2019d stopped weighing myself until a month ago, when I noticed I\u2019d gained weight during this lockdown. \nSince then, I\u2019ve been trying to fast and restrict to get rid of the pounds but I can\u2019t do this anymore.\nIt felt fantastic not continuously worrying about how my body looks. \nI just don\u2019t know how to feel okay when eating again. It feels extremely suffocating. \nAny help would be appreciated; I\u2019m very thankful and proud of every single one of you \ud83e\udd0d",

This is just a blip in your recovery and you will get through this. Focus on you and take small steps everyday towards your recovery.",

      "body": "Isolation and self reflection isn't easy, but it can lead to new breakthroughs. I relapsed a bit with binge/purge and my parents (who already knew) are keeping a close watch on me, but it lead to some heart to heart and created new understanding that wasn't there before. I'm discovering new things about how I respond to food and my body, and so far, having a good support system, journaling, and mindfulness practice has helped a lot. I'd say do those, and also work on forgiving yourself (which is a hard one always but it's worth it). I use Headspace to meditate and it brings me peace of mind, sometimes for a few hours, sometimes for a day. Yoga and working out helps the mind fog too. It's a process but I've shifted my perspective on recovery from seeing it as suffering to seeing it as part of a journey.",

Eat regular adequate meals so you build some patterns in and do try meditation it may really help a lot. I've been there, we all have. Would you comment on a friend after quarantine who had gained a kilo/pound? Would you notice? I'm sure it's not as bad as you think!",

One thing I\u2019ve been trying to do is eating things I like. For example, I\u2019ve had the same rice bowl for three meals in a row. It\u2019s also helped me to make sure I eat once during the day and once during the night. This might not help too much, but if you need a friendly someone to share with, PM me :)",

This is all scary and unknown and my recovery is having set backs as well. Forgive yourself for this is just a really crazy time and things will change and happen and that's 100% okay. None of this is permanent. Just take things one day at a time and keep reaching out and talking to others about what you're feeling because it's all valid! Try to stay strong and I will try with you and love your body before, during, and after all this!",

      "body": "I\u2019ve also gained a lot of weight. I noticed that being home allows me access to constant food where at work I only had access on my lunch break or before and after work. So I\u2019m trying to stop snacking so much and try to pay attention to when I\u2019m actually hungry instead of bored or thirsty (I\u2019m awful at staying hydrated anyway so that\u2019s why this applies to me). \n\n\nI\u2019m not reaching a goal weight. I\u2019m reaching for health. I want to stop being winded by a single flight of stairs. I want to be able to clean my home without sitting down every 30 minutes. I want to continue  learning new hobbies to keep my hands busy so I\u2019m not just mindlessly snacking or biting my nails off. I want to work on my mental health and I know improving the health of my body will assist in that process. \n\nDo I love my body right now, not so much but I\u2019m working towards it. And you can too. I\u2019m not restricting. Just watching the mindless snacking and trying to do small things to stay active. \n\n I figure walking from the kitchen to my couch with my water then back again for my phone then sitting down is better than just walking with everything then sitting down.",

      "body": "This is probably going to be unwelcome but recovery from caloric deficit will require you to gain weight. It\u2019s definitely the most difficult thing to face and feels uncomfortable and is the main reason people end up in quasi-recovery or don\u2019t ever recover. But is that what you want? Is it worth living in a torturous state constantly thinking about food and your weight and your appearance just to be thin? You and your body deserve nourishment, you deserve to eat. When you\u2019ve restricted what you eat your body will hold onto anything you put in until you have eaten enough consistently and it can trust you again. When your body doesn\u2019t trust you it stores water and fat to prepare for the famine it expects. To build trust you need to eat everything you crave, until you\u2019re fully satisfied. This will mean that you gain weight if you need to, but if you keep eating to satisfaction eventually your cravings will diminish, food will no longer control your life and excess weight will shift. Recovery isn\u2019t easy but you can absolutely do it.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t already I would recommend watching Kayla Rose Kotecki, Elisa Oras and Tabitha Farrar on YouTube. They are all recovery coaches with personal experience of eating disorders and weight gain in recovery. They all have books too: \u201cBrainwashED\u201d, \u201cDamn The Diets\u201d and \u201cRehabilitate, Rewire, Recover\u201d\n\nI wish you success in your recovery. Lockdown is the perfect time to recover and gain the weight you need because everyone in the world is in a similar position! Listen to your body, eat when you\u2019re hungry or thinking about food and when you\u2019re not eating rest as much as you can, read books that make you happy, do fun things that take your mind off it. Don\u2019t weigh yourself or body-check, wear comfortable clothes. Take it easy on yourself. Much love.",

      "body": "You\u2019re allowed to want to get rid of the pounds, but always be mindful of how that\u2019s going to SERVE YOURSELF and understand that NO MATTER the method, you must learn patience and existing in your current body as is in each moment! Even if you\u2019d starve yourself, it\u2019s not instant, so might as well get success coping methods for any time you need patience and grounding, you\u2019ll do yourself good in the long run and avoid relapse. Meditation, breathing, and yoga can help the distress to get through the day, and focusing on how you FEEL can help distract from what you WEIGH. If your knees hurt from the weight, taking gentle walks or learning strengthening exercises are alternatives to fasting that people can find helps prevent them from focusing on the eating part too much. If it\u2019s simply a number that\u2019s haunting you and you don\u2019t have health concerns, there\u2019s no shame in ditching the scale  all together! There\u2019s always a work around that will work for you, so don\u2019t feel discouraged! :)",

It's so hard being at home with essentially unlimited access to a food stockpile, and almost no motivation to go outside. Exercise is my bad method of purging so I've definitely gained a good 10 pounds during all of this. It's hard, but I'm optimistic that I, and all of you guys, can get through it.",
