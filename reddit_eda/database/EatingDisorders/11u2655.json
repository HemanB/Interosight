  "title": "I reactivated my account to let anyone know if they\u2019re looking for treatment, do not consider Montecatini in CA",
  "selftext": "I spent 3 months in res at monte. I was continuously gaslight by my therapist, was not communicated major things about my care, had to cry and beg to go to the hospital for 2 hours for a toothache, dealt with violent patients who would run away and destroy property as well as stash drugs and have no repercussions, no communication to my home team when they continuously tried to get in touch w my Monte team, and this is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nI saw so much happen in my time there. A week before I was supposed to step down to PHP I was sent to a locked ward on a 5150. Upon my return I was almost kicked out right there but they let me stay. My insurance informed them I had 3 remaining days of coverage at the end of the week.\n\nYou always talk about step down with your team bc you never know when insurance is going to cut you. I had planned to step down with them, even though I saw 8 people step back up within a 2 week period, I was going to try and live in their duplexes. \n\nWhen my insurance cut me, my therapist brought in the head director and they told me that I was unable to live in the duplex. If I wanted to continue treatment I would have to find my own housing. In 3 days. In San Diego county. Lol. I told them I would leave. \n\nThe day I was leaving they sent a team in for a psych eval which was my 4th in a week. Just for 1 bad day out of 12 weeks, ridiculous. They called my home team for the first time since I had been there and told them when I get home to send me to a locked ward, they of course refused. \n\nSince I\u2019ve left 4 PCT\u2019s left, 2 were directly because of me and the way I was treated, my dietitian left- she also told me she was so sorry for how they dropped the ball with me, and the head of nutrition left. \n\nI have so much more to say, if anyone is interested feel free to message me. But don\u2019t walk away from this place, run.",
