  "selftext": " \n\nHello there! My cohorts and I have created a questionnaire for families affected by eating disorders in order to further understand their needs for learning more about EDs and how to further support their loved one. This questionnaire also applies to people who have or had experienced EDs as well. If you know someone (can be family or friend) who had or has an ED (diagnosed, undiagnosed, or suspected) please take the questionnaire. I really appreciate your time! Thank you so much. The following is the link to the questionnaire:\n\n[https://forms.gle/99H7JKpFLW8X8E228](https://forms.gle/99H7JKpFLW8X8E228)",
