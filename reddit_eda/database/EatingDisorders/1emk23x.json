      "body": "Yes, but you need to meet diagnostic criteria. Don't get wrong, the ICD-11 and DSM-5-TR are flawed. But when it comes to layman diagnosing themselves without knowledge to compelte a differential diagnosis, it's important to meet the criteria. I had an eating disorder long before I was assessed and diagnosed. I knew that it was probable, but I was in denial. For some, self-diagnosis is the first step to reaching out for support and beginning recovery. No one should rob you of that opportunity. That said, some people romanticize eating disorders or do not understand how severe they can be. This is where meeting diagnostic criteria comes in along with self-reflection. If you're having thoughts that you're faking it or not sick enough, it's unlikely that is the case. This is the nature of EDs.",

Others do have an ED and know the truth and how horrendously ugly it gets. I think it\u2019s okay to say that one has experience ED behaviors and recognize patterns as they occur. I also this it\u2019s important to recognize when you are experiencing symptoms. But claiming to have a medical issue without seeking help doesn\u2019t do anything. Unfortunately, most people with EDs rarely seek help on their own and it will deteriorate their health. So if you think you have an eating disorder, and you\u2019re willing to change, you should definitely seek help.",

Unpopular opinion incoming - **please remember that someone 'not being valid to me' doesn't mean they don't have an issue. Me 'not believing they have an ED' doesn't mean they DON'T. My opinion really doesn't matter. You don't have to think I am valid either!** \n\nA friend of mine used to talk about the time she had an (undiagnosed) ED when we were in high school. I don't call what she 'went through' an ED for various reasons I won't get into.\n\nI think a lot of people on tiktok/instagram etc claim to have EDs that don't - they have disordered eating or get a bit obsessed with diet/exercise. I don't think many of them have valid EDs. \n\nNowdays, many of the above people could get diagnosed if they went to their doctor and listed off the symptoms they've convinced themselves they have. For example, if you scroll tiktok, you can pretty much learn what you'd need to say to get diagnosed. \n\nI used to follow a number of girls who are diagnosed who also have personality disorders, I truly believed they exaggerated their ED symptoms as a way to seek attention (seeking attention isn't necessarily bad, it's a part of their illness/trauma response).\n\nI would absolutely accept someone's ED was valid if they weren't diagnosed. But these are psychiatric illnesses, they are dangerous, and life changing. It's not just something that comes and goes.",

I get that not everyone has access to healthcare. A big thing with eds though is that they are very glamorized and portrayed unrealistically. I feel like a lot of people subconsciously feel like restrictive eds are something they wish they could have, and then they start noticing signs of an \u201cEd\u201d in themselves using the confirmation bias. \n\nAlso, there\u2019s a huge difference between disordered eating and an eating disorder. If you actually have struggled with an ed, you can easily spot people that are uneducated about the illness and may just have some disordered habits. You also have to meet diagnostic criteria in order to be diagnosed.\n\nI am kind of weird about diagnosis in general. In life, your goal should be to not have mental illness. In my opinion the only reason you should seek a diagnosis is if you are at a loss and can\u2019t understand what is happening to you and need professional guidance. It shouldn\u2019t just be this casual thing.",

But I don't appreciate people who will use illnesses that people struggle with for attention, personal gain, etc. I feel like it's getting more and more common where you can find people who have found themselves in a rabbit hole surrounding a certain disorder, picked up traits from said disorder, and convinced themselves they have it. I'm not saying that isn't totally valid because them people do probably have something wrong with them. If they're convincing themselves, they have a disorder, or they knowingly say they have it for attention. It's not normal to feel like you have to have something wrong with you in order to get attention, and I think it's something that we should aim to help people with, but it still doesn't make a self-dignosis valid.

The list of problems is so long and continues to grow.\n\nI'm a trans woman. I previously lived as a male. Let me tell you. Whenever I brought up my weight to a healthcare professional they not only blew me off. They tended to start idolizing my body. The sheer creepiness of the last time has made it very hard for me to ever feel comfortable addressing it with another medical professional. Like the doctor was looking at me like I was some delicious treat as he was giving me a physical. When I mentioned my weight and my bmi All he had to say was a bunch of you invalidating stuff like I should be happy. At the time I was 6'1 and weighed about 122 lb. \n\nIt took me so long to recognize that I do in fact struggle with anorexia due to How the media has portrayed Anorexia over the years. I have never wanted to be skinny. I've tried very hard throughout my life to gain weight and was unaware of how my eating habits are tied to negative self-talk until a couple years ago. As I've started to learn about anorexia, I was shocked to find that I was in fact anorexic. Anorexia has most commonly been portrayed as something that is done due to body dysmorphia. That alone always made me look for other explanations.",

A couple years ago i even got in with the Eating Disorder team but after two meetings I bailed not because I didn't want help but because while a low weight I was technically a healthy weight so she didn't want to take me seriously. (I was prewarned of this fact by my CPN). The Ed women came to my home for literally 5 minutes and told me I needed to eat 3 meals a day plus 2 snacks. She told me to think of her as my cheerleader only and write in this food diary. Then she left and said she'll see me in a few weeks. I was suffering from Anorexia Nervosa, both with purging and restricting,  Body Dysmorphia and potentially ARFID. I had had an extreme fear of weight gain my entire life and couldn't handle people knowing I was eating. A food diary was the worst thing possible for me. It made me more restrictive. Not to mention I'd only just got out of a Psychiatric Unit. Oh and I have sensory issues which also makes eating harder but she didn't care so why should I you know. \n\nSo yeah I guess the answer to your question lies in the how they came to claim a self diagnosis.",

Arguably, my mental health just declined drastically over the years throughout my adolescence. It just steadily gets worse. So I don't know if I predicted that, like some weird premonition or something, but surely, I have only gotten worse. I could also just be a late bloomer. \n\nI was always purging so it's kind of hard to deny that behaviour to yourself....but I was just so sweet and so caring as a kid. I was really depressed also, but I had a lot of innocence :) It's not that I don't have it anymore, but over time, I literally had to stop caring just because of how painful it was to keep living in my reality that I was still purging X years later and could not stop nor get any help for it. You have to survive eventually and so I shifted completely. My brain also started derailing at that time also, so I lost awareness and insight and started denying more, not just to others, but to myself as well. And honestly, that was something I had to do because I could not allow myself to be disappointed and depressed any more. There was just no point anymore. Like you have to survive eventually and find your own resilience. Denial after many years is the only way to go about this. It just turns on eventually. For some, it's more immediate than others, I think. Mine was definitely more delayed even though there's always some degree of dissociation involved regardless.\n\nSo it's not always that simple. I feel like for me, it was a steady progression mentally/ neurologically. I don't believe that anything could've lessened the psychological risk for me, ever, once that manifested. But if anything, my descent was delayed. It just means that when it hit fully, it was like really intense out of nowhere. A lot of people were like \"i don't understand what happened.\" and I was like \"I understand completely. I have been waiting for this moment my entire life.\" lol. Some things are just meant to happen. I think I absolutely put up a good fight though. But some things are impossible to combat without extensive care and support. It's just hard to identify what that is until there's an actual problem to treat that doesn't just involve dietetics and talk therapy, you know? I hope that makes sense. It must be hard though, watching a population of young people online just fail to thrive even after many years. It doesn't really always make much sense. I mean, I feel like it makes perfect sense and I have to bring it back to the neuroimaging piece because there was structural evidence of my suffering and so that was like a relief because there's actual treatment for that. The difference is night and day. It can't solve every compulsion, but it helped tremendously. I definitely feel more able now, to the point where dietetics and talk therapy sounds like it has the potential to be promising.",

You don't have to be a 10 year bulimic or severe anorexic for that to be valid. That's just the untreated later stages.\n\nIts a technicality with the term, really. (You're not a professional, so you can't professionally diagnose), but I was hard core bulimic for many many years, and me never seeing a doctor didn't suddenly make the bulimia untrue or go away \ud83d\ude05",

      "body": "I personally think it's worth considering that it might be due to ignorance. I personally have been on a 2-year mental health journey and it wasn't until 3 days ago that I finally was exposed to the notion that a diagnosis should only be sought after if the underlying issue is causing the person's quality of life to be decreased. I'm 41 and somehow I had never been exposed to that concept until reading a book. It's mind boggling.\n\nI don't know if it's my neurodivergence, but it has been incredibly hard for me to wrap my head around that concept and parse through what issues I've been addressing that I apparently shouldn't be focusing on since they aren't reducing my quality of life in any way, shape, or form. I have gotten so much from learning about myself. The validation has allowed me to accept myself and my limitations which has added to my quality of life. I didn't know my quality of life was being dismissed because everything was hidden from myself. I didn't know I was suffering since I conditioned myself to tune it out. I guess I just need to think about it more.\n\n Thanks for your response it is good food for thought.",

          "body": "I\u2019m weary about self diagnosis because I see so many people wrongly diagnose themselves, but I definitely think you can successfully diagnose yourself in some cases. I get that not everyone has access to healthcare. A big thing with eds though is that they are very glamorized and portrayed unrealistically. I feel like a lot of people subconsciously feel like restrictive eds are something they wish they could have, and then they start noticing signs of an \u201cEd\u201d in themselves using the confirmation bias. \n\nAlso, there\u2019s a huge difference between disordered eating and an eating disorder. If you actually have struggled with an ed, you can easily spot people that are uneducated about the illness and may just have some disordered habits. You also have to meet diagnostic criteria in order to be diagnosed.\n\nI am kind of weird about diagnosis in general. In life, your goal should be to not have mental illness. In my opinion the only reason you should seek a diagnosis is if you are at a loss and can\u2019t understand what is happening to you and need professional guidance. It shouldn\u2019t just be this casual thing.",

I agree that having a mental illness, a specific diagnosis, etc. for any reason except to seek guidance in how to recover is problematic, i.e. personality disorders or attention -seeking behavior. \n\nI know that I still avoid referring to myself as having an ED basically ever, except with medical professionals.",

I understand that a lot of professionals don\u2019t do this but it\u2019s extremely important to have a broader perspective.  Also important is for the psychiatrist, psychologist and the nutritionist (if Ed) to talk to each other during the process. It makes it a lot easier to debate and close a diagnosis. \n\nSource: me.

You can absolutely suspect you have a disorder or medical condition, however you should seek medical advice as soon as you are able to because a diagnosis can offer pathways into therapy, treatment and correctly fitted aids if you require them. Also it may end up being that you don't have that condition at all and actually have something else. \n\nPlease note before I get downvoted, this is my personal opinion which OP asked for. If they believe in self diagnosis then they are absolutely valid to feel that way.",

For example, my doctors were very concerned about my low BMI to the point where they made all kinds of checks but because EDs are not associated with men, I was never seriously assessed for that.
