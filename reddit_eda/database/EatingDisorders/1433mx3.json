  "selftext": "Every day I under-eat I notice that the entire day I was genuinely happier. You might say I wasn\u2019t really happy but trust me I was. I don\u2019t get why this happens and I feel as though it\u2019s not good. Any ideas on why?\n\nEdit: Holy crap thank you all so much! This really helped me \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

But over time you will not be able to maintain that response and while your fatigue and brain fog may come on so slowly you don't notice the change, it will likely be apparent to others and you will DEFINITELY notice the difference when you restore your body's digestive function. Hopefully it doesn't get to that point for you :)",

After the 2nd day through the 4-5 day they felt calm, content, stable mood, motivated and happy. After the 5th day both of them had a crash in their mood. \n\nI think it has something to do with the glucose, glucagon and glycogen in our body\u2019s storage and the process of ketosis. In my nutrition class we went over the cycles of that. And I think one of them is the depletion of the storage. It also has something to do with if you\u2019re getting it from fat storage or proteins storage or carbohydrate storage.",
