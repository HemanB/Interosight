  "selftext": "I started to recover on my own as many family members and friends were on my back about how thin I had gotten (almost over weight to underweight). I started to eat more but had extreme hunger and my weight sky-rocketed where I am sitting at a healthy weight now but feel the worst I have ever been\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am now seeing a dietician and a doctor specialized in eds but it is gut-wrenching getting all this help when I feel so invalidated being at a normal weight and having friends saying \u201cIm doing a great job\u201d or \u201cI look better\u201d. I realize now that I tried to rush through recovery alone and have probably taking a few steps back as I am hardcore relapsing and want to lose weight no matter the cost.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is affecting my relationships and school and I feel like my whole life is spiraling all because I decided one day I didn\u2019t have an Ed even though I clearly still do and have it linked to my self worth. I ruined it. I failed. I know gaining weight is necessary in recovery but I am freaking out as I still have urges of extreme hunger but no longer really purge (over exercise) as I once did. How do you deal with weight gain? This is consuming every fiber of my being. I just want to go back to how small I was. There was solace in my chaos bc at least I knew I was doing something right or had something. Now I don\u2019t anymore and my identity is gone.",
