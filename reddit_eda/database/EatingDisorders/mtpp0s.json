  "selftext": "Hey y\u2019all, what do you do when you come across pictures of you when you were at your worst with your ED. I remember still thinking I was too \u201cchubby\u201d at the time and looking at that picture and looking at myself now makes me feel sick. I\u2019m currently the biggest and heaviest (a relatively normal or healthy weight)I\u2019ve ever been and seeing myself at my smallest is devastating. I deleted the picture I saw but it didn\u2019t get rid of this feeling. It\u2019s been almost 5 years now but recently it\u2019s like the struggle is worse.",

I'm at a very much healthier weight but seeing those pictures are a big nono for me.",

      "body": "I definitely recommend getting rid or shelving old pics/videos if they\u2019re triggering. I also think it helps to look back and think about how you really felt back then. I look back and even if my face was smiling, you could see I was dead behind the eyes. If any nostalgia pops up, I immediately go back to reminding myself that I was miserable, constantly fighting with family, lying about my actions, constantly numb and/or irritable, missed out on loads of events, trips, and memories, felt suicidal, etc., and then I don\u2019t want it anymore. It also helps to remember what you have now with recovery. Is life perfect? No. Do I have cellulite? Yes. But I have a life now. My family and I are on great terms, I met and am about to marry my fianc\u00e9, I have energy to take all of the good and bad of life and face it head-on, even when it sucks. So yeah, reflection helps and don\u2019t glamorize the past. There is SO much more to look forward to and life to live, and you need to be healthy to do it.",

It was so weird Because my body looked completly different to me back then.\nSo i try to not look at the pictures from back then, but i want to keep them, Because its an important part of my life in a way. One day I can look back and remember that i got past it, even when i didnt thing there was a way out.\nBut my brother actually send me a video recently of me when i was extremly skinny, and it nearly made me cry. Idk What his intentions were tbh. I feel like he kinda did it to show me \u00abHow sick i was\u00bb or \u00abHow big i am now compaired to then\u00bb, and it really hurt, and i dont even think he realised What he did so..\nBut i wish you all the best:)",
