  "title": "Request: Tinder date revealed she starts treatment for an ED. I want to see her again.. should I?",
  "selftext": "I had a first date a couple of days ago, with someone who told me she's about to be moving to my neighbourhood *for the winter* (she currently lives in a suburb of the large-ish city I live in). I asked her what was bringing her temporarily and she disclosed that she's starting treatment for an eating disorder. The date otherwise went (I felt) extremely well, and it sounds like we are both interested in meeting up again soon, but I'm wondering if it's healthy for her to pursue anything right now? Currently I'm planning to ask her the following questions:\n\n- Do the facilitators of her treatment program recommend dating while she's going through the program?\n- How can I (otherwise) support her while she's going through the program?\n\nBut also, I'm concerned about how her relationship with me could affect her recovery. Like, if we date for 8 weeks and it doesn't work out, could it exacerbate potential body dysmorphia issues (if her disorder is one which stems from those)?\n\nI'm nervous, because I otherwise felt like a hit me over the head, butterflies in my stomach type of connection, based on other things we have in common, but I don't want to pursue something with her right now if it could impede her recovery.",

Obviously we don\u2019t know where she is in recovery or how intensive the treatment is, but I think not rushing into anything and treating it as some thing closer to friendship would be the wisest move for the time being. \n\nTreatment can bring up a lot of feelings, I know I was definitely vulnerable at times, and it isn\u2019t a great idea to get into anything serious when it can already be so draining.",

I can home from my program and immediately went to sleep, almost daily. Not sure if this is the norm or not, but there is no way I would have been able to participate in or maintain any kind of romantic relationship. \n\n2) In a weird and twisted way, the eating disorder is kinda like a boyfriend. Obviously not a good one, he\u2019s a abusive prick, but for me it was like having an sadistic partner in my head all the time. So, jumping into a relationship with someone who is \u201cbreaking up\u201d with their relationship with food and their body may not make a ton of sense. You probably don\u2019t want to be the person to replace the eating disorder in her life. She needs to develop a strong sense of who she is without the ED before diving into a new relationship. You don\u2019t want to be the ED rebound, you know? I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m making any sense here, but hopefully I am!",
