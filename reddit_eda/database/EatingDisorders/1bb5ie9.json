  "title": "I started dating a woman (23) with ED and I really like her. Can you tell me what I should know about this illness and how I can support her?",
  "selftext": "\nShe told me a few things about it and I can definitely ask her for more informations, but I don\u2019t want her to have the feeling that she needs to talk about this often. I want her to feel safe and happy, and not being confronted with the illness more often than necessary. \n\nShe is in Therapy, has the ED for at least 6 years I guess, maybe more and said she is in her last steps of her Therapy. Eating would just be like at 20% of being a problem left rn. The illness causes her Acne which doesn\u2019t make her any less beautiful but I know that making comments on appearance are always difficult.\n\nShe told me that I\u2018m the first man since her illness appeared with whom she could be intimate or be dating at all. She said that being with me really helps her and she was happy and smiling all day long after our first kiss.\n",

Compliment and value us for other things than our appearance, instead of saying we look nice, tell us our outfit is awesome, or that our makeup is well done, compliment the skill behind the look. And do not ever speak of food in moral terms. Food is food. It's not good nor bad. It's not healthy or unhealthy. It's fuel. It's nutrients. It's neutral.",

Don't comment how much she already ate or how little, show her how much you care and tell that you are going to be for her anytime she needs to.",

I know that my bf was really supportive in my recovery, which I am still in, and it would've been much harder without him, so I commend you. I feel like the other comments have really hit the point home. I would advise against commenting on her body, even if it is positive. For people with ED's, it can be hard to accept or believe comments like that, even if they come from a place of good faith. I would recommend complimenting her on her personality or accomplishments, or something other than her physical appearance for the present moment. I would ask her what she is comfortable with discussing or not, and keeping an open and loving heart for communication is key, because sometimes we feel like we don't have people to turn to. This is all from my own personal experience, but these may be a good start :)",

As you're aware there's things you shouldn't say and topics to avoid. Without her ability to communicate, you'd feel like you're walking on eggshells non-stop, so I'm glad you're communicating well. EDs can really torment people and cause a great deal of dysregulation, and there's a higher likelihood of them in person's with certain other mental health issues, like borderline personality disorder.  Obviously not saying that's the case here, but one thing I wish I would've learned years ago was how deeply rooted in trauma, self-image, and self-worth EDs often are. I think having that awareness will help you show up consistently with the empathy she needs. As others have said though it sounds like you're doing well and just need to keep talking with her about it, and reading through the ED sub to understand others' experiences with it will help you too.
