  "selftext": "I've recently found that giving myself the freedom to try new foods and not sticking only to safe ones helps me big time. I also have less cravings if I eat at least two times a day and avoid trigger foods, but it does not always work, especially if my urge to overeat is provoked by negative emotions.\n\nWhat helps you?",
