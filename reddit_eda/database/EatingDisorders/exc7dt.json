  "selftext": "Quick summary of my current situation: I\u2019m currently about 1-1.5ish years into recovery, so while i\u2019m not fully recovered by any stretch of the meaning, i\u2019m still pretty stable. My family is pretty cool, and my friends are amazing !!\n\nWhat sucks is how they all seem to somewhat normalize ED behaviours. I\u2019ve talked to them about my ED and my triggers, but quite honestly they\u2019re kinda clueless about what fits as a trigger, if that makes sense.\n\nOne of the things I\u2019m really struggling with is how they all seem to engage in / talk about ED behaviours as if it\u2019s normal. They\u2019ll casually comment on how they skipped a meal, or how one time they went XYZ long without food, or how they\u2019re gonna do ABC to compensate.\n\nIn my head, I guess I\u2019m having trouble because it\u2019s like, if everyone\u2019s doing it, why can\u2019t I? If this is normal, why can\u2019t I join in with them. I know it\u2019s not normal, but especially when people say things like \u201coh everyone has had sOme ED in their lifetime\u201d, it feels really invalidating and makes me want to relapse.",

And I think for some people it\u2019s as commonplace to bring up as the weather, especially if you\u2019re spending time together or doing things around meals or snacks or anything to do with food. \nAnd I understand what you mean.. sometimes it feels inescapable and like it wouldn\u2019t hurt to just give in to some of the \u201csmaller\u201d behaviors or thoughts. But please don\u2019t give up on your progress!",

      "body": "I invite you to look deeper at the belief, \"If everyone's doing it, why can't I?\" Everyone's doing all kinds of things, like texting and driving, staying up way too late on a work night, etc., etc. You *could* do any of these things. But do they lead to good outcomes? Are they helpful to your long-term well-being? Do they make you happy? If not, what can you focus on instead, so that you're thinking more about the peace, joy, and FUN of recovery instead of what you might be missing out on?\n\nFor more on the process of re-framing beliefs, check out Chapter 5: building and maintaining motivation for recovery in The FREE Unofficial SMART Recovery Handbook for Disordered Eating: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vPk9JbgWrGCL4LbjAmVbVW-g2fD5DFBP\\_P-8ov2F4sY/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vPk9JbgWrGCL4LbjAmVbVW-g2fD5DFBP_P-8ov2F4sY/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI hope you find it helpful. Feel free to share. Full recovery into a joyful life free from ED behaviors *and thoughts* is entirely possible.",

      "body": "That last quote you wrote about is extremely ignorant of your situation. It's like people who say \"I have to keep my shoes organized, I'm so OCD about my shoes.\"\n\nThe fact is, there is a difference between disordered eating and having a diagnosable Eating Disorder.  Diet culture is filled with unhealthy disordered thinking and behaviors. I can't think of one adult family member that has a healthy relationship with food and eating.  The difference is, I have an eating disorder.  What someone who does not have an eating disorder can think about/do once can change.  For me I have to keep thinking and doing until I get help.\n\nA peer in treatment suggested a \"good for you, not for me\" approach to dealing with these situations.",
