I sometimes engage in a behavior that is not aligned with my recovery and instead of saying \u201cguess I\u2019ll go back to being sick\u201d I say \u201cI did x behavior, this is how it felt. I still want recovery for these reasons\u201d and try to move on. \n\nBasically, recovery doesn\u2019t have to be all or nothing. You can step forward and back and keep moving toward healing gradually. Folks with EDs can get stuck in an all or nothing mindset, but recovery isn\u2019t all or nothing. Somedays are harder than others and sometimes I screw up, but either way I try my best each day to make choices that support my goals.",
