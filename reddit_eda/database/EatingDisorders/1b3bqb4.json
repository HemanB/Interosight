      "body": "Absolutely. There can be a number of reasons as to why. If someone is malnourished/not eating well they\u2019re also likely going to be irritable. Shame and guilt are also a huge part of a lot of people\u2019s EDs, and when confronted about things that make us feel guilty/shameful, getting defensive can be a very common response. \n\nAnother reason I\u2019ve noticed for defensiveness also has to do with the nature of eating disorders themselves. I tend to think of EDs as mental parasites: they take over your mind, your thoughts, and do whatever they can to stay alive/active in your mind. Someone trying to help an ED sufferer recover threatens the existence of the ED. The ED doesn\u2019t like this and wants to keep itself active in the mind of the host it\u2019s taken over - e.g. reject the notion of recovery. Recovery is a threat to the ED, so the ED will do whatever it can to stay alive. \n\nOverall though, for whatever reason, this is a common trend.",

      "body": "Yes, it's completely normal. Because your internal ED voice feels threatened. It's been your coping mechanism. So it's only natural for your eating disorder to lash out and feel threatened when you are trying to get rid of it. Just try to become aware of what internal dialogue you choose to listen to. Will it be your recovery voice or ED voice? \nYou can do this. Recovery is possible",
