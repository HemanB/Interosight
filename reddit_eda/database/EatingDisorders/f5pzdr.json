  "title": "Request: Can't let go of weird food rituals",
  "selftext": "I'm 24m and only just accepted that I have an eating disorder. I lost a lot of weight and ended up underweight, I am now trying to gain muscle, but I can't eat properly.\n\nI'm eating xxx - yyy calories (low) a day now, which isn't enough to gain weight but I don't think I can manage any more. \n\nI take adhd medication which means i have barely any appetite anyway,  but when I do feel hungry I have all these rituals to make me eat as little as possible.  I'll have a coffee or green tea right before eating, then I will eat a bowl of lettuce to fill my stomach. I then put the actual food that I cooked on a small plate and cut into tiny pieces, then eat one bite every 30 seconds to make sure I'm slow and mindful when I eat. All my food is low carb vegan, weighed and calorie counted. If I don't know the exact calories I can't eat anything. \n\nAfter all those rituals I sometimes can't even finish the food, which always feels like an accomplishment. When I finish it I usually feel strangely guilty even though I WANT to gain muscle and be more healthy. \n\nHow can I let go of these rituals? Every interaction i have with food is focused on making me consume as little as possible. On the rare occasions I'm able to eat more I just run and work out more to compensate.\nI'm now underweight and I pass out a lot and I'm losing my hair and I can't think straight. I don't even WANT to be thin and I know I don't look healthy, I just can't seem to stop myself.",

If not then just doing baby steps, like slowly breaking the rules a little bit at a time and proving to yourself that it\u2019ll be okay if you break the rituals is what i would try, but i\u2019m not a therapist. seeking professional help is really the best way to go i think",

I\u2019m just now getting over my battle with an ED, and I found being around other people to be the best option. By surrounding myself as often as I could with other people (people who want me to be healthy), I would see that others have healthy lifestyles while eating plenty. At the same time, eating around others forced me to have a normal eating pattern- a good form of peer pressure, if you will!\n\nEating disorders are some of the hardest challenges to overcome, and having people alongside you to push- or shove- you away from your habits greatly lifts the burden!",
