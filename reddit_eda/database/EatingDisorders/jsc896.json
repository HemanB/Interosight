  "title": "Request: how to get rid of the fear of gaining weight?",
  "selftext": "Hello everyone. I have been struggling with the b/p & restrict cycle for a long time now. About a week ago, I started to eat one big meal a day (bc I really don\u2019t know how to eat normally anymore lol). I haven\u2019t binged on sweets since then, which is good, but I still feel so uncomfortably full and i don\u2019t know if it\u2019s imagination but I feel like I\u2019ve already gotten a lot bigger. I\u2019m too scared to check the scale, or do my measurements, and maybe that could also trigger the ed again, idk.. To those who recovered, has this happened to you too? Could it be that my metabolism is damaged? (I read about sth like that) \nI want to recover, I really do, but I do not want to gain weight, or at least I\u2019m scared as hell to look like younger me again. How do I get rid of it? \nI look at myself and feel disgusting & I really don\u2019t want to feel like this anymore. But at the same time, I felt (at least a bit) better when I was full invested in my ed, which is actually not better at all. \nSorry for my English btw, it\u2019s not my first language. \nThanks to anyone who takes the time to read this!",

      "body": "It's likely body dysmorphia that you think you're bigger suddenly. You NEED to eat more than one meal a day, though. That is absolutely awful for your metabolism. You cannot recover from a restrictive eating disorder without gaining weight - it's part of the process. The only way I overcame the fear was just doing the damn thing and gaining weight. I realized the world did not end and I was fine. I still like how I look, yes I do miss my thinner body at times, but I love my life so much more now without my ED.\n\nAs you described yourself, your ED will never be satisfied. You were not happier when you were deep in your ED, that's a lie your mental illness has told you (as it tells all of us). My life is so much better now that I am recovered and your life will be better too. You have to push through the fear to get to the other side. What helped me a lot was joining pro recovery groups (like facebook groups that are truly recovery focused, not any reddit subs) and also watching a lot of YouTube videos. I would recommend Tabitha Farrar, Follow the Intuition, and What Mia Did Next.",

There is so many ED thoughts and patterns to unlearn and it can be super challenging to work through those when they are tangled up with all of your own personal thoughts. Talking it through with a professional will likely make a big difference in your recovery!",

So if you have a fear you're gaining weight, simply watch that fear. Let it sit with you until it passes. \n\nIt can be hard at first to be mindful like this--but a couple things that help are meditation and journaling. \n\nMeditate a couple of times. a day 5 minutes a day. Simply set a timer and relax. \n\nPull out a piece of paper and pen when the fear comes up and write out what that fear feels like, without rationalizing. Simply write out your fears. I feel scared I won't be loved. Etc. Write until you get all the thoughts out. \n\n2. Start some mirror work where you say \"I love you\" to yourself throughout the day. When you're washing your hands, or pass by a mirror. Make the statement, \"I love you.\" \n\nGive these a try and see how they work for you. Persistence is key! I really hope these help.",
