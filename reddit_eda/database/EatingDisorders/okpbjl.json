  "selftext": " \n\nHello, my name is Winnie and I have been struggling with anorexia for a while.\n\nRecently, I have made the decision to try and recover, although it has been extremely difficult without outside support to help me along the way. I'm making an effort to eat when I feel hungry, and to have foods that I want. Despite the anxiety and guilt, I try my absolute best to push through. I know that guilt isn't a useful emotion in this situation and it's not worth sitting on it.\n\nHowever, I'm still having a lot of trouble about restricting myself. I feel like I'm not deserving of food as much as others. I see other people eat during recovery and I want to eat too, but I keep telling myself \"oh you can't do that, you're not underweight,\" or \"you're still trying to lose weight, you're not meant to be eating.\"\n\nThe stress has been piling up endlessly, which has been enhancing my psychosis and delusions as well on top of PMS. It's unbearable, I don't know what to do.",

      "body": "Something that helped me overcome this false belief is being mindful of my hunger cues and honoring them. Honoring hunger can be challenging for us because for a long time we avoided, hated feeling it, and we\u2019re afraid we\u2019d have to restrict or purge once giving in to it.  Try to label hunger as a good thing. Associate it with your body telling you, you are ready for growth and renewal. I know it\u2019s challenging to start believing these things when you don\u2019t feel it. Have hope though. It\u2019s possible.",

      "body": "hi i was in recovery for like 6 months but i recently relapsed. now, i\u2019m trying to recover again. it was really hard because i\u2019m not underweight. i thought i didn\u2019t deserve to recover until i was \u201csick enough\u201d. the reality is that anorexia is a mental illness. it takes over your life in every way. so i may not physically look sick. but my brain was extremely sick. i find that now i\u2019ve started eating enough, my weight doesn\u2019t change so rapidly. and now i get to live a normal life without constantly feeling guilty. when i was suffering with my ed, i felt like it would never end. \u201cthis is my life now\u201d kinda attitude. but ed\u2019s are extremely exhausting. it\u2019s not a healthy sustainable way to live. now that i\u2019m recovering, i\u2019m genuinely so much happier and i feel overall healthy. anorexia is a bitch. hands down. but i can say 100% certainly, recovery is worth it. i wish you all the best.",

You deserve help right now. Not when you are \"sicker\" because your ED will NEVER let you believe that you are sick enough. Don't wait. The longer you do the longer the road to recovery is.  And please don't try to do this all on your own. Find someone you trust and confide in them. Just doing that will take so much power away from ED. You are worth it. And will always be deserving of recovery.",
