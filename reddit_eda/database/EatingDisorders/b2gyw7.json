Usually, I'm able to recognize that what I wrote down is an ED thought.  \n\nAnother thing you can do is write out your goals and values.  This also helps me, as I use it to question ED behaviors - does the behavior or urge match my values?  Values such as telling the truth and the importance of family are some values I used to motivate myself.  \n\nAlso, I recommend the book Life Without ED; the author does a good job of describing how she identified eating disorder thoughts.

Make a list of your values in terms of yourself, relationships, social connectedness, community, health/wellness, education, employment etc. There are worksheets and resource online to guide you.\n\nIt may also be helpful to determined which values you want to embody but might not be very good at right now, then create goals that will help you move toward living your values more fully. \n\n Then you can compare your thoughts to your values. Any thoughts that aren\u2019t helpful in achieving your valued goals are not worth focusing on. It\u2019s hard to make them go away but if you can notice and call them out for what they are, they might stop bothering you so much. So when they pop into your head, think \u201cokay, more unhelpful thoughts\u201d or \u201cthis is a garbage thought\u201d or \u201cah, yes, junk mail thoughts\u201d and just let them be there for a while noticing that you are not creating these thoughts, you\u2019re just observing them as they happen. \n\nDreams don\u2019t make a lot of sense usually, right? And most of the time they don\u2019t bother us because dreams are \u201csupposed to be weird\u201d and \u201cyou can\u2019t control your dreams.\u201d  Thoughts are the same. They come up randomly and unintentionally a lot of the time and they are a product of what we see and hear and some of what we actively think. It seems like a lot of work, but realizing that there\u2019s a difference between passive and active thoughts can be helpful. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to tell them apart which is where deciding which thoughts are helpful comes in. \n\nIf you want to learn more about this look up acceptance and commitment therapy. There are some great books, videos, and interactive learning modules out there to help. ",
