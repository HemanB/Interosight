  "selftext": "I don\u2019t want to die, really. I just don\u2019t see any better options. I\u2019ve been treated over and over and over\u2026.why continue? I\u2019m at rock bottom I guess. Doc said \u201ceat or die\u201d and referred me to Hospice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo the optimistic ones who believe anyone can get to full recovery\u2026.I have tried graining the weight and giving it a sincere try. Restoration ended in BED, my worst nightmare. Would be 6 ft under, bullet to my head, if not for being one of the lucky ones who got prescribed Vyvanse and really benefit. It helped me fight BED and it is the only drug that ever touched my depression and lifted my spirits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy current life: On SSI (disability); have tried school and work and failed each try. Food is the #1 source of pleasure in my life (ironic haha).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, I am physically pretty far gone. Hospice means 6 months or less. And the constant episodes of confusion, even delirium, don\u2019t make me hopeful about brain damage",

      "body": "This is just a random comment but I worked hospice for five years, and I know there\u2019s the idea that if your relationship recommended hospice that it\u2019s the end and there\u2019s no hope but it\u2019s actually the opposite of that. I had so many patients who came in disheartened with their diagnosis and family upset but weeks, months, or years later super happy they signed on and that\u2019s because hospice provides more than just meds and such. It\u2019s a team who helps in so many ways than one. We always became family. As well as a lot of free stuff and services are provided that not everyone gets. I\u2019ve always had many many clients signed off, weeks to even years later.\nI guess my point and story is, hospice isn\u2019t a death sentence. \n\nHowever! I do understand the insensitiveness of what your doctor said and I would recommend getting a new one if I was you, if possible.\n\nMy heart goes out to you! Sometimes hitting rock bottom means the only way out is up. \n\nKeep reaching out and don\u2019t give up on your body yet!",

      "body": "I hope this helps because I can sense some of your pain and a desire for hope, but tiredness in your words. First, I am so sorry. You don\u2019t deserve this pain. You never deserved any of this pain. Now, for the part that I hope makes sense and can help. I\u2019ve learned that the hardest thing to grasp, the most deceptive thing in life is perspective. When I was deep in my ED, my trauma and my symptoms, there was no way I could see anything that would make \u201crecovery\u201d worth it. When I saw things I knew \u201cshould\u201d make me happy because they were once my favorite things and yet I felt nothing from them even if I tried to force myself to feel joy, it just made me feel unheard if someone told me things would ever get better. Fast-forward to now. I still struggle with self-hate. I still have a long way to go. I\u2019ve still been too scared to recover. But I didn\u2019t give up and I did find things that bring me joy again, things I actually look forward to and love. I NEVER would\u2019ve believed that was possible back then. I know (and you may want to slap me for this but I\u2019m still going to say it) that things can get better for you. Recovery for everyone is different. Yours can be what you truly need. What you want and may not know that you want right now. It\u2019s not too late. I know if someone said that to me at my worst I\u2019d just be mad they don\u2019t understand, but what if the doubt is your ED manipulating you and there\u2019s something good beyond it?",

It was also very focused on food & eating. It was a exhausting tug of war - food gives me pleasure- my erratic eating causes me pain. I found relief through working a 12 step program for my compulsive eating problem.  Today I get freedom from all that pain & obsessing as long as I work the steps. I'm grateful to have a solution that works - if I work it!",
