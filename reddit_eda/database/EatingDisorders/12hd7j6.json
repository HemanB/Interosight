      "body": "It's now her responsibility to heal and create a healthy environment if you are going to complete the pregnancy. The best thing would be to find a therapist or dietician with ED knowledge to start the process. There's no way she can \"refuse\" to go to a prenatal appointment; that would be incredibly selfish if she's trying to grow a baby.  If it's serious it's going to require serious and hard work, no way around that. If she has body image issues, food cravings or aversions, those are going to explode. You aren't ambushing her, you are thinking about your kid.",

      "body": "I would honestly wait and see how the first month or so goes. Make sure she's taking her prenatal vitamins and staying hydrated. I was anorexic when I got pregnant and for some reason it was very easy for me to start eating normally. I did it with two other pregnancies as well. I also lost the weight very quickly afterwards but I gained an acceptable amount of weight. Something that helped me was having good maternity clothes. Jeans, shorts, cute dresses. It would highlight that my belly was bigger but the rest of me was pretty much the same (besides swollen feet and bigger breasts). I loved wearing leggings, a tank top, and a zip up hoodie when it was cool. My disorder isn't about being thin, it's control, but I hate the FEELING of being or looking big. It makes me feel trapped.\n\nA pregnant woman doesn't actually need to gain a lot of weight. 20-25 lbs. A bit more if she is already underweight. I would always break that down in my head and think about how much the baby weighed, the placenta, the extra fluid etc. It helped me realize that most of what I was gaining would go away quickly after delivery and it did all three times. After the first I wore my normal jeans the first week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, if she doesn't do well the first month it would be an excellent idea for her to meet with an ED Nutritionist that can help her develop a meal plan she is comfortable with. I did this on my own with a lot of research. Some days I would just eat like a \"normal\" person. Others,I needed to know exactly how much I was consuming. Having a plan in place for those days really helps and she can build it with her safe foods. I wouldn't recommend brining it up to her doctor at the first appointment. This may make her feel very pressured and will put a ton of extra focus on her weight which could be very counterproductive.\n\nBest of luck and congratulations! You are already showing you are going to be a great parent.\n\nA pregnant woman doesn't actually need to gain a lot of weight. 20-25 lbs. A bit more if she is already underweight.
