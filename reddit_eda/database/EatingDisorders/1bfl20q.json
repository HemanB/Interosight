      "body": "Im non binary, not a guy, but id like to offer some support if that\u2019s alright. \n\nEating disorders are wildly misunderstood. They are absolutely not specific to a gender, and in many cases they have far less to do with appearance than they do with control and self harm. They\u2019re an unhealthy coping mechanism that anybody can develop. You know this, obviously, but as a gender queer person I can relate to the idea that it feels too feminine to suffer with. That\u2019s a stupid narrative pushed by people who don\u2019t know the first thing about eating disorders. \n\nYou deserve help. The best thing I can think for you to do is find an eating disorder specific therapist who is already knowledgeable about them. They will understand the complexities far better than a standard therapist. In my experience, unfortunately many don\u2019t get it. I\u2019ve had some that have reduced it to me wanting to fit size 0 pants and it\u2019s so insulting. The mental health care system needs a lot of work, and the shame and stigma is still very much there. \n\nStill, don\u2019t let it discourage you from seeking help. It might be better to open up to people who you trust in your life first, so you have people on your team who can help you. I\u2019m proud of you for taking the first step of reaching out on here. There is help available, and you will get there\u2764\ufe0f take care",

To be honest, the most confusing and difficult part for me was actually when I was diagnosed with an ED - like you say, it\u2019s just not something blokes get\u2026 </sarcasm>\n\nWhether I\u2019ve just been lucky, but I\u2019ve never felt judged or dismissed for being a guy by either my GP, psychiatrist or psychologist. They\u2019ve been really good in helping me come up with ways of recovering that fit in with my life. I have been selective in who I\u2019ve told about and limited it those who I felt would be supportive, so they understand why/if I ever feel the need to remove myself from any social situation when I\u2019m with them.\n\nHope you feel able to reach out to a professional, and it\u2019s as much as a relief as it was for me.",

But that was only one of the providers that was like that. I was pretty shocked though. Men, eating disorders are definitely the minority, or at least the diagnosed minority. The hardest part is finding any in person group sessions. Regardless of whether you\u2019re a male or female.\n\nMy eating disorder has run the gamut from anorexia to binge eating disorder to bulimia. I agree with everyone else, though, the nuances of everyone\u2019s individual disorder have very little to do with gender, and more to do with other factors. Stay safe, everyone.",

And they are pretty experienced at dealing with a lot of very different issues, so I would be shocked if your gender actually made a difference when it comes to treatment/therapy etc. They will have had plenty of experience of different eating disorders, with both men and women, and the different ways they can present.\n\nAt times I found it a bit challenging to talk to my friends about it because it is stereotypically feminine. But after a while I stopped caring - at the end of the day this just comes from ignorance. There shouldn't be any additional stigma around EDs for men, and anyone who thinks otherwise is just ignorant.",

People hear me talk about it now. I don't whine but I'm very honest about the experience. I make boundaries about its triggers n I enforce them quickly. People respect that. I've a few ED friends n we support each other on the bad days of it.\nA woman not like my words? FO. Not my problem. Hope your son n partner find more compassion.\nI was Into the wrong kind of women. I was into the wrong kind of thinking about my ED. I built that world of rejection based on it. \nTook time to learn. Hard lessons. Self esteem needed to be rebuilt. Now my boundaries and self respect are high enough that when some attacks it accidentally or intentionally..  I don't even consider my body or mind at fault. Bad behaviour is on them. My behaviour is on me.\n\nYou can use it to filter people who are good, compassionate, educated, supportive friends.\n\nDon't internalise the story around the ED. You got a illness that's treatable. Treat it. \nYou'd never treat a person with a treatable illness badly I bet. You'd offer them consideration.\nOffer that to yourself.\n\nGet advice. Accept help. Create spaces safe for you.",
