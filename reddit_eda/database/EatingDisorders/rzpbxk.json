  "title": "Request: How can I lose weight after recovering from anorexia?",
  "selftext": "How can I lose weight after recovering from anorexia? When I was 16 I started counting calories and walking excessively. Eventually I lost xx  pounds and was hospitalized for anorexia nervosa and atheltica. I\u2019m at a healthy weight now, but my problem is that I continue to gain weight. I\u2019m in the process of joining the army and I\u2019m not far from my upper weight limit for my height. No matter how hard I try to not eat everything in sight, my extreme hunger continues to make me eat thousands of calories a day. I know I\u2019m eating enough because when I am able to stick to it, my weight remains the same on the scale, but eventually I binge and my weight has slowly been going up. I\u2019m concerned that by the time I leave for bootcamp I\u2019ll be too heavy.",

It was awful. But my body needed it. You have so many calories to make up for, of course your body needs those nutrients!! \n\nBest of luck with the army, and with recovery, I know its tough. I'd suggest you talk to a professional dietitian about this. Maybe you even have one you know from your ED treatment?",

      "body": "As others have written, you would probably benefit from seeking advice from a registered dietician, particularly because you're in recovery from an ED and don't want to jeopardize your progress. But you also might want to seek out nutritionally dense foods that can satisfy hunger cravings without adding too many calories. For example, steamed vegetables, legumes, fish, pasta alternatives like hearts of palm pasta, oatmeal, really fortified smoothies (I make one with coconut water, banana, spinach, yogurt and almond milk that is really filling and very healthy), etc. Good luck!",

I don\u2019t know if you are or you aren\u2019t. I\u2019m not a doctor and I can\u2019t diagnose you. Your hunger may be a part of your eating disorder but it also may be a medical issue.

Bootcamp is very structured environment which some people find helpful for ED/addiction/etc. It takes a way a lot of the \u2018what ifs\u2019 and personal control in your day which makes it harder to engage in those behaviors, which is useful for breaking the cycle of habit.

Eat 3 times a day do some walking for about an hour and sleep really well. hope this helps.",
