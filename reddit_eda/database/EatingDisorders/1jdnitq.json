(not specifying exact age, but im a teenager) my brain just tells me 'if she can do it why can't you?' \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d i already have really disordered eating habits so it just makes me feel like i have to eat less than i already do :/",

Every time I see a really thin girl...my thoughts are why don't you look like that? The sad part is that I actually DO look just like that...it's pathetic how I look fat when I look at myself. My stomach pooches out way too much and my shoulders are too broad...yuck. I know how you feel hon. I feel the same. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f I'm sending you some love and strength, and maybe we can both beat our EDs right? Yeah. Good luck!\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

I'm also a teenage girl (16) , who's grown up with people with EDs, including my mum and sisters alongside of friends, whilst having a very bad relationship with food from a young age myself. Eating/food, even not disordered, is so sensitive for anyone, even those who don't 'think they have an ED' or other things like that. jealously isn't something to be guilty about, rather acknowledged and analysed, like finding the root why do you feel like that and why do you feel that jealousy. we live in a society and are surrounded by industries which feed off of competition and jealousy like social media that, even if not intentional, idolises and both shames every single body, whether slim or larger - and this industry almost standardises and promotes competition within this as well as jealousy, but I'm also not saying its the industries fault people feel jealousy, but it defiantly normalises it and almost thrives off of it. its not so simple to just not analyse peoples bodies and idolise them, especially if they fit the beauty standard, which is obviously being slimmer. i think you really need to focus on whether your jealous of their body, or the fact that they have an eating disorder, then work forwards. don't ever feel bad for these thoughts, i have them and so many do, you cant control how you think but you can control how u moderate it and work from it. stay safe!!!!",
