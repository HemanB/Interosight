  "selftext": "Hi everyone, would appreciate any advice of wisdom.\n\nI (31f) am in a relationship with my partner (31m) for 3 years. My partner has a lot of disordered eating behaviours and thoughts although he has never formally been diagnosed (most likely because he\u2019s a man). As a teenager, he went for a period of about 3 years where he ate only one small meal per day, with the aim of losing weight and was for a time very underweight. He\u2019s now a healthy weight but is very preoccupied with his weight and shape, will exercise rigidly even when unwell, will complain of feeling \u2018fat\u2019 and will restrict calories for long amounts of time before having periods of binging. He hates his body and avoids wearing T-shirts etc despite looking objectively great. So basically - classic enough eating disorder stuff as I know from a few close friends I have who suffer.\n\nMy partner however had never really considered his behaviour to be an ED and was a bit shocked when I gently raised it as a possibility. He suffers a lot from internal shame and this issue has largely remained unspoken between us, with me doing my best to be respectful of his being an adult, although I have suggested a few times he seek therapy, which he isn\u2019t interested in. He looks on dieting as a way to make himself feel better and he doesn\u2019t want that taken he says. He also suffers from depression.\n\nA few months ago I put on a some weight after a stressful life event. My partner has told me that this has hugely impacted his attraction to me and he wants me to lose it. We went on vacation last week and he was obviously annoyed when I indulged at all as he had decided it would be a good time for us both to lose weight. He insisted we walk a certain number of steps together everyday. \n\nI was very upset by this and it led to quite a big fight with him telling me if I didn\u2019t lose weight he doesn\u2019t want to be with me. I guess I\u2019m wondering if anyone here has any insight into if this is related to his eating disorder and something I should be compassionate towards or is it unrelated? I appreciate it could well be a mix of both! Any insight or expertise into those who lack insight into their eating being a problem would also be helpful.",

Yes this is probably happening because of his ED, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to say he\u2019s putting it on you because he\u2019s got an ED. This is controlling behaviour on top of his eating disorder. I know everyone is different but eating disorders are usually imposed on oneself and usually people who have them are internalizers. He\u2019s trying to control your weight now. Do you see this trait in him for others things that aren\u2019t ED related? Or is it just your weight he thinks he has a say in? I have a weird feeling from my own life experiences that he does this in other areas too",

This sounds like the beginning of a relationship in which you are constantly put down by your partner, which will cause you anxiety and damage your self esteem. Often times, these control issues will spread into other areas. An example of what could come next is him criticizing your fashion choices, then your friends, followed by your hobbies and job. I would leave as soon as you can, before you lose sight of who you are. Anyone who threatens to leave you and ruins a vacation over this isn\u2019t healthy for you.",

In my opinion (and I DID have an eating disorder for a very long time), you should kind of forget everything relating to his own disordered behavior & thoughts for a moment & just be honest with yourself: do I really want to be with somebody who can't love me the same at 150 lbs as they did at 140? (I'm making these #'s up)\n\nIt should no longer be a question, your boyfriend ABSOLUTELY has an eating disorder. Of course in his mind, he's doing something good in \"making himself better\" but in reality, he's only harming his own body & mind - but ALSO dragging you down with him, which is dangerous. It sounds like you have a super healthy relationship with food & with your body & you should not only cherish that, but protect it at all costs!\n\nI personally think you need to be the complete opposite of compassionate. You don't have to be a total betch, but he needs to understand that while he's free to do & say these things to himself as a grown adult, YOU are more than your body. You're more than your looks & how attractive he finds you, and you deserve to be with somebody who can appreciate you for you, not for how hard he gets looking at you. I genuinely think this guy needs to come to terms with his own issues before he'll be capable of having a healthy relationship & the #1 red flag you should consider is that he clearly has no interest in doing that.\n\nI vote you break up with him first, because there will be a man out there who won't even notice when you put on a little weight. And if he does, he'll be smart enough to keep it to himself lol",
