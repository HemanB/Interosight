  "selftext": "I've had my suspicions for a while now (for example, he always goes to the bathroom after a meal, while cleaning the toilet I sometimes find evidence that someone threw up, he eats A LOT but is not overweight), but my suspicions were confirmed today when I overheard him in the bathroom throwing up after lunch. He brushed his teeth after as well. I have never had any experience dealing with EDs or know anyone personally that struggled with it so I am lost on how I can go about helping him. I don't think I should tell my parents- they are a little old fashioned and I don't think they would understand. Any advice would help greatly!! \n\n(Note: my brother is 23 and I am 20)",

      "body": "I think if you're worried you should definitely ask him gently.  Tell him that you're concerned and list off what you've heard and had suspicions of.  I definitely wouldn't tell your parents since he's an adult and if that's a conversation he wants to avoid with them that's his prerogative.\n\nThe most you can do is offer your support.  You won't be able to change his behaviours and your support isn't going to make him all better but it will give him something to lean on if he needs it.  Don't try to police him and his actions because you may find he becomes more secretive, just offer him a friendly ear every so often as he needs.  It may seem counter-intuitive to know he's purging and then just sort of letting him purge but recovery is something that needs to be decided by him when he's ready and isn't something that should be forced on him.\n\nThe absolute best thing you can do for him is try to encourage him to visit a doctor.  If he doesn't want therapy or doesn't want to recover and resists it then I'd personally ask him to visit a doctor anyway to check up on him physically since the physical effects of purging can be dangerous.  Just because he visits a doctor to get certain things tested does not mean he's going to have to go to therapy or something along those lines.\n\nYou can always encourage him to recover and the best thing for him to hear would be that you'll always support him.  When you bring this up to him and when you have conversations with him in the future telling him that you'll not judge him and you'll support him the best you can in the way he needs will be so so so comforting.\n\nAlso you'll get something wrong.   You'll say something triggering and it'll be an accident.  Maybe if he's willing to talk to you about it, the subject of triggers can come up and you can ask him about it so you can try to avoid it.  You'll make a mistake and frankly that's okay.  Just apologise, realistically he'll know as well as you that you mean him no harm.  As a general rule though I wouldn't say things like \"you look good at your weight\" or \"you shouldn't lose/gain anymore\" because whilst those things can be perceived as nice they're actually sorta cursed to hear.\n\nBut you've already had a great start, you've come here looking for advice and you're trying to understand what to do and how to help him.  Recovery takes time and works best when decided on by the person who needs to recover with the support of family and friends.  I hope everything works out for you.  Also I don't know where you're from but please look at the Beat website because they have a support section for friends and family of those with eating disorders.  It can be scary, frustrating and it can worry you.  So please look after yourself as well, make sure you have a support system and stay as safe as possible.\n\nI wish you and your brother the best of luck",

      "body": "I went through this when I was younger. From when I was 11 (sibling 13) until I moved out at 17 my sister would throw up *often*. She would always say it was because she ate too much and her stomach was upset, or she wouldn\u2019t say anything and go to the bathroom downstairs/turn the tap on. I didn\u2019t even know what an ED was at 11, so it wasn\u2019t until I was 16 or so that I realized what she was going through. \n\nAnd to be honest, I never talked to her about it. I regret it, but it wasn\u2019t something she was doing constantly (maybe 1 or 2 times a week), and it didn\u2019t feel like my space to enter.\n\nJust a few months ago she called me and told me she\u2019s bulimic (I\u2019m now 23), and she\u2019s working on it. \n\nLooking back on my experience, I recommend talking to him about it. I don\u2019t recommend going to your parents first - he\u2019s 23 years old. He may not know the risks of what he is doing and it might be good for him to talk to someone about it - whether that be you or someone else.",

Big brother is the guardian, and not the one with an eating disorder, that needs some psychological and emotional advice. \n\nI know, that is stupid and cliche, but that is how men tend to think intuitively. And women too for that matter. \n\nHe will certainly assume, that you can relate better to the issue itself (since you are a woman, which is certainly more or less true, up for debate, but that's how his perception of things most likely will be.)\n\nIs he some sort of professional athlete?\nThere are certain risk sports, that are notorious for the more rare development of male bulimia/anorexia. Boxing, wrestling, ballet dancer, running sports, gymnastics... Stuff, where weight classes play a big role for professional competition.\n\nIs he gay? \nIt's a stigma, but as far as I know, it is also not, since gay men have a pressure comparable to that of women, when it comes to being thin and attractive, and youthful, for the rest of their life. In other words, there are more gay men with eating disorders than heterosexual men - according to statistics, but those statistics are also quite scarce in comparison to the data there is about female bulimia/anorexia.\n\nAnd it does often play a role, beyond the rather mundane beauty cult in gay culture. Many men seem to develop the eating disorder out of denial and frustration about their own homosexuality. Hate for their own body and their sexual attraction to the same gender is compensated through the eating disorder. Gives them back control. \nThat is all very superficial, but might be good to know, when going into such a rather peculiar conversation.\n\nKeep it in mind. I would leave the gay thesis out for now. \n\nThis is like hitting him right in the dick, twice. It will be \"interesting enough\", if you confront him with your factual observations about his voluntary purging. \n(Except you know for a fact already, that he is gay, or you have a strong, strong suspicion for that as well.)\n\n\nSo. When are you going to do it? How? Any plans already?",
