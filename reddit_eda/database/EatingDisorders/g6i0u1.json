  "title": "Request: COVID causing me to restrict",
  "selftext": "For the past few years I\u2019ve had issues with my body image and restrictive eating, but they\u2019ve never been as bad as this. I\u2019ve been stuck at home for the past month, and I can\u2019t bring myself to stick to a workout routine. I find it easier to restrict rather than eat healthy and exercise. I\u2019m usually involved in year-round sports, and during those time periods I have no desire to cut calories. However, because of quarantine, I can\u2019t stop thinking about food. I\u2019m terrified that I wont be able to control myself in the future, but I don\u2019t want to tell my parents what\u2019s happening. I don\u2019t know what to do, and I\u2019m worried that I\u2019ll end up hurting my body.",
