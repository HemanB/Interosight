  "selftext": "Request: Mom doesn't acknowledge my recovery efforts and enables my ED. \n\nHello, I hope this is allowed here. I am currently (20F) and have struggled with an ED since I was 13. I was initially diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa Restrictive Subtype but last year began abusing laxatives and diuretics so I am diagnosed as 'Purging Subtype.' I went through a six month period of severe B/P behaviors while at my lowest weight ever. Basically, I would fast all week, than plan a massive binge, than make myself purge all night. And repeated every. single. week. I was so miserable and so food obsessed. I would cook ridiculous meals like a buffet and eat until I would nearly vomit, I was torturing myself. In July, I began making some recovery efforts. Returned to my therapist, had to get stomach surgery from the damage my purging had done, and began attempting to eat more regularly. First just a solid, non restricted meal once a day, than twice, and now three times per day. My mother has been incredibly triggering and grows more angry with me at any efforts I take to further my independence. My grades and gpa have greatly improved, and as a foodie at heart, i am not only able to cook meals but portion them and eat. I have become much better at not asking for reassurance and instead assuring myself that i need to eat. My parents work a lot so I log my food via photography which i send to my best friend or therapist for support, and i even make efforts to bring snacks such as some muffins i bake, or a smoothie to school. I have deleted my calorie counters but i am not really able to eat at restaurants yet, as i dont feel mentally ready. \n\nMy mother seems to miss my former B/P behaviors. I went through a really intense period of binging 10000+ cals per day, to the point where in july i needed hospitalization and as i mentioned earlier, a surgery due to severe bowel impaction. Sometimes, she implies that she misses these behaviors. I used to compare what I ate to her and refused to eat alone or while she worked, meaning i would wait to have dinner with her at 9 pm, usually fainting in the process or having a B/P session. She often puts down what I eat, as her and I have different likes/dislikes. I need wheat bread for my GI issues, and i tend to eat a lot of dark meat chicken which she claims is \"fattening\" which is just so triggering. I am usually hungry at much different times of day than her, like she wont eat til 1 pm where as I make breakfast at 8 am as i feel i really need a schedule. This evening for dinner we were ready to sit and eat and she said she was also going to have a bit of smoked salmon with her meal (we made lasagna). I told her i wasn't really in the mood for that and id pass. she said i NEEDED to have some. I said, \"i dont want any though. i dont make you eat foods you dont want to eat.\" for example, she eats fish for dinner a few nights a week which im allergic to. i eat oats with peanut butter all the time which shes allergic to. she then told me she misses the old days when id make elaborate platters and host big dinners with the neighbors. i said \"those were binging and purging sessions. id wake up at 4 am, go for a run, than center my entire day around binging and purging. it was so painful. i dont miss any of that. i was going through a lot of pain.\" apparently she sees those meals as lovely family time even though she saw how bad itd get. id throw up at the table. i was feeling tortured in my own mind. she also makes fun of my body. i wore a sports bra today and she said i looked disgusting and skeletal. i said \"im practicing body confidence. it was really hard to put this on. i was trying to feel more confident in myself instead of covering my body since its changed.\" im not at my lowest weight anymore and trying to accept change. i really dont know what to do. i have mt friends and therapist in my corner encouraging me, but she is so toxic to my recovery. can anyone give me some advice?",

I had much more mild issues, and I still needed mountains of support to get through. If there's any way for you to move out, I wouldn't blame you. Wear your sports bra and feel good about it!

It probably sounds super scary but maybe it can help her see the reality of your situation. \n\nIt sounds like you're doing a wonderful job in recovery so far - keep up the good work! I hope your mental health continues to improve and that your mom can work through her own hangups and start supporting you on your journey.",

Take control of your life. \n\nGet a job if you have to, many people myself included worked 25+ hours per week in addition to going to college full time and took out student loans that took years to pay back.  But we were able to live as adults while in college and support ourselves.",

You said you threw up at the table and she considered it a nice family meal. You were hospitalized and she still thinks it's okay to comment on your appearance and food. These are not normal or acceptable behaviors when your kid has an eating disorder. Even if she thinks it's helpful, i.e \"if I tell her shes too thin she will want to gain\" it is damaging and you would both benefit from her going to therapy and learning what is helpful and good.",
