  "title": "Request: Pregnant with baby #2 and bulimic",
  "selftext": "This is partly a vent and partly asking for advice and/or reassurance. \n\nFor some background, I\u2019ve been bulimic with restriction for years and years. Then in 2017 I got pregnant with my first child, and I stopped smoking and drinking as soon as I got a positive pregnancy test. I did purge a couple times after I found out I was pregnant and always felt consumed by guilt afterwards and fear that I would lose my baby and it would be my fault. I had my healthy baby in early 2018.\n\nNow I\u2019m pregnant with baby #2. Very much planned. I was late for my period by 5 days last Sunday so I took a test and it was positive. Again I immediately stopped all drinking and smoking, but I again I have purged a couple times since I found out, and I keep crying afterwards and apologizing to my baby and promising I won\u2019t do it again. So I\u2019ve already broken a promise to my child and he or she hasn\u2019t even been born. I\u2019m so overwhelmed with guilt and fear. This baby will complete my family and I know if I lose this pregnancy it will be my fault for purging. I refuse to do it again from now on. I will not do that to my child again. I will not break another promise. \n\nBut I\u2019m so so so scared. I keep reading about how bulimia increases chances of a miscarriage and I\u2019m so afraid. I guess I\u2019m just looking for some reassurance (even though nobody can predict the future lol) or some advice on how to get the disordered thoughts out my head. I\u2019m so scared I hurt my baby.",

It's so hard to break out of these patterns if you don't have someone knowledgeable to talk to. \n\nI don't mean to guilt trip you in any way but maybe also think about your first child observing your behaviors. Research shows that children pick up on disordered eating habits from a very young age, starting from when they're toddlers. Maybe thinking about it this way could help.",

You can resist that urge for 36 (guessing you're about a month in?) more weeks.  You don't have to commit to forever if you're not ready yet, if trying to commit to forever is triggering the behavior.  It's just 36 more weeks.  Count it down, if you have to, but you're strong enough to do this.\n\nPM me if you ever need a reminder.",

Talking about your fears and ways to deal with it and figure out things to do instead of purging would probably be very helpful.\n\n\nBest of luck. You've got this! And congrats on the pregnancy",

If treatment isn't an option I would recommend that you he completely open and honest with your supports about what you're struggling with so they can help you. Try as hard as possible yo distract yourself after meals.  I know the urge to purge is so, so strong, and I also know thay you are capable of getting through it. You're stronger than you know \ud83d\udc9b",

We were healthy when born. The real issue was when we got older, her ED really messed with how we deal with food, and still does to this day. Know that you can only do your best, and that your best will change depending on the day and the circumstances. \ud83d\udc95",

      "body": "I\u2019m not bulimic, but I\u2019m a recovering anorexic. I can never recover for myself for very long, I have to do it for the people I love; a reason more important than myself. Your baby is a miracle and I\u2019m sure you already love him/her very much and want them to be okay. When you think about purging, think about your love and longing for your baby and stay clean for them. Someone else commented that you don\u2019t have to stay clean forever because that\u2019s really, really hard, but right now make your baby your focus. \n\nPicking up a positive hobby like drawing/painting, knitting, reading, etc. could be a helpful distraction when you feel the urges coming on. Also, try to spend more time with your husband and friends if you can. Having people there will give you someone to interact with and potentially keep you from purging long enough for those urges to go away or weaken.\n\nI really wish you the best with your pregnancy and recovery <3",

Eating disorders are complex illnesses and it makes sense that you're having trouble stopping behaviors immediately.  It's evident that you really care about your children and this baby is already so lucky to have you as a mother!  Give yourself grace and keep identifying healthier ways that you can use to cope when the desire to purge comes up.  Distraction can be a really good one to help you ride out the urges!  Reminding yourself of what you're fighting for is also a great one, but try to use it positively rather than a way to cause intense guilt.  I believe in you!",

Before I got pregnant I decided to start a new page by myself and begin getting better. I had stopped purging and binging completely for over 8 months before pregnancy but due to a lot a of stress I had 1 or 2 slip ups before I got pregnant and I have been totally fine since. I didn\u2019t really do anything that special because I had given myself 8 months to cut out that behaviour it gets ingrained in your brain the more you do it the more you feel you need to do it. The less you do it the easier it becomes. I eat healthy meals also.",
