  "selftext": "I've been going through recovery and gaining weight, and though I feel a lot better physically and am able to accomplish a lot more than I used to be able to, the sick part of my brain wants me to lose it again. I've built my identity around being the smallest in the room or just plain looking sick and unhappy. How do I change this mantality? I currently can't afford therapy so I've been recovering in my own. Any tips are welcome.",

My therapist has been asking me when I am on my death bed and looking back at my life, what do I think will have been important to me? Would it be always being the thinnest in the room? Or always in control of my food? What was important to me before the eating disorder? What are hobbies or interests that I\u2019ve always wanted to explore but couldn\u2019t because the ED took up so much time and energy?",

And I clung to those things for dear life because well, I'm scared for my health. I'm trying to understand what it was that helped me overcome it even for a little bit so I can spread the word and help someone. \n\nOne of the things that helped me was the realization that I love working with animals (particularly dogs) and I wanted to become a pet counselleur. It helped lots. We're so alike. Helping them has helped me. \n\nP.S. English not my first language.",
