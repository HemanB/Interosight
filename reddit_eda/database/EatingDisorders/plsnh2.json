  "selftext": " \n\nHi, I\u2019ve been struggling with an eating disorder for the past twenty  years (yikes), but I have felt I\u2019ve had a pretty good grip on my  recovery.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed one thing in particular that triggers me that I can\u2019t  find info about is whenever I find out about someone who has experienced  addiction, I immediately want to open up to them but don\u2019t, and instead  go into a tailspin of ideas and old habits.\n\nDoes this happen to anyone else? Does opening up to them help? I\u2019m  wondering if this is a better approach for me. So many people don\u2019t see  the connection between an eating disorder and, say, alcoholism, and I  would love not to get triggered by someone\u2019s recovery journey even if  it\u2019s not an eating disorder.\n\nThank you, sending love to you all!",

      "body": "I have a certain kinship with addicts. Because we tend to come from similar backgrounds and trauma so I feel somewhat comfortable talking to them. \n\nMy dad was an alcoholic and I also know I\u2019ve inherited a propensity for addiction as well. I\u2019m addicted to my Eating Disorders and cigarettes and if it wasn\u2019t for my fear of the calories in alcohol I\u2019d probably be an alcoholic, too. \nWeird to say Anorexia helps me from possibly becoming an alcoholic. \n\nI don\u2019t really feel too triggered by other people\u2019s addictions. It always reminds me that I could easily go that way if I\u2019m not careful. \n\nSo they help me feel like I can relate and they also help me keep my footing with my own issues.",
