  "selftext": "my roommate is clearly in the midst of a restrictive eating disorder and it\u2019s beginning to trigger me. she often tells asks me if she\u2019ll gain weight drinking a protein shake or ask me if eating two salads a day will make her gain weight. she claims she is trying to recover and told me she ate pizza but she took off the cheese or that she ate a hamburger but took off the buns. she tells me she\u2019s about to hit 100 pounds that she lost her period and she asks me what she should do. it\u2019s becoming very triggering for me because i went from a restrictive eating disorder to having a problem with binge eating and i constantly feel like im being judged and i see myself fantasizing about going back to restriction. im not sure what to do",

      "body": "I don\u2019t want to make excuses for her, but in my past I was completely unaware of how out of touch/Cruel my comments or questions were. Over time I realized how I shouldn\u2019t say those things around/to people even if it isn\u2019t about them, but it took time to realize. I don\u2019t think anyone ever mentioned to me that it bothered them either. Maybe mentioning to her that it\u2019s upsetting you is worth a shot, if she continues to do it then I\u2019d say that\u2019s a conscious decision, but if she can realize what she says is harmful that\u2019s the best outcome, for you both. Protect your peace though, her feelings should not override yours.",

      "body": "My mom does this a lot.  Best thing you can do is kindly explain that it's hurting you and hope that she understands.  They can choose not to talk about these things and most people don't want to negatively affect others.  Chances are with a bit of explaining she'll stop doing it out loud at least, which let's face it is good for her too.  If she doesn't just maintain a healthy distance and remember her struggles are horrid but not worth hurting yourself over as if it's that bad there isn't much you can do without a professional. \n\nI would highly recommend getting some sort of therapists opinion or help with the situation as they know how to handle this stuff better than a lot of us here on Reddit will. \n\nMain thing is to keep yourself from going back, helping yourself is still helping someone.",

It\u2019s hard, but try and not fall into that pit of competition. I hear you. You\u2019re doing great & all the best you can. \ud83d\udda4",
