  "title": "Request: A little tip for anyone recovering from anorexia: make a video",
  "selftext": "Back in 2016 when I was at my anorexic worst (BMI in the danger zone, exercising compulsively, etc.), I decided to make a video.\n\nHere's what I did: I stuck my webcam on, started recording, took my top and jeans off so I was just in my underwear (bear with me), and did a little turn for the camera.\n\nIt served a few purposes\u2014such as acting as a good way to determine how much healthier I looked and to document the recovery process\u2014but now it serves one I hadn't anticipated.\n\nIt's not a magic switch, but now, every time I think about skipping a meal, I play that video. And holy shit does it work wonders sometimes. Skeletor Me is sad and very shocking to look at and I nearly teared up when I re-watched it yesterday, but I suppose that's the point: a shock to the system, a reminder that one skipped meal is where it starts.\n\nAnd y'know, maybe I'll summon the required balls to eat something and still have trouble actually holding it down, but it's the effort of trying now that leads to the resilience built in the future. It doesn't work every time, it's not a magic Cura spell, but for the most part it acts as a great deterrent against skipping meals. As if to say, 'Remember this? Yeah, me too. Let's not do that shit again, yeah? Be brave, knobhead'.\n\nJust an idea. One that's saved me more than a few times since then. Good luck with the rest of your journey xx",

Looking at pictures only does so much for me at this point, I only took the best angles, and it\u2019s so easy to look back at them and *want* to look like that again. In a video I wouldn\u2019t be able to hide the scary angles, or how my face looks when I get like that. Thanks for the tip! ",

But anyways I think this could definitely be beneficial to SOME people. Me? No. It is a constant struggle and daily battle to not go back to what I was and I feel being able to watch it that will just trigger a relapse for months when I\u2019m in a weak moment, as I\u2019m sure many others feel the same. If it helps you all the power! If you feel sad and fat afterwards.. get rid of the videos!",
