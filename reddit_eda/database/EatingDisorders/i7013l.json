  "title": "Request: How to support my friend with an ED?",
  "selftext": "My best friend is coming to visit me and she just reached out to me to tell me she's relapsed in her ED (anorexia) and just wanted me to know she's having a hard time eating.\n\nI absolutely adore my friend and I am so excited to see her again. Its been years since I saw her. I'm really not familiar with EDs at all. I thanked her for telling me, she thought I would be upset and I assured her I wasn't. \n\nI just need some insight from others who either struggle with ED or have loved ones who do. Are there any tips you have for how to be a good host to my friend? Things I should do or things I should avoid? \n\nI want her to feel comfortable and enjoy herself while she's here. I dont want to say or do anything to make her feel bad or worsen her situation. \n\nI would also love if there's any resources like articles or videos that you can point me towards. I want to educate myself and be prepared so I can step up for my dear friend. Thank you.",

      "body": "Ok so first of all you sound like an amazing friend and she should be so lucky to have you. This is actually a situation I\u2019m having and very anxious about. Here is what I would love and appreciate if my friends did for me (disclaimer: everyone\u2019s ed is different and what works for me may not work for her):\n\n\n\nAsk her if she has any safe foods that she feels comfortable eating. And offer to either get them yourself for her beforehand or take her shopping once she gets there. It depends on the person if they rather do the food shopping themselves or not. \n\n\n\nKeep water available and offer it to her often. But not like in an obvious way that you\u2019re trying to get her to drink it. Make it like when you\u2019re getting up to get water, just say hey I\u2019m grabbing some water do you want some? It\u2019s very easy for us to get dehydrated and things can get scary if we do. \n\n\n\nDon\u2019t say anything about her weight. Don\u2019t ask or point out if she\u2019s lost or gained. Don\u2019t call her skinny and definitely don\u2019t call her fat. I think this is pretty self explanatory and well known but just thought I\u2019d say it anyway. Instead of weight, compliment her on things she has chosen about herself (her clothes, shoes, style, hair). \n\n\n\nDuring mealtimes keep the conversation away from anything related to food, bodies, exercise, etc. Talk about things extremely unrelated to those things and keep the conversation light. Example: maybe tell a story about something funny that happened to you at work. \n\n\n\n\nAlso during mealtimes don\u2019t push her to eat. No matter how much or how little she\u2019s eaten that day. You are not her treatment professional and don\u2019t have the authority over her. I know it can be tough to watch but unfortunately it\u2019s just out of your hands. \n\n\n\nBut I will add this: if you\u2019re going to be doing physical activities (hiking, biking, going to beach, etc.) this can be dangerous for her if she hasn\u2019t eaten or drank water in a few hours. Just let her know before you plan on doing these things that you\u2019d feel more comfortable if she ate a snack and had some water before because you want her to be safe. If she does at any point feel faint or lightheaded, help her lay down flat with her legs elevated and give her water when she stops feeling nauseous. \n\n\n\nUnderstand she may not want to talk about anything having to do with her ed. She may also want to talk to you a lot about it. It really depends on the person and how they\u2019re feeling. If she does want to talk about it, don\u2019t try to offer advice. There are a lot of resources on how to handle this I\u2019ll link below. Also if you want and feel comfortable, maybe ask her how she is doing in the beginning of the trip and if she wants to talk. If she doesn\u2019t just let her know she can talk to you at any time. If not, don\u2019t push it. \n\n\n\nWhen in doubt about anything, ask her. Like if you don\u2019t know if you should say or do something for her (or not say or do something) just ask first. It\u2019s better to get it out on the table rather than to guess wrong and potentially trigger her. \n\n\n\nKnow that she is not her ed. Yes it is a very relevant thing in her life right now but she is still the same friend you know and love. She is going through a hard time right now and she likely needs some normalcy right now. She\u2019s probably really looking forward to seeing you too. \n\n\n\n\n[neda ](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/what-are-eating-disorders)\n\n\n[beat](https://www.beateatingdisorders.org.uk/your-stories/10-things-say-someone-with-an-eating-disorder)\n\n[center for discovery](https://centerfordiscovery.com/blog/what-to-say-when-someone-has-an-eating-disorder/)\n\n[reach out](https://au.reachout.com/articles/how-to-help-a-friend-with-an-eating-disorder)",

      "body": "I really like this comment! I wish someone had told my friends three years ago how to handle eds like that. I basically started isolating and lost contact with most of them because they wouldn\u2019t stop talking about my weight loss and whenever we went out to eat, they would tell the they wouldn\u2019t leave until I had finished my food. In my case, there was a lot of bingeing and purging involved and it seemed like they didn\u2019t listen when I told them it didn\u2019t really help when they forced me to eat. They meant well but made social situations, which often involved food, really stressful. \n\nOP sounds like a great friend and I wish them and their friend all the best <3\n\nEdit to add to something someone added below: \n\nI hadn\u2019t seen these friends for a couple of months and when we finally went out for dinner they decided it was a good idea to compliment me saying I finally looked healthier and not as sick. I had gained a few pounds and took that comment as evidence that I had gotten fat (I hadn\u2019t). So yeah complimenting people with eds is kinda weird. Please don\u2019t mention their bodies. I wish my friends had told me my skin was glowing instead of saying my cheeks were fuller (I don\u2019t really understand their logic lmao). When I look back now, I understand that they were worried, but back then it just made me push them away even though it was the time I needed my friends the most.",

Example: maybe tell a story about something funny that happened to you at work. \n\n\n\n\nAlso during mealtimes don\u2019t push her to eat. No matter how much or how little she\u2019s eaten that day. You are not her treatment professional and don\u2019t have the authority over her. I know it can be tough to watch but unfortunately it\u2019s just out of your hands. \n\n\n\nBut I will add this: if you\u2019re going to be doing physical activities (hiking, biking, going to beach, etc.) this can be dangerous for her if she hasn\u2019t eaten or drank water in a few hours. Just let her know before you plan on doing these things that you\u2019d feel more comfortable if she ate a snack and had some water before because you want her to be safe. If she does at any point feel faint or lightheaded, help her lay down flat with her legs elevated and give her water when she stops feeling nauseous. \n\n\n\nUnderstand she may not want to talk about anything having to do with her ed. She may also want to talk to you a lot about it. It really depends on the person and how they\u2019re feeling. If she does want to talk about it, don\u2019t try to offer advice. There are a lot of resources on how to handle this I\u2019ll link below. Also if you want and feel comfortable, maybe ask her how she is doing in the beginning of the trip and if she wants to talk. If she doesn\u2019t just let her know she can talk to you at any time. If not, don\u2019t push it. \n\n\n\nWhen in doubt about anything, ask her. Like if you don\u2019t know if you should say or do something for her (or not say or do something) just ask first. It\u2019s better to get it out on the table rather than to guess wrong and potentially trigger her. \n\n\n\nKnow that she is not her ed. Yes it is a very relevant thing in her life right now but she is still the same friend you know and love. She is going through a hard time right now and she likely needs some normalcy right now. She\u2019s probably really looking forward to seeing you too. \n\n\n\n\n[neda ](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/what-are-eating-disorders)\n\n\n[beat](https://www.beateatingdisorders.org.uk/your-stories/10-things-say-someone-with-an-eating-disorder)\n\n[center for discovery](https://centerfordiscovery.com/blog/what-to-say-when-someone-has-an-eating-disorder/)\n\n[reach out](https://au.reachout.com/articles/how-to-help-a-friend-with-an-eating-disorder)",

          "body": "I really like this comment! I wish someone had told my friends three years ago how to handle eds like that. I basically started isolating and lost contact with most of them because they wouldn\u2019t stop talking about my weight loss and whenever we went out to eat, they would tell the they wouldn\u2019t leave until I had finished my food. In my case, there was a lot of bingeing and purging involved and it seemed like they didn\u2019t listen when I told them it didn\u2019t really help when they forced me to eat. They meant well but made social situations, which often involved food, really stressful. \n\nOP sounds like a great friend and I wish them and their friend all the best <3\n\nEdit to add to something someone added below: \n\nI hadn\u2019t seen these friends for a couple of months and when we finally went out for dinner they decided it was a good idea to compliment me saying I finally looked healthier and not as sick. I had gained a few pounds and took that comment as evidence that I had gotten fat (I hadn\u2019t). So yeah complimenting people with eds is kinda weird. Please don\u2019t mention their bodies. I wish my friends had told me my skin was glowing instead of saying my cheeks were fuller (I don\u2019t really understand their logic lmao). When I look back now, I understand that they were worried, but back then it just made me push them away even though it was the time I needed my friends the most.",
