  "selftext": "I have a history of disordered eating, though because I don't have a diagnosis I don't feel comfortable calling it an eating disorder. I'm trying to cut down on my body fat percentage, but am super worried about relapsing. I'm not in a supporting environment (ie parents encouraging me losing weight too fast), and I due to quarantine I have less healthy influences from outside my family. I don't know what a healthy body looks like, and I don't know what healthy expectations are. Thank you for your time.",

It\u2019s easy to go overboard on exercise or \u201csafe food\u201d, but it is very possible to incorporate and use exercise as a tool to center yourself and be comfortable in your own skin. Utilize YouTube for tips on overcoming eating disorders and exercising to strengthen your body. Meditate, get your mental stability healthy alongside your body as well. I\u2019d suggest reaching out for help if possible.",

      "body": "Truthfully, when you are looking at exercise as something that is healthy, enjoyable, and helpful for you and not as a way of burning calories, that is probably when you are ready to exercise. Disordered eating should be treated like a behavioral addiction-and over exercise and obsessive exercise is abusive and falls into disordered behavior also. I would encourage you to try to find some professional help that can guide you better than well meaning people who may not understand disordered eating thoroughly. Also, I would encourage you to think about why you think you need to lose weight...your goal should be to be healthy not look healthy. So that would include your mental health also. I have struggled with an eating disorder and over exercise for years and years and what I have found is that I can\u2019t be trusted much to exercise in a healthy way. When I finally stopped, a lot fell into place that couldn\u2019t when I was still focused on continual exercise as a way to maintain my weight. I hope you find some peace with your mind and body sooner instead of later! It takes sooo much more work than any effort you could ever put in at some gym.",

Here's a really awesome, empowering podcast about defining health for you and nobody else: [https://www.stitcher.com/show/the-thick-thighs-save-lives-podcast/episode/ep115-defining-health-82066130](https://www.stitcher.com/show/the-thick-thighs-save-lives-podcast/episode/ep115-defining-health-82066130)\n\nThe best thing you can do focus on activity/exercise that you genuinely love doing, and identify the ones that you know you are only going to use to burn calories - you want to avoid those. \n\nExample: At the height of my disorder, running was my go to. Miles and Miles. I didn't actually enjoy it though. Now, I do a shit ton of strength training, and a little cross fit because it makes me happy and it makes me feel strong. I also love going on walks on trails.\n\nThat's the easiest way to avoid slipping - if you change the why behind your movement. And you'll still be exercising so it should keep your parents off your back.",

      "body": "Great question. I think about this every day. I have been in treatment for 3 months and have cut back my exercise but not stopped because it helps so much with my mental health and happiness. I don't trust myself with exercise. I always abuse it. I started following a training plan and that has helped me take rest days and do less miles/workouts. I am not sure how long this good streak will last, but I am trying to take it a day at a time. It is good advice to try seeking out information from good media. A podcast has been life-changing for me \"The eating disorder recovery podcast\" and the episode \"PHIT Queens on Exercise\" from July 15, 2019\" is really really helpful on exercise with an eating disorder. I hope it helps.",

      "body": "Hi there! I have a few thoughts. 1) an absence of a diagnosis doesn't mean your experience isn't just as sensitive, valid, and precarious. I'm wondering if you're in a bigger body and therefore dealing with weight stigma as a barrier to treatment in addition to from your parents. I'd tell your parents that comments on your body are unwelcome and unhelpful. 2) healthy bodies exist in many shapes and sizes (check out Body Respect and Health at Every Size by Lindo Bacon). I've found [Meg Boggs](https://www.instagram.com/p/CLksxHHgB_g/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) and [Emily Decker](https://www.instagram.com/p/CLnB9SOJIvW/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) on Instagram to be helpful. Also, [300 pounds and running](https://300poundsandrunning.com/about-300-pounds-and-running/) does a great job busting the fitness \"look\" stereotype. 3) you don't owe your health to anyone, not even yourself. Healthy people aren't morally superior or better than anyone else. And mental health is just as important to consider (if not more so!)",
