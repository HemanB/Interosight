I want someone to be proud of me for eating but my family are pushing me to lose weight so me telling them this with actually bring them on disappointment. I don\u2019t think my body looks healthy anymore and it\u2019s hurting me but my parents push me to lose more and more. I\u2019m 20. I\u2019ve had them wanting me to be thinner ever since I can remember. I\u2019ve been through recovery before and it was so so hard but I was so proud. I wasn\u2019t fully happy with the weight but I was happy with being healthy. I\u2019m getting worse now and I\u2019m seeing the effects but I don\u2019t think I fully want to get better anymore. I 100% blame my parents. I was doing so well till they started commenting on my appearance again",

As long as you feel good about yourself and are healthy, that's what matters. We're all so proud of you :)",
