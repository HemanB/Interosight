I've never been huge on mayo so just use a bit but helps bring it together!  \nI agree on milk too, personally I like whole white milk, I get non homogenized. Great for nutrients and helps motivate me because it doesn't keep as long and I hate feeling like I'm burning money... once I get a new fridge that will be part of the grocery list again  \nCottage cheese, keep single cups in the ice chest til fridge is replaced. Takes me back to childhood though so it's comforting! Sometimes I add a drizzle of syrup and some pepper.  \nI can also demolish steamed broccoli with lemon squeezed over  em.",
