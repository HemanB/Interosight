  "selftext": "I\u2019m a \u201chealthy\u201d BMI but have obsessive thoughts about losing weight and a lot of body insecurities. I am constantly cycling between eating more than I even want and fasting, it\u2019s always one or the other. I\u2019ll go days without eating anything then inevitably binge.  Every time it\u2019s extremely emotionally distressing. I would vomit if I could but have never been able to, so I just fast. I\u2019ve heard of \u201cexercise bulimia\u201d but not \u201cfasting bulimia\u201d and I don\u2019t really know if it qualifies or if it would be something else",

I would highly recommend seeking a therapist to start to deal with the emotional side of this. And talk with your GP about making sure your body is okay. Recovery is possible!

Bulimia is not specifically vomiting, it\u2019s using compensatory measures to counter a binge. \n\n\nPer the DSM: *Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behavior to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications, fasting, or excessive exercise*\n\nPlease seek help. All eating disorders are miserable and treatment can truly be life changing.",

Basically it's an eating disorder that doesn't fit neatly into bulimia/anorexia/BED, which is actually super common!  A lot of people's EDs either have features of multiple disorders at once or just don't quite fit exactly with one of the other disorders.  It's a valid problem and something I'd recommend seeking help for.",

Bulimia involves any attempt to purge \"excess\" or unwanted calories, or make up for the consumption of them, which includes methods like fasting. Bulimics may also use laxatives or enemas, excerise excessively or use other methods. You can definitely be diagnosed with bulimia if you binge and then fast.\n\nAlso Best of luck and I hope that your health improves x",

      "body": "That is a disorder. It isn't bulimia but that kind of a relationship with food is horribly detrimental to your mental wellbeing. Just because it doesn't have the same physical symptoms as most eating disorders please pay no attention to people who try to downplay it. Your suffering is valid.\n\nI'm a man in my 20s and have been doing the same thing to myself for years. I consider myself recovered but still feel horribly guilty after over indulging. What gets me by is thinking of food as one of life's pleasures, and above all accepting and believing that you deserve that pleasure and you don't need to do anything to justify, earn, or be worthy of it. You are good enough as you are and fasting doesn't make you better. Once you believe that you're attitude and self esteem can start to improve.",
