  "selftext": "Recently, I fell to a weight that prompted my doctor to put me on a meal plan that my mother has to sign off on each day. If I fail to follow it for two or more days this week, my doctor said she will hospitalise me. She told me her goal was for me to gain weight and normalise my eating patterns, but that seems like a contradiction to me. I\u2019m feeling a bit cheated truth be told, like she\u2019s lying to me. Three meals and three snacks are not normal eating patterns; she admitted herself that I\u2019m supposed to gain weight. I don\u2019t understand why she\u2019s trying to give me more unhealthy eating habits to treat my current ones.  I feel almost like an indignant brat; I want to fight this meal plan as hard as I can. Unfortunately, that\u2019s probably a battle I\u2019d lose. Does anyone have any advice?",

      "body": "Mum of eating disorder sufferer here.  I can hear that you're frustrated with the amount of food you're given, three meals and three snacks a day.  That's normal for someone with an ED to start with, certainly in our experience.  The average person eats meals and snacks, sometimes more, sometimes less, and yes it might not be in the structured way that you are being asked to eat (I say 'asked' rather than 'encouraged' because I understand you don't have much of a choice) but that's because other people don't have EDs, or disordered eating.  You might think you don't come into the ED category or consider that your eating is disordered, but if you haven't been eating very much recently (I don't know) your brain might have gone into a starved state, where it's not really very good at knowing what's right for you.  At this stage all you need to do is follow the plan and as your brain heals, you will probably look back and see things differently.  Trust your Doctor and your mother, at this stage they know better than your brain.  Your meal plan is your medicine.\n\nAlso Eryn17 is right, regular snacks are key.\n\nMy daughter, 5 months into her recovery, says it won't be as scary as it seems (notice she recognises the fear underneath the anger) and she says it's not the end, but the start.",

      "body": "So here\u2019s the thing- 3 meals and 3 snacks a day at set times each isn\u2019t necessarily \u201cnormal\u201d in the sense that someone without an eating disorder stops everything at exactly 12:30 to eat lunch, exactly 8:40 for evening snack, etc. However a person without an eating disorder is likely eating around the same amount of calories every day because they do it without really thinking. You wake up, eat breakfast. You get kinda hungry around 10 AM, eat a snack. Eat lunch, have a snack in the afternoon. Eat dinner, and then have a snack before bed. That\u2019s all super normal. \n\nThe structure isn\u2019t something you have to follow forever. I got stuck on that in treatment a LOT- like \u201cwhen I\u2019m back in the real world I\u2019m not going to halt my life to eat hummus and pretzels at 3 PM, why do it now?\u201d \n\nBecause if I\u2019m hungry and eat hummus and pretzels, I might do it at 2 PM, or 4 PM, but I\u2019m still going to eat it because my body needs it and wants it. \n\nThe structure in recovery is really difficult and I feel for you. I think most of us in here who are in recovery can empathize. But remember that your life doesn\u2019t have to be scheduled meals and snacks forever- as you get used to eating again, you can start to trust your body to know what it needs and when it needs it. And one day you may not need a meal plan because it comes naturally to you. \n\nHang in there bb. I promise it isn\u2019t this hard forever!",

I remember I felt that if I started eating three meals plus snacks I would gain weight, and that those who told me otherwise didn't understand. This mindset is negative and won't help you. I only really started recovering when I realised how I was hurting my mum who has always loved me and wanted the best for me in her imperfect ways. I encourage you to take this as a spiritual journey and look around you, there are people who love you and the only thing they want for you right now is to eat as much as indicated in your plan. If you can't see anyone loving you enough (it happened to me too) it means you still haven't found them, or they have been there all the time and you've never seen them. Trust those who love you and try as hard as possible to eat enough, eat healthy stuff and stay positive. You can do this.",

I don\u2019t know your doctor or you and your situation but a big part of disordered eating is based on needing to control. Telling you to completely let go of all control or go to the hospital would send me through the roof. Do you have a therapist? Can you get another doctors opinion? I do think that is a good amount of food, especially if it\u2019s small meals and snacks, but I really don\u2019t think threatening with the hospital is good. There\u2019s is a difference between, \u201cthis is about the amount of weight we need to see you put back on, this is a good meal plan that can help. If we aren\u2019t seeing improvement, we may need to consider hospitalization\u201d that leaves your progress in your control and is a not threat, it\u2019s a treatment plan. \n\nAgain please don\u2019t attack me I\u2019m only trying to help.

Stuff such as TRF or ADF does not.. \n\nAnd if you're hungry and dropping energy every few hours you're eating wrong and your body is relying on carbohydrates instead of fat for fuel. \n\nI've been doing low carb for months, then keto and now I am getting into carnivore, and e.g. today I haven't eaten for 24+ hours and I feel GREAT with PLENTY of energy and only just now am I starting to get hungry, and that's because my body feeds on my fat stores instead of relying on carbs all day long. \n\nHeck, I just came back from doing exercise because I had energy to burn. \n\nI know I'll get downvoted or blocked, but I am tired of seeing bad advice get reported here all the time, especially that you need to eat all day long all the time.",
