  "selftext": "I'm a clinical psychology Master's student and this summer I'm writing my thesis. Due to the COVID situation, I'm having a really hard time reaching my target group. I hope you guys could help me out!\n\nAre you or do you know someone who is a recovered patient of an eating disorder?\nFor my master thesis, I am looking for participants who have recovered from an eating disorder to fill in a survey about eating disorders, emotion regulation, and shame.\nA link to the survey in English for recovered eating disorder patients can be found here: https://survey.uu.nl/jfe/form/SV_d0DxET9ZQYzRNLT.\n\nYour help would be greatly appreciated :) thank you for your time!",
