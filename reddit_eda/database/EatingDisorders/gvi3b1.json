  "title": "Request: I think my binge eating is turning into restrictive eating",
  "selftext": "So ever since i turned 13 i have suffered from binge eating. This is the first time in months that i have been able to control myself around food and i am honestly so proud of myself. I managed to lose some weight and finally get the body i used to have. The only problem is that i think i might be starving myself now. I never really noticed until my sister pointed out that i only eat one meal a day or have completely stopped eating food that i love. I am so terrified to eat more because im afraid i will start binging out of nowhere again or that i will gain back all the weight. For me it feels like i am eating a lot, but i know im not and i dont know how to get rid of this mindset. I just want to be healthy without having to worry about or being afraid of food all the time, someone please give me advice.",

      "body": "Hey, you definitely aren\u2019t alone here. I went through something similar but flipped, restrictive at first, and then full blown binge. Having a disordered relationship with food can do that; even when your circumstances or your body changes, your mind still doesn\u2019t know how to deal with food in a healthy, sustainable way. With an ED that goes both ways like this, it\u2019s like your brain doesn\u2019t know how to stay in the middle of the road, and instead you find yourself on the shoulder, and you try to fix it, but you can easily over-correct and swerve hard into the shoulder on the other side. I would definitely reach out for help, and talk through this with an ED-specialized therapist if you have access to one and have the means to get therapy. If you don\u2019t have the means, there are resources online for more afforadable therapy options, or you can also look on NEDA, they have a bunch of resources and info that can help you process and work towards healing. Therapy (years of talk therapy with ED specialized therapist, some Yoga therapy, and some work with an ED-specializing nutritional therapist) is what got me through to recovery-ish (ED doesn\u2019t just disappear, it\u2019s something we deal with for life, but there is a healthy middle ground, don\u2019t fear) after years of struggling and being miserable, so show yourself the love you deserve and get the help you need. I promise you won\u2019t regret it. Cheering for you and sending you love and strength. You can do this.",

      "body": "hi !! first off, i wanna say congratulations on feeling that you\u2019ve overcome your binge eating disorder !! growth is growth, and no matter what that should be celebrated. that\u2019s proof that you are stronger than these diseases. but sadly, as i have experienced, there are many other bumps on the road of recovery. i have over-eaten and undereaten at different times in my past. and while that is 200% not healthy and not condonable, i don\u2019t want you to feel like a failure or a fool or anything like that. recovery is not linear.\n\nthe biggest thing i have discovered is this: eating should not be stressful. hearing that you eat one meal a day, but feel you are eating lot, can be a little concerning. with eating disorders, our self-perceptions become skewed and it\u2019s hard to know if we\u2019re being healthy. so to ensure you\u2019re healthy, these are my top 2 recommendations:\n\n1) follow what the dietitians say and make sure you\u2019re eating balanced foods (that means fruit& veggies AND protein AND fats) with enough calories (you don\u2019t have to be super strict on your tracking bc i know that can be stressful. even a ballpark is good, bc if you\u2019re one meal isn\u2019t falling into that category then it can definitely be concerning). I\u2019m a nutrition major, and while I don\u2019t track my calories daily because it stresses me out, I sometimes do when I start to feel I\u2019m over/undereating. I use this calculator (https://www.leighpeele.com/mifflin-st-jeor-calculator) as the mifflin st jeor calorie equation has proven to be the most accurate for health\n\n2) if food/eating is stressful, talk to a professional about it! seriously, these are diseases and have special doctors. you would never try to treat corona virus by yourself. i really recommend going through your school for helpful mental health resources. but if you\u2019re not comfortable with that, then there are a lot of places online and through insurance ! there are support groups and therapists and specialists galore \u2014 all here to help you if you want to seek it\n\nyou deserve to have a body you feel confident in, no matter what it looks like. and you shouldn\u2019t have to question your health constantly. i hope this helps \ud83d\udc97",
