Other sports I used to like included.\nI don't go to nice restaurants, because I'm not skinny enough.\nI don't go on dates with my boyfriend until I'm skinny. He intivtes me to nice places and I decline because I don't deserve having a good time with him. All we do is watching movies at home, because of me.\nI don't dye my hair until I'm skinny.\nI try to avoid the mirror until I lose weight. \nI try to not look at my belly. I feel so disconnected from my body but at the same time I don't.\nI don't even like having a shower or generally I hate to undress myself. My jiggly tummy just makes me sick and I try to avoid looking at myself. \n\nI don't know what else I can do. ",

He was so scary thin and looked so so horrible. And in his own twisted view he still wasn\u2019t skinny enough. So the real problem isn\u2019t your size, it\u2019s the mindset tying your size to your self worth.

It was hard work but I got to a place of body neutrality (not necessarily positivity just accepting that this is the body I\u2019m in) and allowing myself to live my life.

I don\u2019t deserve to suffer while that happens. And the goal isn\u2019t to be skinny like it was in my teens-it is to be healthy so I can better achieve the things I want to do.

Before then, I didn\u2019t struggle with self-confidence\u2014I was just a normal teenage girl, living my life without overthinking how I looked.\n\nThen, one night, I was at a party, and this beautiful girl with the same name as me walked in. She was so skinny, with long hair and a carefree vibe. She stood out\u2014drinking wine straight from the bottle, laughing loudly, and catching everyone\u2019s attention. Every guy wanted to talk to her.\n\nLater, I learned she had a rare disease that required her stomach to be removed, which caused her extreme weight loss. But for some reason\u2014maybe it was her thinness or her free-spirited attitude\u2014I felt an overwhelming sense of jealousy. I wanted to be just like her.\n\nThat night changed everything for me. I became obsessed with my weight. I started buying \u201chealthy\u201d food at the grocery store and refused to eat what my mom cooked. The obsession consumed me. I kept telling myself\n\tOnce I\u2019m pretty and skinny, I\u2019ll take pictures.\n\tOnce I\u2019m pretty and skinny, I\u2019ll wear cute clothes.\n\tOnce I\u2019m pretty and skinny, I\u2019ll finally feel happy.\n\nBut here\u2019s the truth\u2026that day never came. And now 10 years later I can tell you it never will.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve learned is this and I think everyone needs to know \nYou are already enough. You are beautiful as you are, right now. There will never be a perfect moment when you suddenly feel \u201cskinny enough\u201d or \u201cpretty enough.\u201d Waiting for that day is just letting life pass you by.\n\nThe problem was never my weight, it was my mindset. And that\u2019s something you can change.\n\nStart living your life today. Fake it if you have to, but take small steps:\nLook at yourself in the mirror and call yourself beautiful.\nGo on that date.\nDye your hair.\nWear the cute outfit you\u2019ve been saving.\n\nYou might realize that weight was never the issue. What truly matters is how you feel about yourself.\n\nTry meditation or volunteer for something you care about. Surround yourself with things that make you feel alive and fulfilled. Life isn\u2019t something you wait to start, it\u2019s already happening, and you are worthy of living it fully.\n\nYou are enough. You are deserving of all the things you want, just as you are. Being \u201cskinny\u201d won\u2019t change anything unless you shift your mindset first.\n\nLearn to appreciate the person you are today. You\u2019ve got this.",

Working out is hard, dieting is hard, and maintaining them as habits is even harder because your body will keep pulling you in the opposite direction. In order to make those changes, go through those changes and consistently keeping up with them, you need a positive mental outlook, and I don't think talking down to yourself will help. Having a coach verbally abusing you during weight loss only works on TV, in real life, you need to love yourself and treasure yourself enough to make those changes and stick with them.",

Building a healthy relationship with food and your body requires full commitment, emphasis on FULL. It\u2019s deep hard spiritual work and I think OP should look at what the anti-diet movement calls for. First off, body acceptance means being practically aware that there are things with your body you can\u2019t change. Like you may want to be 3 in\u2019 different in height, but you don\u2019t stay home every day trying to make it happen, you don\u2019t dedicate time and energy to the pursuit; you know there\u2019s no scientifically proven way. You may not fit the definition of the beauty standard you have in your head but you don\u2019t let it stop you from enjoying your life.

I accidentally scrolled past a picture of my husband yesterday that he took (body checking) before his first day of treatment for anorexia and I **wept** because he was just bones. He was so scary thin and looked so so horrible. And in his own twisted view he still wasn\u2019t skinny enough. So the real problem isn\u2019t your size, it\u2019s the mindset tying your size to your self worth. That\u2019s where you need to put in the work. \n\nI grew up a chubby kid and diet culture has been in my face all my life. It was hard work but I got to a place of body neutrality (not necessarily positivity just accepting that this is the body I\u2019m in) and allowing myself to live my life. I have had to lose weight in a slow sustainable way for my health, but doing it the right way (proper nutrition and no crash diets) takes a looooooong time. I don\u2019t deserve to suffer while that happens. And the goal isn\u2019t to be skinny like it was in my teens-it is to be healthy so I can better achieve the things I want to do. My body has done great things for me at every size and shape \n\nYou deserve to have good experiences",

Before then, I didn\u2019t struggle with self-confidence\u2014I was just a normal teenage girl, living my life without overthinking how I looked.\n\nThen, one night, I was at a party, and this beautiful girl with the same name as me walked in. She was so skinny, with long hair and a carefree vibe. She stood out\u2014drinking wine straight from the bottle, laughing loudly, and catching everyone\u2019s attention. Every guy wanted to talk to her.\n\nLater, I learned she had a rare disease that required her stomach to be removed, which caused her extreme weight loss. But for some reason\u2014maybe it was her thinness or her free-spirited attitude\u2014I felt an overwhelming sense of jealousy. I wanted to be just like her.\n\nThat night changed everything for me. I became obsessed with my weight. I started buying \u201chealthy\u201d food at the grocery store and refused to eat what my mom cooked. The obsession consumed me. I kept telling myself\n\tOnce I\u2019m pretty and skinny, I\u2019ll take pictures.\n\tOnce I\u2019m pretty and skinny, I\u2019ll wear cute clothes.\n\tOnce I\u2019m pretty and skinny, I\u2019ll finally feel happy.\n\nBut here\u2019s the truth\u2026that day never came. And now 10 years later I can tell you it never will.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve learned is this and I think everyone needs to know \nYou are already enough. You are beautiful as you are, right now. There will never be a perfect moment when you suddenly feel \u201cskinny enough\u201d or \u201cpretty enough.\u201d Waiting for that day is just letting life pass you by.\n\nThe problem was never my weight, it was my mindset. And that\u2019s something you can change.\n\nStart living your life today. Fake it if you have to, but take small steps:\nLook at yourself in the mirror and call yourself beautiful.\nGo on that date.\nDye your hair.\nWear the cute outfit you\u2019ve been saving.\n\nYou might realize that weight was never the issue. What truly matters is how you feel about yourself.\n\nTry meditation or volunteer for something you care about. Surround yourself with things that make you feel alive and fulfilled. Life isn\u2019t something you wait to start, it\u2019s already happening, and you are worthy of living it fully.\n\nYou are enough. You are deserving of all the things you want, just as you are. Being \u201cskinny\u201d won\u2019t change anything unless you shift your mindset first.\n\nLearn to appreciate the person you are today. You\u2019ve got this.",

Though I'm still technically overweight, I am feeling much better mentally and I'm so much kinder to myself. \n\nI hope you are able to find a way to be content and find moments of joy in your life. \u2764\ufe0f",

Right now I can't really imagine to do all these nice things, but many have suggested doing so, so maybe I will give it a try.\n\nAnd also thank you for telling me that you are a therapist and that you struggled yourself. In fact, I study clinical psychology and one day I will be a therapist myself. I felt a huge amout of extra-shame because I felt like \"I'm supposed to be a professional, I can't struggle with this, people won't take me seriously\". That's also why I'm too embarrassed to seek professional help.",

Or perhaps you already have a therapist\u2014in which case, feel free to disregard this suggestion.\n\nIf your finances or insurance allow, I\u2019d really recommend looking into it. I started therapy during the pandemic through a company called BetterHelp, and I connected with an amazing therapist. We met virtually every week for almost two years, and it made such a difference in my life.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t tried therapy yet, it might be worth exploring. There are incredible professionals out there who dedicate their lives to helping people reach better places. Of course, therapy isn\u2019t a magical fix for everything, but it can be a valuable step in the right direction.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that not every therapist will be the right fit, and finding the right one can take time. It\u2019s a bit like dating\u2014once you find someone who clicks, it can be truly transformative.",

          "body": "I can completely relate to what you\u2019re saying. For me, it started in high school, and I remember the exact night it all began. Before then, I didn\u2019t struggle with self-confidence\u2014I was just a normal teenage girl, living my life without overthinking how I looked.\n\nThen, one night, I was at a party, and this beautiful girl with the same name as me walked in. She was so skinny, with long hair and a carefree vibe. She stood out\u2014drinking wine straight from the bottle, laughing loudly, and catching everyone\u2019s attention. Every guy wanted to talk to her.\n\nLater, I learned she had a rare disease that required her stomach to be removed, which caused her extreme weight loss. But for some reason\u2014maybe it was her thinness or her free-spirited attitude\u2014I felt an overwhelming sense of jealousy. I wanted to be just like her.\n\nThat night changed everything for me. I became obsessed with my weight. I started buying \u201chealthy\u201d food at the grocery store and refused to eat what my mom cooked. The obsession consumed me. I kept telling myself\n\tOnce I\u2019m pretty and skinny, I\u2019ll take pictures.\n\tOnce I\u2019m pretty and skinny, I\u2019ll wear cute clothes.\n\tOnce I\u2019m pretty and skinny, I\u2019ll finally feel happy.\n\nBut here\u2019s the truth\u2026that day never came. And now 10 years later I can tell you it never will.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve learned is this and I think everyone needs to know \nYou are already enough. You are beautiful as you are, right now. There will never be a perfect moment when you suddenly feel \u201cskinny enough\u201d or \u201cpretty enough.\u201d Waiting for that day is just letting life pass you by.\n\nThe problem was never my weight, it was my mindset. And that\u2019s something you can change.\n\nStart living your life today. Fake it if you have to, but take small steps:\nLook at yourself in the mirror and call yourself beautiful.\nGo on that date.\nDye your hair.\nWear the cute outfit you\u2019ve been saving.\n\nYou might realize that weight was never the issue. What truly matters is how you feel about yourself.\n\nTry meditation or volunteer for something you care about. Surround yourself with things that make you feel alive and fulfilled. Life isn\u2019t something you wait to start, it\u2019s already happening, and you are worthy of living it fully.\n\nYou are enough. You are deserving of all the things you want, just as you are. Being \u201cskinny\u201d won\u2019t change anything unless you shift your mindset first.\n\nLearn to appreciate the person you are today. You\u2019ve got this.",

          "body": "Thank you for taking your time writing all this. I appreciate it so very much! I almost shed a tear. I've never felt \"good enough\". Reading that hits home. And I also appreciate your own personal story. That was very relatable. I take your suggestions seriously, I will eventually do some stuff in hopes it will fulfill me. But I already feel that it won't be easy. As soon as I see myself, I immediatly fall back into the old mindest. It's a tough fight. It takes really convincing arguments to why I deserve all this. But as many already said...it's in my head. There is no reason why not do to things. And maybe there will never be the day where I will be thin and it breaks my heart. I don't know how to overvome it. But I will try. So, thank you again. And I hope you moved on and are doing better now <3",
