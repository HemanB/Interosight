  "title": "Request: Helping my girlfriend stop calorie counting",
  "selftext": " \n\nI am my girlfriends only support network outside of professionals at  the moment, and a lot of her anxiety around food comes from calories. I  was wondering if anyone knew any resources to help me assist her in  overcoming this, or had any tips or tricks.\n\nI really don't want to be a kind of barrier to her eating what she  wants, or being some sort of food moderator for her. I've looked online  and I've really struggled with finding resources on how to support.\n\nMany Thanks in advance",

      "body": "I wish I had some helpful advice here but I don't other than her seeking professional help, which she is. I would just leave her be and let them help her. She might get snappy and angry at you if you start suggesting not calorie counting. I know I would as I'd be frustrated at you for not understanding I currently need to do it in order to feel safe and ok.",

      "body": "Eating disorder dietitian here. It hard to say without knowing where she is at mentally. If she is still in the beginning of her treatment and struggling with the fact that she has an eating disorder at all, I would just talk to her about how calories are really just a measure of energy, and energy is a good thing. Having energy makes your body feel good so you can enjoy your life! Also talk to her about how it\u2019s not just calories in and calories out. Our bodies are doing things all day that require energy beyond exercise. We need energy to think, to move, to play, to exist. Our blood is pumping all day-this requires energy too! We don\u2019t want that to stop happening! And in reality, there is no formula that can predict exactly how many calories your body needs. Everyone is different. Everyone\u2019s metabolism is different. So she is likely putting in a lot of effort into counting something that isn\u2019t even accurate, and causing herself significant anxiety for no verifiable reason. I could go on forever lol so I\u2019m just going to end this comment with 2 resource recommendations. (Again I don\u2019t know where she is at mentally, but these are often helpful).

      "body": "this may sound silly but maybe try to always eat with her when she's hungry? even if it's just a little snack? it may help her to focus on the fact that you're spending time together and nourishing your bodies, instead of the calories she's consuming?? i'm not rly sure how to help bc i'm in this almost exact situation but as the ed girlfriend. i'm sure she worries about burdening you, but also worries you'll police her food if she talks and cause that to create weight gain. how long have you two been together? it might be harder if this is a fresh relationship because she'll be particularly focused on how you perceive her",

It\u2019s a lot easier to forget about calories when I\u2019m eating with loved ones. Another thing that has helped is giving myself one day a week to eat something that I wouldn\u2019t normally eat on top of what I normally eat. So last summer, every Thursday I would eat some ice cream and just seeing that the only difference was that I enjoyed it and not that it was affecting my weight (it was kinda making up for me not eating enough throughout the rest of the week) really really helped my mental health and helped me to start eating more and even start gaining weight eventually.",
