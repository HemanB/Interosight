  "selftext": "For years I have been struggling on and off with Binge and purge cycles. Yesterday, I had some tooth pain and I can\u2019t believe what I saw. \nI knew I had dental issues but not this bad. \n\nOn 6-12 of my teeth, there is black lining the ridges in my teeth. All of my molars are YELLOW despite brushing every day. Where I had previously had one filling, there is black on the filling. \n\nWhen I had complained about tooth pain and black on my teeth before, the dentists said it was nothing. It has been one year. One year ago, I had a little black spot on my tooth, now most of my teeth have black on them. \n\nPurging is a dangerous game. Please do not brush your teeth immediately after a purge. Please go to the dentist more than once a year if you have purging habits. \n\nPlease don\u2019t let your teeth become black like mine.",

But that failed because I was still purging...so it has been a little over a year and this is the longest that I have gone without purging.  So I decided to buy the clip on veneers.  Until, I am able to afford composite veneers.  I work with the disadvantaged youth.  The kids have been nicer to me, than the adults and higher ups at my job.  I understand with the teeth that I have.  Makes it look like I am a drug addict but I am ashamed to smile, speak to someone in their eyes.  I speak lowly and sometimes you just can't understand me.  I hate it.  I am praying that my impression kit comes soon and I do them correctly.  Because, you can't get promoted with bad teeth.  I want my confidence back.  I want to be able to laugh fully again without covering up my mouth.  I want to be able to look people in to their eyes... \ud83d\ude1e life is hard",

          "body": "I can empathize with you on every level here \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc I began purging regularly around age 19 (I\u2019m 33 now), and the toll it has taken on my teeth is worse than any other body part. Within three years of purging, my enamel was completely eroded from all of my teeth. Within 10 years, my two front top teeth began chipping and wearing down. Shortly after that, the surrounding teeth became translucent, chipped in small spots, and formed sensitive spots/cavities. A week ago, I had to have my top row of teeth capped with crowns. The entire process cost roughly $20,000. I cannot express how life changing get this procedure done has been. My smile became a public announcement that \u2018I\u2019m a bulimic.\u2019 It caused me so much shame and embarrassment, turned me into a reclusive person, and kept me from showing my emotions (didn\u2019t want to smile fully, avoided laughing, avoided conversations with strangers, etc.). \nIt\u2019s bothered me for years that dental issues are not talked about enough in bulimia education and treatment. It completely damages your self-esteem and depletes your energy. I want everyone out there to know how difficult the last ten years have been due to my bulimia. My damaged teeth were just a representation of my mental health over time - fractured, hidden, helpless. I also wish I had shown my body more kindness and gentleness, instead of continually thinking, \u2018I\u2019ll worry about my teeth (or heart or bones or brain) later.\u2019 Later does not come. Do not leave some future version of yourself in charge of your recovery. She doesn\u2019t exist. You have to be her now. \nAll the love to anyone going through this struggle. You\u2019re beautiful, simply because you are. Not because of your smile, your weight, your hair\u2026 SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU ARE.",
