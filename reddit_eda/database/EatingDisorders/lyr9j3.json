  "title": "Request: Question post: How do I balance a doctor's prescription of exercise for me with my wife's recovery?",
  "selftext": "So title basically says it all, I have ADHD and my doctor prefers that I increase exercise instead of my dose of adderall. How do I balance that need with the fact that exercise triggers my wife's eating disorder? It's not like I can hide it from her. I have seen her grow and recover so much in the past year, I don't want her to lose any progress on my behalf.\n\nFeel free to edit this as you see fit, I'm certainly no expert in verbiage around ED.",

      "body": "Its extremely loving of you to not want to trigger her.\n\nYou absolutely need to take care of your health tho too. I would have an honest and open conversation with her. \n\nAs long as you aren't exercising around her she will need to work through, cope and process any feelings or triggering thoughts regarding your exercising. If you are exercising outside or at a gym she wont see it. If you do it at your place you can either work out a schedule with her etc\n\nShe alone is responsible for her health. I say that as someone who struggles with these things and also has a substance abuse issue. You can and should be considerate and not talk about it with her or do it right in front of her but ultimately she has to be responsible for not falling back into those old patterns of behaviors",

Go enjoy your workouts, come home feeling good, shower and move on with your day.  I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be cautious not to make it a big deal or whatever, and she will be okay.",

If you don't, you can't care for your wife.\n\nSorry, does she know about this prescription/ advice? Obviously don't hide it from her. Explain it to her. Talk/discuss it. Ask her how that makes her feel.",
