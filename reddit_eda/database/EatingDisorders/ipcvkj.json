  "title": "Request: ED where you only consume unhealthy things?",
  "selftext": "I have a friend who refuses to stick to anything remotely resembling a balanced diet. Her whole life she has only consumed junk food (McDonald\u2019s, bags of chips, energy drinks, etc) but not in large quantities. She\u2019s definitely at a daily caloric deficit. She constantly skips meals and waits until she is essentially passing out and then eats some old crackers or goes and gets a slice of pizza. She\u2019s lactose intolerant but the only protein she will consume is dairy even though she feels awful every time she eats it. \n\nOne time she was over at my parent\u2019s house and my mom made us turkey burgers with sweet potato fries and salad and she refused to eat it- nearly crying at the table with anxiety. It\u2019s like healthy/substantial food scares her? \n\nShe has also chain smoked cigarettes indoors all day every day for over 15 years. \n\nAny clue what this is? She has clinical depression and anxiety but hasn\u2019t always. She\u2019s beginning to have a myriad of mental and physical health problems due to her lifestyle.",

      "body": "Obviously could be different for her, but for me traditionally \"healthy\" food is terrifying because it fills me up a lot more, plus my stomach seems to struggle to digest it. If I have a bar of chocolate I can be hungry again and feel empty again within an hour, so I don't tend to panic as much (I think some deep part of my brain just associates fullness with danger and weight gain, even though I know that's not the case). Whereas if I have a balanced meal I'll be full for hours, get tons of cramping and pain and bloating (probably because I never trained my body to get used to that food out of fear, so it's just got worse). It probably meets the criteria for AFRID?",

I used to be kinda like that where I only consume junk food because those are the only food I really enjoy and feel like they\u2019re \u201cworth the calorie\u201d even though i feel awful all the time. Used to never eat veggies because even though i know they\u2019re less calories, I don\u2019t really like them so in my mind it\u2019s like it\u2019s not even worth the calories. Idk if there\u2019s a particular category for that ED so usually people just lump all the other ones into EDNOS. Sorry if this wasn\u2019t helpful",
