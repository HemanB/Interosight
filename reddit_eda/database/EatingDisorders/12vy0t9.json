Unhealthy and expensive\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nEveryday I hear the same thing, \"That's all you're going to eat?\" \"Does that fill you up?\"\n\nIt's so damn triggering talking about what I eat everyday. I want to just tell them to mind their business, but I don't want to be mean. I'm happy eating my fruit and I don't know why it has to be the topic of conversation everyday.\n\n I'm glad that I'm allowing myself to eat, and that's the honest truth.",

Which I would argue, that fast food IS more unhealthy, but that being said, you can\u2019t expect people to not say anything. It was bound to happen and you know it, so you should simply ask them to stop politely if it\u2019s bothering you. Don\u2019t forget to say thank you for their concern. \n\nIf you express your feelings in any other way towards your coworkers (such as anger), which is based only on the information you have given. It would only prove you\u201dre immature, self-involved, and kinda rude. Lastly, no. Your disorder is not an excuse to treat people poorly or judge others for their own eating choices.",
