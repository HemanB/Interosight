  "selftext": "Hi \n\nThis is my first time posting here, thanks all for stopping by. \n\nI am a girl who\u2019s been struggling with ED for many years, I started with AN and currently experiencing the opposite type. I was hospitalised and treated by therapist. None of those really helped. I also don\u2019t have any support group. I am trying to get a better control of my life but with covid-19, I feel a little different. I am still struggling with bulimia but seeing how people are stocking up on food and thinking about how precious food are right now makes me feel guilty for wasting food (because of bulimia). I feel so bad and guilty whenever I think about. Like I hate myself but at same time I can\u2019t just change even if I want to..... I am so torn... \n\nAny advice or even supportive comment is greatly appreciated\n\nThank you so much \n\nHope everyone stays safe!",

      "body": "Hi there, I\u2019m also female and I\u2019ve been struggling with bulimia for over two years now. I totally get your guilt and it\u2019s okay to feel that way. For me, whenever I\u2019m home I tend to snack constantly and I\u2019ll binge eat until I\u2019m almost in pain and then barf it all out immediately. Over the years I\u2019ve learned a few things about my triggers that might help you so I\u2019ll share. The first thing for me is the feeling of fullness. Then \u201cbad foods\u201d. I don\u2019t feel as strong a need to purge after eating a salad whereas if I\u2019ve eaten four donuts ... you know.\n\nThe things that are especially hard for me are living with another person, what\u2019s your living situation like? When I lived alone I could control the foods in my environment and the temptations faded a little, I also did the best I could to get out of the house when I felt an urge to binge eat (obviously irrelevant right now). It\u2019s also incredible hard to be home all day where temptation lies for me.\n\nIt sounds to me like you are maybe less binge and purge and more just purge? \nOne thing that helps me is every morning I wake up and I write in a journal how I\u2019m feeling about food that day and my goals... some days I meet them and some I don\u2019t but it\u2019s important to get all your thoughts down on paper because it gives us a moment to breathe between our swirling conscious. Perhaps writing your guilt down can help assuage it?\nAlso I am close to thirty days into personal recovery (no purging) and I honestly owe a lot of it to the podcast \u201ceating disorder recovery podcast\u201d with doctor Janean Anderson. She is excellent and it\u2019s basically like free therapy, maybe give that a listen. Also one of the most important things is to know that you are amazing! Having an eating disorder chips away at us and people don\u2019t realize the pain that comes with having to face it three meals or more a day. Give yourself some love honestly. Just because other people are suffering out there doesn\u2019t diminish your pain at all. Be kind to yourself and please stay healthy. If you want to pm me in always happy to talk to tother people about this. I\u2019ve spent years fighting an invisible disorder and my own brain, and I know guilt can be devastating.",

      "body": "I just want to say I totally relate. I have *never* kept food in my house beyond my I\u2019m immediate needs because it triggers all sorts of stuff. Now I suddenly need to have a few weeks of food at a time in my kitchen, and nothing but time stuck in my house thinking about it.\n\nIt\u2019s really helping me appreciate how much I want/need to work on my ED issues more when this is all over. I\u2019ve been living like this for well over a decade after getting over the hump where the \u2018worst\u2019 of my symptoms were in check.\n\nI have been coping as much as I can via the \u2018self parenting\u2019 approach. It may sound silly to some but it has worked wonders for me in other parts of my life. I basically try self talk where I address myself as patiently and loving as possible (like you would a child) and tell myself \u2018no sweetie- it\u2019s not time to eat yet. What do you really need right now?\u2019. And try to \u2018hear\u2019 myself feel whatever it is that is making me turn to the temptation to binge. Am I anxious? Bored? Sad? Do I need some sort of self care? Do I need attention from a loved one?\n\nThis ritual seems to help me a bit, if nothing else to remind myself over and over again \u2018you are tempted to binge. But what do you really need?\u2019 to keep driving home the understanding that I am using food to control/fill a void/check out.",

      "body": "I\u2019m really struggling with how much food we have in the house because we\u2019re shopping less frequently (not hoarding tho) and usually I buy food every couple days to avoid the situation, or mitigate potential damage should I start bingeing. It\u2019s making me insane and actually putting me off food altogether. I\u2019m scared at how wack my schedule is and how little/ bad I\u2019m eating (like I had three bowls of Cheerios today and some green juice???) I guess it\u2019s related. \nI\u2019m really trying to have a list for about five days worth of food when I go to the store, and plan my meals (even though this makes me feel trapped, it\u2019s better than the alternative) and then just go in and out as quick as possible without really looking at anyone else\u2019s cart. \nI also try call someone at meal time so I\u2019m distracted and they can check I\u2019m eating and remind me if it\u2019s not enough or whatever. Don\u2019t know if this helps you (I find just reading about people with similar stories is enough sometimes, even if the advice doesn\u2019t suit me)\nStay safe x",

      "body": ". I felt this way before the pandemic as well but especially during it because it\u2019s hard not to binge when I\u2019m home all day.  I sadly don\u2019t really know how to stop the guilt. I\u2019ve seen people before suggest writing down feelings as a you feel like a binge is about to begin or trying to engage in another activity you enjoy (maybe even with family if you\u2019re able to do so). Even if those things don\u2019t help, I really do hope you manage to stay strong and safe and aren\u2019t hard on yourself; just because you feel guilty for \u201cwasting food\u201d doesn\u2019t make you bad or selfish :(",

      "body": "I was summoned home to my parents house and my parents have a huge pantry stocked full of food. Back in my apartment, my cupboards and fridge are intentionally bare except for a small amount of food that fits my meal plan. I JUST got discharged from PHP. \n\nWith all this food around I\u2019ve been B/Ping like crazy and I feel like garbage emotionally and physically. Idk I just feel your pain and idk what to do about it except to experience and accept all my feelings. Times are tough and I think a lot of disorders will be heightened, and this symptom increase doesn\u2019t have to be forever. We will make it through :) \nCourse it still feels like total shit.\n\nTLDR: I know how you feel, I think a lot of us are struggling with you\u2014it doesn\u2019t erase the work we\u2019ve done. Big hugs and hope we can get out of this awful thing.",
