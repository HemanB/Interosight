  "title": "Why is nobody taking binge eating disorder serious?",
  "selftext": "\"nobody\" might be an exaggeration. But ive struggled with disordered eating for half a decade now and almost nobody took me seriously when i was obese. People with overweight get judged more, treated bad even by doctors (if i had a cold, it was the weight according to the doctor.) Everyone knows anorexia and bulimia but so many people say and think being obese is just someone who was no self control (aka lazy) but the second someone is anorexic, they are ill and treated like they have a real problem. When i was obese, people told me to just eat less and stop. Why does nobody get that no eating disorder comes from laziness or no self controll/respect?",

For many, it's a response to overwhelming emotions, pain, unmet needs, or even long histories of restriction and body criticism - sometimes coming from professionals themselves.\n\nIt\u2019s hard when you\u2019re hurting and not being believed.

There\u2019s a lot of \u201cjust have some self control and stop eating so much\u201d which is so so so harmful. BUT there are doctors out there who\u2019ll take you seriously and have compassion. I\u2019m now back into a restrictive time in my life but it was so comforting having a therapist who was compassionate and understanding of my binge eating. They\u2019re out there. And it can be hard to share your ED with people in your life because of the shame, but if there are people you feel you can trust to be supportive, it can really help to let them know what you\u2019re struggling with. But ultimately it\u2019s just fatphobia and ignorance about mental health.",

Disordered eating is something that can be fixed with lifestyle changes. Eating disorders take so much more to recover from. And recover is a general term. I know multiple people who's \"recovery\" is an act of significant self restraint every single day (both for restrictive disorders and overeating). Normal people will never understand how hard we have to try. And its not that anyone ever wants to be fat the way people want to be skinny, its that there's hormone imbalance, or mental health disorders, or a lack of supportive environments. Restrictive disorders are \"caused by society and social pressures\". Theres no societal pressure to be fat, therefore its fake.",
