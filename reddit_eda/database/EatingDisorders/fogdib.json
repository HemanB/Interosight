  "selftext": "(F 20) about a month or so ago i told my mom about my ed bulimia, ever since then she wont stop mentioning in front of my friends or her friends or even just at home in like a loud manner when my sister and father are there, everytime she sees me eating she goes \"thats why you throw up so much, stop eating in such large quantity\" or she goes \"ik how you think, you eat alot and then you feel guilty so you throw up, stop eating alot in the first place\" she does it when ever she sees me next to food or eating or just having just finished it, or she makes stupid senseless jokes about it infront of people WHO SHOULD NOT KNOW ABOUT IT. it makes me regret ever telling her about it when i broke down before and blurted it out, it makes me feel like i dont want to ever eat infront of her or eat in general, i dont restrict but this is getting on my nerves and i hate it i hate it i hate it. she doesn't understand and she never will.",

That does not help you, in fact it could very well make things much worse for you. She needs to be educated about what eating disorders actually are, food is only the tip of the iceberg.

I also don\u2019t have a support network in my family as they\u2019re all misinformed and refuse to educate themselves, believing that they know the answers already.\n\nOne of the other commenters suggested these comments from your Mum could be emotional abuse - it is. The problem is that I imagine, when pressed, she would feel entirely justified in making the comments and be operating from a self-righteous position of \u201cI\u2019m trying to help.\u201d \n\nIf there are other people in your network that you trust who can talk to her alone and get her to understand that her comments are damaging and unhelpful then definitely leverage these trusted people. If not, please know that her reaction and comments reflect on who *she* is as a person and actually have nothing to do with you. Your mum is a product of her own upbringing and has her own demons to battle. Unfortunately, she\u2019s been brought up to believe that emotionally abusing others in the name of \u201chealth\u201d is acceptable, without actually understanding one bit about what healthy looks like. This is rife in society as I\u2019m sure you know - everyone has an opinion.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult at first but perhaps next time she does this behaviour try to distance yourself from the words/emotions she\u2019s pushing towards you and just watch her with curiosity - where is this coming from? Why does she feel such a need to say what she\u2019s saying? Why is she telling your business to everyone and what does she gain by doing so? Is she trying to shame you into conforming to her standards of behaviour? What kind of person employs shame as a tactic against the people they\u2019re supposed to love? Does she feel out of control? Is she scared for your wellbeing? Is she worried about her image and being seen as a \u201cbad mother\u201d by other people, as if your ED is all about her?\n\nI understand this is going to bring up some very painful emotions/memories for you if you start to analyse your true reality, but doing so may give you more clarity and a calmer mind.\n\nBest of luck to you. Be kind to yourself as best you can.",

      "body": "Before it really set in. I tried to bring it up or ask for help from specific friends. Now they constantly set off my paranoia alarm. Example. \n\nLast night before our state got the lockdown notice. I went over to their house. I forgot my jacket, because after work was incredibly sunny, warm and made me feel incredible. But it took me too long to get out of the house. So the half hour drive saw the temp drop pretty fast. So now that must've freaked them out or (and I swear I heard them whisper this, \"he's just doing it for attention\") they thought I was trying to obvious or something. Because they proceeded to freeze me out until I was shivering inside the house. Sitting watching Scooby doo on Netflix. With my group of friends that I love. One stood by the french door with it cracked. I'm sitting two feet away. I know what he's doing. I know what he wants me to do. To go grab a blanket.\n\n\n\n>> accidentally turned this into a rant so I just split it. But this was really cathartic for me and if I don't keep it as a reply. I won't be able to use this to revisit and rethink about this <<\n\n\n\n But why can't I enjoy ONE FRIGGIN NIGHT with my friends in normality?? I'm sorry. I literally didn't think of a jacket cuz of how warm it is. I have a long sleeve button and a short sleeve under that. Leave me alone. You don't want to talk about it. Because whenever I bring it up or try to talk about issues. You give me looks of incredulity or straight nothing. I hear the whispers and the scathing, (literal) behind the back, remarks. I get you're upset with me. But I'm just as upset with myself. I'm hurting you guys and I need help, but it's hard when I don't want it this much. But no one wants to talk about it anyways even though I've tried to. So why keep bothering when you keep doing things like this? My back hurt from trying to not shiver. Why can't I sit inside a house without a blanket for once? It wasn't even that cold before you opened the door. It was comfortable. I even ate the last slice of pizza you guys left on the counter you said I could have. So why would you do this to me? I can't deal with trying to figure out if what I am paranoid about with you guys is just my wrong way of thinking or actual events, when you guy's keep doing this. Either talk about it. Or don't. But the whispering is destroying me. And I don't have the courage to say anything because I know they think I'm a fake, and when I constantly feel like a fake. It just makes me feel more miserable when I can't eat. Or feel shitty while eating. Or losing control when I am too hurt and sad to protect myself from the horrifically disturbing binges.\n\n\nBut I'm trying. I'm avoiding any of the purge cravings. I'm trying to be careful. But I'm one, broken, simple person. I can't police myself 24/7. I'm alone and came to you. I came to my closest friends and the only people I use to feel comfortable around. Now I'm miserable and I try to engage again. I try to smile and laugh realistically. But the misery turns to melancholy and that turns into a different me. The me I am still trying desperately to relearn control over. \n\nEnd rant. \n\nI'm so so sorry. But it seems like your post got some feelings and words I didn't want to voice, out. So thank you and I'm sorry that your seek of help turned so sour as well. It's hard, especially when sometimes you can understand that maybe they're trying to to do this as a way to help",

My mother is also constantly criticizing and invalidating me, I would never speak to her about my problems because I am sure that she would use it to hurt me. I guess there is a reason why we are using dysfunctional coping mechanisms like restricting or purging, right? You are not alone, must of us suffer from emotionally abusive parents and can relate. I hope that you can find some comfort in this community and use it as a mental shield. Right now I am stuck in quarantine with my mother, my dad is away most time of the day working and she is making every encounter hell but I keep telling myself that this is not about me, this is an expression of her own issues with herself and she doesn\u2019t know any better, growing up with serious abuse herself. No matter what she says, I tell myself to not take it serious and don\u2019t engage in a discussion that can\u2019t be won. It helps a bit.",

You know you're so much more than bulima, but the fact remains that part of who you are is bulimic.  Maybe talking about it more might help?

Only certain conversations can be had with certain friends, which I again had to learn over what their responses were like. \nOne day you won\u2019t be living with your mom and having to listen to her weird unhelpful snarky comments.
