      "body": "For me personally (4 years recovered) the voice doesn't completely totally go away, but it's not far off it. When you stop giving fo us and importance to those thoughts, over time, they become less prominent until you don't even hear them anymore. I never thought that I would ever not know how many calories a food item contains or not be able to work out what my calories intake was in a day but I can honestly tell you I have absolutely no idea what it is now and it is fuxking liberating! Occasionally if I'm looking at two different foods and trying to choose, the Boise says \"go for the lower calorie\". I get myself in check, remember that I have a healthy and balanced diet and don't need to worry about the difference of 100 calories in one random day, and get whichever one I damn well please.\n\nSo, no the voice doesn't entirely disappear, but you can make it almost disappear and what remains is totally negligible :) ",

      "body": "There\u2019s a saying about brains that I think about a lot: neurons that fire together, wire together (I know the comma\u2019s not grammatically correct but it helps with the flow). That means that the associations we make end up cementing the more we make them. It\u2019s why languages are easy to learn at a very young age; we\u2019re not fighting years of neural chains telling us linguistic rules we\u2019ve always known.\n\nAll this is to say, yes, that inner voice can be silenced. But it will take time, and practice. Try not to feed it when it starts; if you can cut it off before it spirals into rumination, you\u2019re on your way. Every time you reject it, you\u2019re forming new neural pathways that will make it just a tiiiiiny bit easier to reject the next time. Eventually, those pathways will be stronger than the ones making the inner voice. ",
