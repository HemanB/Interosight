  "selftext": "I have been doing so well with recovery for so long. With pregnancy and trying to be a role model for my daughter I have been so health focused rather than focused on how I looked. Tonight while eating dinner (it was taco night) my husband said as I was rolling up my taco \u201cWow you really stuffed it.\u201d It was not ideal but I moved past it and took a bite. He then says Well when you\u2019re hungry, you\u2019re hungry.\u201d and I completely shut down. In front of my daughter too. I didn\u2019t want her to see me like that. I couldn\u2019t finish dinner. And now I\u2019m just laying in bed crying.\n\nI don\u2019t know how to move past this. He\u2019s apologized profusely. I know he didn\u2019t mean unwell, but I\u2019m so confused as to why he would say that when he\u2019s well aware of my ED and my history. How do I work through this?",

If I want to at the time. I  ask him to not make those comments and he seems to get it. Sometimes I let it go and realize that is a reminder that I l am not fully recovered yet and I use that to keep pushing myself.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you were upset. I know that feeling all too well. Good luck. Maybe talk to your husband when you are calmer and own your own mood, but explain how you felt. Xo",
