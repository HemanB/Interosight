  "title": "Getting myself to eat more food",
  "selftext": "I (17F) have been struggling with disordered eating habits for several years. Lately, though, I've become more obsessed than ever with eating as little as possible, which has made me feel faint, extremely hungry, and weak. I don't have access to much external support for dealing with food issues right now and am still emotionally very much in the throes of this disorder, but I can see that I am not able to function on this amount of food and I'd like to start eating a more normal amount. However, every time I start to eat more food / food that seems \"fattening\", I panic and severely undereat the next day. I know I will not gain weight if I eat some more (I am losing pretty rapidly), but the idea that I am eating too many calories makes me feel horribly guilty. Does anyone have any suggestions on how I could get myself to a safer food intake without feeling so bad about it?",

The obsession with food is natural as I\u2019ve been told in all my treatment and research as your body and mind actually require nourishment. Also, I get faint and much more emotional when I\u2019m not eating enough even though I trick myself as well thinking I\u2019m doing good things\u2026etc. Perhaps you are feeling guilty about something else? Eating for me has become the main relationship I have during my day, it makes me sad and I also feel guilty for eating more than my food rules allow. So I\u2019m sorry and I feel for and with you. Again, my experience I hope helps you feel less alone. I don\u2019t feel good enough without my ED and therefore my motivation is to earn the feeling of not feeling intrinsically unworthy and guilty.

Obviously you don\u2019t have to go that far if you don\u2019t want to but I found myself looking more at what\u2019s in the food rather than the calories/fat/sugar/etc. My brain would get it\u2019s satisfaction by looking at the nutrition label and I wouldn\u2019t feel AS guilty. Im still not like 100% but that\u2019s at least what\u2019s helped me lol",
