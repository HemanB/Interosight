  "selftext": "Hello all, maybe this isn't the \"perfect\" subreddit for this, but knowing my history with EDs and eating, I thought that this would be the appropriate place to ask.\n\nSo, I have been having problems with EDs since I was around 14 (now I'm almost 21) because my mother kept saying I had to lose X amount of weight before people could consider me pretty or date-able and other things not so nice.\n\nI have been battling with over eating and under eating, going from binging to starving to binging again, never really settling for normal eating habits, gaining and losing weight like a yo-yo even if I'm supposed to be an adult now and have found my \"adult weight\".\n\nThe problem is that I \"knew\" those phases: I knew that while starving myself I would keep on thinking about what food I would be allowed the following day, and I knew that when I was binging I would obsess over the food I could not eat while starving. Even if I was completely out of control, it felt like I had control over what I was eating. I was eating because I wanted, I wasn't eating because I didn't want, even if the reasons behind it were completely nonsensical and related to something I could not control. It was familiar, going from one phase to the other.\n\nHowever, as things are now, I just have no interest in food. I eat what mother cooks for dinner and even then it's difficult to chew and swallow, and I leave most of the meal in my plate. I recognize it doesn't taste bad, but I have absolutely no interest in it. Even things I would eat when I was on campus for college because I loved them, now don't seem appealing in the least.\n\nWhen I get hungry, I still go to the kitchen to look at what is in the fridge and pantry, but there's nothing that seems to be interesting enough for me to eat, so I go back to doing whatever I was doing before.\n\nHas this happened to anybody else? It's just so weird I don't know what to do with it.",

      "body": "Yes, this happened to me. For a while I lost interest in food - no obsessing over what I would eat next, food wasn\u2019t hitting the spot in my brain that makes me feel good. I was suddenly eating for sustenance and stopping when I was satiated, and just didn\u2019t feel as hungry.\n\nI spoke to my therapist and actually wondered if this is how people without eating disorders feel all the time, that food is tasty but not obsessing over it, no compulsion to binge and being able to stop eating when they want. \n\nI went back to normal (my normal) after a few weeks, I think it was probably just a chemical thing in my brain that shifted. I miss it sometimes but not always.",

Maybe because I\u2019m grieving a death, but food just doesn\u2019t taste like how I remember it and I can\u2019t be bothered to eat anymore. The weird thing is, even though the idea of eating makes me sick, I\u2019ve still binged/purged unnecessarily.",

      "body": "Yes I\u2019m definitely like this. Once I stopped obsessing over food and thinking about it all the time, it almost never crossed my mind. I try to not force myself to eat unless I start dropping weight because forcing myself to finish meals brings me back to my old binge purge or restrict thoughts. I will give you the advice my doctor gave me when this happened below!\n\nI\u2019m guessing with quarantine you\u2019re not moving around as much. This could be a huge reason. During recovery I got into lifting and would eat a lot because I was hungry. When my work schedule got crazy and I didn\u2019t have time to lift, my appetite totally fell off. But I tried not to freak because I knew my body needed less. If you\u2019re cooped up in the house all day you won\u2019t be as hungry because your body won\u2019t need as much vs when you\u2019re out and about. \n\nI would say to listen to your body. As long as you know it\u2019s your body telling you youre not as hungry and not your brain. The advice my doctor gave when I started losing weight from not eating enough was to try and sneak in more protein, like add some protein to a morning smoothie. And to shoot for at least 2 meals per day. I have found that eating breakfast regulates my eating better. \n\nSo my advice would be to try and eat something for breakfast, try to sneak in more protein, and to try and get at least two meals per day. If you\u2019re full you don\u2019t need to force yourself to finish it. In my personal experience, forcing myself to finish meals would lead me back into my binging and restricting mind set.",

      "body": "It sucks but you just have to eat anyway. I'm recovered(ish) but still struggle sometimes with just not wanting to eat anything. For me what worked is starting with either something small, and once you have that small thing you realize how hungry you are, or have something rather packed. I recommend single serve peanut butter cups and then some crackers or something (personally a sucker for Cheez-Its). If you have any more questions or need clarification just ask!!",

      "body": "I have a history of anorexia and bulimia, but consider myself recovered, have maintained a healthy weight, and haven\u2019t had disordered thoughts about food for approximately 4 years. \n\nThe same thing has been happening to me the last couple of weeks. No interest in food and rarely hungry. When I do feel hungry, I\u2019ll make something that looks delicious, but start to feel full and uncomfortable after a couple of bites and lose interest in eating. I\u2019m not sure why. \n\nEdit: Just to mention this is a stark contrast to when I was eating disordered. At that time I would fixate on food and what I would be able to eat. I was fascinated and terrified by it. \n\nI\u2019ve been stuck out of my country of residence for the last couple of months due to coronavirus border closures. Maybe it has to do with stress or generally being bored without my routine or friends. I try to be happy during the days, but I think it has to do with underlying unhappiness. \n\nI hope you find interest in food again quickly! Perhaps try changing up your routine, exercise has been helping me keep up my mood because I know it\u2019s easy for myself to fall into depression. We\u2019re going through a stressful time now and while you might not realize you\u2019re stressed, there\u2019s a good chance you might be more burdened than you think.",
