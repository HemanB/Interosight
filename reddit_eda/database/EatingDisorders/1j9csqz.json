  "selftext": "I\u2019m 24 and living at home finishing up school after getting out of treatment, and my mom is a pretty stereotypical eating disordered mom (crossfit, ozempic, restriction, etc \ud83d\ude2d)\n\nThis evening, after her fourth comment of the day on my food, for some reason, I just had HAD IT with her. I told her I don\u2019t want to hear her comments anymore. She tried to start a fight with me, undermine my clinical team, and shame me into backing down, but I just maintained calm and firm.\n\nI\u2019m definitely second guessing the whole thing (she\u2019s right about my food, it IS trash, I AM disgusting, etc), but I\u2019m trying to fight through the anxiety and shame I\u2019m feeling and make my damned French toast because I like it and I want it.",

Unfortunately it\u2019s one of the only things I eat, so that thinking set in that she\u2019s probably right and I can\u2019t have it anymore.  What seems like nothing is really a big deal (and I caved this morning) and just finished my oatmeal to try and fight back the thoughts.",
