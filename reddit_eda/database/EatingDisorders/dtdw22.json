  "selftext": "Ok let me start off by saying I don't think anything I feel is his fault. Everything I think  is my responsibility. But.\n\nEverything he has ever said about what he likes is about really skinny women. And I can't help but compare myself to the women that he shows me that he finds attractive and the things he finds attractive. And now at every turn I see women skinnier than me, dressing more provocative than me, acting more ditsy than me. Essentially acting like many of the porn stars he has mentioned. But I'm not that. And I know he loves me. But I also know the part of him he can't control is attracted to this thing that I'm not. And it triggers me. Walking, At work, at the grocery store, In line at a random fucking place. Does anyone else feel this?",

If you get called ugly, you dont blame yourself, it's the other person being hurtful, right? \nIt sounds like they're comparing you :( \nMaybe I'm overanalyzing BUT\ngive me a good, solid reason as to the purpose of telling your SO body preference you dont have? What good can come from it? \nIf not, I stand by my comment lol\nEdit- elaborated to clear the word 'that'",

Because it started with little comments like this and then they became more biting. And cruel. Eventually he refused to sleep with me and eventually cheated many times. When confronted about it his words were \"well maybe if you were a more attractive weight I wouldn't have needed to cheat.\" I blamed myself and my weight for years, and that insecurity still rears its ugly head now and then and it just sucks.\n\n You deserve more than being compared to people who are impossible to emulate.\n\nThat relationship turned me into a shell of a person and it still takes effort not to slip back into purging to try and make the pounds go away. But I deserved better and so do you. All of you do.",

      "body": "From one who's been in the shoes of the SO here, and deals with ED tendencies personally, they seem to have an unhealthy relationship with physical attraction in romantic relationships. Mentioning preferences in females directly to their SO is particularly telling.\n\nI don't like to tell people how to act, but you need to mention how it hurts you at the minimum. They likely don't know it hurts you. It took a while for me to realize it in my previous relationship. Gently ask them why they point out other females.\n\nThe reason I'm so emphatic about this regards the other issues it can lead to. Low self-worth, and body dysmorphic disorder among others. ED is already tough without these.\n\nFor now please keep in mind that your self-worth should not be gauged based off of any metric of beauty. I know this won't solve the issues, but it's something important to keep in mind that is easy to forget when dealing with the ED.\n\nI really wish you and your SO the best.",
