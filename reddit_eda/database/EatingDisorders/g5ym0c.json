  "title": "Request: My post request: nightly binge eating during quarantine",
  "selftext": "This has always been an issue for me. Realistically it is just as possible all day long but I think I have more distractions/people around.\n\nI lost a ton of weight when I moved in with my boyfriend two years ago because I didn\u2019t binge around him. (I was with him for a full year as a heavier human before this) I would never let him see/gain awareness of that part of my life. He used to think I was anorexic because I ended up so thin so rapidly.\n\nWell we are living apart now and I started binging again non stop. Always at night. Usually sweets. I\u2019m never hungry. I make myself so sick that I want to throw up all the way into the next day (and then I do it all over again anyway).\n\nI\u2019ve put on so much weight and am so depressed, ashamed, and unsure of what to do. It\u2019s gotten worse since quarantine because I\u2019m not out doing my social exercise groups around town.\n\nI\u2019m aware of the problem and I\u2019m SO SICK with myself that I can\u2019t fathom wanting to go through it again tomorrow....and yet I know I will.\n\nHow have you all coped with this? I know for a fact that living with my boyfriend again would immediately fix it. But...not really you know? I\u2019d still have the same mindset, I just hide it when others are around. How do I cope with being alone I guess....",

      "body": "I used to be in a place like this where I struggled with bingeing, I noticed that I would go through these emotional waves (and they would vary from extreme sadness, to anxiety, boredom, confusion/guilt) and I would eat my feelings until my stomach was so full it hurt and was physically hard. I hid my disordered eating for years and would shake it off like nothing was wrong, even though I knew my behavior was abnormal. I think living with you boyfriend is a quick fix, sort of like a band aid, but without properly healing the wound (or emotional aspect that could be related to these patterns) the issue isn't going to go away. \n\nFinding healthy outlets/ connections is great whether you're alone or not, try journaling and just letting the pen flow to the paper without really thinking about what you want to write but let your subconscious free and onto the paper. (Myself and many others have found hidden answers through this practice) Calling a close friend, loved family member or your boyfriend and expressing to them how much you love them, appreciate them etc. Spreading those feelings and expressing them allows those loving feelings to come back to you. \n\nIf you're on the brink of bingeing maybe going to make a cup of tea instead, or finding something productive (journaling, exercising, listening to your favorite music) something to start getting you out of that pattern. Hope this helps!",

I would recommend trying to figure out structured distance social activities in the evenings, especially ones that include a video or audio component (that way you can minimize the chance that you'll be able to eat while you're doing the activity). \n\nWould your boyfriend be up for calls or video calls? Do you have friends you can engage with? If neither of those are currently options, you could look for online groups to join, like support groups, gaming groups, etc. There are chats here on reddit, through discord, and mental heath support websites.",

      "body": "I am so sorry you are dealing with this. I have similar issues, but here's the thing: I live with my long-term partner. At first, living together was enough to halt the urges to binge, but as I grew more comfortable with him, the bingeing gradually returned. So, I think you're on the right track knowing that living with him would \"fix\" it, but \"not really.\" (You nailed it, there). What has helped for me is to **eat more** throughout the day so I'm not underfed in the evening  (sometimes that alone is enough) and then, if I do find myself eating or wanting to eat more, I have to be really curious about why I want to eat - I'm usually trying to avoid feeling something (tired, bored, lonely, insecure, self-critical, etc). The biggest, most helpful first step is to forgive. I have to forgive myself for those urges and for the times I slip. It's counterintuitive, but that's the only thing that stops me. Be gentle to you <3",

      "body": "Were you significantly underweight or restricting? When I was recovering from AN, I developed severe bulimia and even after I thought I had gained all the weight I needed to be weight restored, I would still binge epically at night, on sweet things usually that I don\u2019t even like or crave normally. O would purge until early morning, cry, regret it, hate myself, tell myself I would stop, and then do it all again tomorrow.) I tried a million techniques. However, Once I got to my pre-ED weight, I stopped. The need to binge at night went away significantly. By also telling people around me about my struggle and trying to eat three meals a day (regardless how big) I\u2019ve managed to not night binge for months, which I always thought was impossible. If you\u2019ve heard of set-point theory or All In, those theories can help explain or provide comfort about this topic. Stephanie Buttermore is a great person for explaining her earlier YouTube videos on All In explain extreme hunger and her process shows getting back in touch with hunger cues and your body. Amanda Sevilla also was talking about it in her last two YouTube videos.\nNo idea if this helps you or sounds related to what you\u2019re going through, but watching these women talk about food intake and the damage of restricting helped me view my relationship with food and my body better anyway. Stay safe, sending virtual support to you! \n(Disclaimer: This is in no way professional help or diagnosis. Eating disorders are life-threatening and difficult to fight, please seek professional medical help if you are worried about your eating and food relationship.)",

I love blackened asparagus with a little salt on it, then I cut it up into small pieces and chew as long as I can before swallowing, this has worked well for my night time urges to binge eat. Ends up taking me 30 minutes to eat a head of asparagus that\u2019s only 25 calories.... maybe something like that could work At least until you can get in to see a therapist? Relying on someone else to keep you from binge eating isn\u2019t going to be sustainable unfortunately.",
