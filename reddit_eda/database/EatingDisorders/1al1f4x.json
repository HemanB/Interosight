(note: my views on ED relapses are based specifically in my experiences with anorexia, and are thus not necessarily all-encompassing)\n\napologies if this is gibberish, it's like 4AM here.",

          "body": "getting sober has been worlds easier than ED recovery. it became background instinct much, much easier than the eating has. i can almost forget sometimes. but i can't forget all the bits and pieces of me that yearn to restrict in all their different ways.\n\nalso, there's definitely a lot to be said about community/social support and what reactions look like. if you're sober/clean and relapse and tell someone, there is often a response of compassion/concern from loved ones (albeit sometimes with a \"here we go again\" kind of reaction). but i feel like, unless you are incredibly open with someone who understands how quickly things can go south, there's not a lot of things in ED recovery that are treated similarly until you are hard in the relapse paint. especially since, so often, it's little behaviors adding back up into bigger ones. that's def not to say that people are more understanding of people in recovery from substance abuse vs EDs, moreso that substance relapses tend to be more concrete and bigger, rather than small slips over time. (note: my views on ED relapses are based specifically in my experiences with anorexia, and are thus not necessarily all-encompassing)\n\napologies if this is gibberish, it's like 4AM here.",

It\u2019s usually people who don\u2019t have access to medical detox and harm reduction that think detoxing is awful. It\u2019s actually not bad under proper medical care. Pink clouding is also a thing and can last for an abnormally long time. \n\nHowever, an ed is the one thing that just doesn\u2019t feel better when you increase food because of how the body gets used to depletion. It\u2019s very uncomfortable to tolerate food physically, emotionally etc. The brain does not react optimally even if brain fog lifts. It affects so much. \u201cPink clouding\u201d doesn\u2019t exist here unless it\u2019s coupled with restriction. Eating enough for recovery just does not ever feel good, this is compounded by GI issues etc. \n\nThe physiology behind these two addictions differ drastically if you ask me. It\u2019s not as simple as escaping addictions or not in a tangible sense.\n\nEdit: Recovery from substance use will provide relief, more energy and mobility. Recovery from ed has you sleeping half the day all day for months at a time. You feel sluggish, still constipated for an abnormally long time, fatigued, in emotional distress, physically full, water retention\u2026..The list goes on. After detoxing from substances (with or without medical intervention), the body does feel better in a very short amount of time. With an ed, it can honestly take years to get back to normal. It\u2019s just not the same at all tbh.",
