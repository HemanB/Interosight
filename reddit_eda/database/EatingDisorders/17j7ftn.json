  "selftext": "I really want to be able to recover and I\u2019m starting therapy for my ed on Tuesday, but I\u2019m really scared of how my body might change if I go back to my previous weight. What if I don\u2019t look the same as I did before my ed? What if I gain weight in different places? These are all thoughts that I keep having. For those of you who have recovered, did your body eventually go back to how it was before your ed? I\u2019m just starting to remember how much more confident I was before my eating disorder and I want to go back to those days so badly.  If anyone has any advice on weight gain and recovery please let me know. It feels good hearing stories about other people\u2019s recovery.",

I have come to terms with the fact that I will never be completely happy, but I am doing what I'm doing for my health and that is good enough. \n\nAs for body changes, my ED did some extensive damage to parts of my life, but most of it has been internal and I feel like I've kept relatively the same shape in the same places during recovery. Our bodies are predisposed to wanting to be a certain weight and having that weight distributed in certain areas. You can tone through exercise, but there's no way to spot treat. \n\nThat's my experience, but yours will be completely unique. Your journey in recovery is worth it and YOU are worth it. It becomes a willpower struggle and even fifteen years later, my eating disorder is still a huge part of my life. Finding hobbies and support from friends and family will be key. Distractions are important.

The act of recovering is also our trigger. \n\nI found self love yoga to be very helpful last time I recovered. It's also a co potential of reminding yourself that you likely don't see yourself correctly in the mirror. The important part is do you physically feel good, are you getting better. I believe in you",

      "body": "I experienced weigh gain, and the change in my body that came with it, kind of like a grieving process. I knew I had to develop better eating habits, otherwise I would never be able to recover. I gave in to that, but refused to see the change in my body for a while (as some sort of self-defense mechanism). But after a while and after I gained a significant amount of weight, I started to literally feel different in my body (legs touching while walking for example). Clothes also didn\u2019t fit anymore, and I needed a size up when buying new ones. I absolutely hated my body at that point and it made me feel sad and unattractive. But I already came this far, I wouldn\u2019t give up now. The weight gain stopped at some point because my body had reached its \u2018set point\u2019. I got more used to my body, started to see the beauty in my curves and finally accepted it. I feel better in my body now then I did when I was smaller. \n\nBut, it\u2019s not always rainbows and butterflies. I have quite some days where I feel fat, ugly and unattractive. On those days I still have the urge to skip meals and eat as little as possible, and sometimes I let myself do that. It\u2019s not the best thing to do, but sometimes I can\u2019t find the strength to fight against those urges. Those days often happen when I ate a lot and/or unhealthy for some days in a row (not after one big meal or 1 day, I don\u2019t panic over that anymore). I do think there is still some eating disordered behavior in that though, but I can live with it. If I follow a (somewhat) healthy diet, lift weights and get a decent amount of sleep then those bad days rarely happen. Taking good care of my body makes me feel better, which is logic and normal also for people who don\u2019t have an ED. \n\nSo what\u2019s important is that you create a good support system (family, friends, SO and therapist) in your recovery journey. Find something that makes you feel good about yourself and find something to distract yourself. But most importantly: don\u2019t give up! It\u2019s gonna be hard, but it\u2019ll get better and it\u2019s definitely worth it",

      "body": "You are going to gain weight long before you accept your body. It\u2019s part of the process. Don\u2019t expect to be happy with the way you look for a while. But also remember that other people can\u2019t see the minute differences in your body that you can. The goal in early recovery is to just be neutral with your body. \n\nI had my ED when I was younger so I actually didn\u2019t fully go through puberty until I gained weight. So my hips got wider and my boobs got bigger (along with gaining fat in normal places). I realized that I wouldn\u2019t be able to fit into the same size I was pre ED even if I went back to restricting/lost the weight because my body had already changed and I couldn\u2019t unchange it. It actually helped me to cope with the weight gain knowing it was irreversible.",
