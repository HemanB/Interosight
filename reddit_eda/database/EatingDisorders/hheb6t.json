I finally have seemed to get over that but now I have the issue of binge eating to counteract those urges and its caused me to gain a large amount of weight.

I'm currently in relapse but was 3 years in a solid recovery (like 3-5 episodes a year) and maintained my healthy weight even during quarantine and COVID. Eat what you know will fill you up in healthy amounts. Remember to drink water throughout the day as hunger cravings can be dehydration in disguise. Fruits are high in sugar and while low calorie can cause insulin spikes which can cause those same hungry lows as candy and soda. Speaking of soda, do not drink calories. Unless you are having a fully loaded smoothie or other liquid meal, dont drink calories. Dont restrict heavily on these, throw in that yogurt and protein powder and milk/milk substitute/juice. But realize that drink is upwards of an actual plate of food in calories. So it is better early on to cut out liquid calories entirely.\n\nAnd I am in relapse so I am trying to keep my advice as moderate as possible, but i do realize i mention calories which can be rather triggering. I dont think you should be actively counting calories, but actively cutting unnecessary calories.",

      "body": "Hi friend! I've struggled with similar issues in the past, and here's what I've learned. \n\nSome of the reasons for why we struggle with eating disorders go much deeper than the food and the urges themselves. For some, it stems from a lack of self-confidence, self-esteem: for me, it came from a misunderstanding of my worth and value as a person in my own right. Maybe some have been hurt in the past and turned to food as a savior: still others may just like to eat too much, then got heavier, and thus their fight with food began. I don't now about you, but I encourage you to start thinking about the deeper issues and struggles that might be going on under the surface, and focus on resolving those struggles. (If you want someone to talk to on more along these lines, feel free to PM me.)\n\nThen, also be sure to do some research on healthy eating, start doing exercises, and find a friend to support and encourage you as you strive to live a better lifestyle! Blessings, and I hope some of this is helpful!",

Before i would literally spread peanut butter on tortillas and cram that in my face. I felt like a weird pregnant person. I will say I havent eaten peanut butter since the start of my recovery because I always triggered a binge without fail. It was the one food I craved while restricting.",
