  "selftext": "I purged 4-7 times a day for the past couple of days. I am scared for my life and I feel like I\u2019m in a very difficult spot...do i wanna recover? Absolutely. Do i still have terrible food thoughts everyday? Yes. Am I scared of gaining weight? Yes. But, do I know that I\u2019m slowly destroying my organs? Yes. \n\nAll I need right now is support...and everything/everyone around me is so triggering. Like today one of my fam members, who\u2019s aware of my ED, gave me not one, but THREE nutrition books (the grain brain, fat belly, and wheat belly) to read. I was like \u201coh great. more reasons to not eat a certain food group.\u201d  I feel so weak, pathetic, and stupid. All I can think about is workout, eat, purge, restrict, eat, purge. \n\nI am so sorry \u2014 at this point, I can\u2019t even be positive anymore.",
