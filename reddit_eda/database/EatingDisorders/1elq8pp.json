  "selftext": "I never had an ed diagnose but I most definitely had something bad going on and for over a year now I\u2019ve been trying to let go of my bad habits and negative thoughts. I notice how it keeps getting better but still I seem to keep on adding up what I eat in my head and stressing myself over eating too much in total or of a certain food group a day. I\u2019m wondering if I\u2018ll ever be able to let go of these thoughts or if it\u2019s just something I have to live with by now. I hope it\u2019s not because it\u2019s incredibly annoying if my thoughts are constantly circling around food. It\u2019s like a love-hate relationship. Do you guys have any tips or experiences to share?",

I\u2019d start by doing this, because sometimes we\u2019re scared of doing things but we might not have wondered why exactly that might be.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to answer me, just ask yourself and ponder it. It\u2019s a form of auto-analysis/self-reflection. I\u2019d also look up intuitive eating. This what\u2019s helped me the most. There\u2019s even a book about it. It follows the principle of mindfulness. And also, mindfulness itself might help as well.\n\nAnd don\u2019t ever hesitate to ask for help. There\u2019s no shame in that! I do therapy (Psychoanalysis) once a week and I also see a nutritionist specialized in intuitive eating. IDK where you\u2019re located, but apparently in some countries you\u2019d go to a dietitian instead of a nutritionist. This isn\u2019t the case where I live, though. So, that might vary.

It's like the food noise is always in my head telling me to eat, look in my frig, look in my food pantry etc. It's like a rollercoaster and sometimes it's so stressful. I did a lot of research in line because I need to stop always having food one if the biggest things I think about. Have u heard of Berberine? I started taking the Thorne brand and of course I am trying hard to have will power and it seems to have helped rid that annoying food noise that was always in my head. Aside from always thinking about food, I stopped drinking alcohol and beer.  I even lost 6 lbs in 3 months. I wish u so the best of luck. \u2764\ufe0f. I know how hard it is.",

I used to have binge eating, now i don't do it in the most situations, but i constantly thinking about food like you, when i can eat, i'm hangry enough, i can think half of day can i eat this piece of cake or not. \n\ni'm so tired about this, i just want to back my normal food habits, when i didn't think at all about food, just eat what i wanted. \n\nwhy i can't do it right now? because have fear i gain weight. that's a reason. \n\ni had today my first therapy session after almost 2 years break, and this question is the most important right now. my therapist said i shouldn't get food like something bad, it's just a food, and i she said i should make a notes about what i eat and which thoughts i have at this moment.\n\ni've tried to do it all this day. i will do it until next therapy (in 2 weeks).\n\nMaybe it's help you, even if it's not help me.",

I hope it happens for you. I don't think it can be forced though - the more you try to take your mind off it the more it invades, that's the human brain unfortunately. but with time and some healing it can recede to where it's not suffocating anymore. maybe for some people it goes away entirely, I don't know.
