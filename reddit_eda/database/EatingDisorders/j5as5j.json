  "selftext": "I (18F) recently moved into college, which has unfortunately given me the perfect opportunity to relapse, for lack of a better term. The dining commons shows the calorie counts of each food served and I can\u2019t stop obsessing over it. I almost cried in the line to get food because there were more calories in a scoop of peas than I thought. I can\u2019t even think about eating some of my former favorite foods without feeling sick. It\u2019s gotten so bad I\u2019ll cut myself with a razor blade as punishment for eating a certain small number of calories a day. I know that I most likely really need professional help, but in the meantime is there anything else I can do?",

It\u2019s okay if you aren\u2019t ready to share everything, but it\u2019s important to know you aren\u2019t alone and reach out. Grab something to jot down all the feelings swirling in your head and try to recognize where the feelings are coming from (you can even name the body part where you feel the pain). It\u2019s important to use the counseling service but know that you have so many people to reach out to if you can\u2019t be seen right away (me including - dm me anytime!)",
