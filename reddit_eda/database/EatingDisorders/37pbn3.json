  "selftext": "Shes's(16) been admitted to hospital for anorexia and self harm. I'm(20f) wanting to give her some moral support but I'm unsure how.\n\nI was raped by our cousin when I was 6, then by the next door neigbour at 15, and I've been self harming since I was about 10-11. I don't think she knows any of that as our family has a very hush hush mentality about anything bad.\n\nI haven't seen or talked to her for a few years, but I want to be able to give her some support if she feels so inclined. I want to be able to tell her that I can relate to how she's feeling, but I don't want to make it about me, so I'm unsure how to even mention the eating disorder, as I've heard many people don't want to even hear those two words. How do I go about writing something supportive without stepping on any toes? Any help is greatly appreciated.\n",

The sharing itself, isn't joyful in and of itself, but I'm filled with joy because I know that someone soon understand where I'm coming from and perhaps will feel comfortable to let someone else hold their burden with them. :)\n\nSo I guess I'd say, if you're in the right place with your own trauma, you can share your story but it must be openly, with love, and it should be about them, never about you.\n\nI guess I just fear that too many people believe that the dark holds no succour for them, when it can often be the best way to healing a dealing with it.",

It talks about things like validation therapy and overcoming your own mindsets that can actually be unintentionally exacerbating the situation (like OP says, saying \"I know how you feel,\" can be an honest attempt at empathy that just backfires.)

Basically, anyone with an eating disorder or self-cutting is pretty much always in crisis, and the main thing you can do for them is just non-judgmentally listen.  Reflect what you hear, and notice their feelings.\n\nOne positive thing I would add is a \"contract\". Near the end of the call, we would often ask the caller if they would agree to call us before cutting/purging/attempting suicide/whatever.  If you want to do *something* active, that may be a good idea even in an informal setting.  \"Would you promise to call me next time, before you....\"",
