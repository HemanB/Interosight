  "title": "Request: How to talk to my sister without using triggering words",
  "selftext": "My sister (27) has been battling with Anorexia for close to 10 years now. I have spent countless hours trying to talk to her, encouraging her to get help but yet she continues to spend endless hours at the gym, avoiding friends and sadly lying to us to keep us \"happy\". I know she's an adult and therefore my capacity is limited but I'm struggling to sleep as I'm riddled with fear and anxiety thinking about her health. I know you should avoid using phrases like \"you are looking thin\" etc but what can I say instead to show my concern? The last thing I want to do is trigger her and make it any worse (if that's even possible). \nCan I even try and help her at this point or just remind her that I'm here to support her and let her be? \n\nShe has been to psychologists in the past but always relapses shortly after. \nEverytime I see her she looks more and more unwell.",

      "body": "You're definitely right that any comment about appearance would likely be triggering and could feed the ED.  For some people, expressing concern at all (whether it's appearance or health) ends up being triggering because it validates that the person is \"sick.\"  Those people use their ED to express how they're feeling inside, so looking unwell on the outside to match how they're feeling is the goal.  There's also the competitive side to EDs where people want to be the \"best\" anorexic and get excited when they seem to be achieving that goal.  That's not to say your sister feels that way, or that feeling that way is bad (I've struggled with aspects of it and know many others who have)--it's just something to keep in mind.  \n\nRecovery can take a long time, so I think it's important for you and your family to not give up hope that she can eventually get out of this.  That said, a person has to want recovery for themselves in order for it to work and if she doesn't right now, there sadly isn't much you can do.  You can continue to encourage her but I think it's important for you to be mindful of your own mental health too, and maybe it's time for you to take a step back.  That might sound bad but it isn't the same as giving up.  It doesn't mean you don't care.  It's just a way for you to stop taking on so much responsibility for her recovery and feeling bad when your well-intentioned efforts don't lead to change.  You can tell her that you still want to support her, and that if at any point she decides that she wants help, you'll be right there with her.  But that leaves it up to her to make that decision for herself.\n\nI'd also recommend maybe looking into therapy for yourself too, even if it's just a few sessions.  I can imagine that being a family member of an ED sufferer is exceptionally difficult and it obviously takes a toll on you.  It could be beneficial to have someone help you navigate your emotions around the situation and make sure that your health is protected too.",

      "body": "the first step is honesty, this is for your benefit as well as hers. if you're worried, then say so -- gently. in addition, keep up the rapport between the two of you, let her know you can be trusted. there's no easy way to help people with an ED alas, but just being there for her, listening, empathizing, etc is itself a lot of help. \n\non the psychiatry side, most professionals would agree that recovery takes a long time,and so i hope the relapses don't discourage the two of you to take this course of action. ED is not a one-shot kill. \n\nlastly, want to share that my sister also had ED in the past. she's older and i didn't really talk to her about it, but our mother insists my accepting presence helped her. i don't know if it did, but theres one opinion.",

I don\u2019t known if she goes out for coffee alone, but I do and once every few months I\u2019ll agree to go for coffee with someone but it\u2019s usually planned 2-3 hours in advance, not days... You could try just aaking if she wants to grab a coffee/tea in an hour or so, if she happens to be in the mood for a coffee and not minding too much the company she might agree. That was a long intro to say that the more I isolate myself the worse I am and although I will refuse to see anyone 9 times out of 10, the times I accept, I do feel  bit better/more normal/less controlled by my thoughts... not sure if this is hepful at all but thanks for reading!!!",

      "body": "First I want to acknowledge that I know this is so hard and scary for you, and I\u2019m sorry. \n\nI agree with some other commenters who have mentioned avoiding bringing up physical appearance. Weight truly is just a symptom of an eating disorder \u2014 however, of course extremely low weights are dangerous health wise. But I\u2019d focus on health if you can; rather than \u201cyou are looking so thin,\u201d something along the lines of \u201cI\u2019m really worried that this is going to have lasting damaging effects on your body.\u201d\n\nBeyond all that though, I agree with another commenter that truly someone cannot genuinely recover until they want it for themselves. HOWEVER it does get to a point where physical recovery becomes more important than mental recovery in the immediate due to physical health concerns. \n\nMost of all I want to emphasize that huge components of eating disorders are isolation and guilt. So I would encourage you to continue to show your support the way it sounds like you already are, and try to make sure your concern doesn\u2019t come across as a guilt trip accidentally. Things like \u201cwhat you\u2019re doing to yourself is making me sick with worry\u201d assigns blame versus \u201cI\u2019m so worried about you because I love you and I hate seeing you like this.\u201d\n\nSorry this was kind of rambly and I\u2019m not feeling well so this might not make sense lol. Feel free to ask questions. Wishing you and your sister the absolute best",

For me, at least, people commenting on my appearance, whether it was that I was looking thin or healthy, would definitely increase the eating disorder voice. But people expressing concern about my behaviours would give me a bit of a reality check and prompt me to seek more care than I was getting at that time.",
