  "title": "Request: Victory! Said Goodbye To All My Anorexic Clothes",
  "selftext": " \n\n&#x200B;\n\nVictory! So over a year into recovery from AN/ARFID I finally sold off my high end designer teeny tiny clothes. I'd been hoarding them and struggling to let go while accepting that they represent a really sick, sad, lonely part of my life and I will never fit them again. I feel like this is the final step in accepting, with joy, that I will never be that tiny size again and *I don't want* to be that size again. No one in my personal life knows about my ED recovery journey, so I'm sharing with you lovely people here. It is possible to let go of ED and be happy at a healthy weight. I'm so proud of myself right now. A year ago I could never have done this, and if I did it would have been through sobs and self hatred. But today I am so happy and grateful to have cleansed my closet of these unhealthy reminders. Thanks so much for reading. I wish you all the same success, health, and happiness in your ED recoveries as well. And I hope those beautiful tiny clothes find a home with someone who is naturally/healthily that size.",
