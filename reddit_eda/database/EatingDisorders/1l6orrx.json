  "selftext": "I\u2019ve struggled with how I view myself and eating for about 6 years now and recently everything has gotten alot worse super quickly. I exercise a lot regardless of everything and I often struggle to even eat as much as I burned and yet I still feel like I\u2019m just faking everything. Like I\u2019m not actually eating wrong which is making it very hard to try to think about seeking help. I\u2019ve been wanting to ask for help but because I still have the energy to wake up and go to work. I just want to know if anyone feels the same way.",

I know most people with EDs aren't, and BMI standards aren't a direct indicator of health. But my brain still plays tricks on me.",
