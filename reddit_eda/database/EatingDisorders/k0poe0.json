  "selftext": "I've been overweight my entire life and started developing an eating disorder around highschool. Truth be told there's a lot wrong with me but I forget to eat now because of it and I've been obsessing over my weight recently. I know how to lose weight healthily but I don't have the motivation or patience for it. I just want to self destruct and starve myself. I've even been considering doing c*ke to lose weight, I think about how I look every second of the day and I absolutely dread going out. I hate knowing people can see me when I look like this.",

      "body": "Some advice i\u2019ve received in ED treatment that might help: Your eating disorder\u2019s voice and your voice are not the same. They might seem like they\u2019re the same, but your ED will lie, manipulate, shame, and hurt you into carrying out its agenda. It could help to (by yourself, with friends, or with a therapist) try to separate your ED thoughts from your own. It\u2019s very possible that both you and your ED want to lose weight, but perhaps you disagree about how to do it. The only way to know is to distance yourself from it, and remember what YOUR goals, values, and passions are. here to talk more if needed xx",

Maybe somethings missing from your life, that\u2019s why you can\u2019t find the motivation to loose weight healthily. Do you feel lonely? One thing I can recommend is ABA meetings, they are currently being held on zoom a lot online, it\u2019s a nice way to make friends too. What about your love life? Maybe you feel alone... unwanted, whatever it is, I hope you can find fulfilment in a healthy way",
