  "selftext": "Every time I see someone post that they are struggling with recovery, or succeeding in recovery, or going through a relapse, or fighting their triggers, or just trying their best to continue fighting\u2026 what I see is a bad*ss individual. It is a long road but boy how things change. You will make it out of this I wholeheartedly believe in each and every one of you. Recovery is not easy or smooth. You will relapse and you are not a failure for it. You are not the sum of your actions/mistakes. \n\nIf you can\u2019t leave your bedroom and you have moldy cups in there I still believe in you. I believe in you if you lost your job calling out of work too many times. I believe in you if you dropped out of school or graduated late because you needed IP or IOP treatment. I believe in you even if you feel like you have no fight left in you because I have BEEN THERE. Please release some guilt and shame. You are doing enough.\n\nI just get so emotional seeing where everyone is at, I wish I could hand you a magic mirror that would show you where you\u2019re going to be someday. I wish I could tell you all individually, but I still get a little triggered too if I lurk too hard\u2026 \n\nI remember how hard the holidays used to be for me and I just wanted to post to say if you are in any phase of recovery or even considering recovery, just know that I\u2019m in complete awe of you. If you relapsed this week that\u2019s ok, you can give yourself some extra love and keep going. You didn\u2019t ruin anything, you\u2019re still doing incredible.",
