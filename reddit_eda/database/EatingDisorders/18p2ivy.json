  "selftext": "I\u2019m 14 and my brother is 17. He\u2019s really skinny, and lately I\u2019ve noticed him going to the toilet after meals. Today we went out for dinner, and before we got our food he went to the toilet, and about 40 mins afterwards, right after eating he went again. I\u2019m really scared that he\u2019s purging.\n\nDoes this sound like bulimia or am I just overreacting? I just want to help my brother if he is struggling.",

If he is having some problems or some alergies/intolerance..  people can react as well very badly to lactose for example, it can come in your teen years, my friend's intolerance to lactose  developed when she was 16teen.

      "body": "Is it simply just that he takes awhile? Or other red flags and signs such as actually hearing vomiting or seeing traces of vomit in the toilet afterwards on the seat? Another sure sign of purging is look up what purging knuckles look like: the knuckles get irritated especially if it consistent repetitive purging there will develops scabs on the knuckles and knuckles will appear red. I struggles with anorexia purge subtype so I struggled with restriction plus compensatory behaviors such as over exercise chew n spit and purging. It\u2019s a coping mechanism. \n\nRight now it seems to just be speculation. But if more signs appear I would start to address the issue with him in a respectful and private manner and first let it known you care and are concerned followed by your concerns and evidence for them if you have any. It\u2019s normal for denial for even the sufferer. Many sufferers don\u2019t think they are sick or it\u2019s maladaptive or disordered partly due to disordered behaviors being so damn normalized in society that it\u2019s hard to tell. But making up and compensating for what you eat while it\u2019s rooted and encouraged by diet-culture it is not natural and shouldn\u2019t ever ever be the new normal. And yet here we are with EDs crocheting and developing at earlier and earlier ages. Children as young as 6 years old are actively increasing in struggling with body dissatisfaction research shows. I\u2019m a psych major and look into a lot of these studies out of passion and curiosity. The statistics and results are disheartening. Something needs to change and it truly starts with us. It starts with psycho education and being aware of language and culture and mental health. Being aware of the language we use surrounding food and unlearning associating moral value with food is a crucial part of ED recovery and any Ed treatment program will teach you about intuitive eating and teach you to challenge diet-culture myths and disordered cognitions which also were influenced by diet-culture and how society talks about food and messsages society sends about food which are not even rooted in reality such as food is \u201cjunk\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d which doesn\u2019t promote intuitive relationship with self and body but body disconnection which ironically fuels disordered behaviors even more. The only \u201cbad\u201d food are the ones that made Santa\u2019s naughty list and the only \u201cjunk\u201d food are ones that are already in the garbage. Food is food and language and messages surrounding food is important. My biggest trigger for purging behaviors alone was indeed GUILT and SHAME which was learned through our diet-culture ridden society and even advertisements on food can be seen associating guilt with food as their stinking marketing strategy by saying \u201cZERO guilt or GUILT FREE\u201d all food fits and all food has nutritional value\u2014some more than others but ALL food has value and is fuel. If you live in a household that commonly uses language that demonizes certain food groups, food labels, or attaches moral value to food then these are all recipe for development of eating disorder. I would certainly challenge that and speak about food in more neutral terms around him if that\u2019s the case. \n\nBut so far all we know is that he takes 40 minutes in bathroom. Okay, he could be scrolling on his phone. Maybe he does have slow digestion and digestion issues. Maybe he\u2019s constipated. Maybe he is engaging in disordered behaviors. Maybe he\u2019s just chillin. It\u2019s really hard to know right now. Time will tell. Just be kind and show your support in any way you can",
