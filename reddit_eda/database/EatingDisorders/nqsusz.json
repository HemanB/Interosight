After my first ED 'episode', I considered myself recovered for 5 years and even doubted whether I had an ED in the first place because food/body was totally not a thing for me anymore, I even volunteered at an ED helpline. But then I relapsed hard, probably because I became complacent and missed all the obvious warning signs. Again though I'm well into recovery and I only get fleeting ED thoughts. Research says it takes on average 6 years to recover fully. Google Millie Thomas ED - she had her ED for 15 years and doctors had given up on her and expected her to die.

I did care about eating healthy but never obsessing about food or starving (like I could eat really bad and not to feel guilty). Though this last months (I am 26 now) with covid and other stuff I've been feeling really anxious and insecure and it's kind of getting back. It's definitely a coping mechanism that I feel it demands a lot of energy to fight. Last week I felt my ED was stronger than me but after thinking about it for days, I am sure I can get back to the state where I was okay. I just feel that it is never going to be off at 100% or healed. I feel it will always have a place in my brain and when I feel good, it is going to be in \"stand by\" and when I feel bad it will try to grow bigger.\nMaybe I way to see it is that there's always going to be something within you that challenges you and pushes you to be stronger and more compassionate towards your body and being everyday. I guess thinking this makes me feel better about the whole thing.\n Anyways, lots of strength to the people in this group.",
