  "title": "Request: Need advice, 10 yr brother has anorexia and bulimia combo",
  "selftext": "I am super worried about my brother and I dont know what to do as the country I live in has proved to be of no help i.e. the multiple psychiatrists that I took my sister to who has a serious ED history of 15 years. \nMy brother was fat shamed mercilessly by his classfellows and my parents(they are the worst, my mother is also an on/off bulimic) when was 8 as he had gained weight that made him look a bit healthy but it was not obesity level severe. He has now lost so much weight and has developed multiple gastrointestinal problems at this age. He either does not eat for 2,3 days or throws up immediately. I really do not want him to spiral out of control like my sister, who also has multiple health issues at 23, and would really appreciate some advice on how to help them. I have tried therapy, doctors for the sister and they are of no help. One of them told her to kill herself instead of throwing up (yes he said that) and she attempted suicide at 16. I don't want the same  incident to occur again as the mental health professionals are horrible in my country.\n\nEDIT: OP /u/banananna264 asked that their name be added to make possible PMs",
