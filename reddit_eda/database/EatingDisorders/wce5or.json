  "title": "How to help adult child with anorexia?",
  "selftext": "Hi all I hope this is allowed. My 19 year old has struggled with anorexia on and off for 3 years - it usually gets really bad this time of year. Right now she hasn\u2019t eaten for 2 weeks. Is there anything I can do or say to help her? We talk about it every day and I\u2019ve encouraged her to at least get an ensure or boost shake in. \n\nI\u2019ve been down this road myself but for medical reasons (not an ED) and I know how hard it is to start eating again once you stop. \n\nI\u2019m desperate to help her but I don\u2019t know how.\n\n\n\nEDIT: thank you all so much. I don\u2019t think you realize how desperate I was last night to talk to someone about it. The threatening used to work when she was younger and I had more control in her life but not so much as an adult. I\u2019m happy to say she ate a bit last night and is drinking a smoothie this morning and had some fruit. I got her some ensure shakes too. She is terrified of counseling but has agreed to give it a shot. She\u2019s still on my insurance for two more years and I just was like you\u2019re running out of time. I know that this is a lifelong thing and there\u2019s no simple cure but I\u2019m dedicated.",

Since everyone in the family is aware of what is happening, that was a big motivation for her to start eating yesterday. She broke down and was like I know everyone will be watching me. \n\nWhile eating again is great (she had an a\u00e7a\u00ed bowl and some noodles and broccoli later), I told her it\u2019s time to start working on prevention and treatment now. Just cuz she\u2019s eating doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s fixed. I\u2019m gonna be there every step of the way and pushing her and cheering her on. I\u2019m so grateful for the encouragement I\u2019ve found here\n\nEdit: oh and yes I can and will be visiting and hounding her hahahah. I\u2019ve become that mom lol",
