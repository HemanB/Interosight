It's a lose lose situation and I'll probably lie anyway and then I'll feel bad about lying.",

But if dinner is something unhealthy straight up takeout, its really hard to not to eat, as eating was a way to resource guard growing up, I struggle with eating more than I should, so I try the out of sight out of mind approach. But when people keep asking me and about eating dinner, even though I have expressed my reason that some nights, I can not eat dinner as I have reached or that meal will exceed my caloric intake for the day. It will get to the point that I have to straight up argue because my feelings dont feel like they are being heard. Or if Im having a bad day, all I hear is, \"Don't worry about it, just get fatter, you will always be big anyways.\" I know it's from a place of love. it's just annoying when I am basically interrogated for refusing to eat when my concerns have been expressed, so some nights, I get rather upset.",

However I absolutely hate being asked what I\u2019ve eaten. Especially by my mother. But that is not just ED brain fuckery I think. Before I developed an ED, I was inpatient for other stuff for over a year at a youth psych ward. I was home during weekends. Thing is, when I came home, the first, and pretty much only thing she would ask about is what I had eaten while there. It was not just a general question. She wanted me to list what I had eaten all week, as if that was the most eventful thing about my life, or only thing worth asking about. Like never mind school or the activities there or how I was doing in general. Irony is, eating sure as hell is the most eventful part of my life now. I was confused and mildly annoyed by her asking then, and I sure as hell hate being asked now.",
