I think it\u2019s really hard for people who have never experienced an eating disorder to understand how hard the behaviours are to stop and how ingrained they are. Before I had a longer term eating disorder (I had restrictive cycles prior but they never lasted long enough to cause concern), I was in psych wards a lot with girls who had anorexia and I couldn\u2019t understand why they couldn\u2019t \u201cjust eat\u201d. Of course I never said anything to them but I didn\u2019t understand. Then when I went through it I was able to understand a lot more.",
