In college I would make sure to skip at least 1 meal before any social event. Occasionally, I would skip classes too, even though I enjoy school and am a strong student. I REALLY want to find a better way to cope. \n\nDoes anyone relate to this? How do you work through it???",

      "body": "I\u2019ve done this a lot and still struggle with it. If I\u2019m invited somewhere where I know there will be food around but have eaten a lot that day, I won\u2019t go and I\u2019ll just isolate myself. In a perfect world, we would be able to just accept the invitation and be around food without having anxiety... but obviously our brains don\u2019t work that way. I personally just try to take soda or some kind of \u201cfilling\u201d beverage with me and gum when I\u2019m invited somewhere where there\u2019s food around. If you\u2019re invited to a restaurant though that\u2019s a different story. You could always pull then \u201cI already ate\u201d card and just order beverages instead of food but it\u2019s always hard watching other people eat :( It\u2019s such a horrible thing to have to say no to plans because your brain is telling you that you ate too much and need to isolate yourself. Just know that you\u2019re not alone and try to slowly make an effort to get over your fear of attending these social events... you may surprise yourself. I hope I helped in some way! Good luck \ud83d\udc95",

When I forced myself to socialise instead I would usually have a good time and even if I didn\u2019t it would save me from a binge. I had to force myself essentially with the knowledge that no one was thinking about how much I\u2019d eaten or not eaten and no one cared except me. I would repeat in my head \u201cI have as much right to be here (in public/social) as anyone else\u201d and rip the bandaid off. The more I said yes to social events the less I binged and the more I was filled up in another way. \n\nSay yes and keep saying yes! And remember while you\u2019re head is very busy thinking about you everyone else\u2019s head is very busy thinking about them. \n\nAlso remember your future self is going to thank you for LIVING as opposed to hiding with your ED. It\u2019s like living with a spider, the more you feed it with ED thoughts and behaviour the bigger it gets until it\u2019s so big it\u2019s all you see. Don\u2019t feed the spider, say yes and live!!",

I focus on the fact that I really want to hang out with my friends/meet this person and I know they don't give a shit about my belly being bloated a little more. We're human and our bodies change every day. Trust me, after you overcome the obstacle just once, you'll feel the accomplishment and it will motivate you to do this more :) It's a good thing you realize that it's a problem you need to work on because that's one step forward already!

I also have gained some weight due to an injury/ surgery and have stopped going to see friends as a result... the only thing that has worked for me is realizing that I am missing out on life. I have to remind myself that life is short, and even though I don\u2019t feel great about my body right now, I don\u2019t want to look back on my life when I\u2019m older and think of all the things I didn\u2019t do because I thought I was fat.
