  "selftext": "I'm 16, and I\u2019m in a healthy weight range. I know that. But my mom keeps telling me my \"ideal\" weight is way lower\u2014like, technically underweight. I didn\u2019t believe her at first, but now it\u2019s starting to get in my head, and I\u2019m honestly questioning myself.\n\nAnddd it gets worse, sometimes my parents weigh me when I wake up, or before and after meals. It\u2019s not every day, but when it happens, it makes me spiral really bad and then all my progress to heal gets thrown out the window. I don't get why they\u2019re doing this or what they expect from me.\n\nI just feel stuck and confused. Am I overreacting, or is this actually messed up?\n",

I could help you think of some cover stories (in this situation lying to them is perfectly fine. You need to talk to a professional that can help you)\nIf you can make the appointment, ask for a doctor you're more comfortable with seeing if you have one you remember, or asking to see a doctor of a specific gender if that helps.\nIn this appointment you need to highlight that you're homeschooled, isolated, and how much control your family has over you. Along with the weight monitoring and trying to make you underweight it should paint a bigger picture of abusive control.\nI'm so so sorry you're going through this, and getting your doctor involved and making an official paper trail of these events can help your side.\n\nYour doctor can speak to your parents and tell them to stop this. If they don't, you can go back and tell them how it's still going and they should take more actions to help you. If they brush off your issues, be stubborn and ask to speak to another doctor. Threaten to make a complaint for not taking child safety seriously. This can lead to malnutrition and health issues which I'm sure you know, your parents have no good reason to be doing this to you when there is clearly no problems with giving you enough food.\n\nAre there any local youth clubs you could join? This could be a safe space for you to find friends and also have access to a counsellor to report these safety concerns. It would fly under the radar more to look for help and your parents won't be suspicious if you're trying to keep reporting a secret. But something will have to be done, someone will have to talk to your parents. The important thing is that you have connections to support especially after getting intervention in case your parents are unhappy with your choice to report (which they can deal with because who the fuck thinks it's ok to weight check and starve their kid)",
