  "title": "Request: Do you ever binge or over eat healthy whole foods?",
  "selftext": "Does anyone binge healthy whole foods?\n\nI\u2019m curious to know the struggles of those who don\u2019t binge on any junk food at all, but actually struggle with eating too much fruit, veggies, meat, and other whole foods. By \u201cjunk food\u201c I\u2019m talking about anything that\u2019s processed, manufactured, or has additives or chemicals in it. I know that there are lots of things that claim to be \u201chealthy\u201c but if you look on the label most of them have chemicals and sugar in them which could also make them addictive.\n\nFor example, does anyone binge on too much broccoli/cauliflower, too much bacon, too much meat, too much fruit? \n\nI know that these types of foods are much lower in calories, which actually makes it easier to over eat on them and stuff yourself because psychologically your brain will tell you that you won\u2019t gain as much weight as you would with the more calorie dense food like pizza, burgers, potato chips, etc.\n\nDoes anyone struggle with this? If so, please share your stories, experiences, and solutions. Thanks in advance!",
