  "selftext": "I've struggled with an ED since I was 12, and I was hospitalized for it when I was 13. Throughout my highschool years, my weight fluctuated but not significantly so i havent been too worried until now. With quarentine, I've been losing a lot of weight, and I'm on the brink of becoming underweight now. I'm absolutely terrified, but I'm also too scared to tell anyone because my parents are proud of how far I've come. I dont want to let them down.",
