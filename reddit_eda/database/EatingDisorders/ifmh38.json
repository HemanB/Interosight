  "title": "Request: How to deal with friend\u2019s body comments",
  "selftext": "I recently went back to college and am living with a friend that I have been living with for a couple years. Thankfully, I am doing much better body-image wise than I was at the start of quarantine. I was actually excited to go back to school and I hope that I won\u2019t go back to my old ED habits. \n\nMy friend is aware that I\u2019ve struggled with an ED/body-image issues for many years as we\u2019ve talked about it multiple times. The last time we talked about it was when I was really struggling and she said she would avoid talking about eating disorders, since that seemed to come up in conversation more often than it should have. \n\nWe\u2019ve only been back for 2 days, but during that time she\u2019s made several comments about how she thinks she\u2019s ugly and doesn\u2019t want to look at herself in the mirror. They aren\u2019t necessarily comments about her body image but I\u2019m worried that it\u2019s going to become a trigger for me. \n\nI know that these comments are sincere and she\u2019s not trying to trigger me but I\u2019m unsure about how to handle them. I want to help her because I know exactly where she\u2019s coming from, but I also don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m in the right place yet to help someone else with potentially the same issues I\u2019m dealing with.",

When she says something negative about her body and you hear it, just say something positive, it doesn't have to be a big thing. \n\nExample:\nFriend: \"ugh I'm so ugly I can't even look in the mirror\"\nSupportive redirection: \"I think you're beautiful inside and out, something I've learned is that mirrors are only helpful to check if my clothes match\" (or whatever you think is a recovery-positive response)\n\nIt's going to feel really cheesy, but repetition is key. I never really feel comfortable enough to be super direct with my friends without trying this first. By super direct I mean saying something like \"your negative self talk is triggering me\" because ideally your friend deserves to love her body too! \n\nAnd I think saying nice things to a friend is great practice for how to talk to yourself when you're having doubts.",
