  "title": "Request: How to stop the urge to binge during quarantine",
  "selftext": "Due to several unfortunate circumstances, I'm currently staying at home with my parents and sister until further notice. All of us work from home, sis has online school so there's basically very little privacy. This whole situation + the inability to go out shopping without a good excuse and find fast food in a small town makes me very anxious, which just amplifies my urge to binge eat and drink. However if I succumb, my parents will notice something's wrong. I try to keep myself contained but it's hard when your only coping mechanism in stressful situations is food and alcohol. I need some tips to stop myself from going haywire on my family's food supplies and feeling like shit for it afterwards.",

The more you think about not wanting to eat, you will feel the urge to eat. So do something to keep you from thinking about it.\nThings that aren't really engaging, like watching TV, won't help, though, so best avoid these.",

Activities like coloring, puzzles, origami, or knitting can help keep you distracted.   Craft projects are great and you can order them online.  You can ask your sister to play board games, or even things like putty or stress balls can help if you don't want to talk to other people.",

      "body": "Lots of pragmatic suggestions below that are great - I would just say: think of the situation. Food is scarce, and it really could be harmful to go haywire. Unlike other times, we are in weird times! So - maybe use this as a challenge to see how it goes if you try to really stop the binge from happening. It may be that this COVID situation is going to help you stop bingeing. If you do it, don't beat yourself up - but remember, that guilt and horrible feeling will happen, and if you can avoid that, it's best. That's worse than food supplies going down, IMO.",

I thought I was doing ok, and I'm finally admitting to myself that I am not, I binged 4 times this week. I'm just not in control of my food intake, which is fucking me up. I won't want to eat, my mom will make me eat, and then I'll binge on everything in sight. The moment I feel like I've eaten more than I wanted to, everything feels like failure and I give in to the temptation to use food to feel better. It's so easy when all this junk is so accessable. \n\nWhen I'm going to try to do, and recommend that you try, is planning. Take control of your intake while you're in a good mindset and plan out exactly what you're going to eat and when.",
