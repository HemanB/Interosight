  "selftext": "Like the title says, I am curious/concerned. To clarify, I mean eating but not purging. Basically CONSTANTLY eating on some level, but not just snacking. Outright having extra meals in the middle of the night or early in the 4am black sky mornings? I ask because I cant find any information on search engines, so the algorithm might have decided I am not worthy to know what I am dealing with. I have had times when (especially when alone) I am audibly screaming at my body to stop, and still eating. I just want to know if I have some kind of basic lable to put on it.\n\nEDIT: To clarify, I am already overweight",

If you think that you suffer of binge get help immediately.\nLast thing: you are beautiful, remember it :)) \n\nSorry fot any grammar error, i'm from Italy.",

      "body": "I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s binge eating bc binges tend to be discrete instances of eating massive amounts of calories, not eating constantly. Constant food intake could be a symptom of a biological issue like thyroid imbalance, so a medical checkup would be a good idea. Hyperphagia is also a symptom of atypical depression. Also eating a lot/frequently messes up your body\u2019s hunger and satiety cues. We have a hormone called leptin that tells us when we\u2019re full and need to stop eating. But if we eat a lot, our bodies become resistant to leptin, so you\u2019re basically on a downward spiral where your body wants more food bc its always getting food. \n\nThere could be other reasons; a medical professional could make suggestions and potentially suggest medication.",
