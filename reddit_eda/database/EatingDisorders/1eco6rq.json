  "selftext": "one of my main relapse triggers seems to be looking at myself (specifically my bare stomach area) in mirrors. i only ever wear loose shirts that dont show my stomach so i have to go out of my way to do this and sometimes i can stop myself when the urge hits, sometimes i cant and 9/10 times i will trigger myself. is it like this for anyone else? what do u guys do to stop the urge?",

Over time, it just became an instinct for me to avoid mirrors because I didn\u2019t want to be put in a bad mood over seeing my body. Wish you the best of luck x",

I try avoid looking through reflections in windows too because that will just ruin my self esteem.

In the early days of my recovery I took a break from social media, because comparison is the thief of joy *and* it was impossible for me to ignore fitness or influencer accounts that fulfilled my pro-ana image fix. I also removed the one full length mirror we had. I eventually brought it back and if I felt the urge and stopped in front of it, I would give my reflection a wave and smile and say, how\u2019s it going? You look great! And keep moving.
