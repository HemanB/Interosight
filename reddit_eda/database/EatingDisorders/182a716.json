  "selftext": "I don\u2019t want to binge even though it\u2019s literally glorified on this day. I don\u2019t want to drink too much apple cider to make my stomach expand. I don\u2019t want to eat hella dessert after eating a whole meal. But I feel I can\u2019t help it when I\u2019ve been restricting and there is heaps of food in front of me. It makes me scared that it\u2019s going to trigger me and make me eat a ton of junk in secret for months again all just to throw it up. It\u2019s a terrible pattern I have. I lost 27 pounds in the past few months and I don\u2019t want to go back. Today is supposed to be a day of happiness. But for me it\u2019s a day of fear and sadness. Not to mention, this is my first official Thanksgiving without my late father so it adds to the stress. My heart is racing as I type locked in the bathroom. I\u2019m on the verge of tears. Does anyone else have terrible anxiety today?",

All eating disorders involve a troubled relationship with food, and those who binge are just as bothered by the presence of massive food celebrations as those who restrict.\nTo say someone is ignorant when they make a reference to eating disordered people being uncomfortable with Thanksgiving meals is akin to saying it would be a giant leap to presume that most people reading this sub have a baseline level of internet familiarity.  It\u2019s not silly or ignorant to presume that, and in the same vein, people with EDs - no matter the diagnosis- are facing an enemy to some degree when food is the central focus of an event.\nI think this sub is meant to be supportive, and even if a comment is incorrect, it seems unnecessarily harsh to say \u201cyou\u2019re so ignorant \u201c.",
