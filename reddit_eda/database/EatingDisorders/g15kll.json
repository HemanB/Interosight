I\u2019m slowly killing myself and ending my life. I wanna gain control. I wanna stop it before I become overweight and literally kill myself. I\u2019m not good with humans. I\u2019m just suffering.",

      "body": "Hi, I'm sorry you are feeling this way. If I can offer a different perspective, maybe it might help... Usually when we are feeling out of control around food- or drawn to it like a magnet, it's because we are trying to control it too much. We are restricting foods and nutrients that our bodies need for fuel, like sugar and carbohydrates. Our bodies are hardwired to keep us alive at all costs, so we become clouded with food thoughts and obsessions. This leads to bingeing and grazing non-stop. Please consider the idea that there is no such thing as sugar or food addiction. You FEEL out of control around food because you restrict it. The more you restrict, the more your body craves it. When you give in, your brain floods your body with feel-good hormones as a reward for giving it fuel. It's a good idea to eat a variety of nourishing and nutritionally dense foods to let your body understand and trust that you won't deprive it of fuel. I promise your life, your body, your sleeping patterns, your outlook will change for the better. Please read \"The F It Diet\" by Caroline Dooner for more support with this. Give yourself grace. This is hard stuff. Best wishes.",

Right away she found I have a strong pattern of invalidating my emotions, as well as trouble regulating my emotions which leads me to use and eat out of desperation to control them\n\nI found this site which explained invalidation and gave me the first tools to change how I saw my thinking\nhttp://eqi.org/invalid.htm\n\nI'm also looking into how to manage my feelings when it feels like too much. Talking to another actual human helps the most, one that isnt going to give me advice right back and who will listen first, as I find I carry around a lot of shame about the addiction and also my perception that I \"should\" be able to solve it alone",
