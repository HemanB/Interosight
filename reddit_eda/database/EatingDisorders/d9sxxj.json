  "selftext": " I\u2019m 19 and struggled with bulimia heavily for years . My little sister is in 4th grade and  has been making concerning comments about food and weight and portraying the early habits of an eating disorder. I try to talk to her about it every time I catch her saying those things, but it\u2019s really difficult because I don\u2019t know what the right thing to say is. I really don\u2019t want her to be like me and I need some advice on things I Should say. If anyone began ED habits at a young age let me know what you wish someone would\u2019ve told you before it was too late.",

I stopped eating lunch when I was in middle school and my friends told my mom- but she didn\u2019t do enough at the time to intervene.

A lot of people in my house got home at different times so ate dinner separately. This obviously made it easy to skip meals, and I also think I missed out on a lot of opportunities to make positive associations with food.

I always stayed in my teachers\u2019 rooms during the lunch period without eating and just once wished one of them would have expressed concern. It sounds like you\u2019re already being verbal about noticing these things in your sister so I hope that\u2019s helping!\n\nIf you feel things are getting bad enough, maybe talk to her teacher? They may be able to keep an eye on her and see if she is eating or eating enough during lunch, or making comments about her weight/appearance.",

      "body": "Starting when I was about 8 I had fantasies about cutting my stomach off with ribbon cutting ceremony scissors, and would react to any incident of shame surrounding food with determination to \u201cnever eat again.\u201d\n\nI think it might have helped if someone sat me down to rationalize that thinking (impulsive restriction) with grounded logic about eating as a spectrum. I was overweight at  that time so a holistic effort to improve my diet would have been great, but I didn\u2019t really understand the science of it, I just saw deprivation as a success. By the time I was in 7th grade I was romantically and obsessively skipping lunch and regularly refusing food at home, but I never thought about food choices. I was just so broken in my relationship with food that all food was the same, and the less I could eat, the better a person I would be.",

I think reassurance is important, possibly try get her into a sensible eating regime. Discuss body positivity around her . Talk about her friendships ( a lot of the time its peers have an influence) . I remember as a kid I used to be told I had to go on the bottom of the piggy back, and it\u2019s the little things that usually play on your mind.",

      "body": "I have an ED too. And I have a little sister who also displays similar behaviours I did. Refusin to eat after an argument, refusing to eat things she just dont want to. Eating unhealthy at times.. like, either everything or nothing. Which is very similar to mine.\n\nI havent told her about the eatingdisorder Im struggling with. Because informing her of that could just put ideas in her head. Rather, when she brings it up, tell her how dangerous it is and that its nothing to look for, no need to go in depth unless she pushes it. Try positive reinforcement instead. \"Today we find out what to wat together, and if u chose today, i chose tomorrow. Then we make the food together and have a great time, maybe we can watch a movie or play uno as well\"\n\nI barely evee talk to hee about how she looks. I could probably have avoided making jokes of myself back when I was obese. But i guess i cant change the past. Ive lost a lot of weight now and Im scared that'll influence her too, especially if she finds out why. Im not going to tell her unless she directly ask me.\n\nIm focusing more on being a generallt supportive role. That she can talk to me about absolutely everything. Embarrassing, scary, sad, happy, funny, anything. And in that, I think I have succeeded.\n\nI think thats whats important. That she knows shes loved. And she knows she has a safe person to come to when she needs to talk, laugh, or just cry and be hugged. That wont get mad, and will always support her no matter what.\n\nIts usually when we feel like we dont have that better, safer coping mechanism. We develope bad ones like self harm, eating disorders and substance abuse.",
