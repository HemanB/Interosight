  "title": "Request: Mental hunger vs eating out of boredom?",
  "selftext": "I\u2019m so confused about when to eat. I follow a lot of recovery accounts that support going the \u201call in\u201d route where you honor your physical and mental hunger. Basically, if you\u2019re thinking about food, it\u2019s a sign to eat. \nThen there\u2019s also the whole mindfulness, asking yourself if you\u2019re actually hungry thing. \nI\u2019ve done the \u201call in\u201d thing off and on. I\u2019ve never really had extreme physical hunger, just mental. I\u2019ll do it usually a month or two but then it sort of peters out? I\u2019ll be committed in the beginning but then I start wondering if it\u2019s actually mental hunger or if I\u2019m just bored. If I wasn\u2019t trying to pay attention to whether or not I was thinking about food, would I be thinking about it so much? My mom, who doesn\u2019t have an ED, will be like \u201coh I\u2019ve eaten so many snacks, I need to stop now,\u201d so I start wondering if it\u2019s normal to think about having more but not do it. \nI know who to ask if I want the eat everything you think about answer, and I know who would give me the listen for your hunger cues answer. I guess I\u2019m just looking for additional opinions? Thanks!",

      "body": "I\u2019m struggling hard with both mental and physical hunger. With mental hunger though, if I choose to eat something I\u2019m thinking about I actually get physically hungry. The science behind it helped me understand it more: basically, mental hunger cues in a malnourished state means that the body is only performing its most vital tasks to keep you alive and sending physical hunger cues is considered a waste now because you don\u2019t answer them (during restriction); so it opts for mental hunger cues (thinking about food) because it doesn\u2019t use up any unnecessary energy. And we all know why the body needs so many calories during recovery compared to someone who doesn\u2019t have an eating disorder\n\nI think it was Tabitha Farrar who touched on the subject specifically and explained it really well. Maybe reading up on it will help you to feel better about it!",
