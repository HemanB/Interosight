I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019ve been in recovery for a year with a lot of relapsing.",

You could also go to HR about it to. I know some people don\u2019t feel comfortable revealing their eating disorder at work, but it can be a positive experience. You have a disease that is not your fault. Just like another person that might be in recovery with cancer.",

It sounds like you've been working so hard and doing so well, relapses don't mean you're not taking steps forward! \n\nAre you perhaps able to drink something like a yoghurt or hot chocolate? I find things are easier to drink than eat when I'm wanting to restrict so it can be a good compromise if a whole lunch is too much right now. Sending lots of strength :)",

      "body": "Personally, when I was going through that, I told people flat out exactly what was going on. I wanted them to understand how inappropriate it is to comment on people's bodies. I wanted them to be as uncomfortable as I was when they made comments about it. And I would tell them not to make comments about my body or my food. If conversation about weight, body image, dieting, etc. came up, I would say, \"I don't want to talk about that,\" on repeat until they stopped talking about it. I don't care if it makes people uncomfortable. It SHOULD make people uncomfortable to say stuff like that. I know this method doesn't work for everyone but I just want you to know it's absolutely within your right to stand up for yourself. You can be vague about your condition just saying \"yeah, I've been going through a grueling medical treatment, it's been really tough and I'd really appreciate if you didn't comment on my body.\" I also used the phrase \"doctors orders!\" quite a bit when people slipped up to remind them I have a medical condition and their comments are inappropriate.",
