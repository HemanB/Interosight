  "selftext": "I'm 15 and I've recently been purging and everytime bright red blood has been appearing in large quantities.\n\nTo expand I've only talked about my ed with doctors once before when I was 14 and I got no help or support but I feel now its urgent, I've never really been this scared of my ed before and would like some advice. Some of my mutuals have been saying to get help and to stay safe but I dont want to recover I just dont want to die. My parents are very controlling and strict and talk a lot about my weight in a negative way and it pushes me to continue until they care but I really want to have a future and to not suffer anymore but I just dont trust the medical professionals in my country and I'm really scared no one will believe me or be rude about my suffering. I dont think my parents will be able to afford treatment because of recent changes to the NHS. \n\nTLDR: should I tell doctors I've been purging and never recovered from my previous attempt at recovery and it's now resulting in vomiting blood.",

Purging can be incredibly dangerous and the blood is a sign that you have already done some potentially very serious damage.  Please do everything you can to avoid purging (I know that's easier said than done), you never know if your next purge will be the one that will lead to a full oesophageal rupture.",

      "body": "You definitely should tell a doctor. Bright red blood is \u201cnew\u201d and usually when you purge it it means that you have sores and wounds in your throat. It\u2019s not that dangerous until they get infected and if you purge often that\u2019s more and more likely to happen. Vomiting dark blood means immediately go to a doctor because you might have a big internal bleeding because tge dark color means that it is a bit \u201colder\u201d and the bleeding is more likely to be a bit \u201cdeeper\u201d in your digestive system. BUT vomiting blood is NEVER normal. Please talk to professional and stay safe!",
