  "selftext": "I know it\u2019s not that cool because it\u2019s really normal, but I was finally able to eat 3 full meals today AND snacks in between. I ate 4 snacks today! Usually I eat 1 good meal and snacks for the rest of the day but I feel so proud of myself today. My dad is proud too :) I\u2019m hoping I can do it again tomorrow \ud83d\ude01 I think waking up earlier has helped me plan out my meals better too. \n\nUpdate: I did it again \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01",
