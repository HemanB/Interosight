  "title": "Request: Being heavier than both my boyfriend and his brother is taking a horrible toll on my recovery",
  "selftext": "My boyfriend is 5'9 he goes to the gym daily and (as far as I know) has never dealt with an eating disorder. I found out today that my boyfriend's brother, someone who he often regards as \"chubby,\" \"fat,\" and \"bigger,\" is actually smaller than me. His height to weight ratio is in the healthy range, but his family is hyper-critical of weight gain and weight loss. This is apparent as my boyfriends mother ridicules him everyday about being \"fat.\" I don't if others will understand, but after hearing my boyfriend call his brother fat, knowing he is actually average, makes me feel awful about my 5'6, overweight self. I have struggled in the past with bulimia and BED. Although I consider myself recovered, i've been starting to struggle horribly with my self image and my bulimic habits are coming back. The news about his brother has not made me feel any better. I know that it may seem idiotic to some, but it has really affected my self-esteem knowing that his brother wears a size medium while I wear an extra large. I am having a hard time because it makes me feel lesser than everybody else. I feel hopeless about it and I don't know how to recover after my relapse this morning. My boyfriend is aware of my past eating disorders and he supports me to an extent, but he has also threatened to leave me if  I relapse. I'm not sure how to go on; this past week feels like my own self-image pity party.",

That\u2019s like telling someone you\u2019re there for them but warning that if they falter you\u2019ll give up on them. I don\u2019t have any other info on your situation or relationship but this aspect does not sound healthy. It would be worth bringing it up with him. I understand that may not be emotionally easy for you, but take time to think about how you might discuss your feelings about his and his family\u2019s opinions about weight and body image.\n\nEdit to add: \nIf he\u2019s not willing to listen and truly support you, then I\u2019d recommend reconsidering your relationship. You deserve someone who loves you for you and will support you even when life is difficult (in any way, not just relating to mental health and eating disorders).",

I know it's not another person's responsibility to handle our mental illnesses, but them threatening to leave is an absolute shitty move. My boyfriend is so supportive of my past mental illnesses (depression and anxiety) and he's motivating on the days I feel like I have relapsed. Everyone deserves to have someone who loves you and doesn't make you feel shitty for things you aren't able to control OP.",

His family isn\u2019t going anywhere. Are you ready to possibly be judged by them for the rest of your life? You deserve better. Four years in, you need to have some serious conversations with him if he really is the man you see spending your life with, particularly one about if you ever relapse because he\u2019s already told you he\u2019s unwilling to support you if that happens. Are you prepared to go through that alone if it happens? I truly hope you have a support system in your life outside of him that you can lean on.",
