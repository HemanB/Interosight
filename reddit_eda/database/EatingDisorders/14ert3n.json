  "selftext": "My friend showed me a picture of a \u201cgirl she matched with on bumble\u201d. She had angled her phone so I couldn\u2019t see the girl\u2019s face. She asked me, \u201cisn\u2019t this girl hot?\u201d I said yes and genuinely believed it. Then she scrolled up and it was actually a pic of me at my max weight. After I realized it was me, suddenly I started noticing all the imperfections\u2026but they weren\u2019t there when I thought that girl was just someone she\u2019d matched with on a dating app. \n\nIt was a really clever way for her to show me all this stuff truly is dysmorphia in your head. I never thought I could find myself at my max weight attractive, yet there it is.\n\nIf you can replicate the experience for a friend, would recommend.",
