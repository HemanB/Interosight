  "title": "Request: Christmas Cookie Party Win!",
  "selftext": "Tonight I went to a Christmas cookie contest party. I made cookies without binging on them (Rare). And I ate 4 cookies at the party and didn't purge (Rarer). I had such a great time since I wasn't obsessively focused on the food. \n\nI am beginning to love fighting back against my ED and not letting it have power over me. It's so empowering and makes me excited for a future free from this disease. I am working so hard to recover but I'm still B/P 3-5 times a week. It's a huge decrease from how much I used to B/P but lately I've just been getting frustrated with my recovery and how sick I still am. So these kind of days mean the world to me. \n\nSending healing vibes to you all!",
