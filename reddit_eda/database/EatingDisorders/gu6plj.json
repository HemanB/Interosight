  "selftext": "so i\u2018m at the beginning of coming to terms with me having an eating disorder/ distorted eating habits. \ni really try to reflect on my actions and my thought processes when i\u2018m starting to feel like the topic of weight/ eating/ self-hate is taking over my train of thoughts. \n\ntoday i realized i get triggered when somebody (sadly mostly women) talk about their eating - especially when they mention that they didn\u2018t eat alot or at all that day.\n\nso i was spending time with my boyfriend at his place when his flatmate came home from work.\nshe mentioned that she had a hard working day and then paused for a moment until she said kinda suprised that she didn\u2018t eat all day.\nshe is skinny and i feel really bad about my weight and looks when i\u2018m around her. \n\nshe talked about her not eating all day before and i have to admit i got jealous that she was able to not eat all day while i feel like i\u2018m binging all day.\ni also tried to talk to her about my strange eating or my worries about my eating habits and she answered: \u201eif you\u2018re really unhappy with your weight you would just start working out more and just eat healthier.\u201c\n\nThis hurt me a lot because i didn\u2018t feel like taken seriously and also felt like that - she as a skinny person with a figure that\u2018s in line with our society\u2018s body standard - doesn\u2018t really know how i feel with all my struggles.\nso when she mentions that she didn\u2018t eat i feel disgusted by myself that i ate.\n\n in my mind it goes like: oh, if you would just stop eating you would look better too. she looks great and didn\u2018t eat. you did it. you look so disgusting. you\u2018re weak. just stop eating and you\u2018ll feel better.\n\nmy boyfriend and her were expecting guests later (also friends of mine) and i said before that i\u2018d eat dinner with them. but after her comments i told my boyfriend that i needed some time alone and that i\u2018d eat at my place and would come over later. \nat home i had a binge eating episode and now i\u2018m crying and looking for some kind of comfort...\n\ni also feel like my boyfriends flatmate doesn\u2018t really think about the fact that her comments on her eating habits is affecting me. on the other side i don\u2018t think i really was able to tell her what\u2018s going on in my mind when i\u2018m struggeling with my eating habits/ my weight/ my look so i\u2018m not angry at her.\n\nanybody else having those difficulties?\nhow have you dealt with it?\nand what thought has helped you to cope with situations like these?\n\n\ntake care! and thanks for reading",

      "body": "I totally understand this because I have gone through this. I\u2019m the fattest in my friends group and colleagues. So every woman I know (of all sizes, including the skinny ones) are talking about their diet or exercise regime. It did trigger me a lot. \n\nWhenever I feel like this I think, \nEveryone is different, this other person is lucky enough to have good genes and a great metabolism and a lucky enough to not have my eating disorder. There are other things where I\u2019m luckier (in my case it\u2019s my career). So I should not compare her life and journey with myself because our lives and experiences are extremely different.\n\nAlso regarding her lack of empathy, \nMy husband is also one those tall skinny people. Also his family has this genetic disorder where they have trouble storing fat, it\u2019s bad to the extent his whole family is either underweight or in the verge becoming underweight. Because of this reason obviously he was never judged for his eating which resulted in him developing a very healthy relationship with food. So he also often forgets to eat (because no one controlled his eating so consequently his brain doesn\u2019t rebel and eat). In the beginning of our relationship even I thought he was indirectly mocking me when he said things like \u201cI forgot to eat\u201d, \u201cI felt lazy to eat\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m full for dessert\u201d. But he never made my weight an issue so eventually I understood that he genuinely meant those things about forgetting to eat. This was one of the reasons that prompted me to realize that I have a eating disorder. So in case of your boyfriend\u2019s flat mate, it\u2019s highly likely she actually forgot to eat and for someone who never had to lose weight in life it may look like something that can be solved by just eating less and exercising (which is not true at all). \n\nSo don\u2019t beat yourself comparing with other people. Focus on your journey. You have got this.",

In those moments I have to remind myself of how much progress I've made and that what I was doing was self harm, which is never a positive thing.\n\nMaybe one thing you can do is work out what triggers you, then look into why. Also maybe approaching a doctor to find out if your eating habits are actually damaging your health or if its all psychological. If it's not actually causing any physical issues then it's your mindset that needs to be changed (can be done via therapy), if there are concerns about physical health, then the diet would need to be addressed (can be done via a dietitian). \n\nEither way, please remember that eating disorders can be seen almost like an addiction, and recovery can be a slow process. Due to this, there is no need to feel guilty, apologise or explain yourself when you have slip ups, just take some time to recognise when they happen, events that lead up to the slip (so you can see if there's a pattern that can be avoided), and how you will get back on track in a healthy way.\n\nGood luck to you.
