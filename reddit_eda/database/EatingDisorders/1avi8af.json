  "selftext": "I just returned from a doctor's appointment where I received the news of kidney failure due to my bulimia. I felt a sudden urgency to share on this subreddit (apologies for my English, it's not my first language).\n\nI used to believe that, having engaged in constant binging and purging for only two years, I hadn't yet harmed my body. Unfortunately, I unknowingly severely damaged my kidneys, leading to kidney failure.\n\nI struggle with guilt and anger towards myself for not seeking help sooner, realizing that it might have prevented my current situation. I've often postponed my recovery, saying, \"I'll start next week\" or \"I'm not sick enough.\" Now, I face the consequences, but I promise myself that from today onward, I will prioritize my health and reclaim my old life \u2764\ufe0f.\n\nThis serves as a reminder for those reading \u2013 please seek help and talk to someone because you deserve better, and it will get better, trust me. Sending everyone a virtual hug and a kiss on the forehead, acknowledging that asking for help is hard, but it's even harder to endure the consequences \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f.",
