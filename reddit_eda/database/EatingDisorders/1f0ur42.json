      "body": "Oh jeez, you're pretty young to be so far in recovery, I'm honestly pretty jealous. We seem to have the opposite problems though, it seems - for me, it was getting worse the older I got and the more responsibilities and priorities I had. When I was a child and then a teen, it was just kinda...there, as a backdrop of sorts. Though admittedly I spent most of my teenage years in active psychosis and most of my childhood years in dissociation, so I suppose in a sense I had bigger fish to fry as a child than I do now as an adult.\n\n\n\nPersonally, for me, COVID was like...very very bad and I didn't take care of myself at all and struggled with alcoholism because I couldn't bear being around my abusive family 24/7 and alcohol was the only thing that kept me from breaking down constantly. I think my mental health started getting better only when I finally moved out (despite my family's protests), but ironically around that time, my eating disorder also got way worse. \n\n\n\n\nI'm honestly unsure if I should be working out at this time, because so far whenever I began exercising, my brain went \"This is a competition and we need to be the best or we are the worst. Also you should start restricting.\" So I'm kinda wary of it because I feel like I could relapse very easily if I introduced exercise into my week schedule. I try to walk a lot and stretch to stay healthy, but I don't think I'm ok enough to try actual exercise. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem for me is that I do see my body as an object, something that is just a tool to achieve things, but I do not consider stuff I want to do important? Like in my mind, the purpose of the object that is my body is to make everyone love me. So I see my body as an object designed to earn everyone's affection and at the same time to protect me from unwanted touch. And there's like this funny doublethink going on where the part of me that sees the objective of the body as earning affection thinks that a body that is \"universally attractive\" is a bony one, whereas the part of me that thinks that the objective of the body is to make sure nobody can ever touch/hurt me thinks that a bony body looks ill and sharp and therefore nobody will want to touch it or come close. Honestly I think I have problems with seeing the body even a little bit as a subject, like I feel very disconnected from it most of the time, like it's just a tool I'm forced to inhabit. Like even when I speak, I tend to make a distinction between me, my body, and my brain. \n\n\n\n\n\nSo yeah unfortunately it seems like we have kinda the opposite problem. But again tbh I think it's super impressive that you're only 22 and this far in recovery!! Most people are only starting to seek out therapy during their early 20s.",

Since you were a model, I assume that the measuring tape may have been a problem for you, especially since, afaik, do get measured frequently.\n\n\n\nAsking because it's a problem for me, like I tend to body check using a measuring tape, which is in the end not any better than obsessively weighing myself, but the thing is I'm not really sure how I'd exist in a household without any measuring tapes? Like you know, sometimes you need to measure a table or something else, so you need at least one measuring tape. And I've been known to use even the technical measuring tape, not just the one made for measuring bodies, to body check.",
