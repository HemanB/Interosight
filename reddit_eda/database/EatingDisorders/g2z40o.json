  "selftext": "Please post?\n\nI\u2019m hungry when I wake up. I can\u2019t start the work day without breakfast or else I can\u2019t concentrate and feel dizzy or lightheaded and distracted by hunger. I\u2019m not one of those people who can just have a coffee and be fine until lunch. \n\nMy boyfriend, who I live with, is the opposite. He can just have some coffee, lie in bed and look at his phone, and not need food for hours. If he does have something it\u2019ll be like a handful of nuts or a protein bar while I cook a whole breakfast with eggs and stuff. He\u2019s over a foot taller than me and never worries about gaining weight no matter how much he eats so already it\u2019s hard to not compare myself to him. \n\nI feel so embarrassed when I wake up in the morning feeling hungry and wanting breakfast. I can\u2019t bring myself to say \u201cI\u2019m hungry\u201d and I feel like if I make breakfast I have to hide it. I feel ashamed that I need food when I wake up but someone so much bigger than me doesn\u2019t. Sometimes I\u2019ll make myself wait several hours until he\u2019s hungry and wants to eat with me. If he wants to go to the store or something first I\u2019ll go with him, feeling lightheaded the whole time. \n\nCan anyone relate? I hate this.",

If you don't believe me, please check out this Link: [https://www.apa.org/monitor/2013/10/hunger](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2013/10/hunger)\n\nDon't even worry about WHY he is not hungry - who cares? it has nothing to do with you or your level of hunger.

It probably happens sometimes because he's a different person with different hunger cues.\n\nI agree with other posters that you shouldn't feel guilty, but I understand feeling that way because I've also had an ED and it can make you feel guilty about completely natural things. Instead of going to the store and being lightheaded, what if you compromised by taking a snack to go or having a glass of milk before you go? That way you wouldn't necessarily have to bring it up that you're hungry, but you can also be kind to your body and get some fuel.

He's not try to shame me, but I just wish he'd ignore me and let me eat in peace. \n\nWhy?\n\nWell, we used to work together, and before we got into a relationship, we only saw each others in the lunch room before and after work (we are crane operators).\nI am average height, get called skinny a lot, but I eat like an animal when I'm hungry.\nEvery morning I'd get to work around 5am and cook myself a full cooked breakfast; eggs, bacon/tuna on toast. I'd sit there and eat at the back of the room, but this didn't stop every one of my male colleges (I was the only female operator) commenting on my breakfast eating habits.\nOnce we were together, he admitted that he would watch me eat my meals in horrified astonishment like the rest of the guys. I was never trying to be elegant, but he confirmed that it was... unattractive.\n\nI dont understand how the rest of them, including my partner, run on nothing but a coffee until lunch or dinner. I'm starting to feel dizzy and hangry again within a couple of hours of my big breakfast.\n\nI got so tired of being harassed and shamed I'd try to get to work even earlier to make breakfast, but eventually I gave up and just took food with me to eat on the way to the job. \n\nPeople think its OK to comment, especially if you don't appear to have a problem in their eyes. Because I'm currently a \"healthy weight\", apparently it's fair game to shame me for eating \"like a man\". \n\nI actually used to be bulimic as a late teen, I have serious concerns about any weight I put on... thanks Mum.\n\nIt's been over 10 years since I purged for the reason of shame and body image, but I'm still extremely emotionally sensitive about my body and people's opinion of it and what I eat.\n\nIt's not abnormal for me to eat two steak and cheese pies in a sitting, three on occasion, and I used to laugh about the shit my partner would give me. \nBut today, I'm emotionally spent in all other areas, food hasn't come close to my lips in over 12hrs because of other issues. But now I'm really really hungry, and there are two pies just waiting meters away from me.\n\nYet somehow, the chance that my boyfriend makes a comment is so high, and I feel so fragile, I just can't risk eating the pie. Somehow writing this seems a lot easier than facing my fear and just eating the bloody pie.\n\nIn summary, your body works in its own way, you can't compare yourself to one male, one female or all of them combined. \n\nI'm pretty sure my brain chemistry is a major player in keeping my weight down and my appetite high. I'm a major overthinker and that brain in your head is the most energetically expensive organ you own. \nIf im too stressed I can't eat, but once it drops to a manageable level, the hungry beast awakens and needs feeding ASAP. \nAlso, a physical job makes a big difference, I tend to fuel up then run at full revs until my body screams at me to stop and eat or ill fall over. Unlike so many of my colleagues, I also need constant refueling to avoid the nausea, crash and burn.\nBest thing I can do is listen to my body... still got plenty of work to do in that area, but it beats any dietary rules I've heard from any other source.\n\nYou do you, good luck.",

He\u2019s not thinking \u201comg she\u2019s so fat for eating in the morning.\u201d He\u2019s probably thinking nothing about it; and if he\u2019s isn\u2019t thinking nothing about it he should be because there\u2019s nothing wrong with it. Your body is telling you when it needs food, that doesn\u2019t make you a bad or weak person. Your body is saying \u201chey I need food right now.\u201d If a baby or child told you they were hungry in the morning you wouldn\u2019t judge them; don\u2019t be so hard on yourself. Everyone is different, wanting to eat in the morning depends on your body. Your body is always trying it\u2019s best for you and all it\u2019s asking is for you to give it what it needs and it lets you know when it needs it. I 100% understand where you\u2019re coming from, I hate eating when other people aren\u2019t, but it\u2019s just your ED trying to keep hold of you. It is 100000% okay to eat when someone else isn\u2019t. Don\u2019t think of it as a weakness, think of it as you taking care and listening to what your body needs. In the morning your body is telling you that you need food.\n\nEdit: I just wanted to fix some punctuation.",
