  "selftext": "I don't usually post much on here but I legit have no idea what to do anymore. \n\nI'm on vacation with a close friend of mine and they've started developing an ED. at the moment they're doing keto, IF and low fat all at the same time and constantly making comments about the food that everyone else is eating, as they get a special plate with just barely any meat and some veggies. they also constantly talk about burning the calories and it's extremely triggering for me. \n\nseeing their eating habits and hearing all the food talk has made my recovery extremely hard and every day is a huge struggle so I don't relapse. \n\nI've tried talking to them about it and they said they would do less food talk but it hasn't actually happened. I've also tried explaining what this road would do to them but they seem legit proud of what they're doing. \n\nI'm scared for my own as well as their well being. any advice on what I should do?",

      "body": "You might need to distance yourself from said friend. They\u2019re triggering you and that puts you in a really dangerous position. \n\nAdmittedly, they seem to be developing an ED. You\u2019ve tried to talk to them but they obviously don\u2019t really care that they\u2019re affecting you. That\u2019s also really worrying considering that your friend\u2019s going down that path. If you could have a serious heart to heart, and explain how much it hurts and affects you, it might help (but i cannot make any guarantees). \n\nYou are your most important person. You need to do what\u2019s best for you, first, and then worry about your friend. That fact that it\u2019s triggering you so much and you\u2019re worried of a relapse, that\u2019s not okay. It sounds like their habits are making either the situation or friendship toxic, and you need to separate yourself from that. Your friend also needs to understand that not everything is about them, and that the food talk is really damaging your psyche. I get that they\u2019re developing an ED, but considering that you\u2019ve already have one I\u2019d say you\u2019re more at risk out of the two of you. You need to look out for yourself and get into a better mindset, either by leaving your friend for a while or really connecting with them and helping them understand how serious this is to you and said person. \n\nI hope i\u2019m not coming across as harsh, especially towards your friend, but you do not deserve this. Recovery by itself is already excruciatingly hard, and your friend talking about food the way they do and being really open about their progression w their ED isn\u2019t good for you in the recovery stage. Distance yourself or really get them to understand how toxic that behavior is, not only to them but especially to you. You deserve to be happy and healthy, and at the moment things sound pretty toxic. \n\nYou are worthy of recovery. You are worthy of being happy. Do everything you can to become as such, because you can\u2019t save your friend if you can\u2019t even save yourself. Don\u2019t become the white knight. Be cautious and understand that you and your recovery is the most important thing to you. Sending you love, be safe. Keep us updated if you want :\u2019)",

      "body": "Ugh i have a friend who does similar things. I\u2019m sorry, I know that\u2019s extremely hard to hear those things and continue to do the right thing for yourself. But even though they seem proud, they\u2019re misguided because disordered eating isn\u2019t something to be proud of. What IS something to be proud of is continuing to push forward with your recovery when you\u2019re forced to hear the voice of your eating disorder come out of your friends mouth. If your friend is truly developing an ed, they might act proud and happy and think they\u2019re doing something right and all that, but deep down they\u2019re actually miserable and hurting, and not living a full life. Remember what it\u2019s like to be completely consumed by your ed? Think of your worst eating disorder day. How miserable and dark and hopeless everything feels? And even though recovery is hard and you don\u2019t always feel great, I\u2019d guess it\u2019s probably better than that. Consider that they might be in that dark place, and remember that it\u2019s not better than where you are now. Also, something that helps me with my friend is to continue to push in my recovery and not sit still. I feel better knowing I still have an eating disorder and have more to do in my recovery, so I work towards that and put my energy into it. There\u2019s always more progress to be made, but I hope that encourages you rather than discourages you.",

      "body": "I wouldn't be quick to say they are developing an eating disorder, first of all. Obsession over fitness and nutrition is not an ED, but can be a a biproduct of one. Eating disorders are less about the behaviors and more about what goes on in one's head to make them act the way they do. It's okay to be concerned for them, but be careful giving unsolicited advice. If you are triggered, set boundaries and communicate to your friends why you are triggered. Use more \"I feel\" language and not try to project your personal struggles on her.\n\nXoxo to you in your recovery. You've got this!",

Not a word about it to you or other people. If she is a true friend or even just a decent person she will take that to heart . And if she continues to do so you should tell her you can\u2019t be around her anymore. Seems\nharsh but setting these boundaries are important. I\u2019ve had people to it to me with things.",
