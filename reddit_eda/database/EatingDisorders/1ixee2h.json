  "selftext": "I\u2019ve always hated my body. Ever since I was a child, I was the chubby one, the baby who ate a lot, the kid who got teased for it. My family never meant harm, but their words stuck with me. As I got older, I became hyper-aware of my body, constantly comparing myself to others. By the time I reached high school, those thoughts had settled in, whispering that I wasn\u2019t good enough.\n\nFor years, I carried that self-hatred, but it wasn\u2019t until five years later that I finally acted on it. I started restricting strictly, with purpose. I had always hated my thighs, my bottom, the way my body carried weight, even though I was at a \u201cnormal\u201d weight. I told myself that if I just lost enough, maybe I\u2019d finally feel okay. And I did lose quite a lot of weight. \n\nBut before I could fully sink into it, I was forced into early recovery. My parents made a deal with me: if I wanted to go back to univ, I had to get back on track.\n\nSo, I ate. I regained some weight. But the thoughts never left. I still restricted at times, still found comfort in emptiness. I liked that feeling, of being light, of not needing anything. I exercised at home, but mostly, I walked a lot. Anything to keep the guilt away.\n\nNow, I\u2019ve been all-in for a week. Completely honest with myself. No more pretending. And I\u2019m scared. My digestion is a mess, my stomach feels sluggish, and it\u2019s like I\u2019m reliving the first time I tried to recover. \n\nI made the mistake of looking back at old pictures. Pictures of me before the restriction, before I lost the weight. And I hated what I saw. I felt disgusted. I know I was never overweight, I know logically that my body was \u201cfine\u201d, but I still can\u2019t stand looking at those images. I prefer my body after restriction, even after everything it put me through. Even knowing how much pain it caused me, I still struggle to let it go. And I don\u2019t know how to change that.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just my body that haunts me. It\u2019s my past. The life I had before all of this. The way I used to eat, how I actually enjoyed food, how it used to be something that made me happy. The people I was surrounded by \u2026\n\nAnd now, looking back, it feels like I can\u2019t recognize that person. It\u2019s almost like I\u2019m traumatized by it. But the truth is, I wasn\u2019t totally unaware back then. I did have thoughts about my body and food, but they were quieter \u2026\n\nNow there are things that feel really hard, things that are holding me back, and after just a few days of trying, I already feel like I\u2019m slipping. This weekend has set me back. I really don\u2019t want the body I had before. I don\u2019t want to go back to that version of myself, but I don\u2019t know how to move forward either.\n\nOne of the biggest things I need to work on is how much I compare myself to others. I\u2019m stuck in this endless cycle of measuring my body against everyone else\u2019s. It\u2019s exhausting, but I can\u2019t stop. It\u2019s even affecting my friendships. I feel like I can\u2019t be friends with people who are skinnier than me. By the way i\u2019ve self isolated myself A LOT. \n\nAnyway, thank you for reading my journey. If you\u2019re going through something similar, I hope you find the strength to keep going. I know how hard it is. But I also know we can\u2019t stay stuck here forever :/\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "body": "I'm so sorry about what's happening to you, and I can relate a lot to what you said about always being the \"chubby\" kid, and about how eating was something you enjoyed so much and looked forward to before everything. It never really bothered me that much until I reached a certain age, and it didn't help that my parents were never really there for me and were one of the contributors to my ED. Lost a lot of weight till I was underweight and even then I was never happy with myself, and it hit me so hard that it was never about how I \"light\" I felt (just the way you put it), but about how confident I was, and how I perceived myself. I kept chasing an \"ideal\" body and weight, but the reality was I was chasing approval from others because I couldn't deal with my own self-hatred.  \n  \nI was never even overweight or obese, I was \"normal\" too. Please focus more on what makes \\*you\\* feel good physically, and that means eating right and eating when you're hungry. I completely understand the feeling of being guilty for feeling full, or guilty for eating anything you've labelled as \"bad\" during your restriction, but you are worth so much more than your comparisons to other people, or how they view you.  Your value will never, ever be determined by the numbers on the scale, and even \\*that's\\* still a struggle for me to grasp. Even though I was never happy with my body, a part of me still wishes I could feel as lightweight as I did during my restriction. What helped for me was seeing a psychologist every week (still do), and tackling the other issues that caused the ED. When you dig deeper, you'll realize it was never about food.  \n  \nRecovery isn't easy, and I'm still going through the process, but you and I can take it one step a time. You got this!",
