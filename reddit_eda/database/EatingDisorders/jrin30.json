I\u2019ve already gained about xx lbs and I see a big difference in my body.\n\nIt started when I wanted to stop my binge-restrict cycle last month so I went two whole weeks with no restrictions and no guilt, but I just ended up binging and after that I think developed a junk food addiction. I\u2019ve tried intuitive eating and calorie counting to lose weight but both keep ending up in binges. \n\nThis is the worst my binging has gone and I\u2019m so desperate to get better. I wanna see a therapist but I won\u2019t be able to handle it if he/she tells me I need to gain or maintain weight in order to recover.\n\nDoes anyone have advice? It feels like I\u2019ve lost control over my entire life because of binging.",

You just reached your breaking point and that is actually great.\n\nIt's a natural reaction of the body to want to get out of a severe deficit. Even if you aren't underweight by the BMI chart, you may be underweight for your body, which is just as bad! Let yourself eat unrestrictedly, only then will those moments where you can't stop... stop. You are on the right track! Please don't be afraid to let go of your food rules; only this will enable you to recover and live a full live again.\n\nBefore you started eating a lot, you were living in a state of chronic undereating. Like another poster mentioned, check out the Minnesota starvation study.\n\nThat is my experience. I only ate as you described until my hunger cues etc normalized, which wasn\u2019t even that long.\n\nMore importantly, give yourself permission to eat. That way, you aren't always going to be taking in big quantities as food at once and feel guilty about it later.\n\nEating isn't something to be ashamed of or feel guilty about.\n\nPlease don\u2019t listen to the person telling you to go on a juice cleanse. Prolonging your restriction will only keep you stuck in the restriction \u2013 craving big quantities of food cycle. I promise you things will normalize.\n\nI also started dieting and got an ED because I went too far but recovery didn\u2019t make me overweight at all, not even remotely. I look good and feel good now. You aren\u2019t going to go back to where you started.\n\nAbout sports: **Any** exercise while battling an eating disorder is a no-no, especially competitive sports. Look at it that way: sports are holding you back. There\u2019s a big chance that you'll be able to return to sports after you're recovered. But recovery AND sports/exercise/sports competitions aren't compatible because they have goals that contradict each other.\n\nQuitting exercise/sports for now is a step in the right direction, despite what your ED and even your family and friends may be telling you. And you don\u2019t have to quit forever if you\u2019re honest with yourself on the road to recovery and do what it takes.\n\nLast but not least: talk to people who you think will judge you. Tell them about your problem. That way, they're less likely to judge and you're less likely to feel isolated. If people still judge, **they are the problem.**\n\nYou can always DM me for support; just keep in mind that I'm not a pro. \n\nDo you have your period still after the weight loss? (Sorry for the directness)\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid of seeking professional help; just research the therapists you pick a lot.",

I can understand why you would feel this way IF I was asking her to restrict. \n\nThe OP states, \"I think developed a junk food addiction.\" She also states she's been bingeing every single day for a month. \n\nWhen we binge for this long our digestive systems become backed up and our connection to our bodies become NILL. \n\nHaving been here in the past myself, I understand the cycle being disconnected to our bodies bring. We eat, and eat, and eat, and eat. **The addiction to the food is all we feel.** \n\nCleansing the digestive system will help this. [(This technique is also done in actual centers.)](https://www.hawaiinaturopathicretreat.com/conditions/addiction/food-addiction/)\n\nWhat's worked for me here is to get everything moving. The easiest quickest way to do this is to start the day with fruit. NOT EAT ONLY FRUIT. Simply, **start the day with fruit.** \n\nNow, if the purpose is to move it through, eat the fruit wait two hours and then **eat regularly. No restriction advised at all in this or that post.** \n\nGive your digestive tract the space to move things through so that you can reconnect to the body once again. \n\nI don't think this will help, I KNOW this will help. One week where she is connecting to natural foods--water based foods first thing in the morning will **DISCONNECT** her from the need to eat junk food. [Digestion will help her feel calm.](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/chronic-constipation-ease-stress) She will start to feel sane again. \n\nBut then, that's up to her to try. \n\nI hope this helped clear things up.",
