  "selftext": "I have posted on the sub before to get advice and ask if if I had \u201ceating disorder like habits\u201d I got a few replies and all of them replied with a form of \u201cyes\u201d...... this was scary for me because I didn\u2019t want to develop an ED eventually, I\u2019m pretty sure nobody does. It started off with me losing weight I\u2019m still not at my \u201cgoal weight\u201d yet so I don\u2019t feel like I can stop yet but I\u2019m a healthy weight according to the BMI calculator, I count my calories before I would just guess but I recently started to use the food scale in my kitchen and it\u2019s made me even more obsessed with calories and my weight. Over the past few days I\u2019ve been restricting myself by leaving only a few hundred calories but yesterday I didn\u2019t I ate almost all my calories only leaving about ten this was big for me since I hadn\u2019t done it a week I felt good about this and thought maybe I\u2019m getting better....Wrong! I always plan my meals before since I usually cook for myself I\u2019m only 16 so I still live with my family but they give me freedom to eat what I want and cook for myself but my stepmom decided to make ribs, baked beans, and coleslaw I didn\u2019t know the calories for the food and this absolutely terrified me so before she cooked I went to the store and I got pre-made food from the deli and hid it so they wouldn\u2019t know I had gotten something else and I don\u2019t want to be rude so I made a plate of the food she cooked but I threw it away as soon as I got to my room and just took out the food I bought and ate instead.....I never did that before and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good sign. I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s normal to obsess and constantly think about food, exercise, and calories. Please help me I want to get better if anyone could offer me support I would gladly accept I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m ready to talk to this about the people in my life...",

Please throw out the scale or stop using it and seek help from your family as you are only 16. The best thing would be to be open with your parents about this so they can assist you and help you seek help from a doctor. Try to fight the urges to weight everything and to count calories, you\u2019re strong don\u2019t give up!",

      "body": "Hey friend, \n\nHere are a couple of thoughts and words of encouragement I have for you. \n\nFirst: Calories aren't really what would help you lose weight--the kind of calories also matter. So make sure that the food you're eating is actually healthy, natural, and good for you. Don't exchange good, home-cooked meals for chemical-filled stuff (not that you're necessarily doing that--just a warning!). Do some research, find healthy foods that make you feel full but not heavy, start a good, regular exercise routine, and remember to drink lots of clean, clear water. That would help you flush out your system and make your body cleaner and work better!\n\nSecond, I know it's hard to talk to people you know about this, but speaking from expeirnce, the people who live with you are those who know you best and who are in the best place to really help you when and how you need it. Maybe ask them to think of, and cook, some lighter, more healthy (less calories if that's what you want) foods as an alternative for you? Or just ask them if they're okay with you eating something else. That would take away the \"rudeness\" of not eating what they've cooked, if you just ask first and share your concerns so they know what you're struggling with. \n\nHope that helps you somewhat! Blessings.",

      "body": "I am glad that you are able to recognize that these things rant healthy. An eating disorder int about the food/weight its about control.  Your caloric intake what you eat don't eat how much you weigh these are all things you can control. What else is going on in your life? What are other things you are sutrgglig with?  I would start by find a therapist or a counselor. They can help you breakdown and tackle those issues in your life. I have found that talking with someone who isn't family/friends help a lot. Start by getting ride of the scale. Read about whole nutrition. Its not about restricting but getting the right anount of nutrience. Grains, fruits, veggie, dairy and fats all work together to make you strong mentally and physically.  If you ever want to talk feel free to message me. I will not judge just listen and offer my honest thoughts.",

      "body": "This is definitely disordered eating but its good that you recognize it. I would recommend reading about intuitive eating. Anti-Diet is also a great book. Constantly thinking of or obsessing about food is because of restriction. When you diet or restrict yourself you are signaling famine to your body. Eventually a binge will happen and/or your body will put weight back on. Every body has a set point weight range and your body will fight to get and stay there. Its not worth it, trust me. Enjoy the food and your life! Throw away the scales, stop tracking calories, and just eat what you want when you're hungry. No good foods or bad foods, it all gives your body what it needs to function properly.",

      "body": "I'm glad you recognize it! I get what you mean though, I used to hide food from my parents all the time... I know it's really scary to face calories but also try and remind yourself a plate of ribs won't really change anything, it's just one meal. \n\nEasier said than done, but it sounds like you're allowed to eat alone right? It might sound weird and it might sound like not really progress but next time when you're alone with a meal like that try making yourself eat it (don't give up on me yet, I know that sounds like a dick thing to say). \n\nLet yourself be upset and afraid though, it's okay if it takes you 3 hours to eat that plate of ribs and it's okay if you cry your eyes out the whole time. I can't tell you how many times I've cried my eyes out eating burgers, pizza, ribs, cake, icecream, etc. Really it's a lot of times... but the next morning I always looked the same and now those things aren't as stressful for me. Don't not eat super awesome tasty food because you're afraid of it. The first few times maybe you'll only get half the meal or less down before you have to quit but keep forcing yourself to face those fears. \n\nI've always found it helpful to call a friend to chat or hang out after to help distract me for the night since I'd always feel so horrible after.",
