  "title": "Request: Has Anyone Ever Felt Fully Recovered?",
  "selftext": "Hi all. I have been struggling with an ED for some time now. I'm on again off again with relapsing and healthy eating/trying my best to recover.  My main question is does anyone ever feel fully recovered? I feel like when I'm in my best state of mind and I'm eating again, I still have nagging thoughts in the back of my mind of thinking I could be skinnier, I could weigh less, I could eat less. After so long of this thinking, I eventually relapse back into my ED. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is all very frustrating as I want to recover and eat normally, but sometimes it feels like I will never be able to turn off that part of my brain. Has anyone ever been able to turn off that state of mind/line of thinking? Or do you just get better at ignoring it? Do you ever feel fully recovered?",

      "body": "Yes and no. It's been over ten years since I've lived with an ED and almost every time I eat or think about eating I have to talk myself out of wanting to give in. Sometimes i fail and other times I don't. I try to think of it in a positive light that it's slowly losing the grip that it used to have over my entire life. I also remind myself of how absolutely HORRIBLE it got. Even though I was the skinniest I had ever been and was in control of my life, I lost control of everything else. Friends, money, my health. Sometimes its good to reflect how much better you are now. I don't know if it ever goes away. But overtime it loses the grip it has on your life.  You can do it.",

That is really hard to do, to tell yourself I will NEVER intentionally lose weight ever again and that I will not allow myself to believe thinner is better. I believe you need to get into a HAES mindset, you need to genuinely address your internalized fat-phobia and educate yourself on the influence of diet culture while also removing yourself from the diet-mentality. I don't think anyone can fully recover until they make peace with the possibility of being fat because if you aren't willing to be fat, then you are telling yourself... okay I will gain weight til a point and if i get overweight I will go back to my ED to get my weight down. That doesn't mean you will get fat, that just means that if you do, you won't hate yourself or do anything intentional to change your weight.   \n\n\n  \nThis is my fourth round of recovery but my first round in which I was truly challenging my own fat-phobia and trying to rewire my brain to no longer see weight loss as good and gain as bad. That means every time I weigh myself I celebrate the gain, rather than freak out. It is a process but it is so freeing compared to a recovery where I still am holding on to thin-ideals.",

Force feeding isn\u2019t healthy. I drink water when I am sick, I listen to what my body needs or doesn\u2019t at the time.\n\nI do get tired of being asked if I ate. Every time I\u2019ve lost weight and for some reason my body keeps dropping weight, my mom stares at me and looks concerned and sort of like she doesn\u2019t believe me.

I don\u2019t say this in order to create negativity, but I say this so that you can create realistic goals. It is about having less relapses and controlling your disease instead of its controlling you. You may and probably will get ED thoughts when you are stressed etc but recovery means being able to fight with them and sometimes not beating yourself up when you relapse and being able to get yourself together after a relapse easier. That is what I experience and observed in other people and heard from professionals who work in that field. I used to have ED thoughts and urges every single day and could not imagine going a single day without performing my rituals, but now I am not consumed by them everyday. I can control the urges and still relapse but it is like rare compared to the past. Think of it like other addictions. An alcoholic will never be fully recovered and will have a need to control his urges when he feels down etc. You cannot see a \u2018recovered\u2019 alcoholic who has a completely healthy relationship with alcohol like a person who has never been an alcoholic. So ED is the same.",
