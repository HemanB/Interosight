  "selftext": "So I consider myself 3 years recovered. However, right now I'm overweight. Im not confident with my body and I've been working hard to get to where I want to be. Im working out daily and calorie counting. But progress is so slow for the amount of work I think I'm putting in. I know this is the healthy and normal way to lose weight. But I keep wishing I could go back to my ED habits to just shed it off fast. Can any one offer advice or relate to this? How do you get on shape in a healthy way without constantly wanting to go back to your old ways?",

Keep doing the daily work then check progress once a month. You're establishing habits and lifestyle changes that will last, so you'll have lasting weight loss and never have to do it again. The time will pass anyway.... Just plod along and keep chipping away... Focus on changes you CAN see.. Let that keep you on the straight and narrow.\n\nAsk yourself:\nWhy did you start doing it the healthy way to begin with ?? There might be your own answer :-)",

It\u2019s taken me a lot of time to lose this the healthy way. Although at the height of my poor body image I did slip back into ED behaviors. I have made a lot of changes, including changing my mental health medications. Moderate-intense exercise and balanced eating is all you can do and expect of yourself if you don\u2019t want to get too intense. \n\nIt is easy to go back to behaviors, but those are not only bad for your physical and mental health, but they are not sustainable. You will inevitably burn out. Focus on moving your body in ways that make you feel good and eat foods that make you satisfied. Not need to go to extremes. Also finding health and fitness professionals that are good at educating diet and exercise in healthy, conscious ways that don\u2019t promote ED behaviors or unrealistic results has been so helpful for me!\n\nEdited: I should also say sometimes it\u2019s necessary to gain weight in recovery. I do not at all believe it is necessary to lose weight when considered \u201coverweight\u201d. Plenty of people can be healthy and overweight. If you able to talk to a RD or nutritionist that would probably be super helpful.",

He suggested trying to count calories to see how many I am normally eating/day but not to cut any the first week, then cut 15% for a few weeks, ultimately slowly decreasing the amount to what I *should* be eating. But all I heard and what has stuck with me is \"cut calories\".  It's only been 5 days and I've slipped so quickly back into old habits and as much as I hate to admit it, it feels so good.

I\u2019m overweight in my opinion and every time I start to healthily loose weight I get discouraged and wish I could start back with my ED habits. I have a scale and count calories so I am aware what I am consuming but it is taking forever snd I am having a hard time loosing any weight. I am working out, drinking almost a gallon of water a day, eating healthy. Some times I wish I could go back to my ED. It\u2019s hard but hearing from other people gives me hope and makes me feel like I\u2019m not alone. Good luck snd hope your weight loss journey goes well and makes you happy and healthy!",

Now I'm eating a little less than a normal human, dancing 3-9 hours a week, and doing yoga every couple of days, and it feels like I just keep gaining weight, even though I know that's not necessarily true. It's so discouraging, but thankfully I have a husband who keeps me accountable, makes sure I maintain healthy eating habits, and works out with me. \n\nYou're not alone, but don't take that as a sign that these are good ideas to hold onto! I think accountability is helpful. Having someone who knows what you struggle with and who can help you maintain healthy habits will make it a lot easier. Do you have someone like a roommate, parent, or sibling who you spend a lot of time with and trust to be able to help you?",
