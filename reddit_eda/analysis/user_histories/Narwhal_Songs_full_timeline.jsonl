I cant control binge eating, I cant control purging, im scared for my teeth, im dizzy, im shaky, I guilty, I gain weight, I just feel like shit all the time.\n\nAnd when you eat less you save money, binge eat and wow your wallet is not happy. I am actually in debt because of it. And I have been thrown out by friends that I have stayed with more than once for binge eating.\nIts not treated like a serious disorder, like anorexia.", "parent_id": null, "link_id": null, "context": null}
