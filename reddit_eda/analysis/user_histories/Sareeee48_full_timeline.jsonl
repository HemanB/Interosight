He and I were in this weird phase where I was too sick to understand or even acknowledge his needs in the relationship outside of my anorexia and he didn’t know how to bring it up, so while he was at work all day I stayed at home, by myself, fantasizing about my single slice of cake I’d end up purging before he’d get home and then giving the rest to him and my roommates.\n\nThis year, my coworker bought me a cookie cake and the kids at work (I work at a daycare) made me cards and told me why they were grateful for me. My boyfriend requested Monday off so we could go to the aquarium together; he got me my favorite Starbucks drink, a mini Carvel ice cream cake for the two of us, and vodka and such for Sea Breeze cocktails; my best friend ordered me a pizza; and tomorrow we’re going to the city to get me some art supplies and maybe even my own skateboard.\n\nA lot of the time, I struggle to see the good things in recovery, but this is the first birthday I’ve been genuinely grateful for everything I have and it’s all because I finally chose everything else over anorexia. This the first day I’ve noticed I’ve been genuinely happy.", "title": "My first birthday in 6 years without anorexia *TW for weight numbers", "context": null}

Peanut butter was one of the foods I fucking loved even when I was actively anorexic, but I only allowed myself one tablespoon of a specific brand once a day, maybe two if I restricted enough. It was basically the only “treat” I consistently allowed myself but it was *never* enough. I always wanted more but the fear and anxiety that thought caused me obviously dominated my choices. I even bought “zero calorie peanut butter” that was the worst thing id ever tasted, but I ate it because I wanted peanut butter so much.\n\nThe first month I started recovery, I remember I went through two of those big ass honey flavored Jif jars within a week and a half and it was amazing. I put that shit on everything. Toast, pb&js, bagels, oatmeal, waffles, smoothies, fruits, nuts, pretzels, desserts. I ate it straight out of the jar, fat ass spoonful after fat ass spoonful. Sometimes I’d change it up and buy almond butters and sun butters. It made weight restoration so much easier, and I still eat a spoonful almost everyday.\n\nIt’s crazy how this time last year, I was precisely measuring out a stupid tablespoon of peanut butter and giving myself a fucking conniption if i wasn’t 100% sure it was exactly a tablespoon. Today, I am grateful for peanut butter, and all the other nut butters that graced me with their delicious presence throughout my recovery.", "title": "Can we talk about how amazing peanut butter is?", "context": null}

I gave up purging, compulsive exercising, and food restriction every single day, for 366 days. I gained the weight, I honored my extreme hunger when there seemed to be no end in sight, I ignored the exceptionally terrible thoughts about myself every time my body demanded more food. I kept telling myself it wasn’t my fault that my brain was fucked up when I’d grip the new fat deposits distributed to my trunk and, in that moment, seriously contemplated relapse. On March 12, 2020, at approximately 10:30 am, I gave up the  simultaneously monotonous and chaotic lifestyle that is anorexia that I had been drowning in for years, and clung to recovery like it was my lifeline.\n\nI’m not foolish enough to call recovery a cakewalk, however. In fact, it’s been quite the opposite experience; the entire process has been the most difficult fucking thing I’ve ever had to do, to date. I cried almost every day for months, and I still frequently fall apart. As recently as December, I would say to myself over and over, “If I can’t be thin, I’d rather just be dead.” Absolute nothingness would have felt better than the constant psychological agony I was in every waking moment. \n\nOf course, despite the shitshow I perceived my own recovery to be, I now understand that a sick brain cannot think healthy thoughts until it is not sick anymore. A malnourished brain is a sick brain. So it’s no surprise to anyone that, when I was told things do in fact get better with time, I just had to trust them with nothing more than blind faith. “It gets better when you gain the weigh,” I naturally scoffed at such claims—I mean, haven’t we all? We all think *we’re* the exception. *I* was the exception. What if I’m always this hungry? What if I’m stuck in this disgusting blob of a meat sack for the rest of my life? What if I never accept myself post recovery? What if, what if, what if.\n\nSpoiler alert: I wasn’t the exception. I’m no longer consumed with thoughts about relapses and losing the overshoot weight.  The uncertainty will end. It just takes time, and I’m still in the midst of the unraveling of it all.\n\nNow, my fears haven’t necessarily dissipated. I’m still hyper aware of the physical sensations that my body experiences. The way fat folds when I sit, stand, bend down, breath in and out; the way my stomach dominates the space I take up, especially when I bloat; the way my shirts naturally fit tighter now that I’m no longer flat chested. I’m still terrified that this is my body now. And, naturally, it’s fucking uncomfortable. But Ive been telling myself, “I can tolerate my body just for today,” every single day for a year. What’s another year? Or two years?\n\nMy eating disorder has plagued me since childhood, and succeeded in digging it’s nails into my veins once more in early adulthood. Learning to cope with my body dysmorphia and this incessant need for control in healthy ways means flipping my whole world upside down. My body is still recovering, and the least I could do is give it some leeway. It unreasonable to expect my body to fit into such a tiny, rigid box when such rigidity is the very thing that was killing me to begin with.\n\nLong story short, I do believe recovery is worth it. And I hope you all choose it eventually, when you’re good and ready. ❤️\n\nI think I’ll do either a Q&A or a month-to-month overview of my recover and the psychological and physiological outcomes in the next day or so, so if there is anything you’d like to ask feel free to.", "title": "1 whooooole ass year", "context": null}

Less than 6% of people with eating disordered are diagnosed underweight, so please don’t talk to me about how there is no “ED body type,” and then try to tell me that not allowing intentional weight loss discussions is unfair. There is no ES body type—therefore, intentional weight loss is not the answer.\n\nWhat’s unfair is telling people in larger bodies that they should lose weight, *especially so* when they have eating disorders (restrictive or binge eating).

The concerns you’ve listed are valid concerns and should be addressed with compassion and kindness, but they *are* disordered. Often people don’t understand that weight gain (especially obesity) are very often a symptom of something else, and not because someone “lacks control.” We put the entire blame for being fat on the individual, and ignore the real underlying health and socioeconomic problems that are entirely independent of ourselves; we force the emphasis on weight because diet culture has taught us that weight is relevant entirely by itself, and it. Is. Not.\n\nWe know fat people can be healthy. We know living in poor conditions that significantly exacerbate stress lead to chronic health problems, including heart disease and others that can have weight gain as a symptom (it is *not* just an “overeating” problem). We know glorifying thinness and wellness culture are the reasons eating disorders (both restrictive and binge eating) and BDD are on the rise. So yeah, there is *way* too much emphasis on weight, even in the ED recovery community.\n\nEverything else, I agree with.

I’ve been meaning to make this post since my one year mark back in March, but I’ve just been so busy with... well, not being fucking sick for the first time in Y E A R S. And truthfully, I was unsure about how recovery had made me feel, not only physically but psychologically as well... but after January, I think I finally discovered myself again, and immersed myself in my creative endeavors all over again. It was as if I never fell out of it... but I digress.\n\nI’m going to go over my recovery month-by month, in detail, in hopes that it will be of some use to somebody in this sub. If you have any questions, feel free to ask!\n\n**Month 1:** I decided to recover the day my state went into lockdown. My extreme hunger kicked in *immediately*, which scared the shit out of me. I remember telling myself I would “allow” myself to eat, but only after I restricted for x amount of hours and only after I exercised... of course, I then found out gyms would remain closed for the foreseeable future (including my apartment’s sad excuse for a gym), and I was really forced to loosen my obsessive grip on exercise, which in turn convinced me to eat as well. It took me a few days, but I was able to throw myself into the throes of extreme hunger and eat according to my body’s needs. I ate every hour, as I’d feel physically ill and faint if I didn’t. I ate, and and, and then ate some more. Extreme hunger gave me no leniency during  the nighttime hours, either; I’d wake up every at least three times just to eat. Fuck, I remember counting up all of my calories once and I ate close to 11,000kcals in one day.\n\nI was constantly shoveling food into my mouth (particularly nutrient/caloric dense food—i.e., “processed junk food”), yet i was still hungry 30 minutes later. I suffered from gastroparisis long before recovery, so all that food just sat in my stomach for hours. I was so bloated that I looked as if I was in my third trimester of pregnancy. I immediately retained water, specifically in my hands, feet, legs, the entirety of my midsection, and my face. \n\nAround week 3, my emotions, which I’ve been numbing for literal *years*, were flipped back on. Everything made me cry; to my friend jokingly saying I hurt his feelings to my boyfriend’s tone shifting slightly. Everything f elt so overwhelming all the time.\n\nExtreme physical exhaustion basically forced me into hibernation, as I slept for 14 hours a day. The night sweats (aka, hypermetabolism) were so severe that I had to lay down a blanket underneath and use my own sheet to guarantee my partner’s side of the bed wouldn’t be soaked as well; everything I put into my body was immediately burned off because it just didn’t know what the fuck to do with it all. This stage was so miserable because I was constantly changing out of wet clothes and ensuring I ate more and more so I wouldn’t lose more weight. At this point, I have gained approximately 15 lbs of pure water and water weight, but have not gained true weight just yet.\n\n**Month 2-3:** by this time, I was no longer struggling with night sweats associated with hypermetabolism, though I still slept half the day away, cried frequently, and ate at a significant surplus. I could not be physically active for too long, as my legs would swell and I’d begin to feel faint. Month two was when I finally started gaining true weight. It felt rapid at first, but looking back I truly believe it was probably about 1.5-2 lbs a week. \n\nAt about two months, none of my ED jeans or shorts fit and I would have regular meltdowns, ranting and raving about how this is a nightmare and I must have gained a million pounds. But I continued eating.\n\n**Month 4-7:** these next three months were messy for me. Most of my pre-ED clothes didn’t fit at all, and my body image was at an all time low; my body dysmorphia was constantly being triggered every time I caught a glance at my\nown reflection. I was body checking at an all time high, compulsively checking every single angle, pinching my flesh, and begging my friends for reassurance they learned quickly not to give me. \n\nBut I still didn’t know what I looked like. Looking at photos from before I entered recover were surreal. I didn’t realized how emancipated I was—not just my weight, but my hair, the dark circles under my eyes, how pale and physically fragile I was, as if I’d shatter if I fell too hard (that was a real concern of mine, by the way). But when I looked at myself at this time in my recovery, I saw some hideous monster and that was very difficult for me. I developed a phobia of my own reflection and I began to miss my ED body.\n\nExtreme hunger had reduced around month 4, but was still present in my every day life. I had read so much about how others weight restored after just four months, and My rigid, OCD brain somehow convinced me that I absolutely **had** to be weight restored now, so I began to ignore the remnants of my extreme hunger and only allowed myself to eat [redacted] calories a day. Nothing as low as during my active anorexia, but still not enough to support my recovering body, which unfortunately still required a lot of food. I’m not completely sure as I never weighed myself once at this point, but I believe I lost a little bit of weight and my body was not happy about it.\n\nCouple all that with extreme food boredom and I fucking relapsed, got stuck in a state of quasi recovery, whatever you wanna call it, for 3.5 months. I was constantly hungry, but had zero appetite. It was especially bad at night.\n\n**Month 8-9:** I was able to pull myself out of that relapse and began honoring my extreme hunger once more. I was averaging about 4,000kcals a day for two months. I got rid of my ED clothes, and I started therapy after realizing that I was not recovering psychologically at all, my OCD was flairing up and my body dysmorphia forced me to think about the way I looked every hour of every day. The new clothes I’d bought suddenly felt tight and I noticed new fat deposits in places I’ve never had fat before. My face was swollen and my body felt tight from the water retention.\n\nI have a short short torso and long legs, which resulted in any weight gain I had to my trunk/abdomin region looked compact and too heavy. My ass, thighs, and upper arms also held a lot of weight, whereas my wrists, feet, calves and neck seemingly gained nothing at all. The best description for this foreign body would be, an adult sized toddler. It was uncomfortable and I felt alien in my body, all of the time.\n\nI had gotten a physical done for my new job, and I’d requested not to know what my weight is.... so they told me my BMI instead. I cried for an hour.\n\nThese months were very difficult for me, because recovery just felt hopeless and not at all worth it.\n\n**Months 10-12:** new year, new me—literally. I finally began to see the brighter side of recovery, just dimly. My extreme hunger vanished completely, for the first time in almost a year. I was still eating about 3,400-3,800kcals daily, but my body was still doing a lot of internal healing. I no longer thought about food and every once  in awhile I’d experience fullness. \n\nI dropped some water weight and no longer felt uncomfortably bloated and swollen. I stayed a consistent clothing size and no longer had to continuously buy new leggings and underwear.\n\nI still struggled immensely with my body dysmorphia, and an inability to look at myself from the neck down... but I suddenly had more energy to go back to weight lifting  purely for enjoyment and no aesthetic goal despite my (perceived) uneven weight distribution. I found motivation to start making art again. I laughed a lot more.\n\n**Month 13-14 (present):** my appetite has stabilized and I now experience hunger. I feel like I did, pre-ED  as far as hunger cues and my physical health feels. I have loads of energy to do the things I want, such as hiking, going on walks, and I’m able to be present no matter what food I might have to eat or if I might have to skip a workout (fun story, I dropped a weight on my foot and haven’t worked out properly in about 2 weeks). \n\nI have “overshot” by quite a lot compared to what I lost. My body feels extremely foreign to me, and my weight has yet to redistribute (all in the belly). However I’m slowly moving away from the concept that I’ll lose it. I want to feel comfortable in my body regardless of my size. My relationship has improved, I’m excelling at my job, and I get to eat freely and I can be present with friends, family and my therapist.\n\nThat isn’t to say I don’t have my struggles. I still can’t look in mirrors without feeling immense embarrassment and disgust. I’m currently struggling to ensure I’m eating enough when I’m stressed (going through a really rough time in my life). I have a bad habit of buying clothes that are too big and then crying about the size. But I am actively working on dismantling my own internalized fatphobia and practicing radical acceptance about this new body. I am aware of the things that trigger me and have to make the conscious decision to not give into compulsive ED thoughts, because at the end of the day I am responsible for my own mental health.\n\nTo sum this post up, recovery is fucking hard, often for a long damn time. But it is soooososososo worth it if you wade through the really fucking bad parts, when it feels like it isn’t worth it at all.

It’s literally in the rules.\n\nThere is a big fucking difference between encouraging others to explore more foods, especially later in recovery, and flat out telling others to eat less sugar or less carbs because some of you are afraid of swinging entirely in the other direction after restriction (which does not happen as often as people think).\n\nLook, extreme hunger is shitty, and it can be so, so hard. I went through a whole 10 months of it. It can be scary eating a lot of food, especially caloric/nutrient dense foods that are labeled “processed” and morally “bad” according to society, despite our bodies craving them because they get us out of that energy deficit the quickest (which is exactly what your body wants). This is even more true when they are fear foods we’ve avoided for months, or even years. Honoring those cravings, that hunger, and listening to your body (at your own pace, of course), is the only way to get over extreme hunger. Physical and mental restriction at bedt only prolongs the recovery process, at worst causes a full blown relapse.\n\nI’m **not** telling you what or how to recover; if you wanna cut out certain foods, you do you—but don’t discourage others from eating them either.

We are a recovery focused space. I dont care how well intentioned you are, these comments are hurtful and invalidating and lead people to question their hunger and possibly even a relapse.\n\nI find it weird you mentioned my support of all in, despite even saying in my post, and many times previously, that going at your own pace is totally fine. If you need a meal plan, follow a meal plan; just make sure you’re eating enough. If it’s easier to slowly add foods back in rather than going all-in (pun intended), then that’s okay. Some people work best with structure, others would rather just get it over with. Recovery is very subjective and everyone will recover at their own pace.. That’s totally fine. I have no qualms about that.\n\nThe fact remains, however, that restriction is inherently unhealthy, both psychologically and physiologically. I don’t care if you don’t wanna go all in, that’s fine, but you don’t get to talk about your restriction here, nor encourage it on others’ posts—especially considering this is one of very few subs that are predominantly supportive of the all-in method.\n\nYou ask why we should guard ourselves from diet talk if we hear about it anyway, and I just… don’t know why this is even a question you’re asking? You wouldn’t tell an addict at rehab that it’s pointless because the substance of choice (for lack of a better phrase) is everywhere outside regardless.

My opinions on dieting are irrelevant; discussing it is harmful to members and encourages ED behaviors (whether intentional or otherwise).\n\nOn top of that, there are *countless* other subs dedicated to dieting and pro-Ana content where you could go, here is not the place to do it for all the aforementioned reasons. It doesn’t matter that you have a different opinion on what is considered healthy, because you aren’t entitled to anyone else’s health and therefore you don’t get to comment, in an ED recovery sub, what is and isn’t healthy. It doesn’t matter that you don’t feel a responsibility to make sure other members don’t feel guilty, because it’s mine.

BMI isn’t even backed by any sort of science whatsoever; it was created by a mathematician over 200 years ago to study white, European men (which makes it even more difficult for women and non-white individuals). The overweight marker was even dropped from 27 (if I’m not mistaken) to 25 because “27 is too hard to remember.” It also doesn’t factor in genetics, sex, or bone density. A single number cannot determine that.\n\nBody weight aside, starvation is starvation. The body has a set weight it is healthiest at and functions optimally (yup, even if you’re not conventionally “thin,” you can be overweight/fat and still be healthy). If you drop below that via restriction and dieting, even if you aren’t thin/underweight in terms of BMI, you’re still in an energy deficit and will eventually lose hunger/fullness cues; experience a drop in hormone levels; catabolism (your body eats it’s own muscles and bone mass for fuel), damage to vital organs such as the heart and brain; lose your hair; and become hyper fixated on food, among many other things.\n\nYo-yo dieting and heavy restriction has been scientifically proven to cause more weight gain in the long run. And that’s not delving into adaptive thermogenesis (starvation mode), aka gaining weight despite being in energy deficit. And yes, it can happen to anyone who restricted. The body gives two fucks about your reasons behind restriction, all it knows is that food isn’t coming in and it will physiologically respond the same in any situation that results in a shortage of food. Even if you don’t eat lunch for one day, you’ll notice you’ll be hungrier at dinner and eat more (or at least want to). \n\nHope that all makes sense.

And if you have ensured you’re honoring your body’s need for food but still experiencing relentless hunger, then look into other possibilities such as chronic health conditions, etc. \n\nSecondly, suffering from BED doesn’t mean you need to restrict either (I *really* wanna address the one). BED isn’t driven by hunger and restricting isn’t going to fix the binging—if anything, it’s going to exacerbate it and make it worse in the long term. Not that I’m saying it’s easy, and I understand why restriction seems like a logical response to overeating in a society that basically encourages undereating, especially for those in larger bodies. It’s hard when it feels like you can’t trust your body and that food is the enemy. But if you want to stop binging then learning to cope with the emotional responses and reactions that lead to a binge and those that happen after a binge, hopefully with the help of a professional, is going to be a lot more effective than restricting to “manage” them. Telling others who have restrictive EDs that they need to eat (and eat  *a god damn lot* if they are in recovery) according to their hunger isn’t encouraging BED and tbh I’m a little confused why some of y’all are reporting comments for that.\n\nBottom line: I understand “recommending” a minimum number of calories to people, especially those who are still terrified of eating (regardless of your ED), might not sit well with others but if you’re struggling with an ED and you’re hungry, then you 99.9% of the time, you should eat. \n\nYou are absolutely allowed to believe that restriction would work for you or whoever else, but there are other subs more suited for that kind of talk so I don’t really think this is the place for it and I am not going to argue with y’all about it.\n\nSo… Thanks for coming to another one of my TED Talks.

There are so many things I myself wish I knew before diving into recovery, so I thought I’d compile the most common/important things together in a list for you all, in hopes that it will help y’all who are just starting recoveru.\n\n1. **Your body is gonna do some wack shit for awhile:** you’ll likely retain a fuckload of water within the first few days/weeks (I promise, it’s not true weight gain yet); you’ll be hit with severe body aches and extreme exhaustion to the point you can’t leave the bed and sleep for 14+ hours every day. You’ll be bloated and bowel irregularities are basically a nonnegotiable, necessary evil. Take this time to really, *truly* rest for at least a few weeks, if possible.\n\n2. **No, you’re not developing BED. Yes, it’s normal to eat thousands of calories in a single day:** I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen y’all freak out over the possibility of having BED right after choosing to recover from your restrictive ED (not talking shit, I absolutely understand the fear and the lack of knowledge surrounding extreme hunger). But that’s just not how BED works; the DSM-5 has made it clear that true binging cannot coincide with restrictive behaviors as it is then classified as an abnormal circumstance that leads to rhe large consumption of food. In other words, it is impossible to binge early on in recovery when your body is struggling with months/years of malnutrition. You need to eat back *all* of those calories you restricted over the span of your ED, *on top* of your normal daily caloric intake (which can range anywhere from 2500-3500kcal). This can round out to a lot of food, but I’m telling you right now it’s normal. I ate upwards to 11,000kcal the first month or so. The most important rule to follow is, if you’re eating out of hunger, it’s not binging.\n\n3. **Extreme/mental hunger should always be honored:** even if you’re at a “normal” BMI. Even if you’re technically overweight by BMI standards. Even if your doctor or psychiatrist (who aren’t nutritionists or dietitians, btw, and have little to no academic learning in nutrition) tell you to eat at some arbitrary number that leaves you feeling unsatisfied and hungry. Extreme/mental hunger can be so hard to cope with, especially if you don’t fit into the “emaciated anorexic” stereotype. But you can’t work around it either; the only way out is through.\n\n4. **2000 calories ain’t it:** you need to eat more, probably *much* more than this in recovery, and very likely *after* recovery as well. 2000 is what most 10 year olds eat. And on a similar note, you also dont need to follow some made up TDEE you got from the internet. Those calories are what you’d need if you were in a coma and not moving and don’t account for the various factors in your life. Walking, breathing, typing, even eating burns energy. Honor your hunger.\n\n5. **A starved brain is incapable of doing the important psychological work and the neural rewiring essential for long-term recovery:** this is the paradox of why eating disorders are so difficult to treat; the starved brain is irrationally terrified of food and weight gain to the point it can be fatal, but the only way to overcome those fears for good is to is first eat and gain the weight. You can prep yourself and brace for the inevitable panic attacks and emotional breakdowns, but you cannot rewire your brain when it is still malnourished. You have to gain the weight first and allow your brain to heal as well.\n\n6. **Dont expect weight restoration to solve all of your problems:** this might seem to contradict number 5, but bear with me. I read all of these things about how weight restoration would bring me mental clarity and miraculous neural rewiring… that wasn’t the case whatsoever. I mean, don’t get me wrong—I’m definitely *much* better off, but you need to learn the skills to fight off relapse for long term recovery/remission, hopefully with a professional if you have the option of doing so. Don’t assume you just need to gain weight to get rid of the eating disorder.\n\n7. **Your body decides your set point, not you:** I feel like so many of us get caught up by this one. Our weight is influenced by any *number* of factors, including genetics, sex, height, and environment. Your body knows what weight it functions best at and it will probably be at a weight higher than what you’re comfortable with. But you *cannot* fully recover until you accept that your body calls the shots. Please challenge that fear of weight gain and of being at a higher weight because it’s going to hinder your recovery if you don’t. Ask yourself these important questions: what’s so wrong with being at a higher weight? Who told you being at a higher weight was unacceptable? Would you tell a loved one that they are any less deserving of kindness, love and respect because they are at a higher weight?\n\n8. **Youll probably overshoot, and it might not taper off:** basically, you gain “extra” weight above your preED set point weight. One thing I read (I can try to find the source if you’d like) that suggested that the longer and/or more severe we restricted, the higher we’d overshoot. But here’s the thing: overshoot weight is *necessary* weight. The body has a set fat to fat free mass (muscle) ratio; it first must regain optimal fat levels before it can restore muscle mass, hense why we look soft and dough-y after weight restoration. The excess fat will be used to support long term healing, balance hormones levels, and overall used as an insurance policy of sorts in case you decide to restrict again and it will have energy to keep you going if that happens for however many months/years. If you developed your ED as a child/teen, it may not taper off as weight gain is a normal, healthy part of aging into adults and we typically don’t stop growing until age 25. I restricted pretty dedicatedly both as a child for 3ish years and as an adult for 6 years and I overshot by *a lot.* I kept hoping and hoping it would taper off soon because so many people said it would, but it hasn’t and as much as I hate to admit, it may never will. This is also something you will have to accept and work through in order to prevent a relapse.\n\n9. **Let go of exercising and compulsive movement:** At least temporarily for conventional exercise or general movement, until your weight and body have stabilized. Firstly, the severe swelling, bloating, body aches, extreme fatigue, and extreme hunger will not only make it exceedingly difficult to maintain an exercise routine, it will likely make these symptoms significantly worse. Your body is severely depleted of energy and requires a ridiculous amount of rest. Now, obviously you don’t need to do absolutely nothing for a few months to a couple of years, but you may require bed rest the first month or so (I did); after you finally start to experience the benefits of increased energy, I still suggest to keep it away from conventional exercise until you are sure your weight is stable and you can choose to exercise from a place of enjoyment rather than a compulsive need or as compensatory behaviors. I know some people say the continue to exercise but I don’t really recommend it, personally.\n\n10. **Weight loss is not compatible with recovery:** you cannot focus on weight loss while actively trying to recover. You have an eating disorder; you can’t just tell your brain, “I’m gonna restrict again but this time will be different!” It won’t. On top of that, your body gives fuck all about what you *want* to happen, all it knows is that suddenly there’s not enough food coming in and you’re back to square one before you know it. You cannot choose to lose weight and actively remain in recovery. It’s counterintuitive. I encourage you to let go of the idea of manipulating your body/weight and accept your body at whatever weight it ends up at because you are worth more than some arbitrary BMI number that was created to represent white European men *only* (yup, no women or non white individuals whatsoever) in the 1830s. \n\n11. **Junk food and sugar are your FRIENDS:** firstly, I want to say that you should stop giving moral value to food altogether. ALL food is good food. ALL food has nutrients. Take an apple and a cupcake for example; we know the two are different nutritionally speaking. An apple has fiber and various different vitamins and nutrients such as vitamin C and potassium… but what you might not know is that a chocolate cupcake has magnesium and other essential minerals including calcium, sulfur, zinc, iron, copper, potassium; flavonoids with antioxidant properties; and vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5, B9 and E. Not only this, it is a great choice for those in an energy deficit due to restriction due to its higher calorie content. I tell y’all all the time here to honor your cravings for these foods because they hold a significant purpose in recovery, contrary to what diet culture will have you believe. Junk food will literally save your life where low calorie foods such as fruits and veggies will fail you. You are going to suffer from gastrointestinal distress that will be exacerbated by fibrous fruits, vegetables and whole grains, leading to painful gas, bloating, cramps, and irregular bowel movements. High calorie, nutrient dense foods will actually be easier on your digestion and metabolize much quicker, which will promote faster healing. And remember: once you’re weight restored, you *do not* have to go back to restricting these foods. Eat them when you want, because restricting them will cause you to fall back into ED habits, even if you think you have control over them. You are allowed to eat the foods you crave for the rest of your life.\n\n12. **As much as your ED will try to convince you, you aren’t the exception to recovery:** We often feel like we’re the exception to the rules of recovery, that it won’t work for us because [insert ED reasoning here]. it will most likely feel like you’ll eat endlessly forever, you’ll be hungry forever, you’ll gain forever. That your metabolism is irreversibly damaged… and as someone who thought the same exact thing, I can tell you with certainty that your eating, hunger, and weight will normalize (“normalize” meaning your body will find the middle ground that is healthiest for you). Your body isn’t stupid, it’s the result of millions of years of complex evolution whose sole purpose is to keep you alive; the last thing your body has in mind is to keep you eating and gaining until you die. I promise you that you aren’t gaining as quickly as you probably think. In fact, there is no “too quick” in recovery.\n\n13. ***DON’T*** **compare yourself to everyone else and their recovery:** everyone is different. Don’t compare your progress with some YouTube or IG influencers who only gained x or xx lbs while you gained more or look different or eat more. *Your* recovery is *yours* and you are doing what you need to do. Try not to stress about others whose background you don’t know, because for all you know they could still be struggling. You’re doing your best and that’s what matters.\n\n14. **Recovery isn’t linear, so take your time:** challenge yourself and your ED with opposite actions and unlearning societal norms that harm you, but don’t push yourself too far too quickly. Take your time, go at your own pace. You have an eating disorder and deserve to be kind to yourself. Recovery will have ups and downs and sometimes you might slip for a little while, tomorrow is a new day, fuck even a minute from now is a new moment. Don’t beat yourself up for small mistakes and learn from the big ones. Okay? Okay.\n\n\nIf you have anyting else to add, or have any questions feel free to leave a comment! Hope this helps some of you out. ❤️\n\n***Edit:*** y’all thanks so much for all the rewards. 🥺❤️", "title": "Things to keep in mind during recovery", "context": null}

It all depends on your set point, the severity of your illness, and the duration of it. It may or may not be proportionate to someone who is underweight, but if you were overweight prior to your ED, you may be overweight *after* your eating disorder and that’s totally fine.

The only exception would be BED, in which case refeeding isn’t the goal. *However*, restriction should still be discouraged as it only perpetuates the desire to binge and doesn’t resolve the real problem—resolve/cope with the emotional stressors and/or trauma that leads to binging and you’ll stop the binging.", "parent_id": null, "link_id": null, "context": null}

It borders both fatphobia and pro-ana/mia content which break the rules and it’s my job as a mod to make sure members feel safe here. The issue with “lose weight” on an ED sub is as follows:\n\n1. It implies that being overweight means you cannot be energy deficient and that’s entirely not true.\n\n2. It’s extremely dismissive of overweight people with EDs who need to be able to eat freely, and yes, even very likely gain weight, in order to recover. Only 6% of restrictive ED sufferers are underweight. If your ED has caused you to gain past your set point, restriction isn’t going to fix that; in fact, it’s going to make it exceptionally worse and lead to other negative health consequences. Plus, restricting actually *reinforces* binge urges, hense why a lot of BED treatments are beginning to be tailored around an intuitive eating and HAES friendly approach. I do agree with what you said about unintentional weight loss, i should have clarified when I said *intentional* weight loss isn’t compatible with recovery. And it’s not. If you fix your relationship with food and you naturally lose weight, as some people do, then this doesn’t apply to you. This is something that is frequently talked about in this sub so I didn’t think it needed clarification. My bad.\n\n3. If you are struggling with hormonal issues (as I have myself), restriction doesn’t fix them. Now you just weigh less with hormonal issues. And as someone who’s family struggles with insulin resistance and diabetes (and therefore I myself am at a higher risk for), losing weight doesn’t magically fix these things and there’s really no scientific basis that universally claims it does. In fact, exercise, and treatments that don’t fixate on weight as a whole, has been documented to manage these things a lot more effectively. Theres a reason more than 90% of all diets fail, and why virtually everyone who loses will gain more weight back than they initially lost.\n\n4. Even *if* intentional weight loss and restriction worked, EDs are extremely competitive disorders. You don’t know who you’re encouraging weight loss or food restriction to, or how damaging it can be to others reading the posts/comments and feeling invalidated in their disorder, like they aren’t good at having an ED and need to try harder (the way many atypical ED sufferers feel).\n\nI understand what you are trying to say, and your struggles are valid, but these are pretty specific instances that you are describing; the whataboutism you’re playing is irrelevant because you’re discussing an entirely different scenario to discredit my initial claim that encouraging dieting and intentional weight loss *while in ED recovery* is not okay. Yes, everyone’s recovery is different, but you should be focusing on nutritional rehabilitation (again, even if you have BED or bulimia) and healing your relationship with food and your body. Some people will end up fat and that’s entirely okay and is not synonymous to being unhealthy either (not to mention the science to prove otherwise just isn’t there). If you naturally lose weight in the process, sure. But I think it’s weird to seek out faults in my post, with nothing but hypotheticals and anecdotes, because you feel defensive.", "parent_id": null, "link_id": null, "context": null}

Your treatment team is *still* insinuating that eating “bad” foods lead to less muscle mass and an overall higher weight—even if it’s within some range—and that eating “Whole Foods” (which isn’t actually a real term or way of eating and extremely vague at best, *most* foods are processed, doesn’t make the nutritionally inferior) means you will be leaner and weigh less. That is still giving some type of moral value to food, even if you say that’s not what you’re doing, because it still feeds into diet culture myths that food is a huge factor in our weight when it isn’t even on the top of the list, *if* at all. Your scenario feels flawed in that 1) you don’t know if twin 1 or 2 has a healthy relationship with food based on their body mass or even lifestyle; if eating “Whole Foods” is only sustainable with money, why are eating disorders, including orthorexic behaviors, so prevalent among young women of all demographics? What makes eating this way healthy and intuitive, when it raises the risk of disordered eating at best and a full blown eating disorder at worse? Because at the end of the day, you don’t know what each twin’s relationship with food is. For all you know twin 2 can feel restricted and out of control around the foods twin 1 is comfortable with. This is still an exceptionally idealized version of recovery and ignores all biological drives that cause us to crave sweet foods and the mechanisms that cause us to feel out of control around foods we limit despite really wanting them (it’s one thing to say you don’t like sweets, it’s another to avoid all “junk,” I know that’s not what you said but that’s how I view the scenario). \n\nAlso, I’ve got a lotta gripes with the obesity thing. “Obesity” isn’t caused by poverty forcing poor people to eat fast food/processed food—if that were true, all poor people would be obese. It’s *a lot* more complex than that. To start, poverty leads to excessive stress that can cause many chronic health conditions that not only affect fat people (heart disease, for example) but poor people in general, and tend to go untreated specifically for fat folk by a negligent medical industry. The weight stigma that permeates the medical industry prevents fat people from receiving life saving medical procedures and medication in favor of unsustainable weight loss that, again, leads to more weight gain long term; and then there’s the fact that there are many health conditions that *causes* weight gain as a symptom (think PCOS, diabetes, hypothyroidism, Hashimoto’s). Fat people die because of the medical industry’s fatphobic beliefs and unwillingness to treat them accordingly. Studies show that medical professionals actually view fat people as less than and show them far less compassion in their treatment approach. Then there’s the fact that dieting causes a lot of damage and contributes to the “obesity epidemic” and, yeah, in turn can lead to other health consequences down the road… but *only* if you don’t let your body level out and continue to yo-yo diet and weight cycle like this. And we haven’t even begun to discuss the case of “obese” individuals who are perfectly metabolically healthy, and it’s more common than people will choose to believe.\n\nI definitely agree that certain things improve our overall health, such as regular exercise (whether that’s just running errands, cleaning your home, walking or going to the gym) and eating a variety of foods that a lot of people don’t have access to due to poverty. But I do *not* agree that obesity is a product of poverty and processed food consumption because it entirely shifts the damages of fat phobia away from its source. It’s not a poverty problem, it’s a wide spread, *systemic* problem.", "parent_id": null, "link_id": null, "context": null}

But I don’t think I’d attribute that to any specific mental illness. \n\nI think one reason why we feel so “proud” to have an ED is because we are taught that weight loss = good, healthy, morally superior. Many people with EDs deal with dichotomous thinking (also called black and white thinking); if this thing is good, anything outside of it must be bad and vice versa. So it makes sense that restricting, losing weight, and all of the other behaviors and symptoms that accompany EDs will seem “right” to us.

Many people are asking how much they need to eat and often eat too *little*. \n\nRecovery minimums are going to range anywhere from 2500-3500 based in age, sex and height.\n\n•AFAB individuals younger than 25 between 5’0” and 5’8” (152.4 to 173 cm) will need a minimum 3000 kcal/day; 25+ individuals will need a minimum of 2500kcal daily. If you are taller, you’ll need a bit more; shorter a bit less.\n\n•For AMAB individuals under 25 between 5’4” and 6’0” (162.5 and 183 cm), you will need minimum 3500 kcal daily. 25+ individuals will need 3000; once again, if you fall outside of the given heights, accommodate by adding or removing an average of 200kcal.\n\nKeep in mind that these are minimums you will likely naturally fall into after recovery as well according to age, sex and height. I understand that some people claim counting calories in recovery holds them accountable to hit their minimums so I’m not going to argue that, however don’t rely too heavily on calorie counting as you progress into recovery. Regardless of whether you choose to go all in or take a slower, “more structured” approach, the end goal should be to eat without shame, guilt or anxiety.\n\n**These guidelines apply regardless of your weight.** The intake values are confirmed averages for “average height and weight.” Most people fall within this range—almost everyone will reside within a BMI of 21-30, with the absolute peak being around 27.\n\nHere is an article regarding recovery minimums and why they are the same post recovery as well: https://www.edinstitute.org/orientation-basics/phases-of-recovery-part-four?rq=Phases\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nNow, we will get into the doubly labeled water method that has documented the above calorie needs in many peer reviewed studies and even influenced the FDA’s initial 2350-2400 calorie guideline.\n\nDLW is the gold standard method for assessing daily metabolic rate of a living things over a period of time. So, what is the doubly labeled water method, exactly? The DLW technique measures total carbon dioxide production by observing the differential rates of elimination of a bolus dose of the stable isotope tracers, 2H (deuterium) and 18O… in simpler terms, regular sampling of heavy isotope concentrations in body water, by sampling saliva, urine, or blood,  measure elimination rates of deuterium and oxygen-18 in subject over time. \n\nThe caloric intakes reported are always higher than the “2000 caloric guideline” among those who don’t restrict. And, interesting enough, non restricted groups were reported to have less body mass as well. Let me be clear, though restriction will always lead to*more* weight gain long term, you don’t need to lose weight if you happen to be in a larger body; you aren’t a failed thin person and you are fine just the way you are. \n\nHere are the studies: https://p302.zlibcdn.com/dtoken/6be0e20b2ca1347ea71e94271858156a (pg 84)\n\nhttps://academic.oup.com/jn/article/129/10/1765/4721939\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMany of you have been being up the fact that many people claim to eat much less than the intakes mentioned above, or that they “loosely track” their loved ones’ intakes (please stop doing that, by the way, it’s still disordered) and noticed they eat fat less. Many studies have concluded that individuals, *especially* women, tend to underreport because they believe their peers will judge them. Women who are more concerned about their social status, if you will, were reported to underreport their intake by **507 kcal/day**, compared to those who cared less about their “social desirability.”\n\nRegarding underreporting of caloric intake: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12495831/\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12372163/\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nLastly, I can’t find the original document anymore (I had posted the link to a comment in this sub last year, though it seems to have been swallowed by the void), but I still feel it’s very relevant to this discussion. The FDA has been pretty open about the fact that 2000 calories isn’t enough for both men and women; intially 2350 was the baseline as reported by USDA survey data and doubly labeled water fast experiments, but received a lot of fucking backlash both from the public and medical professionals, mostly rooted in fatphobia, so the reduced the guideline to appease the masses who are more concerned with weight gain over and individuals properly feeding themselves.\n\n&gt;The FDA proposed using a single standard of daily calorie intake--2,350 calories per day, based on USDA survey data. The agency requested public comments on this proposal and on alternative figures: 2,000, 2,300, and 2,400 calories per day.\n\n&gt;Despite the observable fact that 2,350 calories per day is below the average requirements for either men or women obtained from doubly labeled water experiments, most of the people who responded to the comments judged the proposed benchmark too high. Nutrition educators worried that it would encourage overconsumption, be irrelevant to women who consume fewer calories, and permit overstatement of acceptable levels of \"eat less\" nutrients such as saturated fat and sodium.\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/08/why-does-the-fda-recommend-2-000-calories-per-day/243092/#:~:text=The%20FDA%20proposed%20using%20a,and%202%2C400%20calories%20per%20day.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nRemember that you are not going to fall into some clean cut intake, and you’re going to eat more on some days and less on others. These are not hard numbers you absolutely have to follow, but it’s important to understand that you still need a lot of food both during recovery and afterwards.\n\nIf you have any questions, I’d love to try and answer them to the best of my ability. If need be, I can always add in more sources. I am also open to having a civil discussion but we are in no way making fatphobic remarks or encouraging restriction. Thanks. ❤️\n\n**Edit:** I always hear the same complaint regarding Olwyn that she isn’t an ED specialist and thus her advice is moot (even though she is a researcher and patient advocate with thirteen years' experience in general practice, chronic gastrointestinal illnesses, allergies and intolerances). But… neither is Tabitha Farrar, and I’ve yet to see the same argument had about her despite their recovery methods being virtually identical. Both back their claims up with peer reviewed studies and confirmed scientific data—ya absolutely don’t have to like them or their methods, but you can’t just deny the science.\n\nAnother thing worth addressing: someone pointed out that you should always try to see a professional. Olwyn has never advocated against seeing a professional and neither have I. If you have the luxury of seeing someone, do it. **But not everybody has that**; some aren’t financially well off, insurance doesn’t cover treatment, or experiencing weight bias has turned individuals away from professional help. Many of us are forced to recover on our own. Just something to be mindful of.\n\n**Edit 2:** I said I wasn’t going to tolerate fatphobia, but I’m still going to loosely address the concern. If you say you can’t eat these minimums because you will gain weight, well… y’all aren’t gonna wanna hear this, but you need to gain weight. If you were at a higher BMI prior to your ED, you’re very likely gonna be at a higher weight post recovery. Not going to argue set point with y’all, but if you’re constantly having to monitor what and how much you eat to maintain some arbitrary weight, you’re not recovered. I said what I said. You can’t continue the same behaviors that kept you sick and call it healthy this time around—that’s not how restriction works, your body gives fuck all about what weight you *want* to be at and it’s going to act accordingly. Hense why I’m always telling you guys that [intentional] weight loss is not compatible with recovery.", "title": "Repost: On Caloric Intake Before and After Recovery", "context": null}

They also lack knowledge on overshoot, extreme hunger, fat distribution, etc. so no, I would not like to read anymore clinical guideline textbooks that repeat more of the above aforementioned issues.

I’ve been wanting to do this for a few days but I’ve been so busy with, well, life. But I digress! I’ve noticed lately that many of us here are struggling with the symptoms that accompany honoring extreme/mental hunger. In turn, I’ve been thinking about all the things that helped me when I was in deep, so I thought it’s time for yet another list! Let’s get started:\n\n1. **Heating pads or hot water bottles.** eating so much so frequently made my stomach *crazy* sore and tender, bloated, bubbly, and just overall not very happy. Resting a hot water bottle (I didn’t have a heating pad) made constantly resting a bit more cozy and helped relieve some tenderness.\n\n2. **Peppermint tea.** *Now, this is going to really depend on the individual as I know some of us used teas as a means to restrict, so be mindful of this tip.* That said, peppermint tea is great for digestion and I really personally loved the cooling sensation it had in my [sore] mouth, throat, and constantly full stomach. If nothing else, it’s very soothing.\n\n3. **Gas-X, or similar OTC products**. This goes without saying, but early recovery is… gross af hahah. I was soooo gassy, it was not even funnyyyyy, I’d literally run my boyfriend out of our bedroom, RIP to that poor man. While Gas-X wasn’t a cure-all, it did help alleviate some pressure and offer me little physical relief.\n\n4. **Baths.** Honestly, shout out to Epsom salts for being there for me during that first year of recovery when the entire trunk of my body was so sore and swollen from constantly needing to eat. Not only did it help with some of the soreness but it was nice to just relax and take my mind off eating for even *just* 30 minutes. Highly recommend.\n\n5. **Don’t cover your mirrors.** This one is going to be difficult for some of us, I’m sure, but hear me out. We know that our EDs are a product of neural pathways we’ve created, which thus lead to a negative response. Removing or covering your mirrors because your recovering body triggers you is simply going to result in a phobia of mirrors that will be difficult to unlearn later on. This is *especially* true if you struggle with Body Dysmorphic Disorder like I do. I made the mistake of not looking in any reflective surface three months in and now, two years into recovery, I cannot bring myself to look at my own reflection without feeling panicked. Do not recommend.\n\n6. **Avoid high fiber foods, and instead focus on easily digested foods like simple carbs and fats.** I mean, if you enjoy fibrous foods, more power to you, however, keep in mind that in the case of early recovery the digestive system has slowed to extract as much nutrients as possible. Fiber is going to lead to bloating, and thus uncomfortable fullness without actually leaving you satisfied, as well as gastrointestinal distress. Of course, you can always add these foods back later! Or if there are certain foods high in fiber that you happen to be craving that’s absolutely okay, just bear in mind that they *may* contribute to some discomfort… but recovery is already uncomfortable, so you do you.\n\n7. **keep some snacks by your bed when you go to sleep at night… or just in general.** Okay, so lots of you have been bringing up waking up in the middle of the night absolutely *ravenous*. If you’re too exhausted to get up, just keep something high calorie that you can eat when you wake up. And this can apply even during the day, when we’re prone to take hours-long naps too. 🥰\n\n8. **If you’re thinking about food and/or WANTING food, even if you don’t feel physical hunger, you need to eat.** Mental hunger is there to get us to eat in times of famine, and is even present when we aren’t in an energy deficit. Have you ever heard the saying “don’t go to the grocery store hungry”? That’s mental hunger.\n\n9. **Remember that honoring your hunger means honoring ALL cravings.** Yes, even if “nOtHiNg BuT sUgAr,” yes even if you’re not eating “full meals,” or getting all three macronutrients in the way you (read: your ED) would like.

Save for occasional planned “binges” that weren’t really “binges” at all, and id double down on behaviors afterwards to accommodate for them. I do have ADHD and now that I’m recovered I rarely have cravings because I feed myself what I want when I want it as well as eat a varied diet and eat regularly. Which is a problem. In all, food is really boring and trying to figure out what to eat is a chore because I hate cooking and would always opt for the “easier” meals if given the opportunity.\n\n-wanting food to look perfect definitely resonates with me, but I did reach a point where I was making weird ass food concoctions and didn’t give a fuck what it looked like after awhile.\n\n-I also do really remember thinking that I could never be able to eat as much as others because I’d never be truly full. I’d want more and more and more, which is actually true—for a time. You can imagine my head exploding when I learned about extreme/mental hunger.

However, for the sake of this conversation I’m going to point out that 1) fatphobia isn’t just a “western” problem, and 2) the “global west” is vague and problematic at best. The tendency of dividing countries into two groups often leads to the illusion that countries residing in the two groups are of two different kinds; that members within one group have a lot in common, whereas those characteristics are not found in the other group. If that were true, then why, for example, is fatphobia just as big of an issue in Asia (the East) as much as it is in the Americas and Europe? While it may be true that fatphobia may not have permeated your family’s belief system (and that’s great!), it’s anecdotal. Jamaica has an anti-obesity campaign and nine in ten Jamaicans want the government to take action against obesity. There *are* fatptobic ideologies in most countries, even if it’s not as dominant as it is in the Americas and Europe. Which I never claimed to begin with.\n\nSecondly, yes the beauty standards that you mentioned is absolutely whitewashed. Fatphobia was *literally* created by white people (specifically white men), and it has caused, and continues to cause, real harm to people of color, and especially to the black community *in* the US in particular. It’s entire origin is to suppress. And considering the global affects white colonialism has had on the world, is it any wonder it’s presence reaches pretty much world-wide, even if not as pervasive as it is in the white-dominated countries?\n\nLastly, I never once said *all* EDs are caused by fatphobia. I said the leading *environmental* factor is the sociocultural idealization of thinness. And it is. If you translated that as absolutely no other factor in the development of EDs is a valid one, then again I apologize because that’s not what I meant nor what I said. The fact is that fatphobia does play a role in the development of many EDs, and not *just* in the western world.", "parent_id": null, "link_id": null, "context": null}

No, it’s not happening because you eat sugar. No, it’s not caused by your hormones. No, it’s not a result of not eating “bAlAnCeD mEaLs.” The biological purpose of extreme hunger (scientifically referred to as *post-starvation hyperphagia*) is to restore the body’s optimal fat to fat free (muscle) mass ratio. You will continue to experience EH until your body has restored 100% fat free mass, which requires your body to achieve more than 100% fat mass (**fun fact:** *this is also why we overshoot*). It has absolutely nothing to do will power, hormones, or “swinging from one extreme to another”, and everything to do with how your body functions and how it responds to a [percieved] famine both during and after.\n \nI’m going to get real with y’all: the reason the shit I mentioned above is circulating around in this sub, and most especially in other ED subs, is because y’all are afraid of gaining “too much” weight and you need to address that internalized fatphobia. **Spoiler**: there is no gaining too much in recovery; your body is smart as fuck and knows how to heal and regulate itself. Whether you’re all-in or taking a slower approach, you can’t recover without eating a lot of food, period. You can’t starve your body for months/years and then expect it to bounce back like nothing ever happened, like you won’t gain weight, or only gain what you’re comfortable with while eating what you *think* is enough. You have an eating disorder—the entire problem is that *you do not know how to feed yourself*. And you certainly don’t know how to cope with triggering situations—if you did, you wouldn’t immediately jump to restriction and fight tooth and nail to find any excuse to view eating according to hunger as immoral or wrong. So stop trying to find answers to excuse away your *real* hunger. The fact that you’re trying to dismiss your hunger in itself is a disordered behavior.\n\nJust food for thought (pun entirely intended). Thanks for coming to another episode of Sareeee48 Talks.\n\n**Edit:** this is not an attack on anyone, especially those who are struggling to honor their hunger. That shit is hard. Recovery is hard. But the level of misinformation that I’ve seen being encouraged as of late is really not okay. Remember that the advice you give may have real impacts on the people who read it. If you’re determined to share your experiences or opinions, that is absolutely okay! But at least make sure it’s accurate and follows the sub’s rules.", "title": "Staaaaaaahp spreading misinformation about extreme hunger.", "context": null}

Keep in mind that BMI is not backed by any sort of scientific evidence; it was created by a white, European man in the 1800s to measure the average body mass of other white, European men of the 1800s—it is not only exclusionary by design, it’s also extremely flawed and an extremely poor and inaccurate indicator of health.

Many nutritional studies are riddled with design errors, their participant pool is often never randomized, and the collected data from these studies are almost always kept private… basically, most nutritional and weight studies are extremely biased, which is why you will see thousands of contradicting studies about this super food, or why you should avoid that food, this is the best diet to lose weight, but if you do xyz you’ll gain weight, etc. A good example of harmful and fatphobic dietetics practices was released earlier this year, suggesting pretty severe restriction for those who are considered “overweight” by BMI standards.\n\nExtreme hunger—scientifically known as *post-starvation hyperphagia*—has been documented numerous times, however it contradicts everything we are told regarding CICO and weight gain/loss. When you are told that the desire to eat a lot of food is problematic and emotionally driven, it’s going to lead the majority of people to assume that they have a binging problem after restriction—especially if you are in a larger body. We are societally wired to fear eating a lot, without actually understanding that our bodies need quite a lot of food to function optimally every single day.\n\nTbh treatment surrounding EDs is really fucking shitty specifically due to not just a general lack of understanding, but an utter *refusal* to understand the human body as a whole. Relapse rates are so high *because* we aren’t educating patients on what they’re bodies are experiencing and why it’s so important to honor hunger (once medically stable enough to do so, of course).

Weight is primarily genetic; hense why 95% of all diets fail and similar percentages of individuals gain back all of the weight back, if not more, within 2-5 years. And it’s not due to lack of willpower. It might make you uncomfortable, but that discomfort doesn’t change the fact that some people are born in larger bodies and that doesn’t inherently mean they are unhealthy. Especially considering that BMI was never designed to measure health (which is multi-faceted as it is).\n\nIf someone with BED gains weight from binging, then they should absolutely not focus on weight loss as a cure for their binging. They should find the reasons behind *why* they binge and work on managing that, which will in turn manage the binging. If weight loss naturally comes from that, that is fine, but it certainly shouldn’t be something someone fixates on. Consider the fact that many people with a “binging” problem initially come from restriction as it is, and restriction merely reinforces the urge to binge. Just like any other ED, they still have learn to feed themselves *enough* and listen to their hunger. Weight loss has nothing to do with recovering, it’s simply a possible byproduct.\n\nAs for feeling discomfort in a larger body, that is directly influenced by society, that pushes thinness at all costs and tells us from a very young age that fat is morally inferior. You might say that you wouldn’t intentionally be mean to fat people, but implying that nobody should want to weigh xxx lbs and weight loss is compatible with recovery is directly causing harm to fat people, especially those struggling with eating disorders. That’s the thing about fatphobia—it’s engrained, and it’s often so normalized that people don’t see a problem with it.\n\nLastly, the reason weight loss is not compatible with recovery is due to the fact that you cannot engage in behaviors that are keeping you sick (specifically a hyperfixation on your appearance that lead to restriction, purging, compulsive movement, etc.) and expect to remain in a healthy place emotionally and physically. Remember that many people develop their ED from dieting, and many others use it as a form of control.

The body cares more about caloric intake over the actual volume of food, which is why low calorie foods can make us “feel” full while actively remaining hungry. They can also result in uncomfortable fullness not because things like vegetables are actually filling but because they retain water and are usually high in fiber, which causes bloating in large quantities. This bloating is often what is mistaken for fullness. On the other hand, you can eat caloric dense foods that are less volume and achieve satiety a lot easier. For example, my work had a potluck yesterday and I ended up only being able to eat a small plate because the food was so caloric dense and I got full a lot quicker—in this case, I was both physically full and satiated. When you starve your body, especially over months/years, the body isn’t going to need fullness cues because, well, it’s depleted of energy. And it can take several months to over a year to pull oneself out of energy debt.,\n\nI went severalllll years not remembering what fullness felt like, and spent the first year of recovery questioning whether or not I’d ever experience it again. But the more you feed your body, the more it will balance itself out, including restoring consistent hunger and fullness cues.", "parent_id": null, "link_id": null, "context": null}

I’m sorry, but who the fuck died and made you the arbiter of what is and isn’t a meal? If you want banana bread for dinner, then eat the fucking banana bread. Just make sure you’re actually satisfying your hunger if you do so.\n\nA meal is whatever the fuck you want it to be. Sometimes, a thing of hostess donuts and a latte is a breakfast for me. And nine times out of ten, lunch and/or dinner is a snack platter because I have ADHD and cannot commit to “balanced meals.” I certainly did not follow the logic behind such a term in my own recovery—am I less recovered, less healthy, because I ate what and when I wanted rather than sticking to a specific number of carbs, protein, and fats for each meal? Why does it matter if I was satisfied at the end of the day?\n\nNot to mention not everyone has the luxury of meeting whatever the fuck defines a balanced meal, anyway. Health is *also* a privilege for many. Let’s not ignore these things.\n\nThis isn’t to say that if you want a protein, carb, and fat source with every meal you’re doing something wrong—one or the main takeaways of recovery is to eat how you want and learn to listen to your body to the best of your ability. There is no wrong answer as long as you are challenging yourself and learning to listen to your body’s needs and, yes, even its wants (once more, to the best of your ability).\n\nWe need to keep in mind that in early recovery especially, the body tends to lean more towards sugary/carb-heavy foods because they are quickly digested into energy the body *desperately* needs for repairs. And that is *okay*. Again, that doesn’t mean eating other foods is discouraged (no food source should be outright discouraged, assuming it is safe for you to consume—i.e., allergies, intolerances, certain health conditions, etc.), but for fuck’s sake if someone is eating a lot of sugar or carb heavy foods, the last thing they need to hear is “Xyz isn’t a meal. Eat more balanced.”\n\nThe entire point is to unlearn harmful beliefs and ideals regarding food.

You only know what *your* body needs. Personally, my body *didn’t* need a lot of protein, it needed a lot of carbs and sugars, as well as fat in any form. Not to mention that I still met my protein needs eating what I wanted, when I wanted in spite of not having what would be considered a complete meal. All food has macronutrients. If I’m trying to force my body to have what it doesn’t want, then how was I supposed to learn to trust it? \n\n*Again*, if you want to eat “balanced meals,” which is extremely nuanced and vague at best, then you are free to do so, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.

So let me lay things out clearly—because apparently, some people still don’t get it.\n\n##1. The rules are non-negotiable.\n\nIt doesn’t matter whether you agree with them or not. The rules are there to keep this community safe and functional. Mods enforce them. Members follow them. If you break the rules, you’ll get a temporary or permanent ban, depending on how severe or repetitive the issue is.\n\nIf you’re confused about a rule or why your content was removed, that’s fine—**ask us**. We’re more than willing to clarify or even reinstate posts/comments when there’s a genuine misunderstanding. Plenty of users can confirm that reaching out via modmail often leads to a resolution, especially if you’re willing to edit your post to follow the rules. But if you choose to complain publicly instead of reaching out, that’s on you.\n\n\n##2. Moderator discretion applies to everything.\n\nYes, **everything**. Every post. Every comment. No exceptions. If a mod decides your content isn’t appropriate, it’s not staying up. Period. You don’t have to like it, but that’s the way it is.\n\nIf a post isn’t approved or re-approved after review, it’s because we decided it wasn’t safe or appropriate for the sub. This isn’t a democracy—it’s a community we work hard to manage for free, for your benefit. If that’s a problem for you? There are countless other subs. No one’s forcing you to stay here.\n\nWe’re not here to cater to people who just want to stir up drama, promote harmful behavior, or dodge the rules under the guise of “just expressing themselves.” If you actually care about the community and feel a removal was unfair, you’d contact modmail like a reasonable person. But the ones who skip that and go straight to public whining or harassing us? Yeah, you know who you are.\n\n##3. Public mod-bashing = permanent ban.\n\nLet me be clear: if you make a post or comment complaining about the mods instead of taking it to modmail, you’re getting permanently banned. No warnings. I’m done. We’re done.\n\nThe mod team puts in an absurd amount of unpaid time and energy to keep this space safe, and the reward lately has been nonstop harassment, insults, and even threats. It’s disgusting. You don’t have to like us, but you will respect the work we do to keep this place from turning into a dumpster fire.\n\nIf that’s too much to ask, then seriously—go find a different sub.\n\nThis community exists because people work hard to keep it functioning. If you can’t handle that, maybe the problem isn’t the mods.\n\nThanks for coming to my TED Talk, have the day yall deserve. 🥰", "title": "Mod Post: enough is enough.", "context": null}
