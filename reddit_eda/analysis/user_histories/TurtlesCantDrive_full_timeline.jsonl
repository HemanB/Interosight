I’ve struggled my whole life with being ‘a picky eater’ and thought I’d never find anyone who would accept that. It was always the first thing I’d tell someone before a date so they could decide whether or not they could handle it. I had a lot of people turn me down because they were foodies, and that’s okay. I don’t expect most people to understand. But last year I met a foodie who actually supports me. He’s helped me try all sorts of new foods (slowly as I’ve had issues with people forcing me to in the past). He doesn’t think less of me on the days where all I order is a side of fries. He’s proud of me when I try something new. I never thought I’d find someone like this. I just wanted everyone to know that it may feel like no one without ARFID understands, but some people really surprise you. Don’t assume you don’t deserve all the love and support in the world.", "title": "Finding love with ARFID is possible", "context": null}
