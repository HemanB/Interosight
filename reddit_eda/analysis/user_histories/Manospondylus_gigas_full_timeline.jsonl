I eventually went fully vegan by making myself try loads of different alternative cheeses (most of which were horrid) until I found one that I actually liked. Since bread is a safe food I also tried varying the types of bread I have, like sourdough, focaccia, seeded, etc., so you could try finding variants of a safe food. I think there's very few excuses for eating animal products but ARFID is one of them, because I know exactly what it's like to have it. If a large amount of the foods you can eat have animal products in and you can't eat the alternatives made without it, then you shouldn't feel bad for buying them, because otherwise you might starve. Yes, animal products cause suffering and death, but being vegan is about existing whilst causing the least harm possible, not just cutting out animal products. Therefore I'd consider someone who wants to give up animal products but can't because of ARFID pretty much vegan anyway. It's good that you want to, and if you find any alternatives that's great, but not at the expense of your own wellbeing.", "parent_id": null, "link_id": null, "context": null}
