For some reason, some parents want to treat their children like dolls and not legitimate human beings with thoughts and feelings that are completely different from them. In most cases, parents are one of the main reasons for the development of EDs, but they refuse to acknowledge it and act like it's our fault. After my botched therapy attempt, my mother became so erratic and violent with being confronted with the fact that she failed as a parent that the police had to be called. You deserve so much better in life than some childish parents who don't want to take responsibility for the ways that they may have traumatized and wronged their own child.", "parent_id": null, "link_id": null, "context": null}
