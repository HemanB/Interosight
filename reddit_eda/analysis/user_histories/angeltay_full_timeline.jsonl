It‚Äôs not the same as anorexia or bulimia, but it effects our lives similarly. People without eating disorders will not understand that. People who are not neurodivergent will not understand that. I refuse to feel bad for having an eating disorder, especially because I try to find something I can eat everywhere I‚Äôm taken out to eat, and I make my own safe foods at home if everyone is having a meal I don‚Äôt want. I will not feel bad for being different. \n\nYou should not feel bad for being different. None of us should.

Because unless they meet someone with ARFID and take the time to understand it, they will never care and always see us as ‚Äúpicky eaters‚Äù with the ‚Äúpalate of a toddler,‚Äù no matter what we do or don‚Äôt eat. I have even replied to AITA posts like that one speaking up about ARFID, and I just get downvoted. So fuck those people.
