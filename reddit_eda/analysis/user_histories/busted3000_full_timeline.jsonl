By the actual definition in the DSM-5 there is **literally no difference in how it affects the person**, they’re literally just splitting a *mental illness* known for being hyper competitive about weight loss into two categories based on… weight.\n\nIt’s seriously the most fucked up diagnostic decision, if there’s absolutely no difference in the mental aspect of the two mental illnesses, why are they two separate diagnoses?? Malnutrition and all the risks associated with that can happen at any weight, but this diagnostic criteria really underplays that. It’s like the most tangible manifestation of medical fatphobia I think I’ve ever seen. \n\nUgh, I could write a whole essay on how messed up this is. I am so sorry your insurance kicked you out of treatment, I hope you’re able to find new help or continue your recovery progress on your own. It’s not easy to recover alone, but it’s absolutely doable, and we’re all here for you in this sub, any questions you have.", "parent_id": null, "link_id": null, "context": null}

I’ve still gone through periods of isolating myself from people because I hated how my body looked with gaining weight even if it wasn’t realistically very much weight. My ED didn’t really believe that it wasn’t very much weight. I’ve still struggled to socialise because I was ashamed of the quantities of food I was eating compared to everyone else, I’ve still had acne breakouts, I’ve still had the really intense (and hot) recovery farts that made me not wanna be around anyone. I’ve still experienced all the mental distress of ignoring the ED thoughts. \n\nEating disorders are mental illnesses and that means what weight you are doesn’t necessarily effect how you feel, and that carries over to recovery. Recovering into a slim body doesn’t necessarily mean you **feel** pretty or beautiful, no matter how others may view you. I pretty much followed the path you describe in here, but only now after over a year of (more or less) recovery do I actually feel pretty sometimes, and I can assure you that encouraging to people to continue because it gets better has never been any easier for me to say just because I’m still quite slim.", "parent_id": null, "link_id": null, "context": null}
