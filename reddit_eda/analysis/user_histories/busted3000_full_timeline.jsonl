I‚Äôve still experienced all the mental distress of ignoring the ED thoughts. \n\nEating disorders are mental illnesses and that means what weight you are doesn‚Äôt necessarily effect how you feel, and that carries over to recovery. Recovering into a slim body doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you **feel** pretty or beautiful, no matter how others may view you. I pretty much followed the path you describe in here, but only now after over a year of (more or less) recovery do I actually feel pretty sometimes, and I can assure you that encouraging to people to continue because it gets better has never been any easier for me to say just because I‚Äôm still quite slim.", "parent_id": null, "link_id": null, "context": null}
