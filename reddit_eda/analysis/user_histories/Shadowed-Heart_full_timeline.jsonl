However, understand this: while we don't endourage or condone pro-ed behaviors, and do our best by removing rule 10 breaks, this isn't JUST a recovery subreddit for only those in recovery. We're a support subreddit for most everyone with this eating disorder or similar, and thus I feel that showing the stages of recovery are necessary for some people. \n\nI may implement a clause that says you have to post timeline posts as multiple photos, and with the fully recovered one first while making it OBVIOUS that that is you while recovered, and not a \"before ed\" photo. This way people can still have timeline photos but those that find them triggering have the choice between swiping through or not, and won't see it outright. \n\nWhile I understand that it may be harder not to swipe to the next picture, we try not to baby people on this subreddit. It should ultimately be your own choice and not everything remotely triggering should have to be taken away or completely censored. \n\nSorry if this makes no sense - I guess this is the prelude to the upcoming post.", "parent_id": null, "link_id": null, "context": null}

I'm so sorry to anyone who has experienced triggering things here. This should be a safe space. I'm sorry we're not accomplishing that goal right now. \n\nIf you see a post or comment breaking the rules, report it immediately, downvote it so it's less likely to gain traction, and make a *modmail* message to the subreddit asking for it to be taken down.

Venting is encouraged and welcomed here, and does not break the subreddit's rules (unless it does). This is a fucking horrible disease where everyone experiences some of the same things, but also a lot of different things than someone else does. Those experiences aren't pleasant, they're probably not SFW, they're triggering. Amd that's okay, because people are allowed to vent about their problems, even if they don't want help. \n\nIf you don't like someone's vent, don't comment. If you want to comment because you don't like someone's vent, but are going to give them \"harsh truth advice\", mock them, belittle them, insult them, invalidate them, or anything else that is otherwise unsupportive, don't fucking comment. \n\nThis ENTIRE subreddit is under a trigger warning. It always has been, it always will be. Anorexia is a triggering subject. If you can't handle seeing triggering vents from people in the thick of it, ignore it and move on. If you can't handle seeing vents and can't control your urges to comment hate-filled, nonproductive, unsupportive things, this isn't the place for you and I'll escort you to the permanently closed door myself. \n\nI'm sick of it, and I'm not the only one. This is a support community. The amount of arguments, insults, unsupportive and outright *mean* comments I've had to remove just last night is unacceptable. This is not who we are as a community and I refuse to let this place go to the freaking dogs because a couple of you can't keep your unsympathetic mouths shut. \n\nWhile I can't control what people upvote or downvote, I DO control what gets removed and who gets permanently banned. Upvoting someone who's being an asshole makes YOU also an asshole, and downvoting those that come here for support and relatablity makes you a dick. \n\nGuys, this isn't highschool. The mean girls don't rule the school. The assholes are in the minority here, and the supportive community is in the majority. Don't stop posting here because of the people that decide they want to be dicks. The moderators have your back. If you see someone being a dick, report it. If you respond, make sure you're not breaking the rules or insulting them back, or your comment will be removed along with theirs. We can band together and *change*. We can drive out the people that aren't here to be supportive. We've done it before in the past, we can do it now. \n\nIf you don't have anything nice to say, shut the fuck up and don't say anything at all. If people start arguing in the comments, I'll lock the post and they can redirect their arguments into modmail where I'll be happy to converse with them. \n\nSincerely, a mod who's just about had it with those in the community that can't stop being dicks to others.", "title": "Have some sympathy or get out.", "context": null}

Timeline photos are on the threshold but in my opinion as the mod that brought this place from a pro-ana cesspool to where it is now, they shouldn't be outright banned. We've amended their guidelines many times, the most recently to require spoiling. I don't believe that banning the pre-recovery photos would do that much good in the long-run due to the aforementioned reasons, just as I don't think banning all timeline photos would do more good. \n\nYes, there are subreddits dedicated to timeline posts, and we're not one of them. But we're also a space that tries to allow as many kinds of posts as we can that fall within the rules because there is a wide variety when it comes to our community's members. Timeline posts are rare here, anyways. We've gone months without them, then sometimes there are two in 1-2wks. There are people that benefit positively from timeline photos. There are people that benefit negatively from them. It's a balance. \n\nSorry to see that you're unsubscribing, but hope that you're able to find what you're looking for elsewhere. Our rules aren't for everyone and we understand that, but right now they're not going to change. We're going to keep enforcing them and removing timeline posts that do not follow guidelines, but allowing the ones that do.", "parent_id": null, "link_id": null, "context": null}

I'm sure that some of you have noticed that we have an increase in trolls coming into our community and saying awful things to our members. As a result of this, we have set a minimum karma requirement for comments. This means that everyone that does not meet our threshold minimum will have their comments removed by automod. It is our hope that this action will prevent the vast majority of comments from these trolls, because as of right now they have been exclusively using brand new accounts and burning them after a few dozen messages, just to come back with a new one. \n\nUnfortunately, this action *will* prevent some well-meaning new users from being able to comment. However, hopefully (if I've coded it properly) this won't prevent them from making their own posts. We've added a note in the removal message that any users that require support while they grow their karma (it is a low amount, but larger than 0) should join the subreddit's affiliated Discord server (https://discord.gg/4jyQ7Zfr9P). \n\nIf some of these trolls slip past the new requirement, then the best thing that you can do is to immediately ***report*** the offending comment, and moderators will remove it as soon as we are able. Do not engage with the trolls. Not only will it only fuel their pathetic fire, but it will also cause more of a delay in us removing the comment as we then have more to read through. Don't engage, don't fight back. Just remember that they're pathetic no-lifes and don't deserve your attention. ***Report and move on.*** \n\nIt is an unfortunate reality of the internet that trolls are everywhere and are unending. Thankfully, new technology has led to us being better equipped to handle them more efficiently and effectively. Report troll posts and comments, and also any rule-breaking posts or comments, and we'll take care of the rest. \n\nIf trolls start to DM you, then report them to us through modmail and then report their harassing DMs to Reddit admins so they stand a chance of getting their accounts suspended or banned. \n\nThanks for reading. If you have any questions, comments or concerns, then please feel free to comment them under this post or modmail them to us and we will address them as soon as we are able. \n\n- r/AnorexiaNervosa moderators.

Rule 1: participating in pro-ED behaviors. Rule 3: Anyone is welcome here - aka, you were being rude or threatening. And rule 6: glorifying the eating disorder, or glorifying other unsafe and harmful practices. \n\nSo as a recap, considering I doubt you read the reasons behind why your posts/comments were removed. Rule one is pretty self-explanatory as to why it was enacted. Participating in pro-ED behaviors means that you were either encouraging that other vulnerable people continue to slowly kill themselves, or asking for others to encourage you to do so. Rule three was enacted so we don't have a subreddit full of unrestrained dicks insulting, harassing, or threatening our community - and also so we don't have members invalidating others for whatever no-good reason. Rule six was enacted so we don't have people coming here and being further encouraged into their ED because all they see are posts and comments praising the eating disorder, claiming that it's the next best thing since sliced bread. \n\nNow, I'm sure that not all of your removed additions were meant to harm our community maliciously. However, the fact of the matter is that they were going to, so we removed them not to censor you, but to *protect this community.* It's understandable that a lot of people don't quite understand the reasons behind why we remove posts but trust me that there *are* nuances for many of our rules and we take them into consideration. We know what we're doing. \n\nNo one is holding a gun to your own, or your *friends'* heads. You're free to just not participate if you don't like our community. I won't miss removing your pro-ED, rude, or glorifying posts - those are the ones I despise the most, because they're just reminders that not only are some people incapable of following the rules, but some people are just bad people.
