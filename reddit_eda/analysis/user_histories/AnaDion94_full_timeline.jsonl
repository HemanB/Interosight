And I agree, because I'm doing the same thing and it is a constant struggle.\n\nThat being said, this is what worked for me (for about a month before relapsing since the new year): eating *really* healthy meals and working out. That helped disrupt the b/p cycle because I didn't feel as much guilt after eating. Working out helped because burning all that energy made my body desperate enough for energy that I was GOING to eat. It's easy to starve yourself of nutrients if you then just lay in bed all day; it's harder if you're maintaining a somewhat active lifestyle.\n\nMy meals were usually a meat, a cooked vegetable, and some sort of huge salad with cheese, craisins, whatever crispy toppings i like, and a homemade dressing (so i could control the amount of salt, fat, and sugar). I tried to minimize saturated fats and sugar, but not shy away from them if needed (like, i don't need butter on broccoli, but I didn't want to hold myself back from adding a bit of honey, cheese, or EVOO to something if i know I'll really enjoy it). As my workout intensity increased I noticed I was getting lots of headaches and tried integrating more carbs, which definitely helped; for me that meant a plain, baked sweet potato or sometimes brown rice. I snacked on fruits and had greek yogurt with granola, dark chocolate, and craisins for when i was caving something sweet. Or a cup of hot chocolate. Or cookies and milk if I felt like living dangerously  :) \n\nFor exercise I literally just jogged in place in my apartment. Sometimes while watching TV. Sometimes listening to the Hamilton soundtrack. Sometimes fast, sometimes just walking. Not necessarily hitting a number of steps, but trying to beat my lowest number over the previous seven days. AND I didn't weigh myself. Weight loss was based on how my clothes fit and comparing my overall fitness (i.e. only being able to jog for like 20 seconds vs 10 minutes)\n\nFor me, this was the healthiest I'd been since the pandemic causing ALL my ED behaviors to flair up in the worst way, and I'm trying to fall back into it. I liked being able to enjoy food and enjoy my body without fighting the urge to punish it every time I ate something. \n\nGood luck with all the things!", "parent_id": null, "link_id": null, "context": null}

Medical confirmation and I could *feel* that I was not doing well. \n\nFor me, what works best (and i got about 6 weeks in with no issues before relapsing due to the holidays) is eating a lot of super healthy food and doing some amount of exercise. I think i initially gained a few pounds, because my body wasn't used to digesting, but then starting losing much more effectively than i was pre-recovery. \n\nMost of my dinners were a giant salads, lean protein, and some cooked vegetable, only limiting refined sugars and saturated fat, but not particularly strictly. I started integrating carbs (sweet potatoes, whole grains) once my workouts got more intense, and I could feel that I needed more energy. But generally, I find that working out (and by working out i mean i jog in front of the TV and sometimes do squats) and eating healthy foods helped eliminate the guilt trigger and \"purge\" response and also kept me from gaining while recovering.", "parent_id": null, "link_id": null, "context": null}
