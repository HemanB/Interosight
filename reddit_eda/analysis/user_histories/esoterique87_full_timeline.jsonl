I have completely stopped eating sugar because I get an immediate ED response to binge. There are some practical things you can do here in order to break this cycle. Structured Eating, Eat balanced Meals and Accept Delay Distract are from the book 'The Bulimia Help Method' by Ali Kerr & Richard Kerr. This book is a great resource and I highly recommend it.\n\n1. **Reach out.** This is one of the most important parts of recovery. If you don't have a therapist, dietician or coach, I highly recommend seeking professional help. You can recover on your own but if you have support it makes the process so much easier and you feel less alone. If professional help isn't an option then lean on someone you trust who you can contact when you are feeling urges or when you are trying to distract yourself. I'm connecting with my Mom at meals so that I don't binge and purge and it's been very helpful.\n2. **Remove the triggers**. If you find you are out of control around sugar, or any other triggering foods, it's ok to acknowledge this and temporarily stop eating/buying them. Keep them out of sight or better yet, don't buy them. If you order from food apps, delete those apps. Put as much friction between you and the behavior as possible. If you tend to drive to the store to buy binge food, put your keys in an obscure location so that you have to think about what you're doing before you act.\n3. **Structured eating**. Three meals and three snacks a day, no more than three hours apart. Retrain your mind and body to expect food often and regularly. This stabilizes blood sugar and reduces instances of binge urges. When you are well nourished, your body and mind don't have to send out signals to binge. If you are worried about weight gain, keep in mind that eating regularly is one of the best things you can do to maintain a healthy weight as it is a massive boost to your metabolism.\n4.  **Eat balanced meals**. Eat regular meals and snacks made up from fats, proteins and        complex carbohydrates. This will help to stabilize erratic blood sugar levels and in turn reducing those binge urges. I find sticking to whole, mostly unprocessed, low sugar, foods reduces my urge to binge. Nobody really wants to binge on strawberries but strawberry ice-cream is easy to binge on. Pick foods that feel safe to you and the least triggering.\n5. **Accept Delay Distract.** We can't control the fact that we get binge urges because of how our brains are wired to do this behavior. We can control how we respond to those urges. Accept the urge and remind yourself that the binge urge cannot control you, it is not dangerous and does not have to be fought.Delay taking any action towards your urge for 10 minutes and allow the urge to rise and fall. Distract yourself for those 10 minutes. Go for a walk, go for a drive, have a bath, talk to a friend, listen to music, immerse yourself in a project, work or play on your computer. Anything to distract you from those urges will help.\n\nI know how helpless and miserable you can feel in a binge/purge cycle. You are not alone and so many people are going through this right now. I hope even a little of this information was helpful and I'm sending lots of love and support your way ‚ù§Ô∏è", "parent_id": null, "link_id": null, "context": null}

I really feel your pain and I want you to know you are not alone. Are you able to seek treatment for your ED? If you are, I urge you to reach out. You do not have to suffer in silence and there are so many ways in which a therapist, coach, or counselor could help you. It is so important to have support because ED's thrive in isolation. Many people with EDs have struggled recently with the pandemic, especially if they were in quarantine or lock down. If you can't afford treatment then even reaching out to a friend or a loved one will help. \n\nBody image is so hard. I'm struggling with mine now as I'm going through recovery and gaining weight. Think of a few things that you can do for yourself that would make you feel even the tiniest bit better. You could buy yourself something cute to wear that feels good to you. If clothes are too triggering then maybe a cute pair of shoes or an accessory. I got really into nails, makeup and jewelry because clothes are problematic. It doesn't have to be related to your appearance either. You could do an activity or project, go somewhere, talk to someone, pet a puppy, anything that you would enjoy. Even the smallest thing can make a difference. Our eating disorders want us to punish ourselves but we do not have to. We can treat ourselves with love and kindness, even if we don't believe that it will work or that we deserve it.\n\nThose people should not have said those things to you. You do not need to drink teas and you are a worthy human being regardless of what people are saying to you. Those thoughts of body hatred are coming from your ED. If a loved one came to you and said that they hated their body, how would you respond? You probably wouldn't say, \"you're right, you should hate your body.\" You would  say something kind and supportive. You can treat yourself with the same kindness, even when the ED is loud and overwhelming. It does not have to run the show, you have the ability to respond to it and advocate for yourself. I'm sending you lots of love and support. \n\nIf you are in the US, the national eating disorders association has a free hotline. \n\n1-800-931-2237 Monday-Thursday from 9:00 a.m.- 9:00 p.m. and Friday from 9:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m.", "parent_id": null, "link_id": null, "context": null}

My very first steps towards recovery were first telling my Mom. Reaching out and telling someone can really get the ball rolling. I also read books and consumed a lot of recovery content on YouTube. I really wanted to be free of bulimia but I couldn't do it on my own, no matter how many books I read or videos I watched. A YouTuber, who I really admired and related to, happened to also be a recovery coach so I reached out to her. I was lucky enough to get a spot and I have been making much better progress than I did on my own. \n\nTaking any steps, no matter how small, is a good thing. It could be reading books or telling someone or finding a therapist/coach, even coming on this forum. No matter what you decide to do, you will never feel 100% ready to recover.

I'm not personally a recovery coach but I am working with a coach at the moment. I like to come on this forum and try to help others and share some tools/tips that I've learned. I know how difficult recovery can be, especially if you don't have professional help. I can link you to a great video that my coach did about overshoot weight. You can find her video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHhOUivBCMo).\n\nI definitely understand the temptation to go back to your ED and to lose weight. I relapsed last spring after gaining weight and not having the proper tools to help with body image. I went back to restriction which then led me back to bulimia and now I am climbing out of that relapse. Your ED is telling you that your body is the problem but in reality it's your eating disorder that is the problem. A big part of recovery is learning how to talk to yourself and how to accept your body. You don't always have to love it but you can accept it and treat yourself with kindness.\n\nThere is a great tool you can use to help with body image. Imagine a friend or a loved one who is in your position. They are in recovery and now they are struggling with their body image. What would you say to that person? I'm sure it would be something kind, compassionate and supportive right? That is your healthy self. When you are having ED thoughts about your body, try to respond to them in the way you would for another person. Your ED voice doesn't have to dominate your headspace, you have the ability to respond to it and to change the story you are telling yourself.

Bulimia is very all or nothing, you're either restricting or you're binging and purging. I understand how hopeless you can feel and you wonder if you will ever be able to have a better relationship with food. I have a couple of suggestions that may help. \n\nIf you have access to professional help, please seek it out. I say this to everyone in this forum because it is so important. I was in the same spot as you and I felt completely hopeless, now I have a coach and I have made amazing progress in my recovery. Professional help can provide you with the tools you need to combat this illness. You don't have to fight this alone, and it is so much easier when you have guidance.\n\nIf professional help isn't an option, do you have anyone who can sit with you while you eat? I was really struggling with eating normally too and now I have my Mom sit with me at most meals so I don't binge and purge. It can really help to have someone who is aware of your ED and who can sit with you for 60-90 minutes after a meal. If you don't have someone who can sit with you, is there someone you can call or reach out to? Connection is so important in recovery and having people who can support us goes such a long way. Most of us binge and purge in private so if we can reach out to people, it can prevent you from engaging in those behaviors.\n\nIf you don't have someone to reach out to, there is an amazing tool where you dialogue between your ED voice and your healthy voice. Write down the things your ED is telling you and respond to them. Your eating disorder does not have the final say, you can talk back to it and this really impacts your actions. If you start to keep track of the things your ED is saying, you can start to recognize its patterns, thoughts and beliefs and begin to challenge them. Here are a few examples;\n\n**ED Thought**: I'm just going to binge and purge this food anyways, I might as well buy all my binge foods. \n\n**Healthy Self**: I don't have to binge and purge, and my eating disorder cannot predict the future. I am going to buy food with the intention of not binging and purging.\n\n**ED Thought**: Even when I am at a healthy weight I will be miserable, so I might as well be thin and miserable than fat and miserable. \n\n**Healthy Self**: You can't predict how you will feel at a healthy weight because you have never been there long enough. All you know for sure is that you are absolutely miserable and alone when you are sickly thin. This is a known fact, whereas you don't know how you will feel if you gain weight and become healthy.\n\nIf you are buying food at the store and your ED is already telling you that you're going to binge and purge, it will most likely happen. If you talk back to it and reframe your intentions around the food, your actions are more likely to shift. You have a lot more power than you realize and your eating disorder does not get to have the final say. If you are having trouble getting in touch with your healthy voice, imagine what you would say to someone else. \n\nI hope some of this was helpful and I promise you that there is hope. I'm sending lots of support and love your way ‚ù§Ô∏è", "parent_id": null, "link_id": null, "context": null}

You can help yourself if you start reducing body checking behaviors. If you are aware that checking your body after eating triggers your eating disorder then try to avoid doing that. Especially avoid checking your stomach because yes, it will look bigger after you've eaten. It doesn't mean you are disgusting, it just means your stomach has food in it. I used to body check first thing in the morning and that would determine how the rest of my day was going to go. I found that once I stopped doing that, my eating disorder stopped showing up in the morning. \n\nAnother great tool you can use are dialogues between your ED self and your Healthy self. We all have an ED self and it usually is abusive, negative, critical and cruel. We also have a Healthy Self that we are all born with and it usually shows up for other people. Whenever you have an ED thought about your body, write it down and respond to it. It helps to imagine what you would say to a loved one if they were having negative thoughts about their body. For example:\n\nEd Thought: Eating food makes me look disgusting\n\nHealthy Self: You do not look disgusting, nothing has changed about your body just because you have eaten. Your body image cannot be trusted because it is warped. You deserve to eat and to treat yourself with kindness.\n\nThis is a very powerful tool that will help you identify what your eating disorder sounds like and what it's messages and beliefs are. Your eating disorder is going to keep telling you that your body is disgusting so that you will keep relying on it. Every time you challenge your ED, you weaken it.

Some examples of questions that you could ask your eating disorder are;\n\nQuestion: What do you think will happen if you gain weight? \n\nAnswer: I will hate my body, I will be uncomfortable, I will be rejected by people, people will judge me.\n\nThe reality is, your eating disorder is doing all of those things. Your eating disorder is judging you, rejecting you, making you hate your body, making you uncomfortable. You need to look at the truth of what your eating disorder is actually giving you. Is it something you really want to hold onto?\n\nQuestion: What could go well if I recovered and potentially gained weight?\n\nAnswer: I could feel better about myself, I could be healthier, I could have more time and energy for things that I enjoy, I could pursue my interests, I could try new things, I could deepen my existing relationships or form new ones, I could learn to accept myself, I could be happier, I could feel free.\n\nJust some things to think about. Not everyone is at a stage where they are ready to look at these deeper issues. You might not be ready and that's ok.

In these situations you get tunnel vision and all that matters is how you look or how dissatisfied you are with how you look. For those in recovery it is really helpful to limit mirror time. I have my full length mirror covered so that I'm not constantly looking at myself and I am working on not body checking in the mirror. Human beings were not meant to be looking at ourselves as much as we do now. Whether it's in mirrors, pictures, social media or zoom, all of this is way too much time spent looking at ourselves, and criticizing how we look. For your own mental health, be aware of how much time you spend in the mirror or taking photos. Try to limit that time so that you don't end up spiraling.\n\nThere's a great tool to reframe how you feel about your body/appearance. Even if you don't have children or want children, this can still be helpful.\n\nImagine you have a daughter and she is your exact age, she looks identical to you, she is exactly where you are in your life right now. She is struggling with her body image and how she looks. She feels bad about herself, she obsesses, she spirals and cries. What would you say to her? What advice would you give her? How would you comfort her? Would you try and help her see the bigger picture? Would you tell her that she is right and she should feel bad about herself?\n\nThis kind of exercise should help you realize that you are deserving of the same compassion, love and care that you would give to your hypothetical daughter. You are so much more than how you look. You are a complex human being with so many amazing traits and your body is just a vehicle. It helps you live your life and do all the things that you want to do. Focus on all that you do have and what your body allows you to do instead of tearing it down.

I have avoided the dentist for years because I was afraid of being judged or shamed. Ideally I would want my dentist to focus on addressing any current issues and how to take care of my teeth in the future. One thing that is helpful to know is after vomiting, teeth should not be brushed for at least an hour to allow the acid conditions created in the mouth to settle down.

It is wonderful that you have reclaimed your life from such an all consuming illness. You should be so proud of all your efforts and hard work. \n\nI had an eating disorder for over 15 years and it can be incredibly difficult for long time sufferers to recover. I can relate to a lot of your story and you are definitely not the only one who has gone through this. I've been in recovery for 4 years and it's been a journey. Recovery is incredibly difficult but infinitely worth it. I feel like I recovered my true self, the person I was before I ever got sick, the little girl who was always on her own side.\n\nYou mentioned \"cutting down in a healthy way\" which is a bit concerning. When I first went into recovery, after about six months, I had gained weight. The weight gain was torturous to my eating disorder, which was still present in my thoughts even though my behaviors were gone. I went on a diet in order to lose it the weight and I told myself I was doing it in a \"healthy way.\" I ended up relapsing and it took me over a year to climb out of that relapse. I urge you to be careful because this kind of thinking can be a very slippery slope. I'm not saying this will happen to you, I just want you to be aware that your eating disorder can still be active in your thoughts and use the guise of \"getting healthy\" in order to weasel its way back into your life.\n\nYou are amazing, strong and you have your whole life ahead of you.

Recovery has been quite a journey for me and definitely not linear.\n\nAt the beginning of recovery my digestion was really bad and I would get severe bloating/pain. Luckily that didn't last for more than a few weeks and it drastically improved. I was extremely emotional during recovery and my moods were all over the place. After having numbed myself for so many years, suddenly I was no longer numb and I was feeling everything. This was actually good even though it was difficult. Tolerating difficult emotions is a life skill and I'm forever grateful that I have this ability. \n\nI have a bit of acid reflux but its getting better all the time.

I had many years of severe depression coupled with an eating disorder. I would sometimes go months without showering (not an exaggeration.) That was probably the worst year of my life and I didn't leave the house for nearly an entire year. \n\nA lot the reasoning behind this was 1. Complete lack of motivation and energy to care for myself, 2. Wanting to avoid my body and feeling disgusted with myself and 3. I wanted to punish myself. \n\nI can definitely relate to the perfectionism and the black and white thinking. I often had thoughts like \"If I can't be perfect, why bother trying at all?\" or \"I'm disgusting, useless and a failure, I deserve to live in my own filth.\" or \"I'm already beyond help, I will just make things worse for myself.\" I definitely wanted to avoid people and places and self neglect was one way I could do that.\n\nSome practical tips might be things like, showering with the lights off or low light, limiting the amount of time you spend in the shower or setting a time limit, covering mirrors (my mirrors are all covered) and limiting time spent in front of mirrors in general, having some fun music playing to distract you and buying yourself a really nice smelling shampoo or soap.\n\nI really hope you are able to find a better therapist because this is something you can absolutely overcome. The most important piece of the puzzle is how you talk to yourself and that is something you can work on with a therapist. I had the most horribly abusive voice in my head and with the help of therapy and a recovery coach, I have completely changed how I speak to myself and how I see myself. \n\nI know how hard it is.

I started covering my mirrors last year to help with my eating disorder recovery. Every encounter with the mirror gave the eating disorder a reason to show up and criticize every part of me. Humans were not meant to look at ourselves as much as we do now with multiple mirrors in every room, social media, Zoom, it's endless! It's amazing how much of a difference not looking at myself all the time has made. It was a really hard habit to break at first but I'm so glad I did.

Whoever is telling you to \"grow out of it\" is ignorant about what eating disorders actually are.

People don't realize that in those instances, it doesn't mean it was just a phase, it just means they caught it early and recovered sooner.\n\nI know people who have fully recovered from their eating disorder so I disagree that you can't fully recover. There are many people who have fully recovered, some people partially recover, and some people don't recover. It's very individual and there is a broad range of where you might fall on the recovery spectrum. \n\nI agree that you need to have self compassion in recovery and that nobody should expect themselves to have a \"perfect\" recovery.

Sometimes we think we have recovered but there are stones that we haven't unturned or things we haven't fully addressed. Eating disorders can be alarm systems for something inside that hasn't been resolved. If you can think of anything at all that might have triggered this relapse, it could be really helpful in moving forward in your recovery. \n\nIn my experience, letting go of the shame, feelings of failure and reaching out for help was the best way to pull me out of my relapse. If you have access to help, I strongly recommend working with someone who specializes in eating disorders.

It's so important to acknowledge the pain and confusion behind this thought process, but let‚Äôs gently challenge some of the disordered logic here:\n\n**ED**: \"Anorexia made me feel in control.\"  \n\n**Reality**: Anorexia creates an illusion of control, but it‚Äôs the disorder controlling you‚Äînot the other way around. The choices, rituals, and restrictions are dictated by the eating disorder, often at the cost of your physical and mental well-being. True control comes from making decisions that align with your health and values, not a disorder's demands.\n\n**ED**: \"Anorexia made me feel clean, and bulimia makes me feel dirty and disgusting.\"  \n\n**Reality**: These are moral judgments that eating disorders impose on behaviors, but eating or even purging doesn't determine your worth or cleanliness. These feelings often stem from shame and guilt, which are perpetuated by the disorder itself. Your inherent worth is not tied to your body or your behaviors.\n\n**ED**: \"I miss my sick body and the strength it gave me to not eat.\"  \n\n**Reality**: That \"sick body\" was not a sign of strength but of suffering. Your body deserves nourishment, care, and compassion. Missing the \"sick body\" is common because the eating disorder distorts your mind to equate thinness with value, but thinness is not synonymous with health, happiness, or worthiness.\n\nAcknowledging these thoughts takes courage, and it‚Äôs okay to sit with the confusion and conflicting emotions. These feelings are a reflection of how much the eating disorder has taken over and how deeply it can distort your perspective. But you are more than the disorder‚Äôs demands or definitions. There‚Äôs a world beyond these thoughts‚Äîa world full of possibility, connection, and self-discovery, waiting for you to explore it in your own time and way.
