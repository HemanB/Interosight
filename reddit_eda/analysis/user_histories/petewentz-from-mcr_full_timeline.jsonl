I couldn’t slip it to the dogs even, I literally mean watched. I’ve had issues with people watching me eat because of this super traumatic thing when I was 7, so even if I didn’t have a restrictive ED it would have fucked me up. I couldn’t even manage to eat at school until the end of high school over that, like forcing me to eat (especially while being watched) was bullshit. \n\nMy sister used to buy me high-calorie snack foods and give me a due date. Like here’s one of those like 2 foot tall tubs of cheese balls, have it gone Friday. I had mixed feelings about that because on one hand she asked if I wanted her help and I said yes, but on the other using guilt from people spending money on me to make me eat sucked. Especially because she gave me such unrealistic deadlines!

That being said, I only have “don’ts” to share.\n\nDon’t force her to eat. After I was diagnosed at 15, my parents would sit and watch me eat and not let me get up until I cleaned my plate. All that did was lead to me throwing it up, and it made me feel more panicked.\n\nDon’t ever comment about anything at all in terms of nutrition facts. Never do it. When I was 22 I bought myself instant breakfast when I was trying to stop losing weight because my brain decided that beverages didn’t count. My dad walked by and went “oh my god, do you have any idea how much sugar is in that?!” It’s been almost 2 years and I haven’t touched it since. The idea of it makes me cry. There are a million examples of this, but it always gets under your skin and you remember it forever. A passing comment for you about food content can easily become an obsessive fear for your child with this illness. \n\nDon’t comment on her body at all. “You look so much healthier!” means “You’re weight gain is super obvious. You look fat and disgusting. You need to stop.” But also, “You’re too thin!” means “Thank fuck, it’s working. I can’t stop now.” Like this is a mental illness and brains will do literally anything to make a comment about weight feed into the disorder. My parents never did this, they said things like “oh good you’ve lost weight. Don’t gain it back.” To be clear, they’d say it when I was underweight. But that one is more obviously bad, so I used examples that people in town have told me instead.\n\nDon’t comment on anyone else’s bodies, not even your own. My dad is fatphobic and would mock random people on the street, and like now I just think everyone thinks those things but like only about me. My mom would grab at her stomach in the mirror and tell me how much she hated it and how disgusting she felt, even when I was like 6. There wasn’t anything wrong with her stomach, at least not to me. If her healthy stomach was disgusting, what did that mean about mine?? I had bad body dysmorphia, and I thought my stomach was much larger than hers. When I was 12 my dad came to me and instructed me to manipulate my mom into running on the treadmill because if she didn’t start losing weight now she’d just keep gaining it. She’d had a baby 3-4 months prior to this convo. He at least tried to pretend to care about her health, so even if we pretend I believed him, telling me he wants me to help her because he loves her told me that nobody loves you if you’re even a little overweight. It’s a mental disorder, your brain makes weird shit up. If you talk about weight, your brain will find a way to make it motivate you to restrict. \n\nDon’t accuse her of throwing up if she’s not. It’s just hurtful and offensive. Then you think oh if they thought I was throwing up it’s because I’m eating too much and should be throwing up, so then you feel like you have to. \n\nDon’t lie to her about her body. People around town like to lie about my body. They’ll comment on it and I’ll say I have anorexia and am Xlbs underweight, and comments about my body make it harder to make healthy choices. Then they’ll try to lie. Obviously telling me I look healthy and just fine when I can see most of my bones is a bad idea. You might want to help her feel better about her appearance, but definitely never lie. If you have body dysmorphia you almost have to believe the people around you, and when they’re lying it can seriously mess with your concept of reality.\n\nDon’t make her feel guilty. My sister used to buy me high-calorie things and give me a deadline I had to eat it by. I felt guilty that she spent money on me and I knew I’d disappoint her if I didn’t eat it, but it just led to me shamefully eating it as fast as I could while I cried. At the time I thought it was nice because it was the only time anyone had ever cared enough to want me to try to do better. I wouldn’t actually wish that on anyone else, though. \n\nDon’t tell anyone. I know you might want to talk to your own parents, but please don’t. When mine did that it made it super uncomfortable to talk to my grandma and aunt who I’d been close with, and it’s taken me nigh on a decade to try to get past that. People treat you different, even when they mean well. You can tell if someone told them. Feeling like everyone knew just made me feel extremely ashamed and exposed. It also felt like my parents betrayed me. \n\n\nSorry for the long comment. I tried to explain why I chose each of the points I made because like they don’t make a ton of sense without the background of what the disorder hears and tells you. I can’t say it’s all universal, but I know at least some of it is. You can also hear about it on YouTube, just search something like what anorexics want their parents to know. I think I’ve seen a few videos listed under that premise", "parent_id": null, "link_id": null, "context": null}

I went to an auto shop today because my battery isn’t working. When he told me how much they cost I cried, which is embarrassing enough.
