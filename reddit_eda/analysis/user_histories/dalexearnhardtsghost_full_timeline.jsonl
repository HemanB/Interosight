And my teeth are starting to feel icky. My mom has struggled with ED her whole life and that kinda pushed me into that direction as well with her comments towards me and about herself, being weird about food and glorifying underweight models. She regrets it now seeing how bad I am going through it. But body dysmorphia and mental instability is hard to deal with and I can’t blame her for it. As I got older my bulimia got worse and multiple times daily sometimes every meal. I want to get help and change but it’s very hard because binging and purging is an eating disorder and a coping mechanism for me and I’m almost scared to lose it. And it fuels it when people tell me I look like I’m losing weight… (maybe this is part of the reason they tell you not to say that anymore lol) had times of just plain old not eating as well. On the other side of the toilet (lol) I’m a barber, a musician, I ride horses and barrel race, I go to the river every weekend, and honestly enjoy my life with my boyfriend and dog. My boyfriend actually knows About my bulimia. He didn’t for awhile and then he heard me doing it. He tried to push me to get help for a long time then realized it needs to be my decision. So he’s my emotional support after the fact although I almost felt it was easier to deal with when nobody knew. \nThankyou for posting this. It makes me feel heard and happy I’m talking about this.     P.s. we all know it’s hard to get help, so in the meantime does anyone do anything to help their teeth stay ok?", "parent_id": null, "link_id": null, "context": null}
