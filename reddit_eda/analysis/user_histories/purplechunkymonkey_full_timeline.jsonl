Her pediatrician calls her a difficult feeder. She will eat chicken but only seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic. Same with pork and beef and salmon. The other protein she eats is the occasional cocktail shrimp no sauce. For fruit she eats watermelon, grapes, specific types of apples, and mandarin oranges. The only cooked vegetable she will eat is green beans. She eats all colors of bell peppers, cucumbers, celery, baby spinach, and lettuce but it has to be shredded. She is fine with most starches but will only eat potatoes in the form of fries from very specific places. The only sauce she will eat is alfredo. She will not touch anything that has tomatoes. So no ketchup, no pizza sauce, no spaghetti sauce. She can tell if I bought a new kind of pasta.\n\nShe has intense anxiety surrounding food. She needs to have control over what she eats. She has been like this since she was a toddler. At 12 she is better. We have a system worked out. If I am cooking something she doesn't like she is allowed to make her own dinner. She can cook and is quite the avid baker. If I am making pasta alfredo she gets pasta with alfredo sauce on top and whatever meat element on the side. For tacos she gets unseasoned ground beef, a tortilla,  a pile of cheese, a pile of shredded lettuce, and sometimes a pile of sour cream. These are all eaten separately. For spaghetti she gets plain noodles and usually adds parmesan. \n\nThis is just a general idea of her around food. Does this sound like ARFID to you?\n\nIs there anything else I can do to support her? We do buy whatever food she asks to try.", "parent_id": null, "link_id": null, "context": null}
