I believe I had/have arfid since I was a toddler. As a kid I would only eat a fixed set of \"neutral\" foods prepared by my mom, and would refuse to try new things.

I started learning about calories and nutrition, and took it too far basically, as I became addicted to restricting.  So I developed anorexia.  I never got treatment for it because my mother didn't believe in it but I was forced to \"recover\" which led to going from severely uw to obese in about 1.5 years.  I had about 4 normal years in high school/college but relapsed with anorexia eventually.  I have controlled food and exercise for my whole adult life.
