Having a protein with this could be great - look into what you would like. ( if u are like me and hate any protein options you can go for protein shakes!). \nI remember some cake recipes for picky eaters (I’m sorry for saying this but the video was taking about this) showed how one could add vegetable and protein like chickpeas while baking cakes and bread it wouldn’t be noticeable see if u can do that\n\nI think including some vegetable/salad/protein would be helpful- even if it’s one bite.
