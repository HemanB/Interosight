# Interosight

## Overview

Interosight is an mHealth application for eating disorder recovery, blending data-driven insights with a compassionate, engaging user experience. Our long-term vision is to create a Duolingo-style journey for recoveryâ€”where users progress through reflective modules, unlock achievements, and see their growth visualized as a meaningful path. The app combines structured journaling, behavioral logging, and actionable insights to empower users on their unique recovery journeys.
