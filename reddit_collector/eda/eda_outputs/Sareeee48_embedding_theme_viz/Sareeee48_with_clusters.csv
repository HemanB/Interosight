I lost a bunch of weight naturally in hs (not an ED yet but just recovered from years of starvation and this extra weight just seemed to taper off on its own) and she’d make comments about how I’d be bigger if I don’t exercise and “eat less/healthy,” and that really exacerbated my eating disorder later on and kept me from recovering.

All that said, I appreciate being called out because it isn’t fair to assume someone’s health, psychologically or physically.

She didn’t have an eating disorder. She had disordered eating, sure, but she did not having a full blown ED—she has never even described herself as having an eating disorder.

Tbh I feel like people use her as an example for what we WANT after recovery despite the fact that she continued to exercise, she refused to give up her physique for the most part and talks about dropping weight—all of the things we’re supposed to avoided in recovery—because she remained muscular and thin. If she didn’t, I doubt she’d be as hyped up as she has been, especially in the ED community.

I’m happy she eats intuitively now, but when I watched her videos as per someone’s recommendation I felt more triggered and upset with myself than motivated. I don’t look like her weight restored. Even when I started exercising again. And I know many of us don’t.

I just feel like she’s not a great example considering she clung to her physique and exercise in a way that we with eating disorders simply cannot do if we want to recover fully.",,,,Can we stop using Stephanie Buttermore as an example in recovery?,4
comment,2020-12-12 13:15:11,2020-12-12 13:15:11,fuckeatingdisorders,gfit0qq,"But the fact still remains that she DID NOT have an ED. When talking about overshoot I *always* see someone recommending her videos because she lost that weight (never said it wasn’t natural, but she still lost that weight and it is a talking point people cling to), but many people in ED recovery just don’t lose that weight, let alone within the first year. If she wasn’t thin and muscular (I say and because I feel like the two words have become one entity to many people), her story wouldn’t be as impactful as it was to so many in the ED community.

I don’t have a problem with her content, I actually enjoy how she explains the science behind it all, but we use her as an example of how we hope we look in and after recover and it’s not healthy.",,,,,4

We have to stop exercising at least for a couple months (in terms of lifting/intense running/ etc.) because our bodies need to heal. I literally couldn’t get out of bed for more than a few hours the first few weeks, let alone exercise. I like working out, but I understood that I had to give it up for awhile and restructure my relationship with movement so it’s enjoyable, not compulsive and compensatory. Stephanie literally took like a week or two off because she got sick, but she never 100% gave up exercise to allow her body to heal properly.

I’m also going to be *that* person and say that yes, you absolutely *can* quit exercising in the traditional sense for the rest of your life if you choose to. Going to the gym or running is not a necessity and it is absolutely valid to choose not to exercise because you had an ED.",,,,,2

That said, I’m absolutely going to have to respectfully disagree with you on exercising. Traditional exercise is *not* the only form of physical activity and people are perfectly healthy just running errands or doing chores around the house. My sister doesn’t “exercise” but she’s healthy. People don’t understand that you’re still burning calories by simply walking around the grocery store, from your apartment/house, between classes, etc. As a very active person who enjoys lifting, physical activity does not only mean going to the gym or running miles and we as a society really need to stop telling people it is and attributing to our unhealthy relationship with our bodies.",,,,,2

Running also does not build muscle, and fun fact, you burn the same amount of calories running as you so walking; walking, like running, is primarily a cardiovascular exercise and is excellent for the heart alone. There is no “baseline,” and you do not need to build muscle to be healthy, that’s such a misinformed statement.

“You’d be better for it if you push yourself,” how do you know that? Do you know the health of others’ just by their exercise routine? No, you don’t. I was at my unhealthiest exercising regularly. I am at my healthiest now, and I haven’t worked out at all since March save for a month in August.

Once again, nobody owes you their health. You don’t have to do traditional exercise to remain healthy, and even if you did you STILL a don’t have to exercise because you don’t owe anyone your health. Exercising can absolutely be a healthy outlet, but you. Do. Not. Need. To. Exercise. Traditionally. To. Be. Healthy. Point blank, period. I am not continuing this conversation anymore.",,,,,2

Health is not dependent on exercise, your entire argument is based on fatphobic ideologies and therefore mute. Your mention of excess body fat is, in itself, fatphobic. I don’t think you truly understand how fat mass to fat free mass works, especially considering the body makes it’s own muscle mass even in recovery from an eating disorder where the individual is most often refrained from traditional exercise (which is exactly why the tapering of overshoot and weight redistribution occur). My body fat is currently high due to recovery, but my doctor said I am healthy, for example. That is NOT a concern to them. Are you going to argue that because I don’t lift weight or do cardio and therefore must be unhealthy? That I “owe it to myself” to be healthier than I am now, despite currently having no desire to exercise yet? You can’t, because you do not know me, nor my body, nor *anyone else’s* body. Body fat does not equal health. Fat people exist whether or not we all eat and exercise the same (fat people can be and are absolutely be healthy too). Maybe follow fat positive people on social media, including those who exercise for enjoyment rather than an obligation to their health—which is *exactly* what leads to so many eating disorders—and be better.",,,,,2

I was upfront about my anorexia and body dysmorphia being the main things I need to target, otherwise I WILL relapse. We’ve been working toward changing my constant negative thought patterns (all of which are about my body); I’ve still been struggling but I thought maybe it’ll just take a little more time, three sessions isn’t a lot.

Well last night, I told her I was obsessing over my BMI, to which she asked what I could do about it. Obviously I said nothing... so she said she thinks we should build a goal to lose weight.

It’s worth fucking noting, I didn’t tell her what my BMI was. Our sessions are all virtual and she doesn’t know what I even look like. I said I cannot lose weight because I will relapse, that’s it, point blank, period. It’s not up for discussion.

So what did she do? She started lecturing me about not putting in the work to get better and change my thoughts, despite the fact that she knew FROM THE START that I refused to lose weight because I cannot do so without falling  headfirst into anorexia again.

Maybe I misinterpreted that part of your post, but I don’t think eating at “maintenance” is healthy for someone who is still consistently hungry on that much. Your body decides what is enough. 🤷🏼‍♀️

Also, I did balloon up. I retained A LOT of water up until recently, and I’ve also gained a fuckton of weight. It really does depend on the individual needs of someone.

He and I were in this weird phase where I was too sick to understand or even acknowledge his needs in the relationship outside of my anorexia and he didn’t know how to bring it up, so while he was at work all day I stayed at home, by myself, fantasizing about my single slice of cake I’d end up purging before he’d get home and then giving the rest to him and my roommates.

Peanut butter was one of the foods I fucking loved even when I was actively anorexic, but I only allowed myself one tablespoon of a specific brand once a day, maybe two if I restricted enough. It was basically the only “treat” I consistently allowed myself but it was *never* enough. I always wanted more but the fear and anxiety that thought caused me obviously dominated my choices. I even bought “zero calorie peanut butter” that was the worst thing id ever tasted, but I ate it because I wanted peanut butter so much.

The first month I started recovery, I remember I went through two of those big ass honey flavored Jif jars within a week and a half and it was amazing. I put that shit on everything. Toast, pb&js, bagels, oatmeal, waffles, smoothies, fruits, nuts, pretzels, desserts. I ate it straight out of the jar, fat ass spoonful after fat ass spoonful. Sometimes I’d change it up and buy almond butters and sun butters. It made weight restoration so much easier, and I still eat a spoonful almost everyday.

It’s crazy how this time last year, I was precisely measuring out a stupid tablespoon of peanut butter and giving myself a fucking conniption if i wasn’t 100% sure it was exactly a tablespoon.

I had to go from heavily restricting to consuming a large amount of food... at first it was very liberating, but after a month or two the honeymoon phase of eating what I want when I want faded and The anxiety came back. Every time I thought “I can’t eat that/I already had so much/I can save this for tomorrow,” I had to eat whatever it was. I found exposure therapy to be extremely beneficial for me because my entire thought process was “if I do this, something terrible will happen and I cannot possibly cope if they do.”

Also for me, calories wasn’t necessarily the issue, it was the control I needed. I also have OCD and comorbid disorders related to obsessions about my body (hence why exposure therapy was so effective), so it was easy for me to swing from one end to the other; the ritual of calorie counting and obsessions about calories and eating no more than an extremely low amount flipped to having to hit my daily minimums AT LEAST every single day for the last 11 months.",,,,,4

I know our bodies not only crave things we’ve restricted, but also nutrient dense foods in general, especially during refeeding (like peanut butter and the like). But I assume the overwhelming urge to eat high calorie “junk/processed” food is because our bodies know what’s in them and that it’ll get us back to homeostasis the quickest. I grew up eating peanut butter, for example, so my body loved when I ate a fuckload of peanut butter lol. I’m sure it varies depending on what foods we grow up eating, if that makes sense.",,,,,4

It’s more BED erasure to suggest that BED sufferers should not and never will be able to listen to their bodies, especially with the growing body of research on intuitive eating as a treatment for BED.

post,2021-03-12 19:12:44,2021-03-12 19:12:44,fuckeatingdisorders,m3oqw1,"I fucking did it.

I made it to March 2021. I gave up purging, compulsive exercising, and food restriction every single day, for 366 days. I gained the weight, I honored my extreme hunger when there seemed to be no end in sight, I ignored the exceptionally terrible thoughts about myself every time my body demanded more food. I kept telling myself it wasn’t my fault that my brain was fucked up when I’d grip the new fat deposits distributed to my trunk and, in that moment, seriously contemplated relapse. On March 12, 2020, at approximately 10:30 am, I gave up the  simultaneously monotonous and chaotic lifestyle that is anorexia that I had been drowning in for years, and clung to recovery like it was my lifeline.

I’m not foolish enough to call recovery a cakewalk, however. In fact, it’s been quite the opposite experience; the entire process has been the most difficult fucking thing I’ve ever had to do, to date. I cried almost every day for months, and I still frequently fall apart. As recently as December, I would say to myself over and over, “If I can’t be thin, I’d rather just be dead.” Absolute nothingness would have felt better than the constant psychological agony I was in every waking moment. 

Of course, despite the shitshow I perceived my own recovery to be, I now understand that a sick brain cannot think healthy thoughts until it is not sick anymore. A malnourished brain is a sick brain. So it’s no surprise to anyone that, when I was told things do in fact get better with time, I just had to trust them with nothing more than blind faith. “It gets better when you gain the weigh,” I naturally scoffed at such claims—I mean, haven’t we all? We all think *we’re* the exception. *I* was the exception. What if I’m always this hungry? What if I’m stuck in this disgusting blob of a meat sack for the rest of my life? What if I never accept myself post recovery? What if, what if, what if.

Spoiler alert: I wasn’t the exception. I’m no longer consumed with thoughts about relapses and losing the overshoot weight.  The uncertainty will end. It just takes time, and I’m still in the midst of the unraveling of it all.

Now, my fears haven’t necessarily dissipated. I’m still hyper aware of the physical sensations that my body experiences. The way fat folds when I sit, stand, bend down, breath in and out; the way my stomach dominates the space I take up, especially when I bloat; the way my shirts naturally fit tighter now that I’m no longer flat chested. I’m still terrified that this is my body now. And, naturally, it’s fucking uncomfortable. But Ive been telling myself, “I can tolerate my body just for today,” every single day for a year. What’s another year? Or two years?

My eating disorder has plagued me since childhood, and succeeded in digging it’s nails into my veins once more in early adulthood. Learning to cope with my body dysmorphia and this incessant need for control in healthy ways means flipping my whole world upside down. My body is still recovering, and the least I could do is give it some leeway. It unreasonable to expect my body to fit into such a tiny, rigid box when such rigidity is the very thing that was killing me to begin with.

Long story short, I do believe recovery is worth it. And I hope you all choose it eventually, when you’re good and ready. ❤️

I think I’ll do either a Q&A or a month-to-month overview of my recover and the psychological and physiological outcomes in the next day or so, so if there is anything you’d like to ask feel free to.",,,,1 whooooole ass year,4

comment,2021-03-16 22:02:08,2021-03-16 22:02:08,fuckeatingdisorders,gr67c15,"No, it’s not unfair. Especially when the majority of the community agree it’s triggering.

Intentional weight loss, when you have a restrictive eating disorder *at the very least*, is inherently disordered. Less than 6% of people with eating disordered are diagnosed underweight, so please don’t talk to me about how there is no “ED body type,” and then try to tell me that not allowing intentional weight loss discussions is unfair. There is no ES body type—therefore, intentional weight loss is not the answer.

What’s unfair is telling people in larger bodies that they should lose weight, *especially so* when they have eating disorders (restrictive or binge eating). Fat people suffer through eating disorders and disordered eating at the hands of diet culture and we label it as a “diet,” despite experiencing many of the same symptoms that diagnose a thin person with an eating disorder. That is the exact definition of fatphobia, and exactly why I don’t think it has a place here. Recovery should be about moving away from the bullshit concept that weight determines your health, and learn to view food and your body in a neutral light, no matter what you weigh.

I. Don’t. Care. How. Much. You. Weigh. Intentional weight loss topics are triggering, and not recovery focused. As I’ve said in my post, if you want to celebrate your weight loss, go to a weight loss sub. If I see it here, I will call it out, I do not care. I said what I said.",,,,,4

Hoping that you lose weight after recovery, whether from BED or anorexia, is centered in fatphobia. If you naturally lose weight during or after the recovery process, it shouldn’t be viewed as something to celebrate. It should be a neutral phenomenon, as should weight gain.",,,,,4

I was starved as a child which led to an extremely unhealthy relationship with food that developed into anorexia at like 6 or 7. I may have chosen to start purging and restricting when I was older, but I was basically destined to have an eating disorder regardless because I wasn’t taught how to deal with all that bottled up trauma. And don’t get me fucking STARTED on the generous contribution diet culture had on me and continues to have on everyone else as well.

EDs are very similar to drug addiction and the brain functions in very similar ways. The behaviors are due to maladaptive coping skills, and do not make it some easy thing you just choose and then get over. If that were true, eating disorders wouldn’t exist. So sure, I chose to give into those behaviors but I was already sick.

You don’t just have to lift weights or so cardio or walk >!10,000!< steps every day, you don’t have to burn >!1,000!< calories daily, or maintain a “toned” or thin physique. You can work out for 20 minutes or 5 minutes. You can take rest days, or rest weeks or even months or years if you don’t enjoy the “acceptable” forms of exercising. If it’s detrimental to your mental health, it can’t be all that healthy, can it? If you walk a lot (or even a little) at work, guess what? That’s exercise. Running errands or cleaning your house? Exercise. Movement and exercise should feel easy to want and perform. It should feel good, not like a chore, an obligation.

You also don’t have to restrict to be healthy. And you don’t have to lose weight to be healthy either, nor to be worthy of love, respect and self confidence. You are more than a body and fuck anyone who tells you otherwise.

If you’re hanging around other communities heavily influenced by diet culture, speaking poorly about IE and all in recovery (especially since these spaces clearly lack an understanding on how to recover from an ED, let alone nutrition and the metabolic processes involved) and knowing they’re going to back up your argument, you’re just being extremely and irrationally defensive and I think it’s important to evaluate why it makes you feel so threatened.

Knowing your ED makes you terrified of the notion is not the same, imo. If that all made sense lmao.",,,,,4

comment,2021-05-14 17:27:23,2021-05-14 17:27:23,fuckeatingdisorders,gy4fhiq,"I mean, it is fatphobic. The concerns you’ve listed are valid concerns and should be addressed with compassion and kindness, but they *are* disordered. Often people don’t understand that weight gain (especially obesity) are very often a symptom of something else, and not because someone “lacks control.” We put the entire blame for being fat on the individual, and ignore the real underlying health and socioeconomic problems that are entirely independent of ourselves; we force the emphasis on weight because diet culture has taught us that weight is relevant entirely by itself, and it. Is. Not.

We know fat people can be healthy. We know living in poor conditions that significantly exacerbate stress lead to chronic health problems, including heart disease and others that can have weight gain as a symptom (it is *not* just an “overeating” problem). We know glorifying thinness and wellness culture are the reasons eating disorders (both restrictive and binge eating) and BDD are on the rise. So yeah, there is *way* too much emphasis on weight, even in the ED recovery community.

Everything else, I agree with. I was someone deeply entrenched in diet culture, on top of being predisposed to anorexia due to genetics and environmental factors and I get the irrationality—to an extent. I don’t obviously can’t change everyone’s minds and I don’t want to, but nobody is entitled to my emotional labor when they won’t listen anyway. A saying I really liked was “your privilege doesn’t erase your struggles, but your struggles don’t erase your privilege.”

Also, I’m 100% not trying to come at you at all. I tend to come off really aggressive through text so if i did I apologize.",,,,,4

That is the entire point of fatphobia. Diet culture specifically stems *from* fatphobia and racism—especially towards black people.

On top of that, western culture is riddled with ways to oppress fat people, and that is a fact.

I do however agree with your last paragraph. Thanks for clarifying.",,,,,4

comment,2021-05-15 03:44:53,2021-05-15 03:44:53,fuckeatingdisorders,gy6gxb6,"Lmao, Asian people (including Japanese) are POC, they aren’t white, in terms of European and (especially) American standards. And just so we are clear, we’re discussing western diet culture and the influences it’s had *globally*. You can play the “diet culture is directed toward white people too,” game all you want, but it doesn’t change the fact that it’s still rooted racist ideologies. Diet culture affects *everyone*, absolutely, but especially POC. BMI was created to represent white, European bodies that excluded POC and specifically demonized black bodies. That *is* a fact and it’s not up for debate.

Because I didn’t touch on it previously, you cannot say you have nothing against fat people while actively not wanting to be fat yourself. The majority of people with EDs struggle with fatphobia and internalized fatphobia, including myself. The fact remains, if you are actively avoiding fatness, you have a bias toward your fat friends and fat people in general and you *do* judge them for their fatness, at the very least in subtle but nevertheless harmful ways.",,,,,4

Haiiiiiiii, it’s me again. I’ve been meaning to make this post since my one year mark back in March, but I’ve just been so busy with... well, not being fucking sick for the first time in Y E A R S. And truthfully, I was unsure about how recovery had made me feel, not only physically but psychologically as well... but after January, I think I finally discovered myself again, and immersed myself in my creative endeavors all over again. It was as if I never fell out of it... but I digress.

I’m going to go over my recovery month-by month, in detail, in hopes that it will be of some use to somebody in this sub. If you have any questions, feel free to ask!

**Month 1:** I decided to recover the day my state went into lockdown. My extreme hunger kicked in *immediately*, which scared the shit out of me. I remember telling myself I would “allow” myself to eat, but only after I restricted for x amount of hours and only after I exercised... of course, I then found out gyms would remain closed for the foreseeable future (including my apartment’s sad excuse for a gym), and I was really forced to loosen my obsessive grip on exercise, which in turn convinced me to eat as well. It took me a few days, but I was able to throw myself into the throes of extreme hunger and eat according to my body’s needs. I ate every hour, as I’d feel physically ill and faint if I didn’t. I ate, and and, and then ate some more. Extreme hunger gave me no leniency during  the nighttime hours, either; I’d wake up every at least three times just to eat. Fuck, I remember counting up all of my calories once and I ate close to 11,000kcals in one day.

I was constantly shoveling food into my mouth (particularly nutrient/caloric dense food—i.e., “processed junk food”), yet i was still hungry 30 minutes later. I suffered from gastroparisis long before recovery, so all that food just sat in my stomach for hours. I was so bloated that I looked as if I was in my third trimester of pregnancy. I immediately retained water, specifically in my hands, feet, legs, the entirety of my midsection, and my face. 

Around week 3, my emotions, which I’ve been numbing for literal *years*, were flipped back on. Everything made me cry; to my friend jokingly saying I hurt his feelings to my boyfriend’s tone shifting slightly. Everything f elt so overwhelming all the time.

Extreme physical exhaustion basically forced me into hibernation, as I slept for 14 hours a day. The night sweats (aka, hypermetabolism) were so severe that I had to lay down a blanket underneath and use my own sheet to guarantee my partner’s side of the bed wouldn’t be soaked as well; everything I put into my body was immediately burned off because it just didn’t know what the fuck to do with it all. This stage was so miserable because I was constantly changing out of wet clothes and ensuring I ate more and more so I wouldn’t lose more weight. At this point, I have gained approximately 15 lbs of pure water and water weight, but have not gained true weight just yet.

**Month 2-3:** by this time, I was no longer struggling with night sweats associated with hypermetabolism, though I still slept half the day away, cried frequently, and ate at a significant surplus. I could not be physically active for too long, as my legs would swell and I’d begin to feel faint. Month two was when I finally started gaining true weight. It felt rapid at first, but looking back I truly believe it was probably about 1.5-2 lbs a week. 

At about two months, none of my ED jeans or shorts fit and I would have regular meltdowns, ranting and raving about how this is a nightmare and I must have gained a million pounds. But I continued eating.

**Month 4-7:** these next three months were messy for me. Most of my pre-ED clothes didn’t fit at all, and my body image was at an all time low; my body dysmorphia was constantly being triggered every time I caught a glance at my
own reflection. I was body checking at an all time high, compulsively checking every single angle, pinching my flesh, and begging my friends for reassurance they learned quickly not to give me. 

But I still didn’t know what I looked like. Looking at photos from before I entered recover were surreal. I didn’t realized how emancipated I was—not just my weight, but my hair, the dark circles under my eyes, how pale and physically fragile I was, as if I’d shatter if I fell too hard (that was a real concern of mine, by the way). But when I looked at myself at this time in my recovery, I saw some hideous monster and that was very difficult for me. I developed a phobia of my own reflection and I began to miss my ED body.

Extreme hunger had reduced around month 4, but was still present in my every day life. I had read so much about how others weight restored after just four months, and My rigid, OCD brain somehow convinced me that I absolutely **had** to be weight restored now, so I began to ignore the remnants of my extreme hunger and only allowed myself to eat [redacted] calories a day. Nothing as low as during my active anorexia, but still not enough to support my recovering body, which unfortunately still required a lot of food. I’m not completely sure as I never weighed myself once at this point, but I believe I lost a little bit of weight and my body was not happy about it.

Couple all that with extreme food boredom and I fucking relapsed, got stuck in a state of quasi recovery, whatever you wanna call it, for 3.5 months. I was constantly hungry, but had zero appetite. It was especially bad at night.

**Month 8-9:** I was able to pull myself out of that relapse and began honoring my extreme hunger once more. I was averaging about 4,000kcals a day for two months. I got rid of my ED clothes, and I started therapy after realizing that I was not recovering psychologically at all, my OCD was flairing up and my body dysmorphia forced me to think about the way I looked every hour of every day. The new clothes I’d bought suddenly felt tight and I noticed new fat deposits in places I’ve never had fat before. My face was swollen and my body felt tight from the water retention.

I have a short short torso and long legs, which resulted in any weight gain I had to my trunk/abdomin region looked compact and too heavy. My ass, thighs, and upper arms also held a lot of weight, whereas my wrists, feet, calves and neck seemingly gained nothing at all. The best description for this foreign body would be, an adult sized toddler. It was uncomfortable and I felt alien in my body, all of the time.

I had gotten a physical done for my new job, and I’d requested not to know what my weight is.... so they told me my BMI instead. I cried for an hour.

These months were very difficult for me, because recovery just felt hopeless and not at all worth it.

**Months 10-12:** new year, new me—literally. I finally began to see the brighter side of recovery, just dimly. My extreme hunger vanished completely, for the first time in almost a year. I was still eating about 3,400-3,800kcals daily, but my body was still doing a lot of internal healing. I no longer thought about food and every once  in awhile I’d experience fullness. 

I dropped some water weight and no longer felt uncomfortably bloated and swollen. I stayed a consistent clothing size and no longer had to continuously buy new leggings and underwear.

I still struggled immensely with my body dysmorphia, and an inability to look at myself from the neck down... but I suddenly had more energy to go back to weight lifting  purely for enjoyment and no aesthetic goal despite my (perceived) uneven weight distribution. I found motivation to start making art again. I laughed a lot more.

**Month 13-14 (present):** my appetite has stabilized and I now experience hunger. I feel like I did, pre-ED  as far as hunger cues and my physical health feels. I have loads of energy to do the things I want, such as hiking, going on walks, and I’m able to be present no matter what food I might have to eat or if I might have to skip a workout (fun story, I dropped a weight on my foot and haven’t worked out properly in about 2 weeks). 

I have “overshot” by quite a lot compared to what I lost. My body feels extremely foreign to me, and my weight has yet to redistribute (all in the belly). However I’m slowly moving away from the concept that I’ll lose it. I want to feel comfortable in my body regardless of my size. My relationship has improved, I’m excelling at my job, and I get to eat freely and I can be present with friends, family and my therapist.

That isn’t to say I don’t have my struggles. I still can’t look in mirrors without feeling immense embarrassment and disgust. I’m currently struggling to ensure I’m eating enough when I’m stressed (going through a really rough time in my life). I have a bad habit of buying clothes that are too big and then crying about the size. But I am actively working on dismantling my own internalized fatphobia and practicing radical acceptance about this new body. I am aware of the things that trigger me and have to make the conscious decision to not give into compulsive ED thoughts, because at the end of the day I am responsible for my own mental health.

To sum this post up, recovery is fucking hard, often for a long damn time. But it is soooososososo worth it if you wade through the really fucking bad parts, when it feels like it isn’t worth it at all. You have a mental disorder, but you are not broken and you deserve to live a life without your eating disorder whispering in your eat every second of every single day. I hope this helped at least one person. 🥰",,,,14 months in recovery,4

Recovery has improved my relationship soooo much though. He was extremely supportive when I told him I needed help and when I decided to recover.

I bought all the things I restricted and ate them for months, but now I’m just indifferent about food. I’m that stereotypical “idk what I want, you pick” kinda girl, lmfao.

That said, there are a few things I know I really enjoy, so I try to get them regularly/semi regularly and rotate foods out. I try new foods and a lot and so my diet is constantly changing. Most times I’ll eat chicken, but I’ll try to change up the way it’s prepared, or I’ll eat a lotta beef one week instead. Or I’ll try tofu dishes instead.

The overshoot I think is the worst because it really exacerbated my body dysmorphia and I want nothing more than to just peel my skin from my bones some days.

IMO, fatphobia is a trauma in and of itself that often starts in childhood and, yes, absolutely contributes to the rise in eating disorders over the past few years. A connective trauma, I guess.

[Some] risk factors for eating disorders include weight stigma and a history of dieting; of course, you need to meet psychological criteria to be diagnosed, but the line between disordered eating and eating disorders often become blurred, so is important to understand that, at the end of the day, EDs are mental disorders. Therefore, I think it’s worth noting that many eating disorders do stem from fatphobic ideologies at a young age... not all, but some.",,,,,4

It’s literally in the rules.

There is a big fucking difference between encouraging others to explore more foods, especially later in recovery, and flat out telling others to eat less sugar or less carbs because some of you are afraid of swinging entirely in the other direction after restriction (which does not happen as often as people think).

Look, extreme hunger is shitty, and it can be so, so hard. I went through a whole 10 months of it. It can be scary eating a lot of food, especially caloric/nutrient dense foods that are labeled “processed” and morally “bad” according to society, despite our bodies craving them because they get us out of that energy deficit the quickest (which is exactly what your body wants). This is even more true when they are fear foods we’ve avoided for months, or even years. Honoring those cravings, that hunger, and listening to your body (at your own pace, of course), is the only way to get over extreme hunger. Physical and mental restriction at bedt only prolongs the recovery process, at worst causes a full blown relapse.

I’m **not** telling you what or how to recover; if you wanna cut out certain foods, you do you—but don’t discourage others from eating them either. Instead of making people feel bad about it, say “you’re doing great!”, “I’m proud of you,” “I’m going through the same and it sucks,” or just… don’t say anything at all.

We are a recovery focused space. I dont care how well intentioned you are, these comments are hurtful and invalidating and lead people to question their hunger and possibly even a relapse.

I find it weird you mentioned my support of all in, despite even saying in my post, and many times previously, that going at your own pace is totally fine. If you need a meal plan, follow a meal plan; just make sure you’re eating enough. If it’s easier to slowly add foods back in rather than going all-in (pun intended), then that’s okay. Some people work best with structure, others would rather just get it over with. Recovery is very subjective and everyone will recover at their own pace.. That’s totally fine. I have no qualms about that.

The fact remains, however, that restriction is inherently unhealthy, both psychologically and physiologically. I don’t care if you don’t wanna go all in, that’s fine, but you don’t get to talk about your restriction here, nor encourage it on others’ posts—especially considering this is one of very few subs that are predominantly supportive of the all-in method.

You ask why we should guard ourselves from diet talk if we hear about it anyway, and I just… don’t know why this is even a question you’re asking? You wouldn’t tell an addict at rehab that it’s pointless because the substance of choice (for lack of a better phrase) is everywhere outside regardless. This is a safe space where members don’t have to worry about whether or not they’ll be triggered, where individuals can discuss their recovery or their struggles with their ED that doesn’t explicitly discuss in detail methods of restriction or “DiEtInG,” specifically because it *encourages* disordered behaviors. My opinions on dieting are irrelevant; discussing it is harmful to members and encourages ED behaviors (whether intentional or otherwise).

On top of that, there are *countless* other subs dedicated to dieting and pro-Ana content where you could go, here is not the place to do it for all the aforementioned reasons. It doesn’t matter that you have a different opinion on what is considered healthy, because you aren’t entitled to anyone else’s health and therefore you don’t get to comment, in an ED recovery sub, what is and isn’t healthy. It doesn’t matter that you don’t feel a responsibility to make sure other members don’t feel guilty, because it’s mine. It is my job to enforce the rules, and that includes rule 10 (No Diet Tips), which includes encouraging weight loss and restriction. You don’t have to like or agree with the rules, but you do have to follow them.",,,,,4

comment,2021-07-17 15:40:07,2021-07-17 15:40:07,fuckeatingdisorders,h5ix528,"Actually, studies show that at least 70% of women have a disordered relationship with food and their bodies. They may not have eating disorders, but just because many people intentionally lose weight doesn’t mean they’re automatically healthy. Weight is not synonymous to health. It’s also worth mentioning that studies have shown that people at higher weights are generally healthy; the ones who aren’t usually have gained weight as a symptom of a chronic illness rather than the weight being the illness itself. Therefore, losing weight doesn’t diminish the illness (oftentimes it exacerbated it) but individuals who aren’t fat are less likely to face discrimination in the medical community and receive the care the initially needed when they came in with a larger body.

Edit: are you asking how dieting can be healthy in the long term, or how intuitive eating can be healthy in the long term? If IE has lead you to eating freely without reactive binging, whereas “dieting” has lead to all the aforementioned consequences, remember that eating disorders are a mental disorder—however, the affects of starvation are the same regardless of how disordered one’s thoughts are. You will still experience extreme hunger, reactive binges, extreme fatigue, hair loss, amenorrhea (if you are an individual with a uterus), slowing heart rate, dizziness, etc. I think it’s safe to assume dieting (in terms of restriction outside of allergies) is going to lead to at least a few of those symptoms.",,,,,4

You’re absolutely right, many people leave treatment fully determined to go right back to their eating disorder because centers did the absolute bare minimum of refeeding and cognitive rewiring.

That said, I’ve noticed more centers are taking on approaches that don’t emphasize target weights, limited intake, etc. and that’s awesome. Still a long way to go, if course. Especially considering how rampant EDs have become over the last decade alone.

The one thing I do feel the need to say is that treatment centers aren’t meant to be a cure for all of your mental health woes. depression and anxiety can exist outside of your eating disorder—treatment isnt guaranteed to fix that, nor is it guaranteed to fix your eating disorder for that matter. You can learn all the of the skills at at the best treatment centers in the world to manage your ED but if even if you use them and still relapse, it’s not on them. 

And it might sound depressing to say I’ll always have an eating disorder, even when recovering, and that my anxiety and depression were worse afterwards because I wasn’t numbing myself anymore; but holy shit I’d rather be depressed here and there and maybe have a relapse once in a blue moon than *always* being in my eating disorder every waking moment with no time for anything else that’s important to me. 🤷🏼‍♀️",,,,,4

After finally choosing recovery in 2020 (when I was 1000% convinced I’d never recover *ever*), and realized I actually had zero access to a gym and lockdown meant I couldn’t hide my exercise addiction and weird food habits from my partner anymore, I just… let go. And it was awesome, for the first time in ***years*** I ate without any anxiety, and I even felt okay initially gaining and retaining a shitload of water. I really felt like I’d be able to recover pretty easily.

However, it only lasted about a month or so. The honeymoon phase, if you will, wore off. The anxiety I hadn’t felt in weeks came crashing down and I relapsed for a few months.

Tbh, eating normally is really not achievable right off the bat; you have to eat back all the calories you’ve restricted over the months/years and that can take quite a lot of time, not to mention quite a lot of food.

comment,2021-08-14 20:31:52,2021-08-14 20:31:52,fuckeatingdisorders,h8y9vdw,"Short answer: yes, anyone at any weight can experience being in an energy deficit due to not eating enough which results in being under one’s set point weight.

Long answer: eating disorders are mental disorders, weight is irrelevant; on top of this, most people with EDs are people of “normal” weight or overweight. 

Weight is a really shitty indicator of health. BMI isn’t even backed by any sort of science whatsoever; it was created by a mathematician over 200 years ago to study white, European men (which makes it even more difficult for women and non-white individuals). The overweight marker was even dropped from 27 (if I’m not mistaken) to 25 because “27 is too hard to remember.” It also doesn’t factor in genetics, sex, or bone density. A single number cannot determine that.

Body weight aside, starvation is starvation. The body has a set weight it is healthiest at and functions optimally (yup, even if you’re not conventionally “thin,” you can be overweight/fat and still be healthy). If you drop below that via restriction and dieting, even if you aren’t thin/underweight in terms of BMI, you’re still in an energy deficit and will eventually lose hunger/fullness cues; experience a drop in hormone levels; catabolism (your body eats it’s own muscles and bone mass for fuel), damage to vital organs such as the heart and brain; lose your hair; and become hyper fixated on food, among many other things.

Yo-yo dieting and heavy restriction has been scientifically proven to cause more weight gain in the long run. And that’s not delving into adaptive thermogenesis (starvation mode), aka gaining weight despite being in energy deficit. And yes, it can happen to anyone who restricted. The body gives two fucks about your reasons behind restriction, all it knows is that food isn’t coming in and it will physiologically respond the same in any situation that results in a shortage of food. Even if you don’t eat lunch for one day, you’ll notice you’ll be hungrier at dinner and eat more (or at least want to). 

Hope that all makes sense. I can offer sources for all of this if you’d like. I encourage you to check out r/antidiet and r/intuitiveeating as well, those are great sources as well.",,,,,4
comment,2021-08-25 22:46:46,2021-08-25 22:46:46,fuckeatingdisorders,hacpxrb,"Thin privilege is very real, and it is very prevalent in the ED recovery community. I think a huge reason we mainly see these types of bodies is because they are still socially acceptable, whereas others in larger bodies are not. You’ll get praised for living in a privileged body (white, thin girls are told they’re strong, beautiful and deserve to eat) while those in larger bodies either get a whole different kind of praise or straight up disgust and encouragement to engage in ED behaviors (think, the “you’re so brave” comments for doing basic things just because they’re bigger or being told they should eat less solely due to their size).

I don’t follow these accounts anymore. Tbh, I don’t follow most thin ED accounts because quite frankly, they make me feel fucking terrible about myself and I ask myself the same questions you’ve asked here: why can’t I look like that?

Edit: I’m not saying recovering into a thin body isn’t okay, it absolutely is, but I feel like there is a stark difference between those who recover into a thin body (or play the role of recovered while still actively engaging in behaviors) and those who don’t. And those who don’t often have a significantly harder time trying to navigate recovery and accepting their body at a higher weight compared to those who gained very little. EDs are mental disorders and everyone with an ED is a victim worthy of recovery, but to say “it’s hard for everyone” ignores the pain those in larger bodies go through just for simply existing in a society that literally condemns being fat at all costs.",,,,,4

I don’t think it’s misguided to point out the contrasting views and following between these influencers and those in larger bodies. Are all of them like this? No, there are a lot of amazing influencers who just happen to be thin, but I’ve been in the recovery community long enough to observe that *a lot* of them are not truly in recovery and it’s keeping people stuck.",,,,,4

And then you go onto fat positive influencers or fat recovery accounts just to read all of these fatphobic comments about someone who literally has zero impact on their life.

post,2021-09-14 00:52:02,2021-09-14 00:52:02,fuckeatingdisorders,pnsdub,"Even if your ED tells you to, even if you haven’t eaten all day but don’t feel hungry, even if you’re experiencing extreme hunger and you *just ate* but want more, even if you’re weight restored, even if you’re binging out of hunger, even if you have BED, even if someone previously told you that you need to eat some arbitrary amount to maintain some arbitrary weight/BMI. 

Firstly, if you’re binging due to hunger, then you’re going to need to make sure you aren’t restricting (aka listening to your body and honoring your hunger); restriction leads to reactive binging and the body wants to compensate for that; hense why those with restrictive EDs eat a whole fucking lot in recovery. And if you have ensured you’re honoring your body’s need for food but still experiencing relentless hunger, then look into other possibilities such as chronic health conditions, etc. 

Secondly, suffering from BED doesn’t mean you need to restrict either (I *really* wanna address the one). BED isn’t driven by hunger and restricting isn’t going to fix the binging—if anything, it’s going to exacerbate it and make it worse in the long term. Not that I’m saying it’s easy, and I understand why restriction seems like a logical response to overeating in a society that basically encourages undereating, especially for those in larger bodies. It’s hard when it feels like you can’t trust your body and that food is the enemy. But if you want to stop binging then learning to cope with the emotional responses and reactions that lead to a binge and those that happen after a binge, hopefully with the help of a professional, is going to be a lot more effective than restricting to “manage” them. Telling others who have restrictive EDs that they need to eat (and eat  *a god damn lot* if they are in recovery) according to their hunger isn’t encouraging BED and tbh I’m a little confused why some of y’all are reporting comments for that.

Bottom line: I understand “recommending” a minimum number of calories to people, especially those who are still terrified of eating (regardless of your ED), might not sit well with others but if you’re struggling with an ED and you’re hungry, then you 99.9% of the time, you should eat. 

You are absolutely allowed to believe that restriction would work for you or whoever else, but there are other subs more suited for that kind of talk so I don’t really think this is the place for it and I am not going to argue with y’all about it.

So… Thanks for coming to another one of my TED Talks. Good night.",,,,Y’all NEED to remember that restriction isn’t encouraged here,4

post,2021-09-19 12:13:27,2021-09-19 12:13:27,fuckeatingdisorders,pr6t19,"Hey guys, I’m gonna keep this short and sweet so I can get right to the point; I realize that many people don’t know what’s going on with their body when they start recovery from a restrictive ED. There are so many things I myself wish I knew before diving into recovery, so I thought I’d compile the most common/important things together in a list for you all, in hopes that it will help y’all who are just starting recoveru.

1. **Your body is gonna do some wack shit for awhile:** you’ll likely retain a fuckload of water within the first few days/weeks (I promise, it’s not true weight gain yet); you’ll be hit with severe body aches and extreme exhaustion to the point you can’t leave the bed and sleep for 14+ hours every day. You’ll be bloated and bowel irregularities are basically a nonnegotiable, necessary evil. Take this time to really, *truly* rest for at least a few weeks, if possible.

2. **No, you’re not developing BED. Yes, it’s normal to eat thousands of calories in a single day:** I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen y’all freak out over the possibility of having BED right after choosing to recover from your restrictive ED (not talking shit, I absolutely understand the fear and the lack of knowledge surrounding extreme hunger). But that’s just not how BED works; the DSM-5 has made it clear that true binging cannot coincide with restrictive behaviors as it is then classified as an abnormal circumstance that leads to rhe large consumption of food. In other words, it is impossible to binge early on in recovery when your body is struggling with months/years of malnutrition. You need to eat back *all* of those calories you restricted over the span of your ED, *on top* of your normal daily caloric intake (which can range anywhere from 2500-3500kcal). This can round out to a lot of food, but I’m telling you right now it’s normal. I ate upwards to 11,000kcal the first month or so. The most important rule to follow is, if you’re eating out of hunger, it’s not binging.

3. **Extreme/mental hunger should always be honored:** even if you’re at a “normal” BMI. Even if you’re technically overweight by BMI standards. Even if your doctor or psychiatrist (who aren’t nutritionists or dietitians, btw, and have little to no academic learning in nutrition) tell you to eat at some arbitrary number that leaves you feeling unsatisfied and hungry. Extreme/mental hunger can be so hard to cope with, especially if you don’t fit into the “emaciated anorexic” stereotype. But you can’t work around it either; the only way out is through.

4. **2000 calories ain’t it:** you need to eat more, probably *much* more than this in recovery, and very likely *after* recovery as well. 2000 is what most 10 year olds eat. And on a similar note, you also dont need to follow some made up TDEE you got from the internet. Those calories are what you’d need if you were in a coma and not moving and don’t account for the various factors in your life. Walking, breathing, typing, even eating burns energy. Honor your hunger.

5. **A starved brain is incapable of doing the important psychological work and the neural rewiring essential for long-term recovery:** this is the paradox of why eating disorders are so difficult to treat; the starved brain is irrationally terrified of food and weight gain to the point it can be fatal, but the only way to overcome those fears for good is to is first eat and gain the weight. You can prep yourself and brace for the inevitable panic attacks and emotional breakdowns, but you cannot rewire your brain when it is still malnourished. You have to gain the weight first and allow your brain to heal as well.

6. **Dont expect weight restoration to solve all of your problems:** this might seem to contradict number 5, but bear with me. I read all of these things about how weight restoration would bring me mental clarity and miraculous neural rewiring… that wasn’t the case whatsoever. I mean, don’t get me wrong—I’m definitely *much* better off, but you need to learn the skills to fight off relapse for long term recovery/remission, hopefully with a professional if you have the option of doing so. Don’t assume you just need to gain weight to get rid of the eating disorder.

7. **Your body decides your set point, not you:** I feel like so many of us get caught up by this one. Our weight is influenced by any *number* of factors, including genetics, sex, height, and environment. Your body knows what weight it functions best at and it will probably be at a weight higher than what you’re comfortable with. But you *cannot* fully recover until you accept that your body calls the shots. Please challenge that fear of weight gain and of being at a higher weight because it’s going to hinder your recovery if you don’t. Ask yourself these important questions: what’s so wrong with being at a higher weight? Who told you being at a higher weight was unacceptable? Would you tell a loved one that they are any less deserving of kindness, love and respect because they are at a higher weight?

8. **Youll probably overshoot, and it might not taper off:** basically, you gain “extra” weight above your preED set point weight. One thing I read (I can try to find the source if you’d like) that suggested that the longer and/or more severe we restricted, the higher we’d overshoot. But here’s the thing: overshoot weight is *necessary* weight. The body has a set fat to fat free mass (muscle) ratio; it first must regain optimal fat levels before it can restore muscle mass, hense why we look soft and dough-y after weight restoration. The excess fat will be used to support long term healing, balance hormones levels, and overall used as an insurance policy of sorts in case you decide to restrict again and it will have energy to keep you going if that happens for however many months/years. If you developed your ED as a child/teen, it may not taper off as weight gain is a normal, healthy part of aging into adults and we typically don’t stop growing until age 25. I restricted pretty dedicatedly both as a child for 3ish years and as an adult for 6 years and I overshot by *a lot.* I kept hoping and hoping it would taper off soon because so many people said it would, but it hasn’t and as much as I hate to admit, it may never will. This is also something you will have to accept and work through in order to prevent a relapse.

9. **Let go of exercising and compulsive movement:** At least temporarily for conventional exercise or general movement, until your weight and body have stabilized. Firstly, the severe swelling, bloating, body aches, extreme fatigue, and extreme hunger will not only make it exceedingly difficult to maintain an exercise routine, it will likely make these symptoms significantly worse. Your body is severely depleted of energy and requires a ridiculous amount of rest. Now, obviously you don’t need to do absolutely nothing for a few months to a couple of years, but you may require bed rest the first month or so (I did); after you finally start to experience the benefits of increased energy, I still suggest to keep it away from conventional exercise until you are sure your weight is stable and you can choose to exercise from a place of enjoyment rather than a compulsive need or as compensatory behaviors. I know some people say the continue to exercise but I don’t really recommend it, personally.

10. **Weight loss is not compatible with recovery:** you cannot focus on weight loss while actively trying to recover. You have an eating disorder; you can’t just tell your brain, “I’m gonna restrict again but this time will be different!” It won’t. On top of that, your body gives fuck all about what you *want* to happen, all it knows is that suddenly there’s not enough food coming in and you’re back to square one before you know it. You cannot choose to lose weight and actively remain in recovery. It’s counterintuitive. I encourage you to let go of the idea of manipulating your body/weight and accept your body at whatever weight it ends up at because you are worth more than some arbitrary BMI number that was created to represent white European men *only* (yup, no women or non white individuals whatsoever) in the 1830s. 

11. **Junk food and sugar are your FRIENDS:** firstly, I want to say that you should stop giving moral value to food altogether. ALL food is good food. ALL food has nutrients. Take an apple and a cupcake for example; we know the two are different nutritionally speaking. An apple has fiber and various different vitamins and nutrients such as vitamin C and potassium… but what you might not know is that a chocolate cupcake has magnesium and other essential minerals including calcium, sulfur, zinc, iron, copper, potassium; flavonoids with antioxidant properties; and vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5, B9 and E. Not only this, it is a great choice for those in an energy deficit due to restriction due to its higher calorie content. I tell y’all all the time here to honor your cravings for these foods because they hold a significant purpose in recovery, contrary to what diet culture will have you believe. Junk food will literally save your life where low calorie foods such as fruits and veggies will fail you. You are going to suffer from gastrointestinal distress that will be exacerbated by fibrous fruits, vegetables and whole grains, leading to painful gas, bloating, cramps, and irregular bowel movements. High calorie, nutrient dense foods will actually be easier on your digestion and metabolize much quicker, which will promote faster healing. And remember: once you’re weight restored, you *do not* have to go back to restricting these foods. Eat them when you want, because restricting them will cause you to fall back into ED habits, even if you think you have control over them. You are allowed to eat the foods you crave for the rest of your life.

12. **As much as your ED will try to convince you, you aren’t the exception to recovery:** We often feel like we’re the exception to the rules of recovery, that it won’t work for us because [insert ED reasoning here]. it will most likely feel like you’ll eat endlessly forever, you’ll be hungry forever, you’ll gain forever. That your metabolism is irreversibly damaged… and as someone who thought the same exact thing, I can tell you with certainty that your eating, hunger, and weight will normalize (“normalize” meaning your body will find the middle ground that is healthiest for you). Your body isn’t stupid, it’s the result of millions of years of complex evolution whose sole purpose is to keep you alive; the last thing your body has in mind is to keep you eating and gaining until you die. I promise you that you aren’t gaining as quickly as you probably think. In fact, there is no “too quick” in recovery.

13. ***DON’T*** **compare yourself to everyone else and their recovery:** everyone is different. Don’t compare your progress with some YouTube or IG influencers who only gained x or xx lbs while you gained more or look different or eat more. *Your* recovery is *yours* and you are doing what you need to do. Try not to stress about others whose background you don’t know, because for all you know they could still be struggling. You’re doing your best and that’s what matters.

14. **Recovery isn’t linear, so take your time:** challenge yourself and your ED with opposite actions and unlearning societal norms that harm you, but don’t push yourself too far too quickly. Take your time, go at your own pace. You have an eating disorder and deserve to be kind to yourself. Recovery will have ups and downs and sometimes you might slip for a little while, tomorrow is a new day, fuck even a minute from now is a new moment. Don’t beat yourself up for small mistakes and learn from the big ones. Okay? Okay.

comment,2021-09-24 23:35:13,2021-09-24 23:35:13,fuckeatingdisorders,he5l5bc,"Yes. Your body needs to rest in order to recover and exercise burns more calories, which means you have to eat *more* on top of recovery amounts (that are already particularly high, especially if you have extreme hunger). This makes physical repairs of the body significantly more difficult because you’re burning off much needed energy that it needs to heal. And to top it off, it can cause even more weight gain in the long run because your body is literally fighting you to gain weight at all. The desire to continue exercising when you want to recover is counterintuitive and disordered; you can *always* go back to exercising or sports once you are weight restored and nutritionally rehabilitated. It isn’t going anywhere!

I also really encourage you to reflect on why you only allow yourself “whole foods.” All foods are processed in some way. All foods have a purpose; continuing to give moral value to food (aka, “whole foods is better”) will set you back in recovery.",,,,,-1

Thirst is frequently mistaken for hunger. This one is just… dumb.

If you eat within three hours before sleep, you’ll gain weight since the metabolism slows during sleep (which somehow means you gain fat??? Your body is still gonna metabolize what you ate regardless).

Eating high volume, low calorie foods will make you fuller. Similarly, eating caloric dense foods with allow you to eat far more calories and gain weight… umm excuse me, so you know how our metabolism and energy needs work?

The entire fucking concept of the keto diet.

comment,2021-10-25 22:27:22,2021-10-25 22:27:22,fuckeatingdisorders,hi1jm1r,"Essentially, yes. Starvation affects all bodies the same, regardless of weight. Only 6% of ED sufferers are clinically underweight, which means that 96% are either “normal” weight or overweight. So that in and of itself should say something. If you’ve been restricting for long periods of time, regardless of your weight, you’re going to have to basically eat back all the calories you denied yourself to fix the damages of your eating disorder.

Since all bodies are different and no two recoveries are the same, nobody will gain the same amount of weight. It all depends on your set point, the severity of your illness, and the duration of it. It may or may not be proportionate to someone who is underweight, but if you were overweight prior to your ED, you may be overweight *after* your eating disorder and that’s totally fine. Even if you are currently underweight. Even if you are currently at a “normal” weight, and so on.

Weight isn’t a sole indicator of health and BMI is a shitty, unscientific method that shouldn’t be used at all, tbh. It doesn’t matter if it’s anorexia, ARFID, OSFED, atypical anorexia, bulimia, weight gain is basically inevitable and should be encouraged. The only exception would be BED, in which case refeeding isn’t the goal. *However*, restriction should still be discouraged as it only perpetuates the desire to binge and doesn’t resolve the real problem—resolve/cope with the emotional stressors and/or trauma that leads to binging and you’ll stop the binging.",,,,,4
post,2021-10-28 15:23:26,2021-10-28 15:23:26,fuckeatingdisorders,qhpg5i,"The latest trend, for lack of a better work, I’ve been seeing lately is being a “nOrMaL/hEaLtHy” weight and therefore less deserving of recovery, especially when it comes to eating.

Eating disorders are *mental disorders*, the body and therefore it’s weight is not something that specifically defines an eating disorder. Did you know that only 6% of those diagnosed with eating disorders are clinically underweight? That means the other 94%—you know, the vast, **vast** fucking majority—struggle with an “atypical” eating disorder due to their weight, despite suffering from the very same consequences of malnutrition. You are sick enough. *You are sick enough.* **You are sick enough.** ***YOU ARE SICK ENOUGH***. And you deserve to nourish yourself and to eat.

And let me be perfectly clear: I don’t give a flying fuck what your weight is, *if you are restricting, especially for extended periods, you need to eat and you need to eat a fucking lot.* point blank, period, end of story. And if anyone tells you otherwise, I will personally square up with them (not really, I’m a baby, but I will support you emotionally because fuck them).

Obviously this isn’t a “shut up and eat” post, because never is it ever that simple. This isn’t a post encouraging you to recover (there are countless posts already doing that here). But sometimes we need the validation and reassurance that we are sick enough, and we *do* deserve to eat just as much as anyone else even if we don’t fit into the “typical” definition of eating disorders.",,,,Here is your reminder that you don’t need to be underweight for your eating disorder to be valid,4

•Coffee with a lotttt of coffee creamer

•2 Starbucks breakfast sandwiches with a lotta mayo 

•Two poptarts

•Oatmeal with whole milk or heavy cream, a banana, and a shit ton of butter

•3 bowls of cereal

•Two slices of toast with more butter and jelly

•Cheese cubes

•Half a family sized bag of pretzels

•A bowl of yogurt with high carb fruit, granola and soooo much honey

•3 fat peanut butter sandwiches with a tall glass of whole milk

•A Wendy’s 4 for 4 (sandwich, nuggets, fries and unreasonably sweet lemonade)

•A spoonful of peanut butter every hour or so

•Hot chocolate made out of heavy cream

•A whole pack of those mini hostess donuts

•A sleeve of Ritz crackers

comment,2021-11-26 19:09:48,2021-11-26 19:09:48,fuckeatingdisorders,hm6ow4h,"Gonna have to disagree with you. I’m also extremely into fitness and even went to school for nutrition and kinesiology and manipulating your physique requires restricting your diet, which isn’t compatible with recovery.

All that aside, she has also been caught photoshopping her photos, which seems really weird to me if she is supposedly so comfortable with her body. Again, I’m not opposed to people referring to her as a fitness influencer (and this certainly isn’t an attack on her as a person, either), my issue is that she is promoting all in as if you can still exercise to manipulate your body and weight (even if she doesn’t say it) and that’s not how it works. You can be into fitness and not have a desire to change the way your body looks, especially if it involves restricting. Claiming to be an intuitive eater when you aren’t is extremely harmful to a lot of her followers who *do* struggle with disordered eating, and though she is absolutely free to do what she wants with her body, she’s affirming to these people that you don’t need to fix your relationship with exercise and continuing the notion that thinness is superior.

Also, she’s weirdly focused on her body and food and that in and of itself is a sign of disordered behavior.",,,,,4

And it’s the same with professional athletes, there’s this one article about a sponsored Nike athlete who came out as having developed an eating disorder due to the pressure from Nike to look a specific way (and that *really* turned me off to buying their products tbh).

Celebrates are really no different in terms of how deep they are in diet culture and how much it’s part of who they are as a celebrity. That’s why there are so many touting about these miraculous diets and/or workout routine that helped sculpt their physique or shed those last few pounds for good, that virtually everyone else is going to fail partly because 1) 94% of all diets fail and 2) because they’re lying about the results and the diet/workout routine itself, and many can afford surgery to modify their bodies as well. Beach Body and all those products are notorious for lying about the efficacy of their workouts, and the fitness industry in general is known to either be extremely restrictive if you’re a woman in particular and encouraging steroids and an exceptionally bland diet if you’re a man. I know this example on its own is very anecdotal, but my boyfriend was a wrestler in high school and told me about how he begged his doctor to prescribe his steroids because he felt like he couldn’t keep up with his friends.

It really just goes to show how fatphobic society is and why both eating disorders and body dysmorphic disorder are on the rise.",,,,,4

Dieting/weight loss is *not* compatible with recovery. Even if you’re overweight, even if you’re a “normal” weight, and so on.

If that’s what you’re into, fine, you do you, but this is not the place to do it. Members are already struggling to listen to their bodies and nourish themselves, they don’t need y’all telling them that they should be eating less or differently or changing their body. Recovery requires you to eat according to your body’s hunger cues—yes, even BED and bulimia—and telling people to practice restraint  (such as “don’t keep binge food in the house!”) is damaging at best and just reinforces the concept that food is the reason we struggle so much, that it should be avoided.

comment,2021-12-16 19:47:24,2021-12-16 19:47:24,fuckeatingdisorders,hotjw97,"I entirely disagree. It borders both fatphobia and pro-ana/mia content which break the rules and it’s my job as a mod to make sure members feel safe here. The issue with “lose weight” on an ED sub is as follows:

1. It implies that being overweight means you cannot be energy deficient and that’s entirely not true.

2. It’s extremely dismissive of overweight people with EDs who need to be able to eat freely, and yes, even very likely gain weight, in order to recover. Only 6% of restrictive ED sufferers are underweight. If your ED has caused you to gain past your set point, restriction isn’t going to fix that; in fact, it’s going to make it exceptionally worse and lead to other negative health consequences. Plus, restricting actually *reinforces* binge urges, hense why a lot of BED treatments are beginning to be tailored around an intuitive eating and HAES friendly approach. I do agree with what you said about unintentional weight loss, i should have clarified when I said *intentional* weight loss isn’t compatible with recovery. And it’s not. If you fix your relationship with food and you naturally lose weight, as some people do, then this doesn’t apply to you. This is something that is frequently talked about in this sub so I didn’t think it needed clarification. My bad.

3. If you are struggling with hormonal issues (as I have myself), restriction doesn’t fix them. Now you just weigh less with hormonal issues. And as someone who’s family struggles with insulin resistance and diabetes (and therefore I myself am at a higher risk for), losing weight doesn’t magically fix these things and there’s really no scientific basis that universally claims it does. In fact, exercise, and treatments that don’t fixate on weight as a whole, has been documented to manage these things a lot more effectively. Theres a reason more than 90% of all diets fail, and why virtually everyone who loses will gain more weight back than they initially lost.

4. Even *if* intentional weight loss and restriction worked, EDs are extremely competitive disorders. You don’t know who you’re encouraging weight loss or food restriction to, or how damaging it can be to others reading the posts/comments and feeling invalidated in their disorder, like they aren’t good at having an ED and need to try harder (the way many atypical ED sufferers feel).

I understand what you are trying to say, and your struggles are valid, but these are pretty specific instances that you are describing; the whataboutism you’re playing is irrelevant because you’re discussing an entirely different scenario to discredit my initial claim that encouraging dieting and intentional weight loss *while in ED recovery* is not okay. Yes, everyone’s recovery is different, but you should be focusing on nutritional rehabilitation (again, even if you have BED or bulimia) and healing your relationship with food and your body. Some people will end up fat and that’s entirely okay and is not synonymous to being unhealthy either (not to mention the science to prove otherwise just isn’t there). If you naturally lose weight in the process, sure. But I think it’s weird to seek out faults in my post, with nothing but hypotheticals and anecdotes, because you feel defensive.",,,,,4

You’re going to need to eat ***A LOT*** of food in order to heal the damages your ED has caused as well as gain the necessary weight for your body. “Normal” eating comes with time (it took about a year for me), but you can’t starve your body for months/years and expect yourself to eat “normally.”",,,,,4

Most people with restrictive EDs say they have developed binge eating when they are actually experiencing extreme hunger and end up at a higher BMI than they are psychologically comfortable with. I’m not saying you don’t have BED, but I think it’s worth reflecting on if you binge to self soothe/ distract from emotional triggers or due to restriction (oftentimes it’s due to restriction, whether that’s mental, physical, or both). OP is talking about people who wound up overweight *after* recovery from a restrictive ED, not those who are in an overweight body because of binging.",,,,,4

I think it’s really unfair and misguided to assume that people in larger bodies ended up that way by eating “icecream and cake and not working out” and others are thin because they do the opposite. That’s not how it works whatsoever. These types of comments are harmful to not only larger bodied folks, but anyone struggling with a restrictive ED. These people are already terrified of gaining weight and stuck in a vicious cycle of rigid control and fear to suppress and manipulate their weight despite the science proving that doing so is extremely damaging both physically and psychologically, and this viewpoint isn’t what they need to read on a recovery sub.",,,,,-1

I feel super embarrassed because preED I was within the “nOrMaL” BMI range and now I’ve overshot (for lack of a better term), and it is something I’m really struggling with despite how hard I advocate for fat acceptance, etc. but I am trying so hard to work on that.

comment,2021-12-29 03:29:04,2021-12-29 03:29:04,fuckeatingdisorders,hqd675y,"I understand set point well, and out of all of the extensive research I have done and throughout the conversations I had with my previous therapist who was also specialized in EDs, I have never once heard of what you’re talking about. Set point is a range of 5-20 lbs, yes, but it doesn’t simply change because you are more active and decide to “eat in moderation” (another word for restriction imo), if that were true 94% of diets wouldn’t fail, nor would individuals gain back all their weight and then some, because they’d be able to manipulate their set point. Whether or not you intended it as such, you are implying that making physical changes is a “lifestyle” that directly influences your set point and that’s literally why most of us are in recovery—because we put too much emphasis on our physical bodies and the food we put into it. Set point is affected by many things, from our environment to our physical and psychological well being, but the range is just a safety net, you can’t just decide you wanna weigh 20 lbs less. And as someone who is extremely active and eats according to my hunger, I don’t weight less because I go to the gym or work an active job.

I’m not saying your treatment team is full of shit but treatment centers have a long history of being fatphobic, even in subtle ways, and many do not understand or even accept set point, and if they so accept it they believe it is something that can be manipulated to achieve thinness. So I’m sorry if I’m not really impressed with your therapist’s opinion. Maybe I *did* misinterpret your comment, but I’m still left feeling like you and your team are excusing restriction and manipulating your body based on set point being within a range and I just think that’s… really weird for ED specialists to encourage. Also, saying individuals weigh more because their less active and eat “bad” food *is* fatphobia. Don’t really know how it’s not.",,,,,4
comment,2021-12-29 12:28:05,2021-12-29 12:28:05,fuckeatingdisorders,hqeid0m,"I definitely misinterpreted to an extent, but I still don’t agree. Your treatment team is *still* insinuating that eating “bad” foods lead to less muscle mass and an overall higher weight—even if it’s within some range—and that eating “Whole Foods” (which isn’t actually a real term or way of eating and extremely vague at best, *most* foods are processed, doesn’t make the nutritionally inferior) means you will be leaner and weigh less. That is still giving some type of moral value to food, even if you say that’s not what you’re doing, because it still feeds into diet culture myths that food is a huge factor in our weight when it isn’t even on the top of the list, *if* at all. Your scenario feels flawed in that 1) you don’t know if twin 1 or 2 has a healthy relationship with food based on their body mass or even lifestyle; if eating “Whole Foods” is only sustainable with money, why are eating disorders, including orthorexic behaviors, so prevalent among young women of all demographics? What makes eating this way healthy and intuitive, when it raises the risk of disordered eating at best and a full blown eating disorder at worse? Because at the end of the day, you don’t know what each twin’s relationship with food is. For all you know twin 2 can feel restricted and out of control around the foods twin 1 is comfortable with. This is still an exceptionally idealized version of recovery and ignores all biological drives that cause us to crave sweet foods and the mechanisms that cause us to feel out of control around foods we limit despite really wanting them (it’s one thing to say you don’t like sweets, it’s another to avoid all “junk,” I know that’s not what you said but that’s how I view the scenario). 

Also, I’ve got a lotta gripes with the obesity thing. “Obesity” isn’t caused by poverty forcing poor people to eat fast food/processed food—if that were true, all poor people would be obese. It’s *a lot* more complex than that. To start, poverty leads to excessive stress that can cause many chronic health conditions that not only affect fat people (heart disease, for example) but poor people in general, and tend to go untreated specifically for fat folk by a negligent medical industry. The weight stigma that permeates the medical industry prevents fat people from receiving life saving medical procedures and medication in favor of unsustainable weight loss that, again, leads to more weight gain long term; and then there’s the fact that there are many health conditions that *causes* weight gain as a symptom (think PCOS, diabetes, hypothyroidism, Hashimoto’s). Fat people die because of the medical industry’s fatphobic beliefs and unwillingness to treat them accordingly. Studies show that medical professionals actually view fat people as less than and show them far less compassion in their treatment approach. Then there’s the fact that dieting causes a lot of damage and contributes to the “obesity epidemic” and, yeah, in turn can lead to other health consequences down the road… but *only* if you don’t let your body level out and continue to yo-yo diet and weight cycle like this. And we haven’t even begun to discuss the case of “obese” individuals who are perfectly metabolically healthy, and it’s more common than people will choose to believe.

I definitely agree that certain things improve our overall health, such as regular exercise (whether that’s just running errands, cleaning your home, walking or going to the gym) and eating a variety of foods that a lot of people don’t have access to due to poverty. But I do *not* agree that obesity is a product of poverty and processed food consumption because it entirely shifts the damages of fat phobia away from its source. It’s not a poverty problem, it’s a wide spread, *systemic* problem.",,,,,4

We deserve to feel proud of our bodies, damn it!

Here are a few of my own:

2. Super simple but… I can go up my apartment steps without feeling like I’m gonna faint!

3.

Not to sound harsh, but don’t tell someone what they are doing is unhealthy when you aren’t educated on the recovery process nor recovering yourself.",,,,,4

That said, eating disorders are competitive by nature and many people are in flat out denial they have them. I completely denied that I had anorexia for 6 years and bragged about how healthy I eat compared to everyone, how I take care of myself and exercise and limit processed foods, and I didn’t even realize how damaging that was to others around me, especially in a society that basically encourages that.

I had the opposite experience, personally. I got a lot more attention when I was underweight compared to now; it’s almost like it was fetishized to a weird extent. Everyone close to me says they like me better now… but I don’t get hit on anymore lmao. I don’t weigh myself, but I am most definitely overweight and I don’t feel beautiful at all. I do struggle with body dysmorphic disorder so I’m sure that contributes on top of my own internalized fatphobia, and I know overall confidence is a factor. But people who fit the “beauty” standard, whether you’re overweight in the “right places” or straight up thin do tend to get treated better on a systemic level. It’s not an excuse to not work on your own fatphobia but I understand why so many people struggle with ending up at a higher weight.",,,,,4

comment,2022-02-20 16:14:21,2022-02-20 16:14:21,fuckeatingdisorders,hxptt80,"Not sure if there are other mental illnesses specifically, but I’ve got no shortage of mental illnesses/disorders from OCD to ADHD, on top of trauma after trauma. I wouldn’t necessarily say I’m “proud” to have any of them (save for the ED but only while I was actively restricting), but for the longest time I did make it an active goal to be this helpless little girl who deserved all the love and attention and to just be coddled; and yeah, it did feel good when people treated me as such. But I don’t think I’d attribute that to any specific mental illness. 

I think one reason why we feel so “proud” to have an ED is because we are taught that weight loss = good, healthy, morally superior. Many people with EDs deal with dichotomous thinking (also called black and white thinking); if this thing is good, anything outside of it must be bad and vice versa. So it makes sense that restricting, losing weight, and all of the other behaviors and symptoms that accompany EDs will seem “right” to us. We’ve literally wired our brains to make those connections, and this societal obsession with thinness really doesn’t help either.",,,,,4
post,2022-02-21 11:44:55,2022-02-21 11:44:55,fuckeatingdisorders,sxrm0p,"**Repost because for some reason the original was not letting me reply anymore or even edit the post.**

So I initially posted this as a comment, but I feel it’d make a pretty relevant topic due to the influx of posts to this sub regarding intake. Many people are asking how much they need to eat and often eat too *little*. 

Recovery minimums are going to range anywhere from 2500-3500 based in age, sex and height.

•AFAB individuals younger than 25 between 5’0” and 5’8” (152.4 to 173 cm) will need a minimum 3000 kcal/day; 25+ individuals will need a minimum of 2500kcal daily. If you are taller, you’ll need a bit more; shorter a bit less.

•For AMAB individuals under 25 between 5’4” and 6’0” (162.5 and 183 cm), you will need minimum 3500 kcal daily. 25+ individuals will need 3000; once again, if you fall outside of the given heights, accommodate by adding or removing an average of 200kcal.

Keep in mind that these are minimums you will likely naturally fall into after recovery as well according to age, sex and height. I understand that some people claim counting calories in recovery holds them accountable to hit their minimums so I’m not going to argue that, however don’t rely too heavily on calorie counting as you progress into recovery. Regardless of whether you choose to go all in or take a slower, “more structured” approach, the end goal should be to eat without shame, guilt or anxiety.

**These guidelines apply regardless of your weight.** The intake values are confirmed averages for “average height and weight.” Most people fall within this range—almost everyone will reside within a BMI of 21-30, with the absolute peak being around 27.

Here is an article regarding recovery minimums and why they are the same post recovery as well: https://www.edinstitute.org/orientation-basics/phases-of-recovery-part-four?rq=Phases

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now, we will get into the doubly labeled water method that has documented the above calorie needs in many peer reviewed studies and even influenced the FDA’s initial 2350-2400 calorie guideline.

DLW is the gold standard method for assessing daily metabolic rate of a living things over a period of time. So, what is the doubly labeled water method, exactly? The DLW technique measures total carbon dioxide production by observing the differential rates of elimination of a bolus dose of the stable isotope tracers, 2H (deuterium) and 18O… in simpler terms, regular sampling of heavy isotope concentrations in body water, by sampling saliva, urine, or blood,  measure elimination rates of deuterium and oxygen-18 in subject over time. 

The caloric intakes reported are always higher than the “2000 caloric guideline” among those who don’t restrict. And, interesting enough, non restricted groups were reported to have less body mass as well. Let me be clear, though restriction will always lead to*more* weight gain long term, you don’t need to lose weight if you happen to be in a larger body; you aren’t a failed thin person and you are fine just the way you are. 

Here are the studies: https://p302.zlibcdn.com/dtoken/6be0e20b2ca1347ea71e94271858156a (pg 84)

https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/129/10/1765/4721939

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many of you have been being up the fact that many people claim to eat much less than the intakes mentioned above, or that they “loosely track” their loved ones’ intakes (please stop doing that, by the way, it’s still disordered) and noticed they eat fat less. Many studies have concluded that individuals, *especially* women, tend to underreport because they believe their peers will judge them. Women who are more concerned about their social status, if you will, were reported to underreport their intake by **507 kcal/day**, compared to those who cared less about their “social desirability.”

Regarding underreporting of caloric intake: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12495831/

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12372163/

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lastly, I can’t find the original document anymore (I had posted the link to a comment in this sub last year, though it seems to have been swallowed by the void), but I still feel it’s very relevant to this discussion. The FDA has been pretty open about the fact that 2000 calories isn’t enough for both men and women; intially 2350 was the baseline as reported by USDA survey data and doubly labeled water fast experiments, but received a lot of fucking backlash both from the public and medical professionals, mostly rooted in fatphobia, so the reduced the guideline to appease the masses who are more concerned with weight gain over and individuals properly feeding themselves.

&gt;The FDA proposed using a single standard of daily calorie intake--2,350 calories per day, based on USDA survey data. The agency requested public comments on this proposal and on alternative figures: 2,000, 2,300, and 2,400 calories per day.

&gt;Despite the observable fact that 2,350 calories per day is below the average requirements for either men or women obtained from doubly labeled water experiments, most of the people who responded to the comments judged the proposed benchmark too high. Nutrition educators worried that it would encourage overconsumption, be irrelevant to women who consume fewer calories, and permit overstatement of acceptable levels of ""eat less"" nutrients such as saturated fat and sodium.

https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/08/why-does-the-fda-recommend-2-000-calories-per-day/243092/#:~:text=The%20FDA%20proposed%20using%20a,and%202%2C400%20calories%20per%20day.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Remember that you are not going to fall into some clean cut intake, and you’re going to eat more on some days and less on others. These are not hard numbers you absolutely have to follow, but it’s important to understand that you still need a lot of food both during recovery and afterwards.

If you have any questions, I’d love to try and answer them to the best of my ability. If need be, I can always add in more sources. I am also open to having a civil discussion but we are in no way making fatphobic remarks or encouraging restriction. Thanks. ❤️

**Edit:** I always hear the same complaint regarding Olwyn that she isn’t an ED specialist and thus her advice is moot (even though she is a researcher and patient advocate with thirteen years' experience in general practice, chronic gastrointestinal illnesses, allergies and intolerances). But… neither is Tabitha Farrar, and I’ve yet to see the same argument had about her despite their recovery methods being virtually identical. Both back their claims up with peer reviewed studies and confirmed scientific data—ya absolutely don’t have to like them or their methods, but you can’t just deny the science.

Another thing worth addressing: someone pointed out that you should always try to see a professional. Olwyn has never advocated against seeing a professional and neither have I. If you have the luxury of seeing someone, do it. **But not everybody has that**; some aren’t financially well off, insurance doesn’t cover treatment, or experiencing weight bias has turned individuals away from professional help. Many of us are forced to recover on our own. Just something to be mindful of.

**Edit 2:** I said I wasn’t going to tolerate fatphobia, but I’m still going to loosely address the concern. If you say you can’t eat these minimums because you will gain weight, well… y’all aren’t gonna wanna hear this, but you need to gain weight. If you were at a higher BMI prior to your ED, you’re very likely gonna be at a higher weight post recovery. Not going to argue set point with y’all, but if you’re constantly having to monitor what and how much you eat to maintain some arbitrary weight, you’re not recovered. I said what I said. You can’t continue the same behaviors that kept you sick and call it healthy this time around—that’s not how restriction works, your body gives fuck all about what weight you *want* to be at and it’s going to act accordingly. Hense why I’m always telling you guys that [intentional] weight loss is not compatible with recovery.",,,,Repost: On Caloric Intake Before and After Recovery,4

But they aren’t healthy and you know that. Flaunting the fact that you have remained thin—often *very* thin—is just another way the disorder shows itself. It feeds off validation, and the age of social media really exacerbates this. That’s why pro-Ana sites exist. That’s why this content is the bulk of recovery hashtags—not because it’s actually healthy.

Remember that eating disorders are competitive illnesses. Unfollow these “influencers” and if you truly want some real recovery content your best advice would be to follow fat positive influencers and anti diet influencers. Expanding your social media to include a variety of bodies is going to help you accept yourself that much quicker.",,,,,4

Sure, a sandwich is great but so is a side of chips and a drink; and if you factor in calories in mayonnaise, meat and cheese, you can end up with a meal that’s easily 600 calories.

Lmao honestlyyyy what even were they doing? I’m hypoglycemic and they **never** got me through til the end of the school day (like 2-3pm). I’d do the same and eat a bunch of snacks before dinner too and stil have room for dinner. Same for breakfast, I remember I would eat like 2 HUGE bowls and my sister commented on it once and I felt really shitty afterwards because I knew I was gonna go to school and eat their free breakfast too.

It’s also just pretty damn harmful to individuals *already* struggling to eat enough or going through extreme hunger and eating more than double, sometimes triple, that in a single day and reading “this is plenty,” especially when they will get the same damn comments from diet subs that contribute to their disorder. 

I’m sorry, but from the hours or research that I have done—whether or not you think it’s accurate—that intake is *not* enough. It’s honestly really not fair to suggest that I am only using “small” studies to make a point, like fuck my knowledge, right? The Doubly labeled water method is known for its extreme accuracy and there are more than just a few small studies on it. It is something the FDA based it’s initial 2350 calorie guideline from. It has been proven to be more accurate than other methods of determining nutritional and energy needs.

I also want to point out that most ED sources are drenched in outdated, fatphobic rhetoric and of the mindset of “recover, but not too much” that is harmful to the majority of ED sufferers who either recovery into larger bodies or were never underweight to begin with. They also lack knowledge on overshoot, extreme hunger, fat distribution, etc. so no, I would not like to read anymore clinical guideline textbooks that repeat more of the above aforementioned issues. There is a reason relapse rates are significantly high among ED sufferers, and a large part of that is because treatment often involves maintaining on a caloric amount that simply isn’t enough to sustain a human body, let alone one in recovery that needs a substantial amount of food.",,,,,4

I understand the concept of gentle nutrition. But what annoys me is that the sub kinda makes it “mandatory,” and it gives me major restriction vibes. Gentle nutrition should be about what you can *add*. Unless you have allergies, intolerances, GI issues exacerbated by certain foods, or food you just plain do not like the taste of, there is no reason to replace or remove them. And it should be centered around foods you enjoy. Like, if you want a greasy burger but you also want to get some vegetables in, why can’t you order the burger *and* a salad together?

If we’re talking lethargy, bloating, gastrointestinal distress, water retention, body soreness, cravings, and hunger, that’s all par for the course in terms of recovery. I felt fucking awful for like 9 months into my recovery, but it definitely dissipated with time despite eating relatively the same. When the body is being fed adequately, it’s first response is to allocate all available energy to repairing damages, and that can result in extreme fatigue, tummy troubles, and overall uncomfortable symptoms.

That isn’t to say that you can’t dislike certain foods—you absolutely can. But assuming you’re still early into the process, I wouldn’t blame it on “junk food,” especially if you’re still struggling with assigning moral value to foods. Remember that anxiety and stress can cause uncomfortable physical symptoms as well; and it’s very common to feel guilt and shame—a by product of anxiety and stress—after eating these foods due to diet culture’s influence.",,,,,4

On one hand I get it—it was amazing when my extreme hunger disappeared, likewise it was crazy to me when I first experienced fullness, but it wasn’t something I was *hyperaware* of either. And I didn’t post ecstatically about it either.

It’s not even so much the individuals either—it’s that nobody seems to be correcting the behavior that really gets me.",,,,,4

I wrote this awhile ago and thinking back now, I should have used “extended period” of restriction rather than “long periods.” Essentially, yes, all of this still applies to you; you still restricted, and thus you’ve caused damages that require repairs, which can only occur with enough energy (aka food). Food is something our bodies *need* to survive, even a day of not eating enough can result in negative symptoms that can only be remedied by eating enough. Even if you don’t not restricted for a few months, weeks, or even hours, *you still deserve to eat and honor your hunger.* if you are physically and/or mentally hungry, you need to eat.

post,2022-05-06 18:41:15,2022-05-06 18:41:15,fuckeatingdisorders,uju72b,"I’m sitting at the airport, finally free to actually make this post! I’ve been wanting to do this for a few days but I’ve been so busy with, well, life. But I digress! I’ve noticed lately that many of us here are struggling with the symptoms that accompany honoring extreme/mental hunger. In turn, I’ve been thinking about all the things that helped me when I was in deep, so I thought it’s time for yet another list! Let’s get started:

1. **Heating pads or hot water bottles.** eating so much so frequently made my stomach *crazy* sore and tender, bloated, bubbly, and just overall not very happy. Resting a hot water bottle (I didn’t have a heating pad) made constantly resting a bit more cozy and helped relieve some tenderness.

2. **Peppermint tea.** *Now, this is going to really depend on the individual as I know some of us used teas as a means to restrict, so be mindful of this tip.* That said, peppermint tea is great for digestion and I really personally loved the cooling sensation it had in my [sore] mouth, throat, and constantly full stomach. If nothing else, it’s very soothing.

3. **Gas-X, or similar OTC products**. This goes without saying, but early recovery is… gross af hahah. I was soooo gassy, it was not even funnyyyyy, I’d literally run my boyfriend out of our bedroom, RIP to that poor man. While Gas-X wasn’t a cure-all, it did help alleviate some pressure and offer me little physical relief.

4. **Baths.** Honestly, shout out to Epsom salts for being there for me during that first year of recovery when the entire trunk of my body was so sore and swollen from constantly needing to eat. Not only did it help with some of the soreness but it was nice to just relax and take my mind off eating for even *just* 30 minutes. Highly recommend.

5. **Don’t cover your mirrors.** This one is going to be difficult for some of us, I’m sure, but hear me out. We know that our EDs are a product of neural pathways we’ve created, which thus lead to a negative response. Removing or covering your mirrors because your recovering body triggers you is simply going to result in a phobia of mirrors that will be difficult to unlearn later on. This is *especially* true if you struggle with Body Dysmorphic Disorder like I do. I made the mistake of not looking in any reflective surface three months in and now, two years into recovery, I cannot bring myself to look at my own reflection without feeling panicked. Do not recommend.

6. **Avoid high fiber foods, and instead focus on easily digested foods like simple carbs and fats.** I mean, if you enjoy fibrous foods, more power to you, however, keep in mind that in the case of early recovery the digestive system has slowed to extract as much nutrients as possible. Fiber is going to lead to bloating, and thus uncomfortable fullness without actually leaving you satisfied, as well as gastrointestinal distress. Of course, you can always add these foods back later! Or if there are certain foods high in fiber that you happen to be craving that’s absolutely okay, just bear in mind that they *may* contribute to some discomfort… but recovery is already uncomfortable, so you do you.

7. **keep some snacks by your bed when you go to sleep at night… or just in general.** Okay, so lots of you have been bringing up waking up in the middle of the night absolutely *ravenous*. If you’re too exhausted to get up, just keep something high calorie that you can eat when you wake up. And this can apply even during the day, when we’re prone to take hours-long naps too. 🥰

8. **If you’re thinking about food and/or WANTING food, even if you don’t feel physical hunger, you need to eat.** Mental hunger is there to get us to eat in times of famine, and is even present when we aren’t in an energy deficit. Have you ever heard the saying “don’t go to the grocery store hungry”? That’s mental hunger.

9. **Remember that honoring your hunger means honoring ALL cravings.** Yes, even if “nOtHiNg BuT sUgAr,” yes even if you’re not eating “full meals,” or getting all three macronutrients in the way you (read: your ED) would like. Even if it’s something so fucking weird that you’d never even consider it if you weren’t so god damn nutrient deprived (I was obsessed with Lime tortilla chips in vanilla icecream). Even if you are at a “normal” weight or higher; only 6% of ED sufferers are underweight—weight is irrelevant to whether or not you can experience EH. You are valid and worthy of eating how much you want regardless of your weight. ❤️

I might add to this when I have time so if you wanna add to this list, or just have a question, feel free to comment! Love you guys, and I’m proud of y’all.",,,,Tips to help you through extreme/mental hunger,4

Despite having an interest to eat being a sign of hunger, the opposite isn’t necessarily true; a lack of interest to eat is not the same as losing hunger, that hunger is still there.

I have ADHD and I get that way too sometimes when I hyperfixated on certain things for hours and forget to eat and the “desire” to eat isn’t there. But i notice hunger through other means—irritability/crankiness, nausea, low blood sugar (shakiness, weakness, etc.). This usually results in me having to eat a larger portion to make up for that time in between. It feels real inconvenient in the moment, but eating frequently, even when I’m not famished, is the best thing for my recovery, and my life in general.",,,,,4

The example I gave wasn’t specific to sweets, but caloric dense foods in general. You’re still opting for low calorie options over other calorie dense foods. This doesn’t *just* apply to sweets foods, though they are the most common even for those with EDs who never really had a sweet tooth to begin with. Which I think is significant because you even said you like cookies, fiber one bars, and kodiak muffins (which have just as mucin sugar as other muffins, btw.).

Like I said, I’m not claiming it’s impossible, simply that a malnourished body is going to gravitate *toward* high calorie foods (which is clear via your cravings for fatty meat). Not that it is *only* capable of craving these things. But due to our tendencies as disordered individuals, I simply think it’s best to err on the side of caution when claiming to only crave low calorie, high fiber foods. I don’t think textures would be considered disordered, it’s when you only eat specific foods and nothing else due to the textures is when it becomes concerning.",,,,,4

Only 6% of ED sufferers are underweight, and yes, some people *will* end up in a larger body, or were *always* in a larger body. Are they less deserving of  honoring their hunger, of a healthy relationship with their body? If you haven’t guessed, the resounding answer is **NO**.

If discussing weight in terms of ending up in a fat body makes you uncomfortable, I **highly** encourage you to address that discomfort. Fat people are people too, and deserve to live comfortably in society. Consider the advice you offer here because it can be really fucking harmful for members who *already* have a fear of weight gain; instilling fear with misinformation is inappropriate and, quite frankly, wrong. I’m seeing way too much if it lately in a recovery sub I’ve worked my ass off to be a safe space for *everyone*, especially people in larger bodies who are *vastly* underrepresented in the ED community.

It’s one thing to be *clinically* underweight (which is also a problem in and of itself not because these people fit the clinical diagnosis of underweight, but because they are *overrepresented* and are the most likely to recieve treatment over someone who isn’t clinically underweight), it’s another to tell members in larger bodies that they should eat less, than they need to lose weight, that their disordered thoughts are “healthy” just because they are fat, that they must have binge eating disorder, that they don’t need to gain weight or honor their hunger.

The “naturally skinny people suffer too” trope is in itself a fatphobic statement to say to marginalized individuals who have to fight tooth and nail just to exist in their bodies. It’s like saying “well what about white people?” Again, does that mean underweight or naturally thin people don’t deserve help, to vent about their experiences? Absolutely not, everyone is welcome to share their experiences here… as long as it doesn’t perpetuate harmful rhetoric about bodies and feed into stereotypes that bar majority of people from getting treatment. 

Remember that the biggest environmental contributor to eating disorders is the **sociocultural idealization of thinness.** eating disorders ruin lives and take so much from us, but as someone who *was* clinically underweight*, while fatphobia especially affects people in larger bodies it also affects *everyone*, and prevents many people from recovering.",,,,,4

For me, I craved *a lot* of things and usually made “low calorie” versions of the food my family cooked because I sooo wanted to eat what they were eating. I also craved deserts and other sweets like crazy, but never gave into them. Save for occasional planned “binges” that weren’t really “binges” at all, and id double down on behaviors afterwards to accommodate for them. I do have ADHD and now that I’m recovered I rarely have cravings because I feed myself what I want when I want it as well as eat a varied diet and eat regularly. Which is a problem. In all, food is really boring and trying to figure out what to eat is a chore because I hate cooking and would always opt for the “easier” meals if given the opportunity.

-wanting food to look perfect definitely resonates with me, but I did reach a point where I was making weird ass food concoctions and didn’t give a fuck what it looked like after awhile.

-I also do really remember thinking that I could never be able to eat as much as others because I’d never be truly full. I’d want more and more and more, which is actually true—for a time. You can imagine my head exploding when I learned about extreme/mental hunger. Lol

-I never craved fiber during my active ED and it actually caused a lot of digestive issues. I ate a shit ton of fiber because I was volume eating but it wasn’t what I was actually craving.

I did *irrationally* upset when my boyfriend would find my food stash and eat some of it too. It’s like that SpongeBob meme where SpongeBob at Patrick’s candy bar and Patrick was like “**AND NOW IM GOING TO STAVE**”. This actually finally faded after 2 years into recovery—I don’t really care if he eats food I bought and it’s actually kinda helpful because I tend to forget all of what I bought at the grocery store.",,,,,4

But eating is a chore for me, it’s difficult to consistently eat and I can often forget to do it if I hyperfixate on an activity because I’m not food obsessed anymore. Because I don’t crave literally anything it’s hard to decide what to eat because I hate cooking and habe other things I’d rather be doing. That’s the best way I know how to describe it.

What you described isn’t recovery. Fat is *always* restored first, and it’s for a reason. Controlling the process isn’t recovery and feeling empowered to remain thin is inherently disordered.

comment,2022-05-25 22:11:04,2022-05-25 22:11:04,fuckeatingdisorders,i9zqb4q,"> The overwhelming majority as in almost all of us are not fatphobic towards other people.

This is actually untrue. Internalized fatphobia is still fatphobia. You can’t say you are okay with people in larger bodies existing and then say you yourself would find an issue in being fat. Society fetishes thinness to a harmful extent—there’s a reason the dieting and weight loss industry bank $7 billion a year. Systemic fatphobia is a **huge** issue from the fashion industry to the medical industry to employment opportunities. The vast majority of people *are* fatphobic—including myself. The issue when you are unwilling to address that fatphobia and spread harmful, and often false, rhetoric about fat bodies.

I said it in another comment, but the leading environmental factor in the development of eating disorders is the sociocultural idealization of thinness. Yes, EDs also exist outside of fatphobia, but many, especially those in larger bodies, people’s EDs stem from fatphobia. Mine was partially linked to fatphobia. Control was an aspect, but it was also the endless pursuit of thinness for me. As it is for many others.",,,,,4

It may be misinterpreting them but that doesn’t necessarily make the narrative they spread true either, when biases play a huge role in weight loss studies and studies relating to fat bodies. To ignore the role that big drug companies play in biased studies is absolutely relevant, especially the majority of these studies don’t extend to long term documentation.

I mentioned this to begin with because many people don’t factor in the systemic disadvantages of living in a larger body, from fewer employment opportunities to inadequate medical treatment that lead to hoverall poorer health outcomes that skew these statistics. Not because they are *fat*, but because they literally aren’t getting the same medical treatment or living wages as others in a smaller body. Again, correlation is not causation.",,,,,-1

I had a mental breakdown where I realized I no longer wanted to be with my partner, but that scared me because I spent years being abused and I had become hardwired to believe that I couldn’t do better. The things he did were normalized, so I didn’t see anything wrong with them. I blamed it entirely on my OCD diagnosis that eventually caused me a lot of long term hurt and a breakup that had me fearing for my life… needless to say, I now wish I would have trusted my gut and left right then and there.

I’m not necessarily saying that this is anything like your situation. But I *am* saying that if you are unsure about this relationship and how your partner is treating this situation, it’s very unlikely to be your ED. It’s one thing to have a preference, it’s another to push it onto your partner. You need to sit him down and enforce clear boundaries because your recovery is in jeopardy here and there is absolutely no reason for you to put up with comments that make you feel uncomfortable and bad about yourself.",,,,,4

It’s the same as Noom claiming to be an approach to “iNtUiTiVe EaTiNg”—it’s just another diet in disguise because it promises weight loss, or at the very least no weight *gain*. Which is still extremely harmful because:

1. You have to gain weight in recovery if you have a restrictive ED (bulimia is often included in this); suggesting that you can remain at a weight you (read: your ED) is comfortable with justifies engaging in behaviors and reinforces the concepts your brain has about weight, health, and morals you hold regarding food.

2. It further damages your relationship with food by implying that sugar = bad, candy bars inherently lead to guilt, or binges, or weight gain. Giving moral value to food doesn’t heal your relationship to food—just makes it significantly worse.",,,,,4

Hyperfixation on food is pretty much a universal symptom of a [restrictive] ED—it’s no coincidence that the majority of recovery content has a huge focus on food, the type of food, and content surrounding their body.

2. You need to define obsession (in this case we will use obsess, as obsession is the noun to obsess, and thus a state of being): **ob·sess •/əbˈses/ verb • preoccupy or fill the mind of (someone) continually, intrusively, and to a troubling extent. •(of a person) be preoccupied with or constantly worrying about something.** By your logic, anyone who has had an ED and works with people with EDs aren’t recovered… and that’s not true. Are we to pretend that EDs just don’t exist? I’m not hyperfixated on food, my body, or my own recovery [anymore]. I’m not even hyperfixated on others’ recoveries. Which, in this instance, is what I used to point out recovery accounts that remain in a “process” of indefinite recovery to excuse the continuation of engaging with behaviors such as undereating and body checking, and/or compulsive exercise. 

There is a huge difference between wanting to help people when there is so much misinformation about recovery out there and  very little access to treatment for the majority of ED sufferers, and being “obsessed” with my, or others’, recovery. Do I think y’all deserve recovery? Absolutely. Am I plagued with intrusive thoughts about y’all’s recovery to the point it is affecting my personal life? No. I don’t even think about my own recovery too much because I have other things that need my attention—and as a mod, this sub happens to be one of them. Not everyone recovers, and that’s fine. But knowing all of your *options*, or having a safe space to recover when you *do* want to recover is definitely a concern of mine in this sub. If you wanna call that obsession, go right ahead, but we have very different definitions of what that words means. 🤷🏼‍♀️",,,,,4

comment,2022-06-29 02:20:14,2022-06-29 02:20:14,fuckeatingdisorders,ie4x5az,"I apologize if my comment was interpreted as the entirety of the world because that was not the intention of my comment. However, for the sake of this conversation I’m going to point out that 1) fatphobia isn’t just a “western” problem, and 2) the “global west” is vague and problematic at best. The tendency of dividing countries into two groups often leads to the illusion that countries residing in the two groups are of two different kinds; that members within one group have a lot in common, whereas those characteristics are not found in the other group. If that were true, then why, for example, is fatphobia just as big of an issue in Asia (the East) as much as it is in the Americas and Europe? While it may be true that fatphobia may not have permeated your family’s belief system (and that’s great!), it’s anecdotal. Jamaica has an anti-obesity campaign and nine in ten Jamaicans want the government to take action against obesity. There *are* fatptobic ideologies in most countries, even if it’s not as dominant as it is in the Americas and Europe. Which I never claimed to begin with.

Secondly, yes the beauty standards that you mentioned is absolutely whitewashed. Fatphobia was *literally* created by white people (specifically white men), and it has caused, and continues to cause, real harm to people of color, and especially to the black community *in* the US in particular. It’s entire origin is to suppress. And considering the global affects white colonialism has had on the world, is it any wonder it’s presence reaches pretty much world-wide, even if not as pervasive as it is in the white-dominated countries?

Lastly, I never once said *all* EDs are caused by fatphobia. I said the leading *environmental* factor is the sociocultural idealization of thinness. And it is. If you translated that as absolutely no other factor in the development of EDs is a valid one, then again I apologize because that’s not what I meant nor what I said. The fact is that fatphobia does play a role in the development of many EDs, and not *just* in the western world.",,,,,4

No, it’s not a result of not eating “bAlAnCeD mEaLs.” The biological purpose of extreme hunger (scientifically referred to as *post-starvation hyperphagia*) is to restore the body’s optimal fat to fat free (muscle) mass ratio. You will continue to experience EH until your body has restored 100% fat free mass, which requires your body to achieve more than 100% fat mass (**fun fact:** *this is also why we overshoot*). It has absolutely nothing to do will power, hormones, or “swinging from one extreme to another”, and everything to do with how your body functions and how it responds to a [percieved] famine both during and after.
 
I’m going to get real with y’all: the reason the shit I mentioned above is circulating around in this sub, and most especially in other ED subs, is because y’all are afraid of gaining “too much” weight and you need to address that internalized fatphobia. **Spoiler**: there is no gaining too much in recovery; your body is smart as fuck and knows how to heal and regulate itself. Whether you’re all-in or taking a slower approach, you can’t recover without eating a lot of food, period. You can’t starve your body for months/years and then expect it to bounce back like nothing ever happened, like you won’t gain weight, or only gain what you’re comfortable with while eating what you *think* is enough. You have an eating disorder—the entire problem is that *you do not know how to feed yourself*. And you certainly don’t know how to cope with triggering situations—if you did, you wouldn’t immediately jump to restriction and fight tooth and nail to find any excuse to view eating according to hunger as immoral or wrong. So stop trying to find answers to excuse away your *real* hunger. The fact that you’re trying to dismiss your hunger in itself is a disordered behavior.

Just food for thought (pun entirely intended). Thanks for coming to another episode of Sareeee48 Talks.

**Edit:** this is not an attack on anyone, especially those who are struggling to honor their hunger. That shit is hard. Recovery is hard. But the level of misinformation that I’ve seen being encouraged as of late is really not okay. Remember that the advice you give may have real impacts on the people who read it. If you’re determined to share your experiences or opinions, that is absolutely okay! But at least make sure it’s accurate and follows the sub’s rules.",,,,Staaaaaaahp spreading misinformation about extreme hunger.,4
comment,2022-07-26 03:28:40,2022-07-26 03:28:40,fuckeatingdisorders,iho4tg3,"I’m going to disagree. Keep in mind that BMI is not backed by any sort of scientific evidence; it was created by a white, European man in the 1800s to measure the average body mass of other white, European men of the 1800s—it is not only exclusionary by design, it’s also extremely flawed and an extremely poor and inaccurate indicator of health. If you feel healthy both physically and psychologically, then why does it matter if you’re “obese”? Especially when we consider that many of these individuals who reside in a larger body are more proficient at fight off diseases that fatness supposedly causes to begin with (aka, the “obesity paradox”).

At the end of the day, correlation is not causation. Larger bodies aren’t inherently more unhealthy from a biological perspective, and science has failed repeatedly to prove that they are (that is, if you exclude studies with clear weight biases). Bodies come in all shapes and sizes; If you end up at a higher weight post recovery, then it’s the weight your body functions best at. It is not a moral failing, despite what our deeply fatphobic society tells us.",,,,,-1

It aids in the function of pretty much all important aspects of the body, from hormonal development (which is directly tied to the body’s ability to build muscle and bone mass optimally in the first place), blood pressure regulation, metabolism regulation, bone health, organ health, and so much more. As I already said as well, it’s not *just* muscle mass; it’s also bone mass. Interfering with the process is only going to prolong it. Especially considering that overshoot is necessary for long term recovery.

I got with a friend who I had had a crush on for nearly 10 years of friendship. While I was stoked to be with someone who got me like nobody else, my behaviors intensified over that first year of our relationship. I was terrified of ever allowing my body to change because what if he found me disgusting and lost all attraction for me? What if he found someone who looked better than me? What if, what if, what if.

Ironically, when I broke down and opened up about my ED, he was super supportive and I don’t think I would have been able to recover at the time if he wasn’t so open minded and encouraged me throughout my extreme hunger and weight gain. I am the heaviest I have ever been in my life and my relationship with this individual has improved tenfold—which is the exact opposite of what I had seen, heard, and read about. Obviously not all relationships will turn out like mine, but honestly that’s the sad part. Everyone deserves that kind of support and to feel loved at any weight. Because if your love can’t change and adapt with each others’ bodies, then do you *really* fucking love that person? Is it really fucking love if you are willing to throw away an entire relationship because your partner gained fucking weight? Yikes.

**Edit:** I noticed a lot of these posts you mentioned are about women who had these men’s fucking *children* and they have the audacity to to be upset they don’t look the same postpartum? I’d like to see them grow a 5-10 lb fetus inside of their body, stretching their skin, and tearing through their reproductive organs and come out with the same body. Pregnancy causes [**necessary**] weight gain and body changes.",,,,,4

Cravings differ per person. From my research it’s common to crave carbohydrates/sugar because it’s the body’s main source of fuel, but also because it’s something people often restrict. I didn’t crave a lot of fat in recovery because I hate a lot of it during my ED—if it was something you restricted, it could be related to your body just needing a lot of fat.",,,,,4

She never gave up exercise save for a like a few weeks (if I remember correctly, please correct me if I’m wrong), was still relatively thin when stopped gaining weight, and lost the “overshoot” weight in a matter of a few short months when she was less than a year in. She also posts a lot of photos I personally consider body checking photos captioned as “confident and healthy”, etc. that can be pretty triggering to those who don’t end up in a body like her’s. The entire premise of her “recovery” from restriction is really fucking sketchy to me and I personally don’t think she has truly recovered as much as she likes to boast about.

I mean you can definitely use her as motivation if you want, that’s totally okay. But keep in mind that your recovery is probably not going to look like her’s. Just make sure you’re going all-in for the right reasons rather than because you think your recovery will be identical or similar to what she posts on social media.

Same, came here to say this too actually. I mean, find motivation in whoever you want! But I don’t think she’s the icon of all-in like so many people think, especially because virtually nobody going all in and truly recovering ends up looking like her, least of all in less than a year.",,,,,4

I did the same thing, don’t get me wrong, but it was out of a “nobody else is like me, so I need to *see* that they’re going through the exact same things in order to validate my own needs/hunger.” Thing is, nobody’s recovery is going to be the same and looking for others’ specific experiences is not going to help you long term, especially when the weight begins to accumulate. Because then you’re more likely to go back to their content and think, “I must be doing something wrong.” You’re handing over control over to someone else rather than your body—and I think at their most basic core, EDs are about trying to manipulate that control over our bodies because we think it’s the only form of control we have. 

At the end of the day, you have you trust your body over everyone else. It’s hard as fuck, moreso with a method like all-in. But it is key to recovering fully.

They’re literally trained to discourage eating and [tOo MuCh] weight gain. But this isn’t just an ED recovery issue—it’s a nutritional and dietetics issue at its core. Many nutritional studies are riddled with design errors, their participant pool is often never randomized, and the collected data from these studies are almost always kept private… basically, most nutritional and weight studies are extremely biased, which is why you will see thousands of contradicting studies about this super food, or why you should avoid that food, this is the best diet to lose weight, but if you do xyz you’ll gain weight, etc. A good example of harmful and fatphobic dietetics practices was released earlier this year, suggesting pretty severe restriction for those who are considered “overweight” by BMI standards.

Extreme hunger—scientifically known as *post-starvation hyperphagia*—has been documented numerous times, however it contradicts everything we are told regarding CICO and weight gain/loss. When you are told that the desire to eat a lot of food is problematic and emotionally driven, it’s going to lead the majority of people to assume that they have a binging problem after restriction—especially if you are in a larger body. We are societally wired to fear eating a lot, without actually understanding that our bodies need quite a lot of food to function optimally every single day.

Tbh treatment surrounding EDs is really fucking shitty specifically due to not just a general lack of understanding, but an utter *refusal* to understand the human body as a whole. Relapse rates are so high *because* we aren’t educating patients on what they’re bodies are experiencing and why it’s so important to honor hunger (once medically stable enough to do so, of course). It’s why so many people opt to recover on their own or simply not recover at all.",,,,,4

From what I’ve been able to learn it’s helped me accept that bodies aren’t calculators, calories aren’t hard numbers, and even if they were our bodies don’t digest and metabolize them as simply as we are told they do. The body is complex as **fuck** and to expect it to act like a machine that hasn’t spent several million years surviving and evolving is a complete disregard of the potential of the human body.

It is, unfortunately, something you just have to do in order to accept though. Good luck on your recovery journey!",,,,,4
comment,2022-10-24 00:44:53,2022-10-24 00:44:53,fuckeatingdisorders,itj4hbs,"It means that your body is in complete control over where your set point is. Weight is primarily genetic; hense why 95% of all diets fail and similar percentages of individuals gain back all of the weight back, if not more, within 2-5 years. And it’s not due to lack of willpower. It might make you uncomfortable, but that discomfort doesn’t change the fact that some people are born in larger bodies and that doesn’t inherently mean they are unhealthy. Especially considering that BMI was never designed to measure health (which is multi-faceted as it is).

If someone with BED gains weight from binging, then they should absolutely not focus on weight loss as a cure for their binging. They should find the reasons behind *why* they binge and work on managing that, which will in turn manage the binging. If weight loss naturally comes from that, that is fine, but it certainly shouldn’t be something someone fixates on. Consider the fact that many people with a “binging” problem initially come from restriction as it is, and restriction merely reinforces the urge to binge. Just like any other ED, they still have learn to feed themselves *enough* and listen to their hunger. Weight loss has nothing to do with recovering, it’s simply a possible byproduct.

As for feeling discomfort in a larger body, that is directly influenced by society, that pushes thinness at all costs and tells us from a very young age that fat is morally inferior. You might say that you wouldn’t intentionally be mean to fat people, but implying that nobody should want to weigh xxx lbs and weight loss is compatible with recovery is directly causing harm to fat people, especially those struggling with eating disorders. That’s the thing about fatphobia—it’s engrained, and it’s often so normalized that people don’t see a problem with it.

Lastly, the reason weight loss is not compatible with recovery is due to the fact that you cannot engage in behaviors that are keeping you sick (specifically a hyperfixation on your appearance that lead to restriction, purging, compulsive movement, etc.) and expect to remain in a healthy place emotionally and physically. Remember that many people develop their ED from dieting, and many others use it as a form of control. Learning to accept yourself wherever your body may land in terms of weight is essential in recovery because you need to learn to trust your body and let go of the pressure to live up to societal beauty standards that often harm us in the long term.",,,,,4

Also, various studies actually indicate that being at a higher BMI leads to longer lifespans and makes it easier to combat diseases supposedly caused by being in a larger body. I understand where you are coming from in terms of a diet culture mindset, but I’ve already explained everything to you in my initial reply. Just because you don’t think what you are saying is fatphobic doesn’t negate the fact that it is and it harms the well-being of fat people on a systemic level.",,,,,4

It’s not that I think having a bad lace to vent, especially when you aren’t in recovery, but it’s not heavily moderated like it needs to be, which is an issue when you have disordered individuals with very distorted perspectives on reality talking to other disordered individuals with very distorted perspectives on reality. If you’re running a space dedicated to a mental disorder/illness you’re bound to have discussions regarding disordered behaviors… the issue is when you begin to spread harmful information that *promotes* disordered behavior.

As an artist who used my ED as “inspiration” to some extent, there is absolutely no excuse for posting shit like this.

This is why so many ED spaces are not safe spaces and encourage relapsing Or continuing behaviors, even if they claim that’s not the case. It’s unfortunate and while I don’t think they are intentionally doing this, it’s still a *very* common occurance. The fact is, if you don’t understand the harms of weight stigma associated with eating disorders in particular, you’re likely going to cause more harm.

It is **not** healthy for anyone struggling with an eating disorder to use exercise as it can quickly deteriorate into a compensatory behavior, which is what you are describing. Also, exercise should be viewed from a positive perspective; cardio is not for everyone, therefore not everyone is going to enjoy it. Exercise should be enjoyed first and foremost, not performed out of a fear of ending up “unhealthy”. That’s just fearmongering. 

On top of that, the body is physically incapable of gaining any benefits from exercise in a malnourished state. Metabolism is slowed to a crawl and hormones—which are essential for muscle growth—become far less of a priority and result in significant health problems down the line. And that’s not even touching on the loss of bone density—you actually put yourself at risk of severe injury by exercising in a malnourished state. If someone with an ED wants to exercise, they need to wait until they are weight restored *at least*. There is absolutely no reason otherwise. Period.",,,,,2

If they are fitness or even recovery influencers eating those small portions, I would bet physical money that they are restricting and not actually eating according to their hunger—which is evident in the fact that they feel the need to post on social media, likely as a form of seeking validation. Also keep in mind that they may only be showing what they are eating *in that specific moment*. Which, yes, paints a poor picture of recovery, however it’s possible they are eating *a lot* more than they are willing to actually publicly document.

When I was in early recovery, my breakfasts consisted of 1200+ calories. Nearly three years in, I’m still eating 800-1000 calories for breakfast alone… it’s the easiest meal for me to get food in, and it’s arguably the most important meal of the day as it decides your energy levels, mood, etc. for the day. There is *nothing* wrong with eating a lot at breakfast, let alone in general. You are recovering from an eating disorder—that comes with a lot of fucking food.

The entire point of recovery is to find food freedom and accept your body—not continue to limit yourself out of fear of weight gain or becoming fat.

But when we live in a society that promotes disordered behaviors like exercising and restircting your intake as a means of changing your body, I can’t blame them entirely. They just genuinely don’t know any better, they really do think that’s what recovery looks like.",,,,,2
comment,2023-02-10 19:27:05,2023-02-10 19:27:05,fuckeatingdisorders,j80nfbd,"Fullness is typically a combination of physical fullness *and* satiety, and you often won’t feel satiety without also feeling physical fullness (not *always* but most of the time, as satiety is a system to tell us our bodies have had enlugh). So like… during my EH phase, I could eat and eat and eat and still feel that I was physically hungry despite also being physically full. When my EH finally ended I experienced fullness that did not extend to physical discomfort and my brain kinda went “that’s enough, I don’t want any more.”

What defines fullness is a bit situational though. The body cares more about caloric intake over the actual volume of food, which is why low calorie foods can make us “feel” full while actively remaining hungry. They can also result in uncomfortable fullness not because things like vegetables are actually filling but because they retain water and are usually high in fiber, which causes bloating in large quantities. This bloating is often what is mistaken for fullness. On the other hand, you can eat caloric dense foods that are less volume and achieve satiety a lot easier. For example, my work had a potluck yesterday and I ended up only being able to eat a small plate because the food was so caloric dense and I got full a lot quicker—in this case, I was both physically full and satiated. When you starve your body, especially over months/years, the body isn’t going to need fullness cues because, well, it’s depleted of energy. And it can take several months to over a year to pull oneself out of energy debt.,

I went severalllll years not remembering what fullness felt like, and spent the first year of recovery questioning whether or not I’d ever experience it again. But the more you feed your body, the more it will balance itself out, including restoring consistent hunger and fullness cues.",,,,,4

post,2024-05-20 02:45:33,2024-05-20 02:45:33,fuckeatingdisorders,1cw5b35,"Someone said earlier that banana bread isn’t a meal. I’m sorry, but who the fuck died and made you the arbiter of what is and isn’t a meal? If you want banana bread for dinner, then eat the fucking banana bread. Just make sure you’re actually satisfying your hunger if you do so.

A meal is whatever the fuck you want it to be. Sometimes, a thing of hostess donuts and a latte is a breakfast for me. And nine times out of ten, lunch and/or dinner is a snack platter because I have ADHD and cannot commit to “balanced meals.” I certainly did not follow the logic behind such a term in my own recovery—am I less recovered, less healthy, because I ate what and when I wanted rather than sticking to a specific number of carbs, protein, and fats for each meal? Why does it matter if I was satisfied at the end of the day?

Not to mention not everyone has the luxury of meeting whatever the fuck defines a balanced meal, anyway. Health is *also* a privilege for many. Let’s not ignore these things.

This isn’t to say that if you want a protein, carb, and fat source with every meal you’re doing something wrong—one or the main takeaways of recovery is to eat how you want and learn to listen to your body to the best of your ability. There is no wrong answer as long as you are challenging yourself and learning to listen to your body’s needs and, yes, even its wants (once more, to the best of your ability).

We need to keep in mind that in early recovery especially, the body tends to lean more towards sugary/carb-heavy foods because they are quickly digested into energy the body *desperately* needs for repairs. And that is *okay*. Again, that doesn’t mean eating other foods is discouraged (no food source should be outright discouraged, assuming it is safe for you to consume—i.e., allergies, intolerances, certain health conditions, etc.), but for fuck’s sake if someone is eating a lot of sugar or carb heavy foods, the last thing they need to hear is “Xyz isn’t a meal. Eat more balanced.”

The entire point is to unlearn harmful beliefs and ideals regarding food. For many of us, in early recovery at the *very* least, “balance” is a synonym for restriction and control rather than a form of gentle nutrition.

A difference in opinion doesn’t mean you get to go on someone’s post and tell them that banana bread isn’t a complete meal and they should try for more balanced meals. Additionally, you don’t really get to decide what someone else’s body needs—you don’t know what it needs and you shouldn’t pretend to know more than their own body. You only know what *your* body needs. Personally, my body *didn’t* need a lot of protein, it needed a lot of carbs and sugars, as well as fat in any form. Not to mention that I still met my protein needs eating what I wanted, when I wanted in spite of not having what would be considered a complete meal. All food has macronutrients. If I’m trying to force my body to have what it doesn’t want, then how was I supposed to learn to trust it? 

*Again*, if you want to eat “balanced meals,” which is extremely nuanced and vague at best, then you are free to do so, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. But why come on here and make people feel bad for doing something different than you? It’s wholly unnecessary. Just don’t say anything if you disagree or have a different approach to recovery, at least in the context of how you think they should be doing things.

We will of course keep everyone updated if/when we do decide to add more mods!",,,,,3
comment,2024-06-26 02:00:42,2024-06-26 02:00:42,fuckeatingdisorders,laaw6tg,"1. Clarifying something wasn’t right is still inappropriate on a sub that focuses on recovery. I said what I said. Note that pro-ED content, as per the rule, falls under descriptions of behaviors as well, which is likely why the post was removed. Posts are subject to moderators’ discretion, and while you don’t have to like it you do have to adhere to *that* rule as well as we all have different viewpoints on what breaks a rule here.

2. We, the only three active mods on this sub, have lives outside of Reddit and do not owe you a response in a given timeframe. We are busy, and yet we do this for free, with zero expectations of acknowledgement outside of basically human decency. If we didn’t respond when you wanted us to then idk what to tell you other than to be patience and/or shoot us another message in modmail. We have 35k members and growing—sometimes it takes us several hours, or even days, to see something.

3. You clearly just want to be mad and while you have a right to your feelings, you don’t actually want a discussion so we will not be engaging in this. If you would like to have a civil conversation in modmail, we will be happy to discuss whatever it is that is bothering you. Have a wonderful day.",,,,,-1
post,2024-07-10 18:11:03,2024-07-10 18:11:03,fuckeatingdisorders,1e02nng,"There have been a lot of posts centering around guilt, shame, fear, and disgust in regards to eating more. Many of you are questioning whether or not you deserve to eat, whether you’re sick enough to eat more, etc.

Let me be very clear: **Food is not a reward. Food is not something you EVER have to earn. It is a basic necessity to your survival—you are ENTITLED to it, just as you are entitled to the air you breathe.** You are allowed to eat however much you fucking want. Don’t ever be afraid to demand food. Especially if you are hungry.

The only exception would be if you have any known allergies/intolerances to specific cravings that would harm you, or if you are at risk of refeeding syndrome.

I hope that helps at least one person today. Stay tuned for my next TED Talk",,,,Some of yall need to hear this,4
post,2024-08-03 15:16:41,2024-08-03 15:16:41,fuckeatingdisorders,1ej5r31,"There is absolutely no reason to list every single thing you ate in a day. Especially when many of the posters/commenters that are guilty of this are still restricting and are more concerned with seeking validation (usually a “you didn’t eat too much!” So they can justify continuing this behavior) than whether or not the contents will trigger other members.

**But why does it break rule 4?**

Because it breeds competition among members, a common behavior among ED sufferers. If one user ate xxxx calories by honoring their extreme hunger or from a reactive eating episode, and saw that another user had, say, two cookies, a few handfuls of granola, a half cup of fat free yogurt and a whole pint of “hEaLtHy” icecream and is freaking out despite the fact they likely still didn’t meet their minimums, it could cause the first user to compare themselves to the other’s intake. Thus it could begin the cycle of feeling guilty or like a failure for eating so much when others are clearly sicker than them (note: they aren’t, that’s just the thought process), and may lead to a relapse or further restriction to prove they’re sick enough.

Is that always the case? No, of course not. But this is **a safe space** and everyone deserves to feel safe here. It is *not* a space to seek validation on your restrictive mindset from members who also need support.

**Note**: I don’t care that you post about a specific food or that you’ve eaten nothing but oatmeal during extreme hunger—I care if you list quantities and possibly calories depending on the context. If you have any questions about this rule, please don’t hesitate to ask and I’ll try my best to clarify! And if you see posts like the ones mentioned here, for the love of god, *please* report them. I’m not always monitoring this sub but I do get notifications for reported posts immediately, and there are two other wonderful active mods who will see to them if I don’t.",,,,Yall gotta stop posting every damn thing you eat in a day—it breaks rule 4.,4
post,2024-08-23 16:21:39,2024-08-23 16:21:39,fuckeatingdisorders,1ezgyec,"I have had to remove way too many fucking posts like this lately, Jesus Christ. 

This is **not** a pro-ED sub where you can romanticize your sick body at the cost of others’ wellbeing. I don’t care that you like your sick body more, I don’t care that you fear weight gain to the point that you’d rather continue maintaining a severely low weight that could very well result in death—I care that you are putting others’ mental health at risk because you can’t speak about these things in a neutral matter that doesn’t trigger others. You can talk about how you can’t let your sick body go without talking *in detail* about how those in larger bodies disgust you. At this point, some of yall are just choosing to be assholes.

Thanks for coming to my 1,029,383,818th TED Talk, have a wonderful day. 🥰

**EDIT:** if you see these types of posts, please, please, *please* report them. The mods have lives outside of these subs and we don’t always see things ourselves, but I get reports immediately and I will look over reports as soon as I notice them/have the time if another mod hasn’t already. We ask that you guys do your part in helping to keep this community safe. Thank you!",,,,Posts glorifying thinness will be promptly removed and you WILL be banned.,4

The mods have noticed a weird uptick of pro-ED content here and many aren’t reporting so a lot of it goes under the radar for a few days if we’re busy irl. We’re trying to manage the best we can, but it’s difficult when users aren’t reporting harmful content as consistently as they used to.",,,,,-1
comment,2024-08-23 21:52:26,2024-08-23 21:52:26,fuckeatingdisorders,ljm52sg,"Literally shitting on fat people just makes you an asshole. Don’t use your mental illness as an excuse for being shitty to other people. 🥰

Sincerely, someone who has had anorexia for most of my life. Being terrified of letting go of your sick body is normal and it’s okay to talk about that. But being a dick to other people *because of that fear* is absolutely not part of the disorder.

**Edit:** next time just say you’re fatphobic and you don’t care about how your actions contribute to the wellbeing of others, least of all fat people’s. You don’t get to come onto my sub and trigger others simply because you have an eating disorder and refuse to acknowledge your own shitty behavior, enjoy your ban.",,,,,4
comment,2024-08-23 22:07:26,2024-08-23 22:07:26,fuckeatingdisorders,ljm7kq3,"Again, having a fear of weight gain/letting your sick body go is valid and you can discuss that here.

TW >!Saying that people in larger bodies disgust you, that thin bodies are the “correct” bodies to have, that the pursuit of thinness is the pursuit of a higher consciousness, that you would rather self harm/commit suicide before you end up in a larger body, etc.!<—all things I have heard within the past week alone—are so wildly fucking inappropriate that I don’t even have words to describe why i would ever allow such posts here.

Like I know this wouldn’t be an issue if it were any other mental illness where one is required to take responsibility for their actions. Having compassion and understanding for why we do things is *not* the same thing as enabling shitty behavior, and we really need to stop using our disorders as an excuse.",,,,,4

comment,2024-08-24 02:08:55,2024-08-24 02:08:55,fuckeatingdisorders,ljn8m04,"Yeah, absolutely. The issue lies more in going into detail about how thinness is somehow superior and doubling down on it rather than acknowledging that such beliefs are problematic.",,,,,4

comment,2025-03-10 23:57:57,2025-03-10 23:57:57,fuckeatingdisorders,mh47f97,"I don’t think this is entirely fair. Eating disorder behaviors are so normalized that they often go unnoticed under the guise of “health.” One of the biggest risk factors for developing an eating disorder is a history of dieting—some studies suggest that people who have dieted are up to 18 times more likely to develop one.

The reality is, we can’t always tell if someone is struggling with an eating disorder. If we treated all bodies equally—both systemically and individually—there would likely be far less dieting overall, including in the cases of eating disorders. Access to diagnosis and treatment is a privilege, especially when it comes to receiving the right diagnosis, and even more so for those in larger bodies. Framing dieting as separate from disordered eating is, at best, problematic. Restriction in any form is harmful when it involves withholding food for reasons unrelated to medical conditions that directly impact health.",,,,,4
post,2025-03-24 19:44:59,2025-03-24 19:44:59,fuckeatingdisorders,1jizvqo,"I’m just gonna get straight to the point—we have seen way too many posts lately bashing the mods, and frankly, it’s gotten ridiculous. So let me lay things out clearly—because apparently, some people still don’t get it.

##1. The rules are non-negotiable.

It doesn’t matter whether you agree with them or not. The rules are there to keep this community safe and functional. Mods enforce them. Members follow them. If you break the rules, you’ll get a temporary or permanent ban, depending on how severe or repetitive the issue is.

If you’re confused about a rule or why your content was removed, that’s fine—**ask us**. We’re more than willing to clarify or even reinstate posts/comments when there’s a genuine misunderstanding. Plenty of users can confirm that reaching out via modmail often leads to a resolution, especially if you’re willing to edit your post to follow the rules. But if you choose to complain publicly instead of reaching out, that’s on you.


##2. Moderator discretion applies to everything.

Yes, **everything**. Every post. Every comment. No exceptions. If a mod decides your content isn’t appropriate, it’s not staying up. Period. You don’t have to like it, but that’s the way it is.

If a post isn’t approved or re-approved after review, it’s because we decided it wasn’t safe or appropriate for the sub. This isn’t a democracy—it’s a community we work hard to manage for free, for your benefit. If that’s a problem for you? There are countless other subs. No one’s forcing you to stay here.

We’re not here to cater to people who just want to stir up drama, promote harmful behavior, or dodge the rules under the guise of “just expressing themselves.” If you actually care about the community and feel a removal was unfair, you’d contact modmail like a reasonable person. But the ones who skip that and go straight to public whining or harassing us? Yeah, you know who you are.

##3. Public mod-bashing = permanent ban.

Let me be clear: if you make a post or comment complaining about the mods instead of taking it to modmail, you’re getting permanently banned. No warnings. I’m done. We’re done.

The mod team puts in an absurd amount of unpaid time and energy to keep this space safe, and the reward lately has been nonstop harassment, insults, and even threats. It’s disgusting. You don’t have to like us, but you will respect the work we do to keep this place from turning into a dumpster fire.

If that’s too much to ask, then seriously—go find a different sub.

This community exists because people work hard to keep it functioning. If you can’t handle that, maybe the problem isn’t the mods.
