Raise this with your HR. You have a medical condition that impacts the food you can eat; provide HR with a small list of safe foods and advise them that you'll be happy to work around this where possible if your restrictions are too severe. 

For your coworkers - I promise you, all you need to do is say it's because of a medical condition. If they pry, say you'd rather not go into it. If they get arsey about it, go to HR - this is also why we tell HR about these things.

With my ARFID, I can get away with having chips, pizza, and chicken in most forms. This allows me a lot of leeway over nights out. That being said, I have ended up at restaurants where I haven't been able to eat what's offered, and conferences where my needs weren't communicated. Often the wait staff will be able to accommodate you with small requests so that you can still participate in the night (e.g. bread rolls, drinks, the like), and in a corporate environment, you can get away with ""oh, it's this medical thing, it's no problem - I wish I could enjoy it like you do!"" and then direct the conversation away from your food. 

You can do this. The people in your office will get used to you. They have to get used to Kathy having the most god awful eggy fishy salad every day and John eating with his mouth open; they can easily tolerate you having the same possibly odd lunch every day.",,,,Hanhula,,-1,-2.9755895,-2.7612453

Things like coffee, beer, tea - there are literally thousands of different ways of making these sorts of drinks across countless different countries. You genuinely might find one you like one day - IF and only IF YOU WANT TO TRY UNTIL YOU FIND THAT ONE, which you & OP don't. It took me a looooong time before I could do so. I now have very specific coffee drinks I like because they aren't bitter at all. You might think all coffee is bitter at the moment because you've never had the super sweet nonbitter ones, and that's totally ok! You don't need to find a coffee you like!

The egregious thing is when folk won't accept that you don't want to try it. That's fucking annoying! ARFID is so hard to try new stuff with, I'm not going to fight it just because some twat in a caf√© wants me to do so. Let us stick to the hot chocolate, jeez.

(I actually learnt to like some coffee because after much discussion, a twink in a specialist coffee place carefully went through a tonne of coffee shots until he found one I didn't immediately hate and then we sweetened it until it worked. Very voluntary process. Wouldn't recommend it unless you're having a really good day.)",,,,Hanhula,,-1,-0.6716309,-2.772334

It's not universally bitter, nor the same in.. pretty much any way other than it being a drink. I can't eat vegetables, but chips, crisps, and hash browns are OK despite potato being a vegetable. I hate most coffee, but iced mochas are a great occasional treat for me. Same diff.

I want to emphasise this because it's such a big thing with ARFID especially - nixing entire categories of food or drink because we just cannot do them. You don't do coffee, that's fine! But don't forget that it varies an absolutely massive amount for if you're ever feeling like working on expanding the safe drinks list - or safe foods, for that matter. Chocolate cake frequently has coffee in it, and I know for me when I see an unsafe food in something, it can be a showstopper... so hopefully knowing that coffee manifests in a shit tonne of ways turns that into ""okay, why is there coffee in the cake what does it taste like"" instead of ""the cake is now illegal"".",,,,Hanhula,,-1,-0.7345675,-2.830219

Additionally, google the number and put it into social media sites like Facebook or Discord, that can often tell you who the owner is.

If you can identify the owner and they're at work or school with you, report them for harassment and discrimination. If they're not and they're a family member or something, tell your parents and their parents that this twat has started to harass you.

If you can't identify the number, block it and move on. You might be tempted to send them something back - I wouldn't, even if you find out who they are. Just pretend you never saw it.

You need to go to HR with a formal letter of complaint as you're being discriminated against and receiving hostile behaviour for having a medical condition. You also need to look up employment law in your area and see how well the law covers you. Here in Australia, they would be in deep shit for this.

From there, you keep raising complaints to HR. If HR does nothing or makes light of your complaints, go above their heads to their bosses. If you keep getting shit, refer back to those laws and see if you can chat to an employment lawyer or union organiser etc. Your doctor might also have some advice on people to talk to.

You should also check the laws around recording in your area. If it's one party consent, start recording as evidence. If it's two party, stop, pull out your phone, state ""This conversation is being recorded. Would you care to repeat your comment about my medical condition?"" Keep doing similar, too. Either grey rock them, or very bluntly ask them to repeat themselves or say something like ""I didn't realise my medical condition was open for discussion.""

If you want backup here, post on ask a manager. If they try it in front of the client, politely ask that your medical condition please not be discussed. If they continue, apologise to the client for the discourtesy and LEAVE.

It‚Äôs not a well-known disorder and has only recently been updated to include adults in the diagnosis. We have no right to gatekeep this illness. We are here to support each other but also people who are afraid of what‚Äôs happening with their child. It‚Äôs not fair to exclude anyone just because you feel as though parents coming here for questions and support are somehow making you feel infantilized. We as adults with ARFID know that it‚Äôs more common in children than adults, so we are technically the minority here. And as adults we are (or should be) mature enough to comprehend that these people need support. That said, you are more than welcome to create a new subreddit solely for adults with ARFID to weed out anyone who is under a certain age. 

Personally, hearing stories from parents about their children gives me so much hope for these kids because when I was little there was no internet, the doctors told my parents to just give me vitamins and let me eat whatever I wouldn‚Äôt refuse to eat, and that was the end of it. I absolutely love seeing how much time and effort these parents are putting into their kids‚Äô physical and mental health and providing guidance for them as an adult who has struggled with this disorder my whole life.",,,,two-of-me,,-1,-3.1010928,-3.983734

Last year I started starving myself due to stress. I was having normal days, and days where I had to force myself to choke down 200 calories. 

Just that light starvation triggered gallbladder failure for me. My symptoms were that I had no appetite and food nauseated me. I had mild nausea and was off put by food all the time. If I didn‚Äôt eat right when I was hungry that feeling would creep back in within an hour tops. 

They really should see a regular doctor to check out what‚Äôs going on. Even if it‚Äôs not something physical causing the food avoidance, like in my case, they might be able to evaluate the potential eating disorder.",,,,Zelda_is_my_homegirl,,-1,-5.4093246,-0.96820205

My nutritionist told me that I have slowed my metabolism from the years of restricting, and that the solution is to eat enough and balance my metabolism.

comment,2020-12-09 12:50:39,2020-12-09 12:50:39,EatingDisorders,gf5v5fo,"TL;DR : Go to the doctor. 

See a medical doctor and/or psychiatrist. A school counselor is not qualified to diagnose an eating disorder. Stress is only one of many medical conditions that could cause loss of appetite. You could certainly contact the eating disorder folks who could likely screen you, but I would get checked out for loss of appetite by a doctor first to rule out other conditions. 

Typically, traditional eating disorders are a mental health issue and would involve intentionally restricting, binging, purging or other disordered behaviors, rather than simply not feeling hungry. Now, if you‚Äôre toying with enjoying that feeling of emptiness or not wanting it to end, I would say you‚Äôd be catching a problem pretty early. 

I lost my appetite due to stress about a year ago. I was thrilled though, because I‚Äôve always been overweight and had already severely restricted calories off and on for about 15 years to try and lose weight. After about 2.5 months on 200-600 calories per day, I had lost ~40lbs and my gallbladder was failing. I felt the worst I‚Äôve literally felt in my life. I wanted to feel hungry but couldn‚Äôt and everything made me nauseous as soon as I tried to eat. So I didn‚Äôt. I put off medical care for the nausea for weeks, because despite how terrible it was I was so happy about not being able to eat. I liked that it forced me to starve with the level of commitment I‚Äôve always wished for. 

Are you hesitant to seek medical care for stress or loss of appetite? Do you inwardly enjoy the weight loss or appetite changes? 
I would say to sit with those questions, but absolutely still see a doctor first and foremost.",,,,Zelda_is_my_homegirl,,-1,-5.346989,-0.8788796

This may not be you, but right around when I was dealing with the same stress related food issues, I was diagnosed bipolar. All my life I thought I had ‚Äúdepression and anxiety‚Äù when really I was having issues regulating my moods. Antidepressants and anxiety meds didn‚Äôt work for me and I thought they were bs. Then I went to a psychiatrist instead of a doctor and she immediately put me on mood stabilizers (lamictal). I still have episodes, but it‚Äôs much milder and the swings are less dramatic. 

Some telltale symptoms are mood swings, impulsivity that may cause harmful decisions (financial, sexual, relationships, etc- I shop when I don‚Äôt have money for example) and staying up for long stints without feeling tired. I‚Äôm in a manic episode rn and I‚Äôve slept about 5 hours total in the last 4-5 days. 

Anyway I‚Äôm rambling. Check to see if your university has psychiatric services available, sometimes teaching hospitals will offer free or very cheap options. And good job.

I was sneaking food, because my mother had already started trying to control my weight. Every snack I‚Äôd attempt to eat would be scrutinized or shut down, so I stopped wanting people to know that I ate at all. The thought of you installing cameras or locks literally made me cry. The thought of how wrong it would make her feel for following probably very urgent-feeling urges she‚Äôs having is very upsetting. 

Your post is self critical, which is fine, but I would say one step you can take is to not criticize your daughter‚Äôs weight or make her feel guilty or wrong for being hungry or in a larger body. Also she‚Äôs a teenager! Many young women gain weight at the outset of puberty.

One of the most detrimental things for my eating disorder was my mother doing these things:

A. Making me feel wrong for having extra body fat
B. Equating happinesses with weight/size
C. Stopping me from having things I wanted. 
D. Constantly analyzing both what I was eating and the way my body looked. 

Some phrases as a 13 year old that were triggering for me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre really getting kind of heavy.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not something girls your size should wear‚Äù ‚ÄúThe kitchen is closed! No more snacks!‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy are you eating? You can‚Äôt possibly be hungry‚Äù ‚Äúshe can afford to eat that. You can‚Äôt‚Äù

You‚Äôre a wonderful parent for trying to understand and get ahead of this. I STRONGLY recommend the book Anti-Diet by Chrissy Harrison (for your understanding, it‚Äôs a bit dry for a 13 year old). My therapist recommended it to me. It covers a lot of things regarding weight stigma/psychological, efficacy of diets, the dangers of weight cycling vs staying heavier, etc. 

Something to remember is this. It is not morally wrong to have a larger body. It is not morally superior to have a smaller body. Trying to treat an eating disorder with ‚Äúa healthy diet‚Äù or further limiting access to foods can literally just shift the type/manifestation of the disorder. 
My experience at 13 sounds very similar to your daughter‚Äôs. Shortly after the binging, I began restricting/anorexic behaviors. Since then, I‚Äôve spent 20 years cycling between binging, anorexic, orthorexic, and bulimic behaviors. Having a young girl thinking there is something wrong with her body is a recipe for continued disordered eating.

Every young girl is bombarded with the message that she has to be thin to be worthy. Some people are genuinely just genetically larger bodied. Be one of the voices in her life to let her know that her body is fine at whatever size it is and that she should never be ashamed or guilty about her body.",,,,Zelda_is_my_homegirl,,-1,-7.3569646,-0.004532415

Weight control is addicting. Especially if she hasn‚Äôt been a gym person, this might feel like a new door opening up to her eating disorder. A new opportunity to change her body. 

I would suggest you try to shift the gym and diet practices away from consoling/shaping the body. Help her work out for strong musculoskeletal system and heart. Eat food so that you feel satiated and energized. 

Intentional weight loss for an anorexic in recovery is not the best of ideas. It sounds like while she‚Äôs eating normally at this point that she‚Äôs still not over the body acceptance piece yet, which is truly the heart of the disorder.

If we restrict during the day, the pendulum will swing the other way and trigger a binge because you‚Äôre not feeding yourself enough. People think they‚Äôre ‚Äúuncontrollable‚Äù but really our body is just trying to protect us.

Perhaps check out the book intuitive eating be Elise Resch and Evelyn Tribole. Or check out Anti-Diet by Christy Harrison. The IE book focuses more on the process while Anti-diet focuses a little more on the science behind weight loss/gain, dieting, and intuitive eating. 

All that being said. ‚ÄúHealthy‚Äù intentional weight loss has never been shown to be possible or effective long term in any scientific study. Each time we lose weight our body adjusts to prevent it in the future, so people are just weight cycling (yo-yoing) 98% of the time. Around 2% of people can keep weight off by being religious about maintaining restricting behaviors. 
That is not to say weight loss doesn‚Äôt happen naturally. If you neutralize your relationship to food, you can find your body‚Äôs stable weight (though it may be higher than what you‚Äôd like).

Something I‚Äôve had success with is telling people that it‚Äôs basically like ocd with food. I think people tend to understand that example because it helps them realize that it‚Äôs not a rational decision. It‚Äôs compulsive and ritualized rather than a strategic choice.",,,,Zelda_is_my_homegirl,,-1,-5.1717606,-0.14086294

I‚Äôve had a friend with ED history compliment me when I was at my lowest and as people with EDs we know that others with EDs are prone to notice due to the constant comparing that happens. Well I recovered and I gained quite a bit of weight. I mentioned to her that I was having a hard time with the weight and she said ‚ÄúI just see you. My best friend.‚Äù 

If your friend knows you have ED history and has an ED herself, then she knows encouraging you to not listen to hunger signals and to try and lose weight is harmful. If she‚Äôs knowingly inflicting harm, I might ask myself whether it‚Äôs healthy to spend time with that person. 

You definitely should see a doctor so you can be well. If you are athletic, I assume you‚Äôd like to continue doing sports. 
When we don‚Äôt eat enough, our body will breakdown muscle. The heart is a muscle, and one you might like to keep in good health so you can keep doing the things you enjoy.",,,,Zelda_is_my_homegirl,,-1,-7.037732,-0.109720826
comment,2023-03-03 02:54:17,2023-03-03 02:54:17,EatingDisorders,japin3h,"EDs are not weight disorders. They are primarily behavioral disorders that (sometimes) manifest physical side effects. 

Left untreated they can worsen over time. Having negative body thoughts and a strained relationship with food is enough to warrant seeking some help. The fact that you‚Äôre asking here means you know something isn‚Äôt right with how you‚Äôre feeling. It‚Äôs ok to get help before it gets serious rather than waiting. Especially when you‚Äôre in a sport that can strain your relationship with food further. 

Just something to think about.",,,,Zelda_is_my_homegirl,,-1,-5.868758,-1.293094

(even though bmi does not mean much) am i scared? of course but am i continuing on through the fear & pain? i am. i try to be proud of myself for how far i've come since i've had no outside help (no therapist, dietician, hospital) & a very toxic environment but i am doing it. i am trying to accept my body for how it looks & some days that's easy but some days it is really really fucking hard & restriction comes to my mind but then i try & realize how far i have come & how much progress i've made! i even think my weight is beginning to distribute more evenly now which is a relief & exciting. sorry for the long post i am just incredibly emotional right now & i want u all to know u CAN do this! u can attempt recovery & live a happy life. please just try! i know it's terrifying but what have u got to lose? ur eating disorder is always waiting for u but trust me once u experience freedom u won't want to go back. thank u to anyone who listened i am sending all of u love & am endlessly grateful for this sub (& all of u tolerating my many annoying posts)",,,,mariah-xo,the pandemic forced me into recovery & is saving my life.,-1,-5.2134027,-0.97974944

The mind still has to recover though, and as I said before, the average recovery length is eight years; you spend most of that piecing your mind back together. Your mind is pretty much shattered, but you gained weight, so you must be okay! It just makes me so mad.

It's fully okay to still be struggling; I can't imagine what you've gone through and I'm sorry you're still struggling with this.

Going through my vomit and smelling it to see what came up xoxo 

Purging at my 86 year old grandmothers house 

Going to the toilet if u know what I mean while still eating at the same time because I physically couldn‚Äôt stop myself from putting the food in my mouth 

Eating from the trash in my house 

Contemplating taking a trash bag full of binge food out of the big ass cans outside my building 

Pouring fairy liquid over the rest of my binge food to stop myself from eating it and eating it anyway 

Purging into a trash can in my room while my friend was sleeping over 

Spending my literal savings on binge food 

Debating taking out a small LOAN to sustain my life and bingeing 

Stealing 

Lying to everyone around me to get money that I then spent on food

Purging food my family cooked for me 

Purging at airports & in airplanes

Spending money I got from my family for some occasion on binge food 

Purging my graduation celebration dinner 

Purging a Michelin star 5 course meal. Twice. Once to celebrate something and the other time it was a gift from the company I work at 

Eating literally ingredients not even food. Butter, cream, etc. 


Idk if I can think of any more but I‚Äôve purged blood before, thought I was having a heart attack, the whole 9 yards. I have promised myself time and time again that today will be the last day but the guilt and shame I feel and the self hatred I have towards myself if I‚Äôm bloated or something is just insane.

Despite the fact that  tuesdays recipe is lemon basil, and the shrimp recipe I want to try is spicy, it just uses a bit of lemon to enhance the shrimp, so they‚Äôre not really similar? And I‚Äôm not allowed to make rice Wednesday either because I‚Äôm having rice on Thursday - despite the fact that I often meal prep, and therefor *often* eat a meal with rice three or four days in a row, but I can‚Äôt make it fresh two nights running? For reasons. And God Forbid I don‚Äôt weigh out my bowl of strawberries to the gram - but if I eat a handful of grapes from the display while grocery shopping it‚Äôs fine, don‚Äôt need to count them.

Your body does need a lot protein to repair damages so that‚Äôs probably why, and for me personally I crave fatty protein like steak as well, which makes sense bc the body also needs fats to repair. 

As for fiber, yeah it‚Äôs rough. I truly love, crave and enjoy fruits and veg (AND SWEET POTATOES OMG they were my recovery OBSESSION) but obviously I can‚Äôt eat plates and plates of broccoli and be comfortable lol. 50g fiber is generally what I get a day without trying or thinking about it, and is actually a pretty healthy amount (IMO the DRV of 25 is way too low) but in one sitting? And in ED recovery? Might be a biiiiit hard on ya. 

So I think while it makes sense that you‚Äôre craving foods with a high nutritional content that you also enjoy, maybe also practicing a liiiitle gentle nutrition in paying attention to how your body FEELS after that amount of fiber/protein snd maybe adjusting a bit.

But I‚Äôve been though this before and I definitely notice that the first time I had EH as a teen, eating simply high calorie never ever satisfied me but now  as an adult going through EH I have noticed that the foods I eat make a HUGE difference in my EH. (I‚Äôm learning I can‚Äôt trick my body w volume and vegetables, I‚Äôm learning how important fat is to satisfaction and how awful I feel if I eat only carbs) 

my mental hunger is reducing every day that I eat enough - I certainly don‚Äôt restrict, I‚Äôm even moving away from counting calories-, and I‚Äôm going for very long periods being able to focus on other things and have conversations and experiences again! The mental hunger is definitely there still, and probably will be until I‚Äôm weight restored, but it‚Äôs a background buzz rather than a foreground scream now. Sure, there are times I‚Äôm still obsessed w food and spiral, but I know now it‚Äôs because I haven‚Äôt eaten enough yet that day or I‚Äôve prioritized volume over nutrition, which I‚Äôm working on.

All that said, I appreciate being called out because it isn‚Äôt fair to assume someone‚Äôs health, psychologically or physically.

She didn‚Äôt have an eating disorder. She had disordered eating, sure, but she did not having a full blown ED‚Äîshe has never even described herself as having an eating disorder.

Tbh I feel like people use her as an example for what we WANT after recovery despite the fact that she continued to exercise, she refused to give up her physique for the most part and talks about dropping weight‚Äîall of the things we‚Äôre supposed to avoided in recovery‚Äîbecause she remained muscular and thin. If she didn‚Äôt, I doubt she‚Äôd be as hyped up as she has been, especially in the ED community.

I‚Äôm happy she eats intuitively now, but when I watched her videos as per someone‚Äôs recommendation I felt more triggered and upset with myself than motivated. I don‚Äôt look like her weight restored. Even when I started exercising again. And I know many of us don‚Äôt.

We have to stop exercising at least for a couple months (in terms of lifting/intense running/ etc.) because our bodies need to heal.

I like working out, but I understood that I had to give it up for awhile and restructure my relationship with movement so it‚Äôs enjoyable, not compulsive and compensatory. Stephanie literally took like a week or two off because she got sick, but she never 100% gave up exercise to allow her body to heal properly.

I‚Äôm also going to be *that* person and say that yes, you absolutely *can* quit exercising in the traditional sense for the rest of your life if you choose to.

My body fat is currently high due to recovery, but my doctor said I am healthy, for example. That is NOT a concern to them. Are you going to argue that because I don‚Äôt lift weight or do cardio and therefore must be unhealthy? That I ‚Äúowe it to myself‚Äù to be healthier than I am now, despite currently having no desire to exercise yet? You can‚Äôt, because you do not know me, nor my body, nor *anyone else‚Äôs* body.

Peanut butter was one of the foods I fucking loved even when I was actively anorexic, but I only allowed myself one tablespoon of a specific brand once a day, maybe two if I restricted enough. It was basically the only ‚Äútreat‚Äù I consistently allowed myself but it was *never* enough. I always wanted more but the fear and anxiety that thought caused me obviously dominated my choices. I even bought ‚Äúzero calorie peanut butter‚Äù that was the worst thing id ever tasted, but I ate it because I wanted peanut butter so much.

The first month I started recovery, I remember I went through two of those big ass honey flavored Jif jars within a week and a half and it was amazing. I put that shit on everything. Toast, pb&js, bagels, oatmeal, waffles, smoothies, fruits, nuts, pretzels, desserts. I ate it straight out of the jar, fat ass spoonful after fat ass spoonful. Sometimes I‚Äôd change it up and buy almond butters and sun butters. It made weight restoration so much easier, and I still eat a spoonful almost everyday.

It‚Äôs crazy how this time last year, I was precisely measuring out a stupid tablespoon of peanut butter and giving myself a fucking conniption if i wasn‚Äôt 100% sure it was exactly a tablespoon.

post,2021-03-12 19:12:44,2021-03-12 19:12:44,fuckeatingdisorders,m3oqw1,"I fucking did it.

I made it to March 2021. I gave up purging, compulsive exercising, and food restriction every single day, for 366 days. I gained the weight, I honored my extreme hunger when there seemed to be no end in sight, I ignored the exceptionally terrible thoughts about myself every time my body demanded more food. I kept telling myself it wasn‚Äôt my fault that my brain was fucked up when I‚Äôd grip the new fat deposits distributed to my trunk and, in that moment, seriously contemplated relapse. On March 12, 2020, at approximately 10:30 am, I gave up the  simultaneously monotonous and chaotic lifestyle that is anorexia that I had been drowning in for years, and clung to recovery like it was my lifeline.

I‚Äôm not foolish enough to call recovery a cakewalk, however. In fact, it‚Äôs been quite the opposite experience; the entire process has been the most difficult fucking thing I‚Äôve ever had to do, to date. I cried almost every day for months, and I still frequently fall apart. As recently as December, I would say to myself over and over, ‚ÄúIf I can‚Äôt be thin, I‚Äôd rather just be dead.‚Äù Absolute nothingness would have felt better than the constant psychological agony I was in every waking moment. 

Of course, despite the shitshow I perceived my own recovery to be, I now understand that a sick brain cannot think healthy thoughts until it is not sick anymore. A malnourished brain is a sick brain. So it‚Äôs no surprise to anyone that, when I was told things do in fact get better with time, I just had to trust them with nothing more than blind faith. ‚ÄúIt gets better when you gain the weigh,‚Äù I naturally scoffed at such claims‚ÄîI mean, haven‚Äôt we all? We all think *we‚Äôre* the exception. *I* was the exception. What if I‚Äôm always this hungry? What if I‚Äôm stuck in this disgusting blob of a meat sack for the rest of my life? What if I never accept myself post recovery? What if, what if, what if.

Spoiler alert: I wasn‚Äôt the exception. I‚Äôm no longer consumed with thoughts about relapses and losing the overshoot weight.  The uncertainty will end. It just takes time, and I‚Äôm still in the midst of the unraveling of it all.

Now, my fears haven‚Äôt necessarily dissipated. I‚Äôm still hyper aware of the physical sensations that my body experiences. The way fat folds when I sit, stand, bend down, breath in and out; the way my stomach dominates the space I take up, especially when I bloat; the way my shirts naturally fit tighter now that I‚Äôm no longer flat chested. I‚Äôm still terrified that this is my body now. And, naturally, it‚Äôs fucking uncomfortable. But Ive been telling myself, ‚ÄúI can tolerate my body just for today,‚Äù every single day for a year. What‚Äôs another year? Or two years?

My eating disorder has plagued me since childhood, and succeeded in digging it‚Äôs nails into my veins once more in early adulthood. Learning to cope with my body dysmorphia and this incessant need for control in healthy ways means flipping my whole world upside down. My body is still recovering, and the least I could do is give it some leeway. It unreasonable to expect my body to fit into such a tiny, rigid box when such rigidity is the very thing that was killing me to begin with.

Long story short, I do believe recovery is worth it. And I hope you all choose it eventually, when you‚Äôre good and ready. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Intentional weight loss, when you have a restrictive eating disorder *at the very least*, is inherently disordered. Less than 6% of people with eating disordered are diagnosed underweight, so please don‚Äôt talk to me about how there is no ‚ÄúED body type,‚Äù and then try to tell me that not allowing intentional weight loss discussions is unfair. There is no ES body type‚Äîtherefore, intentional weight loss is not the answer.

What‚Äôs unfair is telling people in larger bodies that they should lose weight, *especially so* when they have eating disorders (restrictive or binge eating). Fat people suffer through eating disorders and disordered eating at the hands of diet culture and we label it as a ‚Äúdiet,‚Äù despite experiencing many of the same symptoms that diagnose a thin person with an eating disorder. That is the exact definition of fatphobia, and exactly why I don‚Äôt think it has a place here. Recovery should be about moving away from the bullshit concept that weight determines your health, and learn to view food and your body in a neutral light, no matter what you weigh.

I. Don‚Äôt. Care. How. Much. You. Weigh. Intentional weight loss topics are triggering, and not recovery focused. As I‚Äôve said in my post, if you want to celebrate your weight loss, go to a weight loss sub. If I see it here, I will call it out, I do not care.

EDs are very similar to drug addiction and the brain functions in very similar ways.

The concerns you‚Äôve listed are valid concerns and should be addressed with compassion and kindness, but they *are* disordered. Often people don‚Äôt understand that weight gain (especially obesity) are very often a symptom of something else, and not because someone ‚Äúlacks control.‚Äù We put the entire blame for being fat on the individual, and ignore the real underlying health and socioeconomic problems that are entirely independent of ourselves; we force the emphasis on weight because diet culture has taught us that weight is relevant entirely by itself, and it. Is. Not.

We know fat people can be healthy. We know living in poor conditions that significantly exacerbate stress lead to chronic health problems, including heart disease and others that can have weight gain as a symptom (it is *not* just an ‚Äúovereating‚Äù problem). We know glorifying thinness and wellness culture are the reasons eating disorders (both restrictive and binge eating) and BDD are on the rise. So yeah, there is *way* too much emphasis on weight, even in the ED recovery community.

Everything else, I agree with. I was someone deeply entrenched in diet culture, on top of being predisposed to anorexia due to genetics and environmental factors and I get the irrationality‚Äîto an extent. I don‚Äôt obviously can‚Äôt change everyone‚Äôs minds and I don‚Äôt want to, but nobody is entitled to my emotional labor when they won‚Äôt listen anyway.

Because I didn‚Äôt touch on it previously, you cannot say you have nothing against fat people while actively not wanting to be fat yourself.

Haiiiiiiii, it‚Äôs me again. I‚Äôve been meaning to make this post since my one year mark back in March, but I‚Äôve just been so busy with... well, not being fucking sick for the first time in Y E A R S. And truthfully, I was unsure about how recovery had made me feel, not only physically but psychologically as well... but after January, I think I finally discovered myself again, and immersed myself in my creative endeavors all over again. It was as if I never fell out of it... but I digress.

I‚Äôm going to go over my recovery month-by month, in detail, in hopes that it will be of some use to somebody in this sub. If you have any questions, feel free to ask!

**Month 1:** I decided to recover the day my state went into lockdown. My extreme hunger kicked in *immediately*, which scared the shit out of me. I remember telling myself I would ‚Äúallow‚Äù myself to eat, but only after I restricted for x amount of hours and only after I exercised... of course, I then found out gyms would remain closed for the foreseeable future (including my apartment‚Äôs sad excuse for a gym), and I was really forced to loosen my obsessive grip on exercise, which in turn convinced me to eat as well. It took me a few days, but I was able to throw myself into the throes of extreme hunger and eat according to my body‚Äôs needs. I ate every hour, as I‚Äôd feel physically ill and faint if I didn‚Äôt. I ate, and and, and then ate some more. Extreme hunger gave me no leniency during  the nighttime hours, either; I‚Äôd wake up every at least three times just to eat. Fuck, I remember counting up all of my calories once and I ate close to 11,000kcals in one day.

I was constantly shoveling food into my mouth (particularly nutrient/caloric dense food‚Äîi.e., ‚Äúprocessed junk food‚Äù), yet i was still hungry 30 minutes later. I suffered from gastroparisis long before recovery, so all that food just sat in my stomach for hours. I was so bloated that I looked as if I was in my third trimester of pregnancy. I immediately retained water, specifically in my hands, feet, legs, the entirety of my midsection, and my face. 

Around week 3, my emotions, which I‚Äôve been numbing for literal *years*, were flipped back on. Everything made me cry; to my friend jokingly saying I hurt his feelings to my boyfriend‚Äôs tone shifting slightly. Everything f elt so overwhelming all the time.

Extreme physical exhaustion basically forced me into hibernation, as I slept for 14 hours a day. The night sweats (aka, hypermetabolism) were so severe that I had to lay down a blanket underneath and use my own sheet to guarantee my partner‚Äôs side of the bed wouldn‚Äôt be soaked as well; everything I put into my body was immediately burned off because it just didn‚Äôt know what the fuck to do with it all. This stage was so miserable because I was constantly changing out of wet clothes and ensuring I ate more and more so I wouldn‚Äôt lose more weight. At this point, I have gained approximately 15 lbs of pure water and water weight, but have not gained true weight just yet.

**Month 2-3:** by this time, I was no longer struggling with night sweats associated with hypermetabolism, though I still slept half the day away, cried frequently, and ate at a significant surplus. I could not be physically active for too long, as my legs would swell and I‚Äôd begin to feel faint. Month two was when I finally started gaining true weight. It felt rapid at first, but looking back I truly believe it was probably about 1.5-2 lbs a week. 

At about two months, none of my ED jeans or shorts fit and I would have regular meltdowns, ranting and raving about how this is a nightmare and I must have gained a million pounds. But I continued eating.

**Month 4-7:** these next three months were messy for me. Most of my pre-ED clothes didn‚Äôt fit at all, and my body image was at an all time low; my body dysmorphia was constantly being triggered every time I caught a glance at my
own reflection. I was body checking at an all time high, compulsively checking every single angle, pinching my flesh, and begging my friends for reassurance they learned quickly not to give me. 

But I still didn‚Äôt know what I looked like. Looking at photos from before I entered recover were surreal. I didn‚Äôt realized how emancipated I was‚Äînot just my weight, but my hair, the dark circles under my eyes, how pale and physically fragile I was, as if I‚Äôd shatter if I fell too hard (that was a real concern of mine, by the way). But when I looked at myself at this time in my recovery, I saw some hideous monster and that was very difficult for me. I developed a phobia of my own reflection and I began to miss my ED body.

Extreme hunger had reduced around month 4, but was still present in my every day life. I had read so much about how others weight restored after just four months, and My rigid, OCD brain somehow convinced me that I absolutely **had** to be weight restored now, so I began to ignore the remnants of my extreme hunger and only allowed myself to eat [redacted] calories a day. Nothing as low as during my active anorexia, but still not enough to support my recovering body, which unfortunately still required a lot of food. I‚Äôm not completely sure as I never weighed myself once at this point, but I believe I lost a little bit of weight and my body was not happy about it.

Couple all that with extreme food boredom and I fucking relapsed, got stuck in a state of quasi recovery, whatever you wanna call it, for 3.5 months. I was constantly hungry, but had zero appetite. It was especially bad at night.

**Month 8-9:** I was able to pull myself out of that relapse and began honoring my extreme hunger once more. I was averaging about 4,000kcals a day for two months. I got rid of my ED clothes, and I started therapy after realizing that I was not recovering psychologically at all, my OCD was flairing up and my body dysmorphia forced me to think about the way I looked every hour of every day. The new clothes I‚Äôd bought suddenly felt tight and I noticed new fat deposits in places I‚Äôve never had fat before. My face was swollen and my body felt tight from the water retention.

I have a short short torso and long legs, which resulted in any weight gain I had to my trunk/abdomin region looked compact and too heavy. My ass, thighs, and upper arms also held a lot of weight, whereas my wrists, feet, calves and neck seemingly gained nothing at all. The best description for this foreign body would be, an adult sized toddler. It was uncomfortable and I felt alien in my body, all of the time.

I had gotten a physical done for my new job, and I‚Äôd requested not to know what my weight is.... so they told me my BMI instead. I cried for an hour.

These months were very difficult for me, because recovery just felt hopeless and not at all worth it.

**Months 10-12:** new year, new me‚Äîliterally. I finally began to see the brighter side of recovery, just dimly. My extreme hunger vanished completely, for the first time in almost a year. I was still eating about 3,400-3,800kcals daily, but my body was still doing a lot of internal healing. I no longer thought about food and every once  in awhile I‚Äôd experience fullness. 

I dropped some water weight and no longer felt uncomfortably bloated and swollen. I stayed a consistent clothing size and no longer had to continuously buy new leggings and underwear.

I still struggled immensely with my body dysmorphia, and an inability to look at myself from the neck down... but I suddenly had more energy to go back to weight lifting  purely for enjoyment and no aesthetic goal despite my (perceived) uneven weight distribution. I found motivation to start making art again. I laughed a lot more.

**Month 13-14 (present):** my appetite has stabilized and I now experience hunger. I feel like I did, pre-ED  as far as hunger cues and my physical health feels. I have loads of energy to do the things I want, such as hiking, going on walks, and I‚Äôm able to be present no matter what food I might have to eat or if I might have to skip a workout (fun story, I dropped a weight on my foot and haven‚Äôt worked out properly in about 2 weeks). 

I have ‚Äúovershot‚Äù by quite a lot compared to what I lost. My body feels extremely foreign to me, and my weight has yet to redistribute (all in the belly). However I‚Äôm slowly moving away from the concept that I‚Äôll lose it. I want to feel comfortable in my body regardless of my size. My relationship has improved, I‚Äôm excelling at my job, and I get to eat freely and I can be present with friends, family and my therapist.

That isn‚Äôt to say I don‚Äôt have my struggles. I still can‚Äôt look in mirrors without feeling immense embarrassment and disgust. I‚Äôm currently struggling to ensure I‚Äôm eating enough when I‚Äôm stressed (going through a really rough time in my life). I have a bad habit of buying clothes that are too big and then crying about the size. But I am actively working on dismantling my own internalized fatphobia and practicing radical acceptance about this new body. I am aware of the things that trigger me and have to make the conscious decision to not give into compulsive ED thoughts, because at the end of the day I am responsible for my own mental health.

To sum this post up, recovery is fucking hard, often for a long damn time. But it is soooososososo worth it if you wade through the really fucking bad parts, when it feels like it isn‚Äôt worth it at all. You have a mental disorder, but you are not broken and you deserve to live a life without your eating disorder whispering in your eat every second of every single day.

[Some] risk factors for eating disorders include weight stigma and a history of dieting; of course, you need to meet psychological criteria to be diagnosed, but the line between disordered eating and eating disorders often become blurred, so is important to understand that, at the end of the day, EDs are mental disorders.

It‚Äôs literally in the rules.

There is a big fucking difference between encouraging others to explore more foods, especially later in recovery, and flat out telling others to eat less sugar or less carbs because some of you are afraid of swinging entirely in the other direction after restriction (which does not happen as often as people think).

Look, extreme hunger is shitty, and it can be so, so hard. I went through a whole 10 months of it. It can be scary eating a lot of food, especially caloric/nutrient dense foods that are labeled ‚Äúprocessed‚Äù and morally ‚Äúbad‚Äù according to society, despite our bodies craving them because they get us out of that energy deficit the quickest (which is exactly what your body wants).

Honoring those cravings, that hunger, and listening to your body (at your own pace, of course), is the only way to get over extreme hunger. Physical and mental restriction at bedt only prolongs the recovery process, at worst causes a full blown relapse.

I‚Äôm **not** telling you what or how to recover; if you wanna cut out certain foods, you do you‚Äîbut don‚Äôt discourage others from eating them either. Instead of making people feel bad about it, say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre doing great!‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud of you,‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going through the same and it sucks,‚Äù or just‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt say anything at all.

We are a recovery focused space. I dont care how well intentioned you are, these comments are hurtful and invalidating and lead people to question their hunger and possibly even a relapse.

I find it weird you mentioned my support of all in, despite even saying in my post, and many times previously, that going at your own pace is totally fine. If you need a meal plan, follow a meal plan; just make sure you‚Äôre eating enough. If it‚Äôs easier to slowly add foods back in rather than going all-in (pun intended), then that‚Äôs okay. Some people work best with structure, others would rather just get it over with. Recovery is very subjective and everyone will recover at their own pace.. That‚Äôs totally fine. I have no qualms about that.

The fact remains, however, that restriction is inherently unhealthy, both psychologically and physiologically. I don‚Äôt care if you don‚Äôt wanna go all in, that‚Äôs fine, but you don‚Äôt get to talk about your restriction here, nor encourage it on others‚Äô posts‚Äîespecially considering this is one of very few subs that are predominantly supportive of the all-in method.

You ask why we should guard ourselves from diet talk if we hear about it anyway, and I just‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt know why this is even a question you‚Äôre asking? You wouldn‚Äôt tell an addict at rehab that it‚Äôs pointless because the substance of choice (for lack of a better phrase) is everywhere outside regardless. This is a safe space where members don‚Äôt have to worry about whether or not they‚Äôll be triggered, where individuals can discuss their recovery or their struggles with their ED that doesn‚Äôt explicitly discuss in detail methods of restriction or ‚ÄúDiEtInG,‚Äù specifically because it *encourages* disordered behaviors. My opinions on dieting are irrelevant; discussing it is harmful to members and encourages ED behaviors (whether intentional or otherwise).

On top of that, there are *countless* other subs dedicated to dieting and pro-Ana content where you could go, here is not the place to do it for all the aforementioned reasons. It doesn‚Äôt matter that you have a different opinion on what is considered healthy, because you aren‚Äôt entitled to anyone else‚Äôs health and therefore you don‚Äôt get to comment, in an ED recovery sub, what is and isn‚Äôt healthy. It doesn‚Äôt matter that you don‚Äôt feel a responsibility to make sure other members don‚Äôt feel guilty, because it‚Äôs mine. It is my job to enforce the rules, and that includes rule 10 (No Diet Tips), which includes encouraging weight loss and restriction.

They may not have eating disorders, but just because many people intentionally lose weight doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre automatically healthy. Weight is not synonymous to health. It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that studies have shown that people at higher weights are generally healthy; the ones who aren‚Äôt usually have gained weight as a symptom of a chronic illness rather than the weight being the illness itself. Therefore, losing weight doesn‚Äôt diminish the illness (oftentimes it exacerbated it) but individuals who aren‚Äôt fat are less likely to face discrimination in the medical community and receive the care the initially needed when they came in with a larger body.

Edit: are you asking how dieting can be healthy in the long term, or how intuitive eating can be healthy in the long term? If IE has lead you to eating freely without reactive binging, whereas ‚Äúdieting‚Äù has lead to all the aforementioned consequences, remember that eating disorders are a mental disorder‚Äîhowever, the affects of starvation are the same regardless of how disordered one‚Äôs thoughts are.

The one thing I do feel the need to say is that treatment centers aren‚Äôt meant to be a cure for all of your mental health woes. depression and anxiety can exist outside of your eating disorder‚Äîtreatment isnt guaranteed to fix that, nor is it guaranteed to fix your eating disorder for that matter.

comment,2021-08-14 20:31:52,2021-08-14 20:31:52,fuckeatingdisorders,h8y9vdw,"Short answer: yes, anyone at any weight can experience being in an energy deficit due to not eating enough which results in being under one‚Äôs set point weight.

Long answer: eating disorders are mental disorders, weight is irrelevant; on top of this, most people with EDs are people of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù weight or overweight. 

Weight is a really shitty indicator of health. BMI isn‚Äôt even backed by any sort of science whatsoever; it was created by a mathematician over 200 years ago to study white, European men (which makes it even more difficult for women and non-white individuals). The overweight marker was even dropped from 27 (if I‚Äôm not mistaken) to 25 because ‚Äú27 is too hard to remember.‚Äù It also doesn‚Äôt factor in genetics, sex, or bone density. A single number cannot determine that.

Body weight aside, starvation is starvation. The body has a set weight it is healthiest at and functions optimally (yup, even if you‚Äôre not conventionally ‚Äúthin,‚Äù you can be overweight/fat and still be healthy). If you drop below that via restriction and dieting, even if you aren‚Äôt thin/underweight in terms of BMI, you‚Äôre still in an energy deficit and will eventually lose hunger/fullness cues; experience a drop in hormone levels; catabolism (your body eats it‚Äôs own muscles and bone mass for fuel), damage to vital organs such as the heart and brain; lose your hair; and become hyper fixated on food, among many other things.

Yo-yo dieting and heavy restriction has been scientifically proven to cause more weight gain in the long run. And that‚Äôs not delving into adaptive thermogenesis (starvation mode), aka gaining weight despite being in energy deficit. And yes, it can happen to anyone who restricted. The body gives two fucks about your reasons behind restriction, all it knows is that food isn‚Äôt coming in and it will physiologically respond the same in any situation that results in a shortage of food. Even if you don‚Äôt eat lunch for one day, you‚Äôll notice you‚Äôll be hungrier at dinner and eat more (or at least want to). 

Hope that all makes sense. I can offer sources for all of this if you‚Äôd like. I encourage you to check out r/antidiet and r/intuitiveeating as well, those are great sources as well.",,,,Sareeee48,,-1,-5.961419,-1.6020812

I think a huge reason we mainly see these types of bodies is because they are still socially acceptable, whereas others in larger bodies are not. You‚Äôll get praised for living in a privileged body (white, thin girls are told they‚Äôre strong, beautiful and deserve to eat) while those in larger bodies either get a whole different kind of praise or straight up disgust and encouragement to engage in ED behaviors (think, the ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so brave‚Äù comments for doing basic things just because they‚Äôre bigger or being told they should eat less solely due to their size).

I don‚Äôt follow these accounts anymore. Tbh, I don‚Äôt follow most thin ED accounts because quite frankly, they make me feel fucking terrible about myself and I ask myself the same questions you‚Äôve asked here: why can‚Äôt I look like that?

Edit: I‚Äôm not saying recovering into a thin body isn‚Äôt okay, it absolutely is, but I feel like there is a stark difference between those who recover into a thin body (or play the role of recovered while still actively engaging in behaviors) and those who don‚Äôt. And those who don‚Äôt often have a significantly harder time trying to navigate recovery and accepting their body at a higher weight compared to those who gained very little.

Yes, yes, this is 100% a shared opinion thanks for saying what we‚Äôre all thinking lmfao. Seriously though, men going out of their way to reject women who don‚Äôt know they exist is peak toxic masculinity tbh.",,,,Sareeee48,,-1,-7.168804,-2.0123353

post,2021-09-14 00:52:02,2021-09-14 00:52:02,fuckeatingdisorders,pnsdub,"Even if your ED tells you to, even if you haven‚Äôt eaten all day but don‚Äôt feel hungry, even if you‚Äôre experiencing extreme hunger and you *just ate* but want more, even if you‚Äôre weight restored, even if you‚Äôre binging out of hunger, even if you have BED, even if someone previously told you that you need to eat some arbitrary amount to maintain some arbitrary weight/BMI. 

Firstly, if you‚Äôre binging due to hunger, then you‚Äôre going to need to make sure you aren‚Äôt restricting (aka listening to your body and honoring your hunger); restriction leads to reactive binging and the body wants to compensate for that; hense why those with restrictive EDs eat a whole fucking lot in recovery. And if you have ensured you‚Äôre honoring your body‚Äôs need for food but still experiencing relentless hunger, then look into other possibilities such as chronic health conditions, etc. 

Secondly, suffering from BED doesn‚Äôt mean you need to restrict either (I *really* wanna address the one). BED isn‚Äôt driven by hunger and restricting isn‚Äôt going to fix the binging‚Äîif anything, it‚Äôs going to exacerbate it and make it worse in the long term. Not that I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs easy, and I understand why restriction seems like a logical response to overeating in a society that basically encourages undereating, especially for those in larger bodies. It‚Äôs hard when it feels like you can‚Äôt trust your body and that food is the enemy. But if you want to stop binging then learning to cope with the emotional responses and reactions that lead to a binge and those that happen after a binge, hopefully with the help of a professional, is going to be a lot more effective than restricting to ‚Äúmanage‚Äù them. Telling others who have restrictive EDs that they need to eat (and eat  *a god damn lot* if they are in recovery) according to their hunger isn‚Äôt encouraging BED and tbh I‚Äôm a little confused why some of y‚Äôall are reporting comments for that.

Bottom line: I understand ‚Äúrecommending‚Äù a minimum number of calories to people, especially those who are still terrified of eating (regardless of your ED), might not sit well with others but if you‚Äôre struggling with an ED and you‚Äôre hungry, then you 99.9% of the time, you should eat. 

You are absolutely allowed to believe that restriction would work for you or whoever else, but there are other subs more suited for that kind of talk so I don‚Äôt really think this is the place for it and I am not going to argue with y‚Äôall about it.

So‚Ä¶ Thanks for coming to another one of my TED Talks. Good night.",,,,Sareeee48,Y‚Äôall NEED to remember that restriction isn‚Äôt encouraged here,-1,-5.0773425,-1.527473

post,2021-09-19 12:13:27,2021-09-19 12:13:27,fuckeatingdisorders,pr6t19,"Hey guys, I‚Äôm gonna keep this short and sweet so I can get right to the point; I realize that many people don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on with their body when they start recovery from a restrictive ED. There are so many things I myself wish I knew before diving into recovery, so I thought I‚Äôd compile the most common/important things together in a list for you all, in hopes that it will help y‚Äôall who are just starting recoveru.

1. **Your body is gonna do some wack shit for awhile:** you‚Äôll likely retain a fuckload of water within the first few days/weeks (I promise, it‚Äôs not true weight gain yet); you‚Äôll be hit with severe body aches and extreme exhaustion to the point you can‚Äôt leave the bed and sleep for 14+ hours every day. You‚Äôll be bloated and bowel irregularities are basically a nonnegotiable, necessary evil. Take this time to really, *truly* rest for at least a few weeks, if possible.

2. **No, you‚Äôre not developing BED. Yes, it‚Äôs normal to eat thousands of calories in a single day:** I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve seen y‚Äôall freak out over the possibility of having BED right after choosing to recover from your restrictive ED (not talking shit, I absolutely understand the fear and the lack of knowledge surrounding extreme hunger). But that‚Äôs just not how BED works; the DSM-5 has made it clear that true binging cannot coincide with restrictive behaviors as it is then classified as an abnormal circumstance that leads to rhe large consumption of food. In other words, it is impossible to binge early on in recovery when your body is struggling with months/years of malnutrition. You need to eat back *all* of those calories you restricted over the span of your ED, *on top* of your normal daily caloric intake (which can range anywhere from 2500-3500kcal). This can round out to a lot of food, but I‚Äôm telling you right now it‚Äôs normal. I ate upwards to 11,000kcal the first month or so. The most important rule to follow is, if you‚Äôre eating out of hunger, it‚Äôs not binging.

3. **Extreme/mental hunger should always be honored:** even if you‚Äôre at a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù BMI. Even if you‚Äôre technically overweight by BMI standards. Even if your doctor or psychiatrist (who aren‚Äôt nutritionists or dietitians, btw, and have little to no academic learning in nutrition) tell you to eat at some arbitrary number that leaves you feeling unsatisfied and hungry. Extreme/mental hunger can be so hard to cope with, especially if you don‚Äôt fit into the ‚Äúemaciated anorexic‚Äù stereotype. But you can‚Äôt work around it either; the only way out is through.

4. **2000 calories ain‚Äôt it:** you need to eat more, probably *much* more than this in recovery, and very likely *after* recovery as well. 2000 is what most 10 year olds eat. And on a similar note, you also dont need to follow some made up TDEE you got from the internet. Those calories are what you‚Äôd need if you were in a coma and not moving and don‚Äôt account for the various factors in your life. Walking, breathing, typing, even eating burns energy. Honor your hunger.

5. **A starved brain is incapable of doing the important psychological work and the neural rewiring essential for long-term recovery:** this is the paradox of why eating disorders are so difficult to treat; the starved brain is irrationally terrified of food and weight gain to the point it can be fatal, but the only way to overcome those fears for good is to is first eat and gain the weight. You can prep yourself and brace for the inevitable panic attacks and emotional breakdowns, but you cannot rewire your brain when it is still malnourished. You have to gain the weight first and allow your brain to heal as well.

6. **Dont expect weight restoration to solve all of your problems:** this might seem to contradict number 5, but bear with me. I read all of these things about how weight restoration would bring me mental clarity and miraculous neural rewiring‚Ä¶ that wasn‚Äôt the case whatsoever. I mean, don‚Äôt get me wrong‚ÄîI‚Äôm definitely *much* better off, but you need to learn the skills to fight off relapse for long term recovery/remission, hopefully with a professional if you have the option of doing so. Don‚Äôt assume you just need to gain weight to get rid of the eating disorder.

7. **Your body decides your set point, not you:** I feel like so many of us get caught up by this one. Our weight is influenced by any *number* of factors, including genetics, sex, height, and environment. Your body knows what weight it functions best at and it will probably be at a weight higher than what you‚Äôre comfortable with. But you *cannot* fully recover until you accept that your body calls the shots. Please challenge that fear of weight gain and of being at a higher weight because it‚Äôs going to hinder your recovery if you don‚Äôt. Ask yourself these important questions: what‚Äôs so wrong with being at a higher weight? Who told you being at a higher weight was unacceptable? Would you tell a loved one that they are any less deserving of kindness, love and respect because they are at a higher weight?

8. **Youll probably overshoot, and it might not taper off:** basically, you gain ‚Äúextra‚Äù weight above your preED set point weight. One thing I read (I can try to find the source if you‚Äôd like) that suggested that the longer and/or more severe we restricted, the higher we‚Äôd overshoot. But here‚Äôs the thing: overshoot weight is *necessary* weight. The body has a set fat to fat free mass (muscle) ratio; it first must regain optimal fat levels before it can restore muscle mass, hense why we look soft and dough-y after weight restoration. The excess fat will be used to support long term healing, balance hormones levels, and overall used as an insurance policy of sorts in case you decide to restrict again and it will have energy to keep you going if that happens for however many months/years. If you developed your ED as a child/teen, it may not taper off as weight gain is a normal, healthy part of aging into adults and we typically don‚Äôt stop growing until age 25. I restricted pretty dedicatedly both as a child for 3ish years and as an adult for 6 years and I overshot by *a lot.* I kept hoping and hoping it would taper off soon because so many people said it would, but it hasn‚Äôt and as much as I hate to admit, it may never will. This is also something you will have to accept and work through in order to prevent a relapse.

9. **Let go of exercising and compulsive movement:** At least temporarily for conventional exercise or general movement, until your weight and body have stabilized. Firstly, the severe swelling, bloating, body aches, extreme fatigue, and extreme hunger will not only make it exceedingly difficult to maintain an exercise routine, it will likely make these symptoms significantly worse. Your body is severely depleted of energy and requires a ridiculous amount of rest. Now, obviously you don‚Äôt need to do absolutely nothing for a few months to a couple of years, but you may require bed rest the first month or so (I did); after you finally start to experience the benefits of increased energy, I still suggest to keep it away from conventional exercise until you are sure your weight is stable and you can choose to exercise from a place of enjoyment rather than a compulsive need or as compensatory behaviors. I know some people say the continue to exercise but I don‚Äôt really recommend it, personally.

10. **Weight loss is not compatible with recovery:** you cannot focus on weight loss while actively trying to recover. You have an eating disorder; you can‚Äôt just tell your brain, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna restrict again but this time will be different!‚Äù It won‚Äôt. On top of that, your body gives fuck all about what you *want* to happen, all it knows is that suddenly there‚Äôs not enough food coming in and you‚Äôre back to square one before you know it. You cannot choose to lose weight and actively remain in recovery. It‚Äôs counterintuitive. I encourage you to let go of the idea of manipulating your body/weight and accept your body at whatever weight it ends up at because you are worth more than some arbitrary BMI number that was created to represent white European men *only* (yup, no women or non white individuals whatsoever) in the 1830s. 

11. **Junk food and sugar are your FRIENDS:** firstly, I want to say that you should stop giving moral value to food altogether. ALL food is good food. ALL food has nutrients. Take an apple and a cupcake for example; we know the two are different nutritionally speaking. An apple has fiber and various different vitamins and nutrients such as vitamin C and potassium‚Ä¶ but what you might not know is that a chocolate cupcake has magnesium and other essential minerals including calcium, sulfur, zinc, iron, copper, potassium; flavonoids with antioxidant properties; and vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5, B9 and E. Not only this, it is a great choice for those in an energy deficit due to restriction due to its higher calorie content. I tell y‚Äôall all the time here to honor your cravings for these foods because they hold a significant purpose in recovery, contrary to what diet culture will have you believe. Junk food will literally save your life where low calorie foods such as fruits and veggies will fail you. You are going to suffer from gastrointestinal distress that will be exacerbated by fibrous fruits, vegetables and whole grains, leading to painful gas, bloating, cramps, and irregular bowel movements. High calorie, nutrient dense foods will actually be easier on your digestion and metabolize much quicker, which will promote faster healing. And remember: once you‚Äôre weight restored, you *do not* have to go back to restricting these foods. Eat them when you want, because restricting them will cause you to fall back into ED habits, even if you think you have control over them. You are allowed to eat the foods you crave for the rest of your life.

12. **As much as your ED will try to convince you, you aren‚Äôt the exception to recovery:** We often feel like we‚Äôre the exception to the rules of recovery, that it won‚Äôt work for us because [insert ED reasoning here]. it will most likely feel like you‚Äôll eat endlessly forever, you‚Äôll be hungry forever, you‚Äôll gain forever. That your metabolism is irreversibly damaged‚Ä¶ and as someone who thought the same exact thing, I can tell you with certainty that your eating, hunger, and weight will normalize (‚Äúnormalize‚Äù meaning your body will find the middle ground that is healthiest for you). Your body isn‚Äôt stupid, it‚Äôs the result of millions of years of complex evolution whose sole purpose is to keep you alive; the last thing your body has in mind is to keep you eating and gaining until you die. I promise you that you aren‚Äôt gaining as quickly as you probably think. In fact, there is no ‚Äútoo quick‚Äù in recovery.

13. ***DON‚ÄôT*** **compare yourself to everyone else and their recovery:** everyone is different. Don‚Äôt compare your progress with some YouTube or IG influencers who only gained x or xx lbs while you gained more or look different or eat more. *Your* recovery is *yours* and you are doing what you need to do. Try not to stress about others whose background you don‚Äôt know, because for all you know they could still be struggling. You‚Äôre doing your best and that‚Äôs what matters.

14. **Recovery isn‚Äôt linear, so take your time:** challenge yourself and your ED with opposite actions and unlearning societal norms that harm you, but don‚Äôt push yourself too far too quickly. Take your time, go at your own pace. You have an eating disorder and deserve to be kind to yourself. Recovery will have ups and downs and sometimes you might slip for a little while, tomorrow is a new day, fuck even a minute from now is a new moment. Don‚Äôt beat yourself up for small mistakes and learn from the big ones. Okay? Okay.

Your body needs to rest in order to recover and exercise burns more calories, which means you have to eat *more* on top of recovery amounts (that are already particularly high, especially if you have extreme hunger). This makes physical repairs of the body significantly more difficult because you‚Äôre burning off much needed energy that it needs to heal. And to top it off, it can cause even more weight gain in the long run because your body is literally fighting you to gain weight at all. The desire to continue exercising when you want to recover is counterintuitive and disordered; you can *always* go back to exercising or sports once you are weight restored and nutritionally rehabilitated. It isn‚Äôt going anywhere!

I also really encourage you to reflect on why you only allow yourself ‚Äúwhole foods.‚Äù All foods are processed in some way. All foods have a purpose; continuing to give moral value to food (aka, ‚Äúwhole foods is better‚Äù) will set you back in recovery.",,,,Sareeee48,,-1,-5.782466,-2.269109

Only 6% of ED sufferers are clinically underweight, which means that 96% are either ‚Äúnormal‚Äù weight or overweight. So that in and of itself should say something. If you‚Äôve been restricting for long periods of time, regardless of your weight, you‚Äôre going to have to basically eat back all the calories you denied yourself to fix the damages of your eating disorder.

Since all bodies are different and no two recoveries are the same, nobody will gain the same amount of weight. It all depends on your set point, the severity of your illness, and the duration of it. It may or may not be proportionate to someone who is underweight, but if you were overweight prior to your ED, you may be overweight *after* your eating disorder and that‚Äôs totally fine. Even if you are currently underweight. Even if you are currently at a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù weight, and so on.

Weight isn‚Äôt a sole indicator of health and BMI is a shitty, unscientific method that shouldn‚Äôt be used at all, tbh. It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs anorexia, ARFID, OSFED, atypical anorexia, bulimia, weight gain is basically inevitable and should be encouraged. The only exception would be BED, in which case refeeding isn‚Äôt the goal. *However*, restriction should still be discouraged as it only perpetuates the desire to binge and doesn‚Äôt resolve the real problem‚Äîresolve/cope with the emotional stressors and/or trauma that leads to binging and you‚Äôll stop the binging.",,,,Sareeee48,,-1,-5.918098,-1.54128

Eating disorders are *mental disorders*, the body and therefore it‚Äôs weight is not something that specifically defines an eating disorder.

That means the other 94%‚Äîyou know, the vast, **vast** fucking majority‚Äîstruggle with an ‚Äúatypical‚Äù eating disorder due to their weight, despite suffering from the very same consequences of malnutrition.

I‚Äôm also extremely into fitness and even went to school for nutrition and kinesiology and manipulating your physique requires restricting your diet, which isn‚Äôt compatible with recovery.

All that aside, she has also been caught photoshopping her photos, which seems really weird to me if she is supposedly so comfortable with her body. Again, I‚Äôm not opposed to people referring to her as a fitness influencer (and this certainly isn‚Äôt an attack on her as a person, either), my issue is that she is promoting all in as if you can still exercise to manipulate your body and weight (even if she doesn‚Äôt say it) and that‚Äôs not how it works. You can be into fitness and not have a desire to change the way your body looks, especially if it involves restricting. Claiming to be an intuitive eater when you aren‚Äôt is extremely harmful to a lot of her followers who *do* struggle with disordered eating, and though she is absolutely free to do what she wants with her body, she‚Äôs affirming to these people that you don‚Äôt need to fix your relationship with exercise and continuing the notion that thinness is superior.

1. It implies that being overweight means you cannot be energy deficient and that‚Äôs entirely not true.

2. It‚Äôs extremely dismissive of overweight people with EDs who need to be able to eat freely, and yes, even very likely gain weight, in order to recover. Only 6% of restrictive ED sufferers are underweight. If your ED has caused you to gain past your set point, restriction isn‚Äôt going to fix that; in fact, it‚Äôs going to make it exceptionally worse and lead to other negative health consequences. Plus, restricting actually *reinforces* binge urges, hense why a lot of BED treatments are beginning to be tailored around an intuitive eating and HAES friendly approach. I do agree with what you said about unintentional weight loss, i should have clarified when I said *intentional* weight loss isn‚Äôt compatible with recovery. And it‚Äôs not. If you fix your relationship with food and you naturally lose weight, as some people do, then this doesn‚Äôt apply to you. This is something that is frequently talked about in this sub so I didn‚Äôt think it needed clarification. My bad.

3. If you are struggling with hormonal issues (as I have myself), restriction doesn‚Äôt fix them. Now you just weigh less with hormonal issues. And as someone who‚Äôs family struggles with insulin resistance and diabetes (and therefore I myself am at a higher risk for), losing weight doesn‚Äôt magically fix these things and there‚Äôs really no scientific basis that universally claims it does. In fact, exercise, and treatments that don‚Äôt fixate on weight as a whole, has been documented to manage these things a lot more effectively. Theres a reason more than 90% of all diets fail, and why virtually everyone who loses will gain more weight back than they initially lost.

4. Even *if* intentional weight loss and restriction worked, EDs are extremely competitive disorders. You don‚Äôt know who you‚Äôre encouraging weight loss or food restriction to, or how damaging it can be to others reading the posts/comments and feeling invalidated in their disorder, like they aren‚Äôt good at having an ED and need to try harder (the way many atypical ED sufferers feel).

I understand what you are trying to say, and your struggles are valid, but these are pretty specific instances that you are describing; the whataboutism you‚Äôre playing is irrelevant because you‚Äôre discussing an entirely different scenario to discredit my initial claim that encouraging dieting and intentional weight loss *while in ED recovery* is not okay. Yes, everyone‚Äôs recovery is different, but you should be focusing on nutritional rehabilitation (again, even if you have BED or bulimia) and healing your relationship with food and your body. Some people will end up fat and that‚Äôs entirely okay and is not synonymous to being unhealthy either (not to mention the science to prove otherwise just isn‚Äôt there). If you naturally lose weight in the process, sure.

Most people with restrictive EDs say they have developed binge eating when they are actually experiencing extreme hunger and end up at a higher BMI than they are psychologically comfortable with. I‚Äôm not saying you don‚Äôt have BED, but I think it‚Äôs worth reflecting on if you binge to self soothe/ distract from emotional triggers or due to restriction (oftentimes it‚Äôs due to restriction, whether that‚Äôs mental, physical, or both).

comment,2021-12-29 03:29:04,2021-12-29 03:29:04,fuckeatingdisorders,hqd675y,"I understand set point well, and out of all of the extensive research I have done and throughout the conversations I had with my previous therapist who was also specialized in EDs, I have never once heard of what you‚Äôre talking about. Set point is a range of 5-20 lbs, yes, but it doesn‚Äôt simply change because you are more active and decide to ‚Äúeat in moderation‚Äù (another word for restriction imo), if that were true 94% of diets wouldn‚Äôt fail, nor would individuals gain back all their weight and then some, because they‚Äôd be able to manipulate their set point. Whether or not you intended it as such, you are implying that making physical changes is a ‚Äúlifestyle‚Äù that directly influences your set point and that‚Äôs literally why most of us are in recovery‚Äîbecause we put too much emphasis on our physical bodies and the food we put into it. Set point is affected by many things, from our environment to our physical and psychological well being, but the range is just a safety net, you can‚Äôt just decide you wanna weigh 20 lbs less. And as someone who is extremely active and eats according to my hunger, I don‚Äôt weight less because I go to the gym or work an active job.

I‚Äôm not saying your treatment team is full of shit but treatment centers have a long history of being fatphobic, even in subtle ways, and many do not understand or even accept set point, and if they so accept it they believe it is something that can be manipulated to achieve thinness. So I‚Äôm sorry if I‚Äôm not really impressed with your therapist‚Äôs opinion. Maybe I *did* misinterpret your comment, but I‚Äôm still left feeling like you and your team are excusing restriction and manipulating your body based on set point being within a range and I just think that‚Äôs‚Ä¶ really weird for ED specialists to encourage. Also, saying individuals weigh more because their less active and eat ‚Äúbad‚Äù food *is* fatphobia. Don‚Äôt really know how it‚Äôs not.",,,,Sareeee48,,-1,-5.7080884,-1.8148797
comment,2021-12-29 12:28:05,2021-12-29 12:28:05,fuckeatingdisorders,hqeid0m,"I definitely misinterpreted to an extent, but I still don‚Äôt agree. Your treatment team is *still* insinuating that eating ‚Äúbad‚Äù foods lead to less muscle mass and an overall higher weight‚Äîeven if it‚Äôs within some range‚Äîand that eating ‚ÄúWhole Foods‚Äù (which isn‚Äôt actually a real term or way of eating and extremely vague at best, *most* foods are processed, doesn‚Äôt make the nutritionally inferior) means you will be leaner and weigh less. That is still giving some type of moral value to food, even if you say that‚Äôs not what you‚Äôre doing, because it still feeds into diet culture myths that food is a huge factor in our weight when it isn‚Äôt even on the top of the list, *if* at all. Your scenario feels flawed in that 1) you don‚Äôt know if twin 1 or 2 has a healthy relationship with food based on their body mass or even lifestyle; if eating ‚ÄúWhole Foods‚Äù is only sustainable with money, why are eating disorders, including orthorexic behaviors, so prevalent among young women of all demographics? What makes eating this way healthy and intuitive, when it raises the risk of disordered eating at best and a full blown eating disorder at worse? Because at the end of the day, you don‚Äôt know what each twin‚Äôs relationship with food is. For all you know twin 2 can feel restricted and out of control around the foods twin 1 is comfortable with. This is still an exceptionally idealized version of recovery and ignores all biological drives that cause us to crave sweet foods and the mechanisms that cause us to feel out of control around foods we limit despite really wanting them (it‚Äôs one thing to say you don‚Äôt like sweets, it‚Äôs another to avoid all ‚Äújunk,‚Äù I know that‚Äôs not what you said but that‚Äôs how I view the scenario). 

Also, I‚Äôve got a lotta gripes with the obesity thing. ‚ÄúObesity‚Äù isn‚Äôt caused by poverty forcing poor people to eat fast food/processed food‚Äîif that were true, all poor people would be obese. It‚Äôs *a lot* more complex than that. To start, poverty leads to excessive stress that can cause many chronic health conditions that not only affect fat people (heart disease, for example) but poor people in general, and tend to go untreated specifically for fat folk by a negligent medical industry. The weight stigma that permeates the medical industry prevents fat people from receiving life saving medical procedures and medication in favor of unsustainable weight loss that, again, leads to more weight gain long term; and then there‚Äôs the fact that there are many health conditions that *causes* weight gain as a symptom (think PCOS, diabetes, hypothyroidism, Hashimoto‚Äôs). Fat people die because of the medical industry‚Äôs fatphobic beliefs and unwillingness to treat them accordingly. Studies show that medical professionals actually view fat people as less than and show them far less compassion in their treatment approach. Then there‚Äôs the fact that dieting causes a lot of damage and contributes to the ‚Äúobesity epidemic‚Äù and, yeah, in turn can lead to other health consequences down the road‚Ä¶ but *only* if you don‚Äôt let your body level out and continue to yo-yo diet and weight cycle like this. And we haven‚Äôt even begun to discuss the case of ‚Äúobese‚Äù individuals who are perfectly metabolically healthy, and it‚Äôs more common than people will choose to believe.

I definitely agree that certain things improve our overall health, such as regular exercise (whether that‚Äôs just running errands, cleaning your home, walking or going to the gym) and eating a variety of foods that a lot of people don‚Äôt have access to due to poverty. But I do *not* agree that obesity is a product of poverty and processed food consumption because it entirely shifts the damages of fat phobia away from its source. It‚Äôs not a poverty problem, it‚Äôs a wide spread, *systemic* problem.",,,,Sareeee48,,-1,-6.222468,-1.8048658

I know many of us are struggling with our new bodies, so let‚Äôs take a moment to brag about the things we are capable of now and trash the idea that you somehow need to be in a smaller body to achieve these things.

Here are a few of my own:

1. I am adding 15 lbs a week (5 lbs 3 times a week) to my squat, and about 5-10 lbs a week on every other lift. Back in 2019, my anorexic ass could barely handle any weight on the bar, and despite not eating ‚ÄúcLeAn‚Äù I am making steady progress for the first time in years and it feels amazing.

2. Super simple but‚Ä¶ I can go up my apartment steps without feeling like I‚Äôm gonna faint!

I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily say I‚Äôm ‚Äúproud‚Äù to have any of them (save for the ED but only while I was actively restricting), but for the longest time I did make it an active goal to be this helpless little girl who deserved all the love and attention and to just be coddled; and yeah, it did feel good when people treated me as such. But I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd attribute that to any specific mental illness. 

I think one reason why we feel so ‚Äúproud‚Äù to have an ED is because we are taught that weight loss = good, healthy, morally superior. Many people with EDs deal with dichotomous thinking (also called black and white thinking); if this thing is good, anything outside of it must be bad and vice versa. So it makes sense that restricting, losing weight, and all of the other behaviors and symptoms that accompany EDs will seem ‚Äúright‚Äù to us.

So I initially posted this as a comment, but I feel it‚Äôd make a pretty relevant topic due to the influx of posts to this sub regarding intake. Many people are asking how much they need to eat and often eat too *little*. 

Recovery minimums are going to range anywhere from 2500-3500 based in age, sex and height.

‚Ä¢AFAB individuals younger than 25 between 5‚Äô0‚Äù and 5‚Äô8‚Äù (152.4 to 173 cm) will need a minimum 3000 kcal/day; 25+ individuals will need a minimum of 2500kcal daily. If you are taller, you‚Äôll need a bit more; shorter a bit less.

‚Ä¢For AMAB individuals under 25 between 5‚Äô4‚Äù and 6‚Äô0‚Äù (162.5 and 183 cm), you will need minimum 3500 kcal daily. 25+ individuals will need 3000; once again, if you fall outside of the given heights, accommodate by adding or removing an average of 200kcal.

Keep in mind that these are minimums you will likely naturally fall into after recovery as well according to age, sex and height. I understand that some people claim counting calories in recovery holds them accountable to hit their minimums so I‚Äôm not going to argue that, however don‚Äôt rely too heavily on calorie counting as you progress into recovery. Regardless of whether you choose to go all in or take a slower, ‚Äúmore structured‚Äù approach, the end goal should be to eat without shame, guilt or anxiety.

**These guidelines apply regardless of your weight.** The intake values are confirmed averages for ‚Äúaverage height and weight.‚Äù Most people fall within this range‚Äîalmost everyone will reside within a BMI of 21-30, with the absolute peak being around 27.

Here is an article regarding recovery minimums and why they are the same post recovery as well: https://www.edinstitute.org/orientation-basics/phases-of-recovery-part-four?rq=Phases

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now, we will get into the doubly labeled water method that has documented the above calorie needs in many peer reviewed studies and even influenced the FDA‚Äôs initial 2350-2400 calorie guideline.

DLW is the gold standard method for assessing daily metabolic rate of a living things over a period of time. So, what is the doubly labeled water method, exactly? The DLW technique measures total carbon dioxide production by observing the differential rates of elimination of a bolus dose of the stable isotope tracers, 2H (deuterium) and 18O‚Ä¶ in simpler terms, regular sampling of heavy isotope concentrations in body water, by sampling saliva, urine, or blood,  measure elimination rates of deuterium and oxygen-18 in subject over time. 

The caloric intakes reported are always higher than the ‚Äú2000 caloric guideline‚Äù among those who don‚Äôt restrict. And, interesting enough, non restricted groups were reported to have less body mass as well. Let me be clear, though restriction will always lead to*more* weight gain long term, you don‚Äôt need to lose weight if you happen to be in a larger body; you aren‚Äôt a failed thin person and you are fine just the way you are. 

Here are the studies: https://p302.zlibcdn.com/dtoken/6be0e20b2ca1347ea71e94271858156a (pg 84)

https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/129/10/1765/4721939

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many of you have been being up the fact that many people claim to eat much less than the intakes mentioned above, or that they ‚Äúloosely track‚Äù their loved ones‚Äô intakes (please stop doing that, by the way, it‚Äôs still disordered) and noticed they eat fat less. Many studies have concluded that individuals, *especially* women, tend to underreport because they believe their peers will judge them. Women who are more concerned about their social status, if you will, were reported to underreport their intake by **507 kcal/day**, compared to those who cared less about their ‚Äúsocial desirability.‚Äù

Regarding underreporting of caloric intake: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12495831/

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12372163/

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lastly, I can‚Äôt find the original document anymore (I had posted the link to a comment in this sub last year, though it seems to have been swallowed by the void), but I still feel it‚Äôs very relevant to this discussion. The FDA has been pretty open about the fact that 2000 calories isn‚Äôt enough for both men and women; intially 2350 was the baseline as reported by USDA survey data and doubly labeled water fast experiments, but received a lot of fucking backlash both from the public and medical professionals, mostly rooted in fatphobia, so the reduced the guideline to appease the masses who are more concerned with weight gain over and individuals properly feeding themselves.

&gt;The FDA proposed using a single standard of daily calorie intake--2,350 calories per day, based on USDA survey data. The agency requested public comments on this proposal and on alternative figures: 2,000, 2,300, and 2,400 calories per day.

&gt;Despite the observable fact that 2,350 calories per day is below the average requirements for either men or women obtained from doubly labeled water experiments, most of the people who responded to the comments judged the proposed benchmark too high. Nutrition educators worried that it would encourage overconsumption, be irrelevant to women who consume fewer calories, and permit overstatement of acceptable levels of ""eat less"" nutrients such as saturated fat and sodium.

https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/08/why-does-the-fda-recommend-2-000-calories-per-day/243092/#:~:text=The%20FDA%20proposed%20using%20a,and%202%2C400%20calories%20per%20day.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Remember that you are not going to fall into some clean cut intake, and you‚Äôre going to eat more on some days and less on others. These are not hard numbers you absolutely have to follow, but it‚Äôs important to understand that you still need a lot of food both during recovery and afterwards.

If you have any questions, I‚Äôd love to try and answer them to the best of my ability. If need be, I can always add in more sources. I am also open to having a civil discussion but we are in no way making fatphobic remarks or encouraging restriction. Thanks. ‚ù§Ô∏è

**Edit:** I always hear the same complaint regarding Olwyn that she isn‚Äôt an ED specialist and thus her advice is moot (even though she is a researcher and patient advocate with thirteen years' experience in general practice, chronic gastrointestinal illnesses, allergies and intolerances). But‚Ä¶ neither is Tabitha Farrar, and I‚Äôve yet to see the same argument had about her despite their recovery methods being virtually identical. Both back their claims up with peer reviewed studies and confirmed scientific data‚Äîya absolutely don‚Äôt have to like them or their methods, but you can‚Äôt just deny the science.

Another thing worth addressing: someone pointed out that you should always try to see a professional. Olwyn has never advocated against seeing a professional and neither have I. If you have the luxury of seeing someone, do it. **But not everybody has that**; some aren‚Äôt financially well off, insurance doesn‚Äôt cover treatment, or experiencing weight bias has turned individuals away from professional help. Many of us are forced to recover on our own. Just something to be mindful of.

**Edit 2:** I said I wasn‚Äôt going to tolerate fatphobia, but I‚Äôm still going to loosely address the concern. If you say you can‚Äôt eat these minimums because you will gain weight, well‚Ä¶ y‚Äôall aren‚Äôt gonna wanna hear this, but you need to gain weight. If you were at a higher BMI prior to your ED, you‚Äôre very likely gonna be at a higher weight post recovery. Not going to argue set point with y‚Äôall, but if you‚Äôre constantly having to monitor what and how much you eat to maintain some arbitrary weight, you‚Äôre not recovered. I said what I said. You can‚Äôt continue the same behaviors that kept you sick and call it healthy this time around‚Äîthat‚Äôs not how restriction works, your body gives fuck all about what weight you *want* to be at and it‚Äôs going to act accordingly.

But they aren‚Äôt healthy and you know that. Flaunting the fact that you have remained thin‚Äîoften *very* thin‚Äîis just another way the disorder shows itself.

It‚Äôs honestly really not fair to suggest that I am only using ‚Äúsmall‚Äù studies to make a point, like fuck my knowledge, right? The Doubly labeled water method is known for its extreme accuracy and there are more than just a few small studies on it. It is something the FDA based it‚Äôs initial 2350 calorie guideline from. It has been proven to be more accurate than other methods of determining nutritional and energy needs.

I also want to point out that most ED sources are drenched in outdated, fatphobic rhetoric and of the mindset of ‚Äúrecover, but not too much‚Äù that is harmful to the majority of ED sufferers who either recovery into larger bodies or were never underweight to begin with. They also lack knowledge on overshoot, extreme hunger, fat distribution, etc. so no, I would not like to read anymore clinical guideline textbooks that repeat more of the above aforementioned issues. There is a reason relapse rates are significantly high among ED sufferers, and a large part of that is because treatment often involves maintaining on a caloric amount that simply isn‚Äôt enough to sustain a human body, let alone one in recovery that needs a substantial amount of food.",,,,Sareeee48,,-1,-5.0540304,-2.5994163

post,2022-05-06 18:41:15,2022-05-06 18:41:15,fuckeatingdisorders,uju72b,"I‚Äôm sitting at the airport, finally free to actually make this post! I‚Äôve been wanting to do this for a few days but I‚Äôve been so busy with, well, life. But I digress! I‚Äôve noticed lately that many of us here are struggling with the symptoms that accompany honoring extreme/mental hunger. In turn, I‚Äôve been thinking about all the things that helped me when I was in deep, so I thought it‚Äôs time for yet another list! Let‚Äôs get started:

1. **Heating pads or hot water bottles.** eating so much so frequently made my stomach *crazy* sore and tender, bloated, bubbly, and just overall not very happy. Resting a hot water bottle (I didn‚Äôt have a heating pad) made constantly resting a bit more cozy and helped relieve some tenderness.

2. **Peppermint tea.** *Now, this is going to really depend on the individual as I know some of us used teas as a means to restrict, so be mindful of this tip.* That said, peppermint tea is great for digestion and I really personally loved the cooling sensation it had in my [sore] mouth, throat, and constantly full stomach. If nothing else, it‚Äôs very soothing.

3. **Gas-X, or similar OTC products**. This goes without saying, but early recovery is‚Ä¶ gross af hahah. I was soooo gassy, it was not even funnyyyyy, I‚Äôd literally run my boyfriend out of our bedroom, RIP to that poor man. While Gas-X wasn‚Äôt a cure-all, it did help alleviate some pressure and offer me little physical relief.

4. **Baths.** Honestly, shout out to Epsom salts for being there for me during that first year of recovery when the entire trunk of my body was so sore and swollen from constantly needing to eat. Not only did it help with some of the soreness but it was nice to just relax and take my mind off eating for even *just* 30 minutes. Highly recommend.

5. **Don‚Äôt cover your mirrors.** This one is going to be difficult for some of us, I‚Äôm sure, but hear me out. We know that our EDs are a product of neural pathways we‚Äôve created, which thus lead to a negative response. Removing or covering your mirrors because your recovering body triggers you is simply going to result in a phobia of mirrors that will be difficult to unlearn later on. This is *especially* true if you struggle with Body Dysmorphic Disorder like I do. I made the mistake of not looking in any reflective surface three months in and now, two years into recovery, I cannot bring myself to look at my own reflection without feeling panicked. Do not recommend.

6. **Avoid high fiber foods, and instead focus on easily digested foods like simple carbs and fats.** I mean, if you enjoy fibrous foods, more power to you, however, keep in mind that in the case of early recovery the digestive system has slowed to extract as much nutrients as possible. Fiber is going to lead to bloating, and thus uncomfortable fullness without actually leaving you satisfied, as well as gastrointestinal distress. Of course, you can always add these foods back later! Or if there are certain foods high in fiber that you happen to be craving that‚Äôs absolutely okay, just bear in mind that they *may* contribute to some discomfort‚Ä¶ but recovery is already uncomfortable, so you do you.

7. **keep some snacks by your bed when you go to sleep at night‚Ä¶ or just in general.** Okay, so lots of you have been bringing up waking up in the middle of the night absolutely *ravenous*. If you‚Äôre too exhausted to get up, just keep something high calorie that you can eat when you wake up. And this can apply even during the day, when we‚Äôre prone to take hours-long naps too. ü•∞

8. **If you‚Äôre thinking about food and/or WANTING food, even if you don‚Äôt feel physical hunger, you need to eat.** Mental hunger is there to get us to eat in times of famine, and is even present when we aren‚Äôt in an energy deficit. Have you ever heard the saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt go to the grocery store hungry‚Äù? That‚Äôs mental hunger.

9. **Remember that honoring your hunger means honoring ALL cravings.** Yes, even if ‚ÄúnOtHiNg BuT sUgAr,‚Äù yes even if you‚Äôre not eating ‚Äúfull meals,‚Äù or getting all three macronutrients in the way you (read: your ED) would like. Even if it‚Äôs something so fucking weird that you‚Äôd never even consider it if you weren‚Äôt so god damn nutrient deprived (I was obsessed with Lime tortilla chips in vanilla icecream). Even if you are at a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù weight or higher; only 6% of ED sufferers are underweight‚Äîweight is irrelevant to whether or not you can experience EH. You are valid and worthy of eating how much you want regardless of your weight. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Only 6% of ED sufferers are underweight, and yes, some people *will* end up in a larger body, or were *always* in a larger body. Are they less deserving of  honoring their hunger, of a healthy relationship with their body? If you haven‚Äôt guessed, the resounding answer is **NO**.

If discussing weight in terms of ending up in a fat body makes you uncomfortable, I **highly** encourage you to address that discomfort. Fat people are people too, and deserve to live comfortably in society. Consider the advice you offer here because it can be really fucking harmful for members who *already* have a fear of weight gain; instilling fear with misinformation is inappropriate and, quite frankly, wrong. I‚Äôm seeing way too much if it lately in a recovery sub I‚Äôve worked my ass off to be a safe space for *everyone*, especially people in larger bodies who are *vastly* underrepresented in the ED community. Fucks sake.

It‚Äôs one thing to be *clinically* underweight (which is also a problem in and of itself not because these people fit the clinical diagnosis of underweight, but because they are *overrepresented* and are the most likely to recieve treatment over someone who isn‚Äôt clinically underweight), it‚Äôs another to tell members in larger bodies that they should eat less, than they need to lose weight, that their disordered thoughts are ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù just because they are fat, that they must have binge eating disorder, that they don‚Äôt need to gain weight or honor their hunger.

The ‚Äúnaturally skinny people suffer too‚Äù trope is in itself a fatphobic statement to say to marginalized individuals who have to fight tooth and nail just to exist in their bodies.

For me, I craved *a lot* of things and usually made ‚Äúlow calorie‚Äù versions of the food my family cooked because I sooo wanted to eat what they were eating. I also craved deserts and other sweets like crazy, but never gave into them. Save for occasional planned ‚Äúbinges‚Äù that weren‚Äôt really ‚Äúbinges‚Äù at all, and id double down on behaviors afterwards to accommodate for them. I do have ADHD and now that I‚Äôm recovered I rarely have cravings because I feed myself what I want when I want it as well as eat a varied diet and eat regularly. Which is a problem. In all, food is really boring and trying to figure out what to eat is a chore because I hate cooking and would always opt for the ‚Äúeasier‚Äù meals if given the opportunity.

-wanting food to look perfect definitely resonates with me, but I did reach a point where I was making weird ass food concoctions and didn‚Äôt give a fuck what it looked like after awhile.

-I also do really remember thinking that I could never be able to eat as much as others because I‚Äôd never be truly full. I‚Äôd want more and more and more, which is actually true‚Äîfor a time. You can imagine my head exploding when I learned about extreme/mental hunger. Lol

-I never craved fiber during my active ED and it actually caused a lot of digestive issues. I ate a shit ton of fiber because I was volume eating but it wasn‚Äôt what I was actually craving.

I did *irrationally* upset when my boyfriend would find my food stash and eat some of it too. It‚Äôs like that SpongeBob meme where SpongeBob at Patrick‚Äôs candy bar and Patrick was like ‚Äú**AND NOW IM GOING TO STAVE**‚Äù.

This is actually untrue. Internalized fatphobia is still fatphobia. You can‚Äôt say you are okay with people in larger bodies existing and then say you yourself would find an issue in being fat. Society fetishes thinness to a harmful extent‚Äîthere‚Äôs a reason the dieting and weight loss industry bank $7 billion a year. Systemic fatphobia is a **huge** issue from the fashion industry to the medical industry to employment opportunities. The vast majority of people *are* fatphobic‚Äîincluding myself. The issue when you are unwilling to address that fatphobia and spread harmful, and often false, rhetoric about fat bodies.

I said it in another comment, but the leading environmental factor in the development of eating disorders is the sociocultural idealization of thinness. Yes, EDs also exist outside of fatphobia, but many, especially those in larger bodies, people‚Äôs EDs stem from fatphobia. Mine was partially linked to fatphobia.

2. You need to define obsession (in this case we will use obsess, as obsession is the noun to obsess, and thus a state of being): **ob¬∑sess ‚Ä¢/…ôbÀàses/ verb ‚Ä¢ preoccupy or fill the mind of (someone) continually, intrusively, and to a troubling extent. ‚Ä¢(of a person) be preoccupied with or constantly worrying about something.** By your logic, anyone who has had an ED and works with people with EDs aren‚Äôt recovered‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs not true. Are we to pretend that EDs just don‚Äôt exist? I‚Äôm not hyperfixated on food, my body, or my own recovery [anymore]. I‚Äôm not even hyperfixated on others‚Äô recoveries. Which, in this instance, is what I used to point out recovery accounts that remain in a ‚Äúprocess‚Äù of indefinite recovery to excuse the continuation of engaging with behaviors such as undereating and body checking, and/or compulsive exercise. 

There is a huge difference between wanting to help people when there is so much misinformation about recovery out there and  very little access to treatment for the majority of ED sufferers, and being ‚Äúobsessed‚Äù with my, or others‚Äô, recovery. Do I think y‚Äôall deserve recovery? Absolutely. Am I plagued with intrusive thoughts about y‚Äôall‚Äôs recovery to the point it is affecting my personal life? No. I don‚Äôt even think about my own recovery too much because I have other things that need my attention‚Äîand as a mod, this sub happens to be one of them. Not everyone recovers, and that‚Äôs fine. But knowing all of your *options*, or having a safe space to recover when you *do* want to recover is definitely a concern of mine in this sub.

However, for the sake of this conversation I‚Äôm going to point out that 1) fatphobia isn‚Äôt just a ‚Äúwestern‚Äù problem, and 2) the ‚Äúglobal west‚Äù is vague and problematic at best. The tendency of dividing countries into two groups often leads to the illusion that countries residing in the two groups are of two different kinds; that members within one group have a lot in common, whereas those characteristics are not found in the other group. If that were true, then why, for example, is fatphobia just as big of an issue in Asia (the East) as much as it is in the Americas and Europe? While it may be true that fatphobia may not have permeated your family‚Äôs belief system (and that‚Äôs great!), it‚Äôs anecdotal. Jamaica has an anti-obesity campaign and nine in ten Jamaicans want the government to take action against obesity. There *are* fatptobic ideologies in most countries, even if it‚Äôs not as dominant as it is in the Americas and Europe. Which I never claimed to begin with.

Secondly, yes the beauty standards that you mentioned is absolutely whitewashed. Fatphobia was *literally* created by white people (specifically white men), and it has caused, and continues to cause, real harm to people of color, and especially to the black community *in* the US in particular. It‚Äôs entire origin is to suppress. And considering the global affects white colonialism has had on the world, is it any wonder it‚Äôs presence reaches pretty much world-wide, even if not as pervasive as it is in the white-dominated countries?

Lastly, I never once said *all* EDs are caused by fatphobia. I said the leading *environmental* factor is the sociocultural idealization of thinness. And it is. If you translated that as absolutely no other factor in the development of EDs is a valid one, then again I apologize because that‚Äôs not what I meant nor what I said. The fact is that fatphobia does play a role in the development of many EDs, and not *just* in the western world.",,,,Sareeee48,,-1,-6.466469,-2.4578516

No, it‚Äôs not a result of not eating ‚ÄúbAlAnCeD mEaLs.‚Äù The biological purpose of extreme hunger (scientifically referred to as *post-starvation hyperphagia*) is to restore the body‚Äôs optimal fat to fat free (muscle) mass ratio. You will continue to experience EH until your body has restored 100% fat free mass, which requires your body to achieve more than 100% fat mass (**fun fact:** *this is also why we overshoot*). It has absolutely nothing to do will power, hormones, or ‚Äúswinging from one extreme to another‚Äù, and everything to do with how your body functions and how it responds to a [percieved] famine both during and after.
 
I‚Äôm going to get real with y‚Äôall: the reason the shit I mentioned above is circulating around in this sub, and most especially in other ED subs, is because y‚Äôall are afraid of gaining ‚Äútoo much‚Äù weight and you need to address that internalized fatphobia. **Spoiler**: there is no gaining too much in recovery; your body is smart as fuck and knows how to heal and regulate itself. Whether you‚Äôre all-in or taking a slower approach, you can‚Äôt recover without eating a lot of food, period. You can‚Äôt starve your body for months/years and then expect it to bounce back like nothing ever happened, like you won‚Äôt gain weight, or only gain what you‚Äôre comfortable with while eating what you *think* is enough. You have an eating disorder‚Äîthe entire problem is that *you do not know how to feed yourself*. And you certainly don‚Äôt know how to cope with triggering situations‚Äîif you did, you wouldn‚Äôt immediately jump to restriction and fight tooth and nail to find any excuse to view eating according to hunger as immoral or wrong. So stop trying to find answers to excuse away your *real* hunger. The fact that you‚Äôre trying to dismiss your hunger in itself is a disordered behavior.

Just food for thought (pun entirely intended). Thanks for coming to another episode of Sareeee48 Talks.

**Edit:** this is not an attack on anyone, especially those who are struggling to honor their hunger. That shit is hard. Recovery is hard. But the level of misinformation that I‚Äôve seen being encouraged as of late is really not okay. Remember that the advice you give may have real impacts on the people who read it. If you‚Äôre determined to share your experiences or opinions, that is absolutely okay!

At the end of the day, correlation is not causation.

Especially considering that overshoot is necessary for long term recovery.

I got with a friend who I had had a crush on for nearly 10 years of friendship. While I was stoked to be with someone who got me like nobody else, my behaviors intensified over that first year of our relationship. I was terrified of ever allowing my body to change because what if he found me disgusting and lost all attraction for me? What if he found someone who looked better than me? What if, what if, what if.

Ironically, when I broke down and opened up about my ED, he was super supportive and I don‚Äôt think I would have been able to recover at the time if he wasn‚Äôt so open minded and encouraged me throughout my extreme hunger and weight gain. I am the heaviest I have ever been in my life and my relationship with this individual has improved tenfold‚Äîwhich is the exact opposite of what I had seen, heard, and read about. Obviously not all relationships will turn out like mine, but honestly that‚Äôs the sad part. Everyone deserves that kind of support and to feel loved at any weight. Because if your love can‚Äôt change and adapt with each others‚Äô bodies, then do you *really* fucking love that person? Is it really fucking love if you are willing to throw away an entire relationship because your partner gained fucking weight? Yikes.

**Edit:** I noticed a lot of these posts you mentioned are about women who had these men‚Äôs fucking *children* and they have the audacity to to be upset they don‚Äôt look the same postpartum? I‚Äôd like to see them grow a 5-10 lb fetus inside of their body, stretching their skin, and tearing through their reproductive organs and come out with the same body.

Many nutritional studies are riddled with design errors, their participant pool is often never randomized, and the collected data from these studies are almost always kept private‚Ä¶ basically, most nutritional and weight studies are extremely biased, which is why you will see thousands of contradicting studies about this super food, or why you should avoid that food, this is the best diet to lose weight, but if you do xyz you‚Äôll gain weight, etc. A good example of harmful and fatphobic dietetics practices was released earlier this year, suggesting pretty severe restriction for those who are considered ‚Äúoverweight‚Äù by BMI standards.

Extreme hunger‚Äîscientifically known as *post-starvation hyperphagia*‚Äîhas been documented numerous times, however it contradicts everything we are told regarding CICO and weight gain/loss.

Weight is primarily genetic; hense why 95% of all diets fail and similar percentages of individuals gain back all of the weight back, if not more, within 2-5 years.

It might make you uncomfortable, but that discomfort doesn‚Äôt change the fact that some people are born in larger bodies and that doesn‚Äôt inherently mean they are unhealthy.

If someone with BED gains weight from binging, then they should absolutely not focus on weight loss as a cure for their binging. They should find the reasons behind *why* they binge and work on managing that, which will in turn manage the binging. If weight loss naturally comes from that, that is fine, but it certainly shouldn‚Äôt be something someone fixates on. Consider the fact that many people with a ‚Äúbinging‚Äù problem initially come from restriction as it is, and restriction merely reinforces the urge to binge. Just like any other ED, they still have learn to feed themselves *enough* and listen to their hunger. Weight loss has nothing to do with recovering, it‚Äôs simply a possible byproduct.

As for feeling discomfort in a larger body, that is directly influenced by society, that pushes thinness at all costs and tells us from a very young age that fat is morally inferior. You might say that you wouldn‚Äôt intentionally be mean to fat people, but implying that nobody should want to weigh xxx lbs and weight loss is compatible with recovery is directly causing harm to fat people, especially those struggling with eating disorders. That‚Äôs the thing about fatphobia‚Äîit‚Äôs engrained, and it‚Äôs often so normalized that people don‚Äôt see a problem with it.

Lastly, the reason weight loss is not compatible with recovery is due to the fact that you cannot engage in behaviors that are keeping you sick (specifically a hyperfixation on your appearance that lead to restriction, purging, compulsive movement, etc.) and expect to remain in a healthy place emotionally and physically. Remember that many people develop their ED from dieting, and many others use it as a form of control. Learning to accept yourself wherever your body may land in terms of weight is essential in recovery because you need to learn to trust your body and let go of the pressure to live up to societal beauty standards that often harm us in the long term.",,,,Sareeee48,,-1,-6.0028224,-2.1628265

comment,2023-02-10 19:27:05,2023-02-10 19:27:05,fuckeatingdisorders,j80nfbd,"Fullness is typically a combination of physical fullness *and* satiety, and you often won‚Äôt feel satiety without also feeling physical fullness (not *always* but most of the time, as satiety is a system to tell us our bodies have had enlugh). So like‚Ä¶ during my EH phase, I could eat and eat and eat and still feel that I was physically hungry despite also being physically full. When my EH finally ended I experienced fullness that did not extend to physical discomfort and my brain kinda went ‚Äúthat‚Äôs enough, I don‚Äôt want any more.‚Äù

What defines fullness is a bit situational though. The body cares more about caloric intake over the actual volume of food, which is why low calorie foods can make us ‚Äúfeel‚Äù full while actively remaining hungry. They can also result in uncomfortable fullness not because things like vegetables are actually filling but because they retain water and are usually high in fiber, which causes bloating in large quantities. This bloating is often what is mistaken for fullness. On the other hand, you can eat caloric dense foods that are less volume and achieve satiety a lot easier. For example, my work had a potluck yesterday and I ended up only being able to eat a small plate because the food was so caloric dense and I got full a lot quicker‚Äîin this case, I was both physically full and satiated. When you starve your body, especially over months/years, the body isn‚Äôt going to need fullness cues because, well, it‚Äôs depleted of energy. And it can take several months to over a year to pull oneself out of energy debt.,

I went severalllll years not remembering what fullness felt like, and spent the first year of recovery questioning whether or not I‚Äôd ever experience it again.

I‚Äôm sorry, but who the fuck died and made you the arbiter of what is and isn‚Äôt a meal? If you want banana bread for dinner, then eat the fucking banana bread. Just make sure you‚Äôre actually satisfying your hunger if you do so.

A meal is whatever the fuck you want it to be. Sometimes, a thing of hostess donuts and a latte is a breakfast for me. And nine times out of ten, lunch and/or dinner is a snack platter because I have ADHD and cannot commit to ‚Äúbalanced meals.‚Äù I certainly did not follow the logic behind such a term in my own recovery‚Äîam I less recovered, less healthy, because I ate what and when I wanted rather than sticking to a specific number of carbs, protein, and fats for each meal? Why does it matter if I was satisfied at the end of the day?

Not to mention not everyone has the luxury of meeting whatever the fuck defines a balanced meal, anyway. Health is *also* a privilege for many. Let‚Äôs not ignore these things.

This isn‚Äôt to say that if you want a protein, carb, and fat source with every meal you‚Äôre doing something wrong‚Äîone or the main takeaways of recovery is to eat how you want and learn to listen to your body to the best of your ability. There is no wrong answer as long as you are challenging yourself and learning to listen to your body‚Äôs needs and, yes, even its wants (once more, to the best of your ability).

We need to keep in mind that in early recovery especially, the body tends to lean more towards sugary/carb-heavy foods because they are quickly digested into energy the body *desperately* needs for repairs. And that is *okay*. Again, that doesn‚Äôt mean eating other foods is discouraged (no food source should be outright discouraged, assuming it is safe for you to consume‚Äîi.e., allergies, intolerances, certain health conditions, etc.), but for fuck‚Äôs sake if someone is eating a lot of sugar or carb heavy foods, the last thing they need to hear is ‚ÄúXyz isn‚Äôt a meal. Eat more balanced.‚Äù

The entire point is to unlearn harmful beliefs and ideals regarding food. For many of us, in early recovery at the *very* least, ‚Äúbalance‚Äù is a synonym for restriction and control rather than a form of gentle nutrition.

Additionally, you don‚Äôt really get to decide what someone else‚Äôs body needs‚Äîyou don‚Äôt know what it needs and you shouldn‚Äôt pretend to know more than their own body.

Note that pro-ED content, as per the rule, falls under descriptions of behaviors as well, which is likely why the post was removed. Posts are subject to moderators‚Äô discretion, and while you don‚Äôt have to like it you do have to adhere to *that* rule as well as we all have different viewpoints on what breaks a rule here.

2. We, the only three active mods on this sub, have lives outside of Reddit and do not owe you a response in a given timeframe. We are busy, and yet we do this for free, with zero expectations of acknowledgement outside of basically human decency. If we didn‚Äôt respond when you wanted us to then idk what to tell you other than to be patience and/or shoot us another message in modmail. We have 35k members and growing‚Äîsometimes it takes us several hours, or even days, to see something.

3. You clearly just want to be mad and while you have a right to your feelings, you don‚Äôt actually want a discussion so we will not be engaging in this.

Let me be very clear: **Food is not a reward. Food is not something you EVER have to earn. It is a basic necessity to your survival‚Äîyou are ENTITLED to it, just as you are entitled to the air you breathe.** You are allowed to eat however much you fucking want. Don‚Äôt ever be afraid to demand food. Especially if you are hungry.

The only exception would be if you have any known allergies/intolerances to specific cravings that would harm you, or if you are at risk of refeeding syndrome.

post,2024-08-03 15:16:41,2024-08-03 15:16:41,fuckeatingdisorders,1ej5r31,"There is absolutely no reason to list every single thing you ate in a day. Especially when many of the posters/commenters that are guilty of this are still restricting and are more concerned with seeking validation (usually a ‚Äúyou didn‚Äôt eat too much!‚Äù So they can justify continuing this behavior) than whether or not the contents will trigger other members.

**But why does it break rule 4?**

Because it breeds competition among members, a common behavior among ED sufferers. If one user ate xxxx calories by honoring their extreme hunger or from a reactive eating episode, and saw that another user had, say, two cookies, a few handfuls of granola, a half cup of fat free yogurt and a whole pint of ‚ÄúhEaLtHy‚Äù icecream and is freaking out despite the fact they likely still didn‚Äôt meet their minimums, it could cause the first user to compare themselves to the other‚Äôs intake. Thus it could begin the cycle of feeling guilty or like a failure for eating so much when others are clearly sicker than them (note: they aren‚Äôt, that‚Äôs just the thought process), and may lead to a relapse or further restriction to prove they‚Äôre sick enough.

Is that always the case? No, of course not. But this is **a safe space** and everyone deserves to feel safe here. It is *not* a space to seek validation on your restrictive mindset from members who also need support.

**Note**: I don‚Äôt care that you post about a specific food or that you‚Äôve eaten nothing but oatmeal during extreme hunger‚ÄîI care if you list quantities and possibly calories depending on the context. If you have any questions about this rule, please don‚Äôt hesitate to ask and I‚Äôll try my best to clarify! And if you see posts like the ones mentioned here, for the love of god, *please* report them. I‚Äôm not always monitoring this sub but I do get notifications for reported posts immediately, and there are two other wonderful active mods who will see to them if I don‚Äôt.",,,,Sareeee48,Yall gotta stop posting every damn thing you eat in a day‚Äîit breaks rule 4.,-1,-5.141779,-2.355169

Eating disorder behaviors are so normalized that they often go unnoticed under the guise of ‚Äúhealth.‚Äù One of the biggest risk factors for developing an eating disorder is a history of dieting‚Äîsome studies suggest that people who have dieted are up to 18 times more likely to develop one.

The reality is, we can‚Äôt always tell if someone is struggling with an eating disorder. If we treated all bodies equally‚Äîboth systemically and individually‚Äîthere would likely be far less dieting overall, including in the cases of eating disorders. Access to diagnosis and treatment is a privilege, especially when it comes to receiving the right diagnosis, and even more so for those in larger bodies.

Restriction in any form is harmful when it involves withholding food for reasons unrelated to medical conditions that directly impact health.",,,,Sareeee48,,-1,-6.1606545,-1.6336857
post,2025-03-24 19:44:59,2025-03-24 19:44:59,fuckeatingdisorders,1jizvqo,"I‚Äôm just gonna get straight to the point‚Äîwe have seen way too many posts lately bashing the mods, and frankly, it‚Äôs gotten ridiculous. So let me lay things out clearly‚Äîbecause apparently, some people still don‚Äôt get it.

##1. The rules are non-negotiable.

It doesn‚Äôt matter whether you agree with them or not. The rules are there to keep this community safe and functional. Mods enforce them. Members follow them. If you break the rules, you‚Äôll get a temporary or permanent ban, depending on how severe or repetitive the issue is.

If you‚Äôre confused about a rule or why your content was removed, that‚Äôs fine‚Äî**ask us**. We‚Äôre more than willing to clarify or even reinstate posts/comments when there‚Äôs a genuine misunderstanding. Plenty of users can confirm that reaching out via modmail often leads to a resolution, especially if you‚Äôre willing to edit your post to follow the rules. But if you choose to complain publicly instead of reaching out, that‚Äôs on you.


##2. Moderator discretion applies to everything.

Yes, **everything**. Every post. Every comment. No exceptions. If a mod decides your content isn‚Äôt appropriate, it‚Äôs not staying up. Period. You don‚Äôt have to like it, but that‚Äôs the way it is.

If a post isn‚Äôt approved or re-approved after review, it‚Äôs because we decided it wasn‚Äôt safe or appropriate for the sub. This isn‚Äôt a democracy‚Äîit‚Äôs a community we work hard to manage for free, for your benefit. If that‚Äôs a problem for you? There are countless other subs. No one‚Äôs forcing you to stay here.

We‚Äôre not here to cater to people who just want to stir up drama, promote harmful behavior, or dodge the rules under the guise of ‚Äújust expressing themselves.‚Äù If you actually care about the community and feel a removal was unfair, you‚Äôd contact modmail like a reasonable person. But the ones who skip that and go straight to public whining or harassing us? Yeah, you know who you are.

##3. Public mod-bashing = permanent ban.

Let me be clear: if you make a post or comment complaining about the mods instead of taking it to modmail, you‚Äôre getting permanently banned. No warnings. I‚Äôm done. We‚Äôre done.

The mod team puts in an absurd amount of unpaid time and energy to keep this space safe, and the reward lately has been nonstop harassment, insults, and even threats. It‚Äôs disgusting. You don‚Äôt have to like us, but you will respect the work we do to keep this place from turning into a dumpster fire.

If that‚Äôs too much to ask, then seriously‚Äîgo find a different sub.

This community exists because people work hard to keep it functioning. If you can‚Äôt handle that, maybe the problem isn‚Äôt the mods.

     It seems that almost all the people I‚Äôve talked to on here with anorexia or any ED have that aspect as well, the control piece. It‚Äôs so huge and so unfair. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre struggling with that too. It‚Äôs just how this disorder works. It‚Äôs like how can we control what controls us every single day? 
Do you also find that it‚Äôs competitive? Like a competition against yourself to a certain level? 
     Like I‚Äôm barely able to keep up. And I know it‚Äôs a losing battle but it‚Äôs barely worth it at this point but I do feel that it‚Äôs all I have now.
I‚Äôve lost so much. Friends, family. Peace, trust. 
     I have literally 3 therapists at this point and it‚Äôs so much f***ing work. And I‚Äôve already been through too much trauma. It‚Äôs like my whole identity right now.

As a kid, I deconstructed everything except deviled eggs and soups. Everything. Even pizza. It drove my mother nuts, so I'd get in trouble. That really didn't help me get over it at all. 

I somehow just stopped having ARFID when I hit puberty. It was awesome! And then it came back when I got pregnant and never went away again. Ugh. But it had a good lasting thing.

I do have some issues with body weight, but they're based on the fact that I am heavy and it's hard on my joints and hard to do the things I really want to do. I'm working on that, but my brain is well aware of what's healthy for my frame and height, and that's my goal. That's not anorexia. 

Some foods, I have past trauma with. It's a small enough list, I'm honestly not even trying with those. 

Some foods have textures my brain says are just not food. Trying to eat them is like trying to eat wood chips. My brain has the same reaction to them. I am in therapy and working on that, but it's hard. It's so hard. It's also not anorexia. 

And like most people without an eating disorder, I just don't like some foods because I don't think they taste good. That's absolutely okay and normal.

Grandma had this belief that as long as I ate, and not just dessert, it was fine. She knew if I was forced to eat things, I'd shut down and be unable to eat anything.

comment,2024-11-29 02:57:46,2024-11-29 02:57:46,ARFID,lzi6c6i,"This is super long, and I don't really know how to sum it up. I guess ""don't force particular foods, but encourage trying without any pressure."" 

Helpful for me when I was young would have been my mom not trying to force me to eat things. On top of that, not being sent to the kids' table by myself at 13 (I'm the youngest on all sides) because I wouldn't eat ""like a normal person"" when what I did eat wasn't going to make anyone else not want to eat would have helped. The majority of my family *did not care* what I ate or didn't eat, but my mom seemed to find me embarrassing, and that added stress and shame that made my ARFID worse. Just letting me eat peas, corn, rolls, and mashed potatoes with only butter on them and acting like that was perfectly normal would have been great. 

My son, who is 28 now, will eat anything but cake and asparagus. As soon as he started on solid foods, I introduced a lot of different foods. If he clearly disliked something, I didn't try that food again for months. I just fed him something I knew he did like. As he got old enough to be able to talk to me, I asked him to always try a bite. If he didn't like it, he was allowed to (politely) spit it out. He always knew he had that option, so he was willing to try almost anything. Some, he wouldn't even take a bite of because of the smell. That was fine as long as he told me that's why. We learned to cook things together in different ways to see if he liked them some other way, so he had a lot of control over the food he ate. I think that sense of control is why he is so willing to try new foods and has a huge variety of things he'll eat now. Honestly, he never flat out refused to at least smell something and never refused a single bite if it didn't smell bad to him, but I think I'd have just accepted his no and moved on. There were a lot of things he didn't take a second bite of, but a year or more later, he'd be willing to try again, and he'd often like them. There are so many possible foods, I really didn't care as long as he was getting enough nutrition, but I didn't want him.to be hampered by a restrictive diet like I was. 

He doesn't have ARFID, to be fair, but I know this approach would have helped me a lot. I have texture issues more than anything else, and getting to have control over whether I finished chewing and swallowing it (rather than being punished when I couldn't) would have led to more foods I could eat. I know this because I finally got to do that as an adult, and it did help. My biggest problem now is that I cannot bring myself to try the foods she forced on me. I have too many bad memories attached to those foods. Some of them smell sooooo good, but when I try to eat them, I feel sick and anxious. 

My grandma was totally different from my mom about food. She basically only had a rule that I had to eat something from each category - so one veggie, one meat, one fruit, one dairy. She didn't care what I chose. The only caveat was that if it wasn't what she was making for everyone else and had to be cooked, I had to help cook it - or cook it myself once I was old enough. And meat was expensive, so generally I was going to get a couple of slices of bologna (which was cheap) if I couldn't eat the meat she was already cooking. I think that was totally fair. She shouldn't have had to make something just for me on top of the meal she was making for everyone else once I could cook. She did get in a fight with my mom about this, once. ""All the kids get to choose which cereal they want or what they want in their oatmeal. Why is it different that I let her choose raw peas when everyone else is having cooked carrots?"" Mom's answer was that I needed to eat what everyone else was having. Grandma thought it was dumb to make that rule, since it meant I wouldn't eat at all when I was in the 5th percentile for weight. To her, me eating at all was much more important than what I ate. Grandma, ""so, you'd rather control her than see her healthy? What is wrong with you?"" My hero. :) All my grandparents and great grandparents were super chill about my ARFID. And you know what? I ate a lot more things at their houses - because there was no anxiety attached to food there.",,,,jorwyn,,-1,-2.7597895,-3.1279714

I might have made a comment about it being easy thinking I was being friendly, though.

We have a small locally owned market nearby that only feels produce, meat, and dairy. They have hand written chalkboard signs, the most aesthetically pleasing displays of fruit and veggies, and in season, locally grown stuff that's not spent weeks in shipping. *And* they're the same price as a chain grocery store or less! I love the vibe so much there, that I'm excited about the stuff I buy from them. I only buy a day or two of veggies at a time, so I eat them before the excitement fades. Then, I get to go back and be all excited again! 

I also bought a fridge that's super helpful. It has a middle drawer that pulls out separately from the doors that's for snacks. I clean and put veggies and fruits in there in pretty displays that make me want to actually eat them. Any time i feel snacky, I open that drawer first, and I almost always choose something from in there. I mean, radishes cut to look like roses? Yes! Carrots made into flowers with a bento punch? I can do that. 

It turns out the more pretty or cute I find food, the more willing I am to eat it. This doesn't apply to foods I completely cannot stand, but it works for things I like and things I can tolerate.",,,,jorwyn,,-1,-2.5966809,-2.4327369

From my limited understanding of human physiology though, doesn‚Äôt nutrient absorption start in the small intestine?

Your body can‚Äôt utilize food for energy much less store it as fat while it‚Äôs still physically in chunks - anything that comes back up will not have been absorbed. Doesn‚Äôt make purging even remotely worth it, though. The health consequences far outweigh any potential (some may lose weight, some may maintain, some may gain) weight loss even if 0 calories were metabolized.

As for the whole ‚ÄúI stop purging and gain 10kg‚Äù‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not real weight gain. That‚Äôs severe water retention and edema. Your body has gotten used to existing in a chronic state of dehydration. Vomiting is extremely dehydrating and so when you stop, your body will upregulate production of certain hormones that control your water/salt balance. It‚Äôs doing this in order to hold onto as much of that precious water as possible, because it‚Äôs been lacking. This makes the scale weight go up and you may even notice visible swelling. Also, when you stop purging you‚Äôll weigh more bc of the weight of the food in your digestive tract. Again, not real body weight.

I‚Äôve searched far and wide for a definitive answer on whether any macronutrient (generally, carbohydrate) can actually be absorbed into the bloodstream through the mouth, and I really can‚Äôt find anything clear-cut. So I guess it‚Äôs possible that some minor amount of carbohydrate may be absorbed through the mouth. But the vast majority of macronutrient absorption happens in the small intestine, and whatever amount may be absorbed through the mouth is negligible. Honestly I find it difficult to believe that any meaningful amount of carbohydrate can actually enter the bloodstream through the mouth as most of the reliable sources I‚Äôve read on this make no mention of it‚Ä¶ but I might be wrong lol, I‚Äôm not an expert

This is a very minor thing, but I want to be clear that digestion is not the same thing as absorption. Digestion = breaking down of food into its energy- and nutrient-containing substituents, while absorption = crossing of these molecules from the GI tract into the bloodstream where they can eventually be used for energy. Yes, carbohydrates begin to be broken down into simple sugars in the mouth. Digestion happens all along the upper GI tract.

The caveat is that although I don‚Äôt experience body image *distress*, I still have some degree of body image *distortion* as I see myself as just mildly thin or like, skinny in a way that passes as healthy, rather than severely underweight. Loved ones tell me I look sick and I truly don‚Äôt believe them, because I think that‚Äôs just bc they know about my ED and are worried - strangers never comment on my body or act concerned. 

When I was at a healthier weight I experienced so much distress, and body checking/avoidance behaviours. It doesn‚Äôt bother me like that anymore.

People shouldn‚Äôt be forced into treatment, assuming they have the most basic decision making capacity. Choosing to remain sick isn‚Äôt a bad or wrong choice, even if that choice is a direct result of the ED itself. 

Of course I want recovery for everyone (except maybe myself lol) and that would be the ideal scenario but some ppl aren‚Äôt capable of it at the moment, aren‚Äôt ready, or don‚Äôt want to and *that‚Äôs fine*. Professionals refusing to work with someone who isn‚Äôt willing to recover/go to a higher level of care/sign a contract is unethical and causes more harm. Threatening people into recovery doesn‚Äôt work. 

No one wants to admit it, but oftentimes the ED is serving a function and, as a coping strategy or protective thing, it WORKS. There are downsides, yes, but forcing someone to give up ED behaviours that may be keeping them safe in other ways is cruel. Virtually everyone has harmful and negative coping mechanisms, whether that is alcohol/substances, relationship issues, overeating, isolation, overworking, self harm, whatever.

I will never tell a young person that it‚Äôs ok to not pursue treatment, and ultimately at that age it kind of isn‚Äôt up to you. I am personally not a fan of FBT because I had a negative experience, although I know it can work for some people. I doubt anything you say would convince your parents or team to just say ‚Äúok cool you can not do treatment, have a nice life‚Äù. You‚Äôre young, and chances are you haven‚Äôt had a long, enduring, entrenched illness so your chances of recovering and being able to live a full, happy, free life are better now. I advise you to really take this chance to give treatment your all and get this behind you. 

That being said, it‚Äôs true that although, as a minor, they CAN make you gain weight and normalize your eating habits, only you can make the decision to commit to recovery and do the psychological work needed to truly get better. I can‚Äôt just tell you to do that, your team can‚Äôt make you, and it isn‚Äôt wrong to not want to recover. I‚Äôd argue that not wanting to recover is pretty normal, especially in the earlier years of illness. So, you‚Äôre kind of at a crossroads here. You‚Äôre probably going to have to do treatment of some kind whether you want to or not, but you can choose to get as much as you can out of that and really give it your best shot, or you can half-ass things and get through it without really giving recovery a chance. 

I‚Äôm sorry, I probably should have clarified in my original two comments that my stance on this is more so for adults.

comment,2020-12-07 06:02:01,2020-12-07 06:02:01,EatingDisorders,gex1vn3,"I had EDNOS for about six years and anorexia for one. TW >!I wasn‚Äôt even very underweight clinically- everyone told me I looked great, not sick!< and they were confused as to why I had a diagnosis... until I showed them my labs. 

Keep in mind I‚Äôm 21. My kidneys were failing, creatinine levels super high. Really bad iron deficient anemia, I couldn‚Äôt even walk up a flight of stairs without taking a break. I went to the doctor after exercising because I started feeling chest pain and palpitations all the time and he said I could have gone into cardiac arrest. I had swelling in my legs because my kidneys couldn‚Äôt filter the water and my circulation wasn‚Äôt strong enough to pump all the blood against gravity. My hair was falling out, my eyes had constant dark circles under them. I was freezing all the time and for *seven months* after weight restoration, I had severe night sweats and hot flashes every single night because my metabolism was just so messed up and trying to regulate. My EKG showed how hard my heart was trying to work to keep me alive. I‚Äôve fainted in so many awful places: in the shower, at school, work, doctor‚Äôs office, *almost* while driving on the freeway. I‚Äôve gotten mild concussions and cut my eye from fainting in inconvenient places. You can‚Äôt plan it. And fainting isn‚Äôt fun. My body shakes violently when I wake up and I‚Äôm numb and I can‚Äôt stop crying and it‚Äôs really scary. 

I also have nearly constant UTIs (but that might be from my awful water drinking habits, which is connected to my ED) and the antibiotics cause yeast infections so it‚Äôs a fun back and forth between the two. I was in a wheelchair for three months after being admitted to treatment, even though I didn‚Äôt feel sick or thin enough in any way. 

SLIGHT NSFW >!My reproductive system had shut down. Unfortunately, that also meant no sex because I couldn‚Äôt get lubricated. That was hard, I felt broken as a woman without my period but when it started up again during treatment, there was constant vaginal discharge from trying to catch up.!< I‚Äôve seen people with permanent infertility or *permanent* gastroparesis (paralyzed stomach). My best friend went into cardiac arrest and was barely resuscitated in time, she‚Äôs also had seizures from her ED. 

Mentally? It was *all I could think or talk about.* I didn‚Äôt have a real relationship with my now-husband and that got me into recovery. Everything I thought about lead back to the eating disorder. I couldn‚Äôt study or have any hobbies. *I did not have friends.* None. My whole life was my eating disorder, with my boyfriend on the side. Looking back at last year, even in treatment, everything was a blur because my brain wasn‚Äôt working properly. I don‚Äôt remember so much of what happened because my memory is so bad. My husband (bf at the time) had to hold his arms out *every time* I stood up because I would fall so often. I slept under 6 blankets and still wasn‚Äôt warm. I slept all day. I‚Äôd come home from work and school and just sleep in my free time, not study or have fun or do anything. 

What my husband says about my eating disorder days: hair was falling out, kidneys and heart were failing, bags under my eyes, almost passed out every time I stood up, sleeping all the time, my irritability (I was grumpy all the time), it was all I could think about, I had no friends. That‚Äôs what he took away from this and it was really hard on him, especially trying to keep me alive when my doctor told him I could die. 

I know I‚Äôm not unique and I don‚Äôt even feel like I was ever sick. Like ‚ÄúI could go back and do it again but safely and not have all the bad things happen‚Äù. But that‚Äôs not true, there is no ‚Äúcareful‚Äù with eating disorders. It‚Äôs a slippery slope you have no control over. I really really hope you can get the support you need from this, because you deserve it and I don‚Äôt want anyone to go through the hell of an eating disorder.",,,,sarathedime,,-1,-5.5987606,0.29651007

 I believe the words ‚Äúaddict‚Äù are referring to using the eating disorder itself as an addiction‚Äî a maladaptive coping mechanism, similar to how drugs and alcohol may be used to cope and then become an addiction. I agree that the term ‚Äúfood addiction‚Äù is extremely harmful, but it‚Äôs a little different than referring to the ED itself as a form of addiction. 

I‚Äôm currently researching the neuropsychology of eating disorders (just on an undergrad level, no primary data myself unfortunately) and on many levels it can present with similar behaviors and desires as an addiction. It‚Äôs not exactly the same of course, but it may prove helpful in figuring out how to treat the ED if someone feels their ED is an addiction. I feel mine is a coping mechanism because it dulls emotions and gives me a ‚Äúhigh,‚Äù similar to how drugs/alcohol/other maladaptive coping skills do. Of course, they ARE bad coping mechanisms, and it may feel insensitive to both ED sufferers and those who suffer from addictions to compare the two

But your feelings are so so valid because ‚Äúfood addict‚Äù is literally disgusting. Everyone needs food. There isn‚Äôt a single living thing that doesn‚Äôt require food. It‚Äôs a dumb term, I agree",,,,sarathedime,,-1,-5.4221745,-1.0844111

I usually eat 3 meals a day with lots of snacks, but these meals are often very low calorie/restrictive. The other day I posted about still losing weight despite feeling like I eat a lot and I was advised to increase certain calorie dense foods.

So for the last two days I‚Äôve had *toast* with my usual omelette and fruit for breakfast, and instead of a plate of veggies, fruit, jerky and dip for lunch I made an eggplant wrap with an *actual tortilla* and a cup of frozen mango. I‚Äôve also snacked on some dried fruit and had a chocolate that my grandma sent which I also never would have done. Oh! And I took a bite of the pot pie filling my mother made which I know for a fact was absolutely laden with butter, and in the past I would have vehemently refused to do so (or lied about having done it). 

Do I feel good? No, I‚Äôve actually been pretty nauseous all day, probably because my body isn‚Äôt that used to ‚Äúcarbs‚Äù (I hate referring to wheat products are carbs because hello, fruit and veg are also carbs and carbs aren‚Äôt inherently bad etc etc) since I‚Äôve restricted them for quite some time.

They did it to be kind to me and I deeply appreciate it while disassociating the entire time waiting for this mystery food that they were preparing.

Him being an adult thought I was using figurative language (ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) and told me ""you can't say that, you have to say you don't like it"" and so I started saying I didn't like it because I thought everyone also felt the same as me, that they vomit when they ""don't like it"" but are so strong willed that they ate it anyway.     
But they don't, they never feel sick in the first place.

They can respect our ""restraint"" (some times) but not take no for an answer.   
      
The only times I managed to explain this successfully was if it was in private and way before any food was even made and it took like an hour of talking and them not understanding for a while.

It was pathetic. The rules had nothing to do with my safety and everything to do with a need to control, micro-manage, punish and feel powerful.",,,,ConfidentStrength999,,-1,-6.8602066,1.0400721

So many of the things about treatment really came down to exactly what you said: so someone could feel powerful for a minute.  It's so sickening.

You really couldn't even make up that bead/feather story - the sad excuses for ""therapy"" they presented were awful. I remember one ""therapy"" exercise i had to do was to illustrate in a specific way how big I thought my waist was, and then they showed me the reality! And I got to keep the comparison! (Of course all I ever did with this was use this to body check and see if my waist was as small as when I was in the hospital).

Similar for me - when I was 17 I went to Renfrew and was in the adult building, and it was SO MUCH better. It was still shit, but it wasn't as degrading and condescending and traumatizing as the hospital program.

And I HATED the ""that's the anorexia talking"" thing! They said the same shit at the hospital I was at.  It made me feel even more like I wasn't heard, didn't matter, and didn't have a voice, and of course you know how I coped with those feelings? Anorexia, of course.

So much of treatment for mental illness (esp for children) is straight up abuse and I hope that at some point its recognized as exactly that.",,,,ConfidentStrength999,,-1,-6.8489585,0.9918277

Just like some people can have salt at any level in their diet, a person with extremely high BP would not be able to have salt as it's like poison to their system (let's pretend that BP medication were not an option). 
Anorexia has no drug or medication to cure it, so the danger is that you get too close to the fire and will get burned again. 
Most crucial: have you clearly told your MD that you have AN in your history?  You have to be very clear about this, and very honest. If you've done that, then this doctor is extremely out of line to even suggest that you lose weight.
My guess is that they don't know your history; you have to keep in mind that all doctors *typically* see is problems with obesity. By far, that's the greater concern than being underweight.  They are used to giving people well-intentioned advice to ensure that they don't go overboard on weight gain. Trust me: YOU ARE NOT THAT PERSON! In other words, based on what you said here - you simply are not at all in danger of being overweight to the detriment of your health, but you can be certain that employing weight loss strategies would be playing Russian Roulette - and most likely, the odds would be stacked against you, I'm afraid.

I can see that your wife is not well, and while I am not an MD, I am an adult who has struggled with severe restrictive AN for about 16 years. About 3 years ago, almost, my fam. did an intervention - I was at a gravely low weight, and they were honestly fearful for my life. I myself am not sure how I did not collapse or die. It was like a miracle that I lived, but my only ""good"" factor was that I still ate, even though it was every 2.5-3 days, and I also grew up perfectly healthy with regard to food/etc. My marriage was the cause of the stress that I believe opened the ED path for me. The ""gun"", as they say, was loaded, but my stressful marriage which has been emotionally abusive, was the trigger. In your wife's case, there is something that she is struggling to deal with, and this ED has become a coping tool. (I say ""ED"", but that really needs an MD diagnosis). These things are possible hallmarks of EDs:

* Denial, refusal to see a problem;
* eating strange things, strange combo's, serious extreme flavor methods like vast amounts of salt or pepper, burning foods is not uncommon; for ex, I ate a lot of dark chocolate powder on everything.
* souping food: adding water to foods to make it go further
* overexercise, refusal to take a break day, refusal to miss routine to the point that if someone were to be rushed to the hospital for an accident, the ED'd person would still complete their workout before caring for the person that fell ill. (just an example)
* missing out on all meal opportunities with people
* ritualizing food
* angry, irritable
* no periods  (BUT a period is still possible if people have AN or any ED).
* binge-eating, throwing up are possible (bulimic behaviors)
* insanely angry if someone raises the concern; total denial
* feels they are in jeopardy of being overweight, flabby, or ""still have to get their \[name a body part\] in better shape"".

OP, you are not responsible, nor are your circumstances; this is a MENTAL illness. Likewise, your use of the word ""choosing"" is misguided, with all due respect; she cannot quit this alone, it's bigger than she is. Help is needed.

It's not to control you, but simply because they would be irresponsible to not infer that your living on campus dictates the necessity of food availability. Without a reliable grocery store right near your housing, they cannot presume you'd have access to food. It would be hard for them to explain, if something happened to you, how they ignored your not purchasing a meal plan. 
Also, it's likely required for insurance (insurance that protects the school/liability).

It would be wonderful if you could just have him agree to see an internist who specializes in ED treatment as well, and have them give him a general evaluation. By doing this, it helps to have someone medically trained that can provide actual data to support what they see.
If by some amazing possibility he is NOT diagnosed with one, then no harm, no foul. He's healthy - terrific. But, my senses - all based on your own knowledge and love for him - show me that something is very wrong.
You cannot make or force a person to get help when they have an ED, but you can definitely support them and value them-- and see if you can help them understand how valuable they truly are.

comment,2021-10-23 15:41:21,2021-10-23 15:41:21,EatingDisorders,hhr0qlp,"OP, I truly understand your feelings.
1. I was dx'd at age 30.
2. I could not - for the life of me - attribute how ED was related to any issues of ""control""; I had a beautiful childhood with a wonderful family, faith and all my needs met. No idea why the ED found me...except that my grandma, sister, niece and - to some degree my brother - all have EDs or ED-issues.  My sister and niece were full-on.

While I believe in heredity's role, the truth is, I could not figure out why I am so ""fat-phobic"". I can look at someone who others may criticize as ""overweight"", and see nothing but beauty and grace in them. But - in myself - I simply cannot stand the idea of having to gain weight or becoming ""average"". I will never understand that, after having made it to age 30 and never thinking twice about this matter. (I had no problem ever - unless you count the few times growing up that I wanted to look better in a bikini, or admired some model, or whatnot. It was not an issue, and I would never, ever ""Diet"". I found diets so sad.)

BUT: as it turns out, here I am. 17 years of restrictive anorexia. I have received treatment, and like you, I thought ""what could I learn or understand that I don't ALREADY know? I can write a book on nutrition, proper serving sizes, the idea that ""restriction makes you obsess"", ""secrets keep you sick"" and all the other things we learn in recovery.
Problem is: you've got a real problem.

- You don't want to gain weight, so you restrict all week and BP on the weekends. How is this actually working for you?...it seems like it sucks, from what I'm reading.  
----> So let's say you actually follow the plan of an RD, that you deem ""restrictive"" because they won't let you eat 10 bowls of cereal or whatever you prefer.  How is their role in teaching you to try and eat more often, more reasonably, ANYWHERE as restrictive as you ""restricting all week""?
I don't deny that you have this feeling, and I understand what you feel.  You basically want carte blanche to eat all of anything and everything, and somehow not gain weight, and somehow not feel limited.

There is no such thing. You will either eat all you want, and gain the weight. Or, you will learn to eat reasonably, and eventually ""settle"" at a weight that is right for you*.
*BY ""eat reasonably"" - and I speak from experience - meal plans for recovery can be as high as six-thousand calories. Eventually, that much food will make you feel extremely uncomfortable and to maintain, your body and mind will naturally desire that you stop eating at the amount that is RIGHT for your body.
But, to get to that point, you do have to eat a LOT.  No treatment center is going to put you on a diet when recovering from RAN. If that's what you have. (along with BP.)",,,,houston_veronica,,-1,-5.7175694,-1.0657408

It's still new right now, but like a lot of other negative visuals that can spike your ED thoughts, it's going to be something you will conquer. There isn't always a sunny resolution - ED's are such that we have to deal with 'triggers' for life, because we can't escape food, body image messages, other unhealthy people, and stress, which creates the need to cope.  

It helps to remember that everyone is on a different path. Someone in the world may struggle with their weight in the opposite direction, and for them, these calorie facts are something that help them stay on track. Or maybe not.  But try to keep your eyes physically and mentally on your own needs/plate requirements. EVERYONE is going to be at a different place, and they will talk about it - diets, healthy/unhealthy eating habits, etc.  The best thing you can do is confront this little by little and keep track of all the wins you're having. (""win"" = eating the best way to defy your ED, and to stay strong. Even if you feel a little sad after, you still won. Keep up the great work, OP!!)",,,,houston_veronica,,-1,-5.1281104,-1.7637231

I would recommend reframing your thinking as much as possible; remember how different you both are in size/shape. Even if you both were the same size, her needs would be different from yours depending on factors that I can't begin to list because they all vary. 
If you aren't already, can you check into seeing an RD to help you ensure you are eating enough? maybe hearing from a professional would help solidify your own need to feel ok about eating what is right for you. 
Your own recovery comes first; that is before any other relationship, since life (your own ability to live/thrive) is essential to be in relationships. If she does not understand, there are many resources that help support those in relationships with others who live with EDs. Youtube has a ton of videos, along with NEDA (www.nationaleatingdisorders.org) to help people understand the most common issues surrounding EDs.

Maybe you can advise her that the kitchen is open 24/7 - and tell her that you are happy to let her graze on her own OR, if she prefers, you can prep and serve food instead.  
What I mean is: I myself, as a person recovering from RAN, would rather be able to grab stuff to eat knowing that no one is really observing me. I still struggle with ""eating in front of people is embarrassing"", so knowing that my hostess will go to bed and not feel compelled to sit there while I eat a snack makes me happy. There probably are lots of other points of view, of course, but count me in as another vote for ""ask"" or ""talk to her"".
There are also good things to have on hand that are safe and easy...like:
- cut-up melon or refreshing fruit that she likes (in fridge);
- jar of PB and honey + fresh apples on counter or in reach
- yogurt in fridge
- hard boiled eggs (not everyone loves these, but a lot do) ready to go, etc.

Also, when around her, try not to focus on food, topics of food, what you're planning to make for the holidays, what you take to work to eat...just let it all be dormant in her presence so she isn't struggling IMO. It's so hard b/c food is a big part of every single aspect of life (we know!) - but now is not the time to try and change her patterns of thinking.

A therapist that I find amiable (regardless of what range of directness I may find preferable) would likely be someone I consider talented in their field. Therefore, yes, I would want to do right by them, if that makes sense. (I'm a pleaser, surprise!)
But the thing to remember is:
- EDs that worsen will eventually preclude your mind from thinking properly, so in some sense, therapists are the ones who have to uphold reality.If the T got off to a solid start with the client, the client should ultimately trust their T.  
- Saying ""just eat"" is poor because it reflects a sense of being tired of you/the person with the ED. It just hearkens to a parent trying to tell their kid ""Just behave.""  -- what does ""just eat"" mean?  
1. ""OP, sticking with your meal plan will definitely help you start to see things more clearly. I promise you are not remotely at risk of gaining endless weight, and you know that I promised you I would be honest with you.""
2. ""Let's talk strategies about how you would feel more likely to eat; can you find a person to eat your meals with? When you see them eating normally, it will remind you that eating normally is not equal to weight gain. Watch how they eat - they just do it without thinking. That is our goal for you.  Someday, you will get there and it really will be easy to just...eat.""

^^ Those are comments that I could say are more powerful to ME, but that's just my opinion. 
BTW, anytime people say ""just (anything)"", it's always when there is a herculean task involved.  ""Just go to sleep"" (to an insomniac or a fussy child).  ""Just get off my case."" (when you are super angry and not likely to drop the issue)  ""Just study harder"".

The other thing I can say is that you may want to journal your food intake and try to see what you were feeling as you ate. Trying to eat your food sitting down at the table, no other distractions, and thinking of what your food tastes like...can help. Then, logging how you feel after - are you still hungry, are you full, are you somewhere in between. Then, think of the fact that you are GOING to need to eat again - which means both bingeing and restricting are less powerful IMO. (Bingeing gets powerful because you are doing it mindlessly, not thinking about how you'll feel after - Restricting is super powerful when it comes to obsessing on food, because you are thinking that you may not eat again for a long time.  By realizing that you are promising yourself you can eat again in 4-6 hours - you hopefully take the power away from these two fears.)",,,,houston_veronica,,-1,-4.4647703,-1.4532902

However: I had severe AN for over thirteen years, all after turning thirty y/o. My family did an intervention, and I took the treatment. While I'm not at all free of behaviors, I engaged completely into treatment for the sake of ""at least I can say I've tried"". The great thing is, I gained the weight and did the work, and it was truly lifesaving. Am I fully healed? no, but that is greatly due to the many years it has been so much a part of me. I hate this, but STILL: I am so, so much better than I was. I eat regularly, have a wonderful, chaotically busy FT job, and life is just so much better. I am praying for your sister.

When I received treatment, there is truth to the feeling of being told ""you MUST eat, you are desperately in need of food, there is simply no further you can go"".  The mind sees it as 'permission' to eat. If you leave any wiggle room, such as ""you did good today"" (if they eat a cracker, for example), then their brain will read that as ""you ate enough, in fact you ate too much. Scale back.""

I had untreated AN for the entirety of 13 years before my family intervened formally and I took the help. When I got to the residential setting, there were so many crazy dramatic things happening; people were so far beyond my understanding of 'normal life', and I felt sure that my sheltered mother would hate that I was there...being exposed to 'rough' life. (I was 44 BTW). I would tell my H. that ""if people knew what I'm seeing, what I'm hearing, and how they treat us, they would want me out ASAP.' - Truthfully, that was the ED finding the proverbial 'hair in the soup'. 

No, there is no treatment program that will ever be perfect. Quite a few tech staff at my program were awful to us. I wasn't allowed to rest even when we had 2 hours of sleep only; I wasn't allowed to be happy if staff were upset, as they would just glare and be rude. They would be snippy, rub my face in the fact that I needed to take the supplement (which was in addition to huge meal plan), be sarcastic, pick favorites, and more. 

  
It still was the best option available, however. No other place would take me, and this place - for all its flaws - still made a major impact for the better.  It's the lesser of the greatest evil - no help at all, and eventual death.

Why are the attending staff at Res treatment centers so awful? they are burnt out, sick of ED lying/manipulating, and they themselves may not fully understand how EDs are. In addition, the requisite measures to break down the power of an ED are often necessarily draconian. The tiniest bit of wiggle room will turn into a highway of enabling. Those who are starving cannot make logical decisions that threaten their propensity to starve. Once a person is refed and restored to a livable weight, only then can they start to be trusted to make decisions for themselves.",,,,houston_veronica,,-1,-6.796583,1.1330696

DAILY hard work, until my healthy behaviors felt like the normal ones, and ED behaviors felt like the wrong, shameful actions.

I still don't love my new recovered body shape or weight. But I LOVE the mental freedom...the mental Peace.  I don't freak out about meeting people for dinner, don't get furious that every social event seems to involve food,  no terror at the Holidays...

Tip: stop weighing yourself on the scale,  or at least put farther and farther amounts of time in between weighing,  until you can stop.  Tbh, after a while,  the number on there is no longer ""rewarding"".  Once you settle into your body's choice of weight, It doesn't move one way or the other dramatically anyway.  No reward or punishment there in the scale anymore. 

Tip: Immediately get rid of ALL clothing in your closet that doesn't fit your changing, recovering body.   I went up 3 sizes during Recovery.   NOTHING in your closet or dresser should taunt you, be cruel to you... insist on ED behaviors just so you can fit into them.   I learned to shop at Second Hand Stores and Costco... but this is important here...keep NOTHING that no longer fits your changing body.

In a world screaming Diversity for race, gender, religion , it's about time there is BODY DIVERSITY. 

Keep going.  Always forgive yourself.   And always remember:  a slip is NOT a relapse.   It's hard work relearning how to choose food, eat food, sit in the uncomfortable and then digest food.  Relearn how to cope without ED behaviors...Relearn how to comfort yourself when facing Life's stressors (or other people's comments!)

That being said, no one is going to save you either.  Outside providers (therapists,  dieticians,  etc) are only just tools to help you recover.   You have to want Recovery MORE that wanting what the ED behaviors are giving you.  All of it... whether it's your body shape, clothing sizes, sense of pride or ""specialness""...whatever your addiction is giving you.

You have to get so sick of it you would rather surrender to Recovery,  accept what those changes will do to you physically and mentally/emotionally.  Then at that point you fight like hell.  It's not easy or quick; there's no magic pill.  You have to choose the food, eat the food,  sit in the uncomfortable,  digest the food.  Deal with what that feels like physically and mentally.    You may start out screaming and sweating.  Addictions don't want to let go.   But your slow and steady repeat WILL start to pay off.  You will see the eating and digesting as the normal things until you no longer see the ED behaviors as even being an option. 

You will gain weight.  You will be changing your clothing sizes, and getting rid of ANY clothes that only fit your body with a ED behavior.    You will ditch the scale.   There's nothing but cruel judgment there.  Not needed in Recovery or at all in fact!!

Get ready to fight.  Freedom isn't Free.  But only YOU can do it.  Only you can be the one to choose correct behaviors over ED ones.

I recovered after 35 years into a menopausal body.   The ED addiction WILL take over your life if you let it. It's time to think about if you want to fight now or later, dealing with older skin that doesn't react like you want it to, or other physical problems,  just because you are simply older.   

The body always wins in the end.  It's called aging and death.   Don't spend your life in misery. You don't need to be, or conform, or prove yourself to anyone.   Diversity includes all body shapes too!!  Go fight for your freedom.",,,,Informal-Ad-7356,,-1,-5.5409384,-0.7204055

comment,2024-03-22 14:11:41,2024-03-22 14:11:41,bulimia,kw1qior,"It's because it's a vicious addiction.    I remember this specifically with my eating disorder and with booze when I was abusing that too.   It's not just the food itself.   It's the ritual,  the reasons WHY.  At one point when trying to control my poor sick mind, I wouldn't even binge;  I would just purge nothing at all. 

This is a crippling addiction.   Please consider outside help.  It is not quick or easy. I wish I could tell you the opposite,  but it took me 2 years to Recover from 3 decades long ED.    It's a slow and steady process. 

There are a few ways to recover,  so if one approach doesn't work, change gears and try again.   Even if you don't feel you are recovering ""fast enough "" or ""correctly"", the pure fight against it will bring back your self-respect because you are trying to fight this Beast.    In the last year of my Recovery I was doing it  alone without a team and that was fine because I had the information; the tools.   At the beginning attempts I tried an ED treatment clinic (didn't work at all for my personality)  but then after 2 more dieticians and 2 more therapists...I found a ""team"" that worked with where I was, not just going off some pre-determined chart.   I then moved away from that state to one with poor mental health coverage, so I had to do it alone.    By then I wanted to relapse bad...but I had already had a taste of freedom,  and I found out I wanted freedom MORE than what the ED gave me!!  This was a vital point in my Recovery. Once you taste freedom,  you know there is a different way to live.

Huge tips for me for that successful push:  ditch the cruel scale, or at least put further and further amts of time between weighing until you can ditch the effing scale.    And also while recovering,  get rid of ANY and all clothing that only fits a body using ED behaviors.   And how I started was eating ""safe foods"" and not allowing Purging to be an option...no matter what!   Then increasing safe foods qtys...sitting in the uncomfortable...digest.   repeat.   Then add in moderate scary foods.. sit in the uncomfortable,  digest,  repeat.    Trigger or binge foods came only at the end.   You can only handle so much at a time.  You gotta eat the food. You have to let your body do what it wants to.  Simple but hard...but factual. You have to surrender to the process.  Scream, sweat, Journal...whatever you need to do, move furniture....but eat the food, sit with it, digest the food. 

Remember to always forgive yourself.   A slip is NOT a relapse.   You are relearning a new way to eat, digest, you may get intestinal upset in the beginning...you may have to relearn how to carry a different body on your frame, and how this feels physically and emotionally.    This is not a short or quick process .  One step at a time.

Recovery IS possible.    This can be done.  You may never love your new body, but the freedom is PRICELESS.   Come over to Recovery.   We can eat and digest cookies over here...chocolate without guilt, visiting a restaurant without looking at the menu first, and join our people when socializing; being fully there.  

You could start today.   But it's baby steps and you have to be 100% honest with yourself.   You know what triggers you, you know when you are slipping or cheating.    This is your personal fight.",,,,Informal-Ad-7356,,-1,-5.4572763,-0.66559994

comment,2024-10-20 03:22:52,2024-10-20 03:22:52,bulimia,lssff5c,"Doctors certainly don't know everything.  They receive virtually no training about eating disorders.  I was way UW, hair falling out and went to seek help, and my GP said ""oh, you don't look that bad "".   I had ED for 35 years.  I think I know more about my disorder than any Dr I have come across.   

I recovered into Menopause.   It was not easy or fast.  It took repeated on-purpose actions AGAINST the screaming ED voices.  Slow and steady.   It started out very painful and panicky, but over time with very specific changed behaviors and reactions,  it started to hurt less and less. Repeat every day, every meal. Every snack.    Step by step.

No one wants to hear it, but Recovery takes surrender and then slowly acceptance.  It takes letting the body gain and weigh what it wants to.  I don't exactly love my Recovered body now, but I LOVE my calm quiet mind.   I can have a dessert without major internal anxiety or judgment...and I know I won't change my weight either way.  My number casually floats 3-5 lbs either way, with NO attempt on my part to change it.   And there-in is the Peace....whether I eat the dessert or choose not to, it doesn't matter to my weight or size.   It's a beautiful FREEDOM in letting go.

But it all starts with baby steps, celebrating EVERY small win, getting rid of all clothes that only fit you with ED behaviors..and weaning yourself from the taunting scale.

Recovery is totally Worth it.  Mental freedom is PRICELESS.",,,,Informal-Ad-7356,,-1,-6.2644897,-0.5202871

every time i purge i tell myself it will be the last time, but it never is. i‚Äôve tried going 1 week purge free to then quit on day 1 as the urges are too strong. 

because of all of this, gaining, losing, rapidly losing & rapidly gaining my body is skinny fat. i have a huge stomach that looks like i‚Äôm bloated 24/7, visible collarbones & thin arms. my body is a mess & like i said earlier i have bad excema which is very unattractive. not cute at all.

Seems like the only way I deserve to recover is if my weight & looks show for it, like get super thin & look super unhealthy & sick to then receive the validation and get that first push to really get help. Like if someone tells me and validates me that I look xyz then that means I finally deserve to recover. Does that make sense? Life sucks.

comment,2021-10-02 16:35:10,2021-10-02 16:35:10,fuckeatingdisorders,hf44ton,I definitely agree but with the caveat that at the very beginning of recovery it's probably too much to ask and probably a phrase which is still best avoided. (I remember even having to stop looking at my fitbit resting heart rate because it felt like a failure when it went back into the 'normal' range. Logically I knew that was a good thing but it still made me tempted to do more exercise and eat less). I'm now at the stage where I still kind of want to be sick but am trying to see being health as a positive (which it really really is).,,,,IamNotABaldEagle,,-1,-5.794808,-2.2506425

They're absolutely full of shitty low quality protein, sweeteners instead of real carbs and now I'm no longer massively starving I've realised they mostly taste like shit (although I do still have a soft spot for dark chocolate mint carb crusher because it tastes like a massive after eight mint). Massively inappropriate to be specifically targeting people with eating disorders.

By 57 I‚Äôve gotten used to being the major problem when it comes to meal time. A few months ago when I learned about ARFID it was a relief to know I have an ED. 

I‚Äôve always been the pickiest eater anyone knows. As a kid I learned to bring food for myself any time we went anywhere. I learned to cook at an early age and took over cooking for the family as a preteen including doing menu planning and grocery shopping with mom. I‚Äôm the one who makes other people feel better about their picky eating kids. Typical ‚Äúpicky eaters‚Äù feel so much better after meeting me because they aren‚Äôt ‚Äúthat bad.‚Äù 

Having lived with this for so long I‚Äôve learned how to deal with family, friends, restaurants, bosses, and explaining why I probably won‚Äôt be able to eat food cooked at peoples houses. For many years I had a handy list of safe foods and at the top it stated only specific brands, cooked exactly right so better to let me cook it there or bring to reheat, and a number of other factors so no food was a a given until right before it was time to eat although certain packaged snacks and cheese (unless I was having dairy issues which come and go) were safer than anything cooked. 

The foods I can eat have expanded over the years. Some of my safe foods are the same from childhood. Other safe foods from childhood no longer are safe.

comment,2024-06-13 01:34:51,2024-06-13 01:34:51,ARFID,l8d16vl,"I‚Äôm 57 and have had many years to add things to my safe foods even though I only learned about ARFID this year. It is always interesting to see how different peoples safe foods are. I still think of myself as ‚Äúmost unique super duper pickiest person in the universe‚Äù. I hadn‚Äôt written down a safe food list in many, many years. Sometime in the last week or two I did a safe food list on a thread here and was shocked at how few things had ‚Äúspecific brand, cooked only one exact way, only if I‚Äôm in right mood, changes frequently over a couple hours‚Äù. My safe food list in ~2004 almost every one of the 15-20 items had that next to it. 

I prefer grape tomatoes cut exactly in half to cherry tomatoes as cherry are a little too big for my mouth. I can eat cherry cut into fourths and regular tomatoes if that‚Äôs what‚Äôs available.

Salad is fairly new safe food. It was a rare thing for me to eat until some time in my mid/late 30s. Prior to that I‚Äôd occasionally pick out the tomatoes and cucumbers if they didn‚Äôt have dressing and eat them plain. I had a low blood pressure problem in my mid-20s/early-30s and doctors insisted I eat more salt which is when I forced myself to add salt to things I used to prefer plain. Now I prefer with salt or Italian dressing (able to eat most brands)

I cut all gristle and fat off my steak as well as any meat touching them. So I understand why you don‚Äôt like it. I prefer to get lean cuts and cook on grill or under broiler so less greasy. I‚Äôve been known to pat with paper towels to degrease. LOL

For mashed foods they must be perfectly mashed, no lumps. Same with gravy, no lumps. I don‚Äôt actually like potatoes much but I love my homemade super duper too much garlic mashed potatoes with gravy or sour cream - the potatoes are simply an acceptable delivery for those. Like one thin layer of potatoes and 2x of gravy, eat with spoon. ü§£

One of the cooking tricks that has helped increase the number of safe foods for me is to use tons of seasoning to drown out taste of foods I don‚Äôt care for. I didn‚Äôt realize that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done for most of my life until I heard about ARFID and was reading various ways people use to make an unsafe food safe and a lightbulb went off. In many cases where a recipe calls for a teaspoon of this, a 1/2 teaspoon of that, I multiple each by 4. Recipe calls for 4 garlic cloves I use a head of garlic. I don‚Äôt automatically increase as above. Each time I cook something I increase a little until it smells and taste right. I cook based on smell because I‚Äôm not eating food that is gross and then not able to eat dinner. Plus since I cooked different food for my family than I did for me I had to learn how to know it was right as no way was I getting it anywhere near my mouth. 

Processed food is reliable. Always same shape, texture, smell, taste. Many of us with ARFID are wedded to specific brands or restaurants because it exactly the same every time.

Being able to cook is probably going to help you a lot in increasing your safe foods over time. Especially since you are able to cook foods you won‚Äôt eat. It has for a number of us. 

It can be difficult to say ewwww gross respectfully - your doing a great job of that. I commend you.",,,,TashaT50,,-1,-2.3214345,-2.7625434

Seafood is my main gag/vomit and only junk food snacking for days.

I‚Äôm not sure why my mom didn‚Äôt give up dairy once it was confirmed that was the problem. As soon as solid foods were introduced if I didn‚Äôt like something I refused to eat anything for hours and if they tried to reintroduce it I refused to taste it and refused to eat anything else for hours.

I also have some food sensitivities, not actual allergies, I‚Äôm not going to end up in ER or die, but I‚Äôll end up with painful digestive problems, bloody noses, congestion, migraines for a few days. Not fun.

I love French onion soup with a large piece of bread and melted cheese is optional. I eat the bread and cheese and sip on a little bit of the broth. I never eat the onions. I give them to whoever I‚Äôm dining with. It‚Äôs a texture thing.

I like some tomato soups - imagine, pacific, and sometimes condensed but I have to be in the right mood. I take slightly toasted garlic bread and dip it in the soup. But I‚Äôm rarely in the mood. 

Chicken noodle occasionally. I only eat the noodles not veggies. I used to make this twice a year for Passover and Sukkot (Jewish holidays).

Wonton soup I eat the wontons and a little bit of the broth only at a few Chinese restaurants.

* For many of us our families don‚Äôt accept we have an ED, ARFID, we need to grow up and stop with the picky eating so they make comments or we know from their looks and body language they are unhappy with us for not eating the normal meal like everyone else.

* Many of us are self conscious eating around others after years and years of people commenting on what we do and don‚Äôt eat. We prefer to limit who we eat around as we are ashamed of our limited safe foods 
* Depending on what‚Äôs being served it might be a food that just smelling or looking at triggers our gag reflex so being around it is impossible. For example seafood smells literally make me vomit so being around my family when they are doing lobster for Christmas can be extremely difficult as sometimes I can‚Äôt eat with the house smelling and I‚Äôm trying very hard not to get sick at the table while looking like everything is just fine and people keep asking me what‚Äôs wrong and I can‚Äôt claim a migraine and upset stomach every single Christmas",,,,TashaT50,,-1,-2.868192,-2.4309137

They should have separate section on the changing your eating habits for those who are overweight which is as compassionate as the rest of the book is.

I loathe BMI. It‚Äôs been proven it‚Äôs inaccurate as a measure of someone‚Äôs health. Medical organizations are suggesting a number of [additional factors](https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/press-releases/ama-adopts-new-policy-clarifying-role-bmi-measure-medicine) should be taken into account but doctors are frequently behind on new standards.

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve heard of myplate but taking a quick look this could definitely set me back in making forward progress if I came across this too soon. It was called something else in the 70s-80s.

Avoidant for me includes looks, texture, taste, and smell but I‚Äôm not limited to a color like my food isn‚Äôt beige. Restrictive is more I have no interest in meals, preparing food is too much work so I won‚Äôt bother if I‚Äôm the only one eating, I‚Äôd be happy to get all my nutrition in a pill, eating meals is exhausting. I‚Äôm a snacking grazer so most of the time I get enough calories, and I‚Äôve gotten better over 50+ years of keeping some more nutritious snacks in rotation as well as taking supplements. Over the last few years with a new housemate who helps with shopping and meal prep I‚Äôve gotten better about having two fairly healthy meals a day with yogurts, protein bars, fruit, and cheese, not just junk food for snacking in between meals but I‚Äôm still lacking in veggies

Luckily the aversive is pretty limited:
* Rice which I do sometimes choke on thanks to a car accident 
* All Seafood as well fresh water fish, pretty much anything that grows in water, except rice and cranberries and agar agar powder (vegan gelatin), cause gagging from smell, occasionally vomiting from smell, not being able to eat for up to 6 hours after smelling seafood, and vomiting if I end up eating it because someone thought it‚Äôd be cute to hide it in my food to prove I don‚Äôt actually have issues eating it.

It‚Äôs way better to snack on carrots than chips or candy when looking for that crunch. Even if you didn‚Äôt have ARFID or food sensory issues/restrictions these would be better choices. Like duh. 

Carrots and apples are healthy and each new safe food can lead to more. I‚Äôm excited with you finding an awesome apple to munch on for that crunch craving. Did you know you can sprinkle a little salt on apples to get that salty crunch? If you like nut butter or cheese both go well with apples. I like hard cheddar pre-cut snack pieces or cheese fondue. Nut butter can be done as a dip or spread on each slice. Any of my suggestions might be a sensory issue but I thought I‚Äôd mention them.

Baby carrots are great for dipping or just sprinkle a little salt for that salty crunch craving. If you like yogurt to get more protein you can make a number of dips - onion soup, dill, ranch, etc. If you are having problems getting enough calories daily I love sour cream dip especially Lipton onion soup. Lots of mixes and recipes for veggie dips out there to try. I love wishbone robusto Italian salad dressing so I‚Äôll pour a little in small dipping bowls and dip the carrots in that.

Given you like the hardness of cosmic crisp apples, if you haven‚Äôt tried them yet, you might like red delicious apples - just make sure they feel hard and aren‚Äôt on their final week. As apples age they get mushier so squeeze them when shopping to make sure they feel super hard.

So exciting you found a fruit to love. I‚Äôve been known to do a little dance when I find a new safe food. My youngest niece also taught me to say ‚ÄúI win, I win, I win‚Äù while doing the dance. I‚Äôm in my 50s for context.",,,,TashaT50,,-1,-1.3575883,-2.407774

I had ARFID as soon as I came out of the womb - problems with breast milk, the only soy formula on the market only kinda worked so had to be modified, and the minute I was given solid food I was like ‚Äúnope I don‚Äôt like this not at all‚Äù. If possible try snacking more as I found that helped. Dry cereal works if you can‚Äôt manage anything else. I always kept snacks on me and had a few bites between classes and at my desk at work. Add supplements to help with the vitamin deficiencies. My mom started me on them as a toddler I think. Ask a doctor to do a full blood work up to figure out what supplements you need/where your deficiencies are. If you‚Äôre like many of us and find taking pills difficult try using a straw. 

Try to find a protein drink or meal supplement drink you can tolerate and have 1-2 a day to make up for missed meals. Many people like Fairlife as well as various Ensure options. It‚Äôs not easy finding one that works but it‚Äôll help you feel better. I went through some 5-10 protein drinks and powders before I found one that worked for me. Use a straw as it helps with the taste. Don‚Äôt throw out what you can‚Äôt finish. Put it in the fridge and drink more an hour later. It‚Äôs fine if it takes 3 hours to drink a single bottle. Add extra sugar or a packet of carnation essential chocolate or strawberry to help with the taste and getting more calories. If it‚Äôs too thick dilute it with a little milk. 

I spent up until my 30s underweight, dizzy spells, lightheaded, and bruised. I did have more variety in what I ate than you did but I had most of the same symptoms. Most of those symptoms are gone now as long as I maintain a weight over 150 lb. No idea why the weight requirement but I‚Äôm mostly able to maintain that now.

It‚Äôs entirely possible to increase your safe foods once you get your body used to eating more and at regular times.

comment,2025-06-08 16:37:43,2025-06-08 16:37:43,ARFID,mwoiiia,"I‚Äôm always ordering off the menu. I‚Äôve been doing this since I was under 10 back in the 1970s. It‚Äôs gotten so much easier now that allergies, eating disorders, vegan, vegetarian, fad diets, and religious restrictions have gotten more acceptable. It‚Äôs also much easier now that menus are online so I can figure out what I‚Äôm going to order, make notes in my phone, and am prepared for the rare freeze moments where I‚Äôll show the waitstaff my notes because I‚Äôm tongue tied.

I was a waitress for a few years. The only thing I cared about my customers orders was getting them right. No judgments on the food. 

Tips from 50 years of ordering off menu
* Look at online menus and pick 2-3 options in case they are out of your #1 
* Look at children‚Äôs and lunch menus as those are smaller portions and frequently have fewer ingredients - talk to a manager if waitstaff says no you can‚Äôt order off those and explain your making this request due to food restrictions/smaller appetite for medical reasons. I‚Äôll offer to pay more for the kids menu if I sense this is the issue.
* I find it can be easier to create something new based off of ingredients so instead of asking for menu item X but having them remove 10 things I‚Äôll ask can they make me a grilled chicken with garlic with a side of mashed potatoes with only butter. 
* Write down what you‚Äôve decided to order in a note on your phone so if you have a brain fart you can remember what you decided & can even show it to waitstaff if your having a hard time speaking due to anxiety 
* Don‚Äôt be afraid to ask to talk to the chef if you‚Äôre at a fancy/very expensive restaurant as they are frequently willing to work with you based on your safe food restrictions - calling ahead at a quieter hour (ex. 10-11:30am & 2-5pm on weekdays) as someone else mentioned may be easier 
* Order a drink and an appetizer or drink and dessert if that‚Äôs the only thing on the menu you feel confident eating. I‚Äôm including soda, lemonade, tea, and coffee as drinks no matter the time of day.
* I joke with the waitstaff that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be the complicated order in our party are you ready?‚Äù it ‚Äúdisarms‚Äù anyone I‚Äôm eating with - kinda hard to give me a hard time when I‚Äôm joking and laughing about my food restrictions 
* It‚Äôs ok to request a complete list of all ingredients including all seasonings - just say you‚Äôre sensitive to a lot of ingredients and it‚Äôs easier to see a recipe list than carry around pages of ingredients that your unable to enjoy",,,,TashaT50,,-1,-2.771717,-2.4955802

If it‚Äôs something that can be cooked I will prepare it for others and then end up not eating anything because my body rejects any food after working with that one.

If it‚Äôs a snack or beverage in individual size I‚Äôll pull it out frequently when I first get it and just have it available for snack times. After a month or two it ends up in the pantry where I know it‚Äôs there and gets pulled out occasionally. I try to donate them to the local food pantry months before their expiration date because it‚Äôs obvious I‚Äôm not going to manage it this time.

My experience isn‚Äôt as extreme. After being in a bad accident years ago I‚Äôve been able to eat more foods including a number that were gag foods just thinking about. Something in my brain changed. Not to the extreme where everything taste amazing but I can eat them and over time I get more and more enjoyment doing so. But during times of crisis or high stress my restrictions come back.

I hope this will be encouraging for you. I‚Äôve found when the high stress/crisis lessens it takes very little for my to add the newer safe foods back in. Like simply only having frozen omelette makings for the rest of the family which normally I can‚Äôt eat but just before my most recent stress time I was able to eat it so I gave it a try the other day and I could eat half my normal portion. Sometimes I don‚Äôt even notice I‚Äôve done it. I know that sounds weird like how can you not notice? So I like my eggs a particular way and any bits that aren‚Äôt cooked perfect I slide onto my partner‚Äôs plate. As the situation gets less stressful I just eat what‚Äôs on my plate and only notice when my partner passes his plate to me and I don‚Äôt have anything to put on it. 

You‚Äôve just had a baby and your hormones are all over the place. You‚Äôre stress levels are through the roof. It‚Äôs possible in 18 months when things settle down you‚Äôll find it easier to add a number of the new foods you enjoyed back in. It may take a bit of effort - I‚Äôve sometimes had to do it a few bites at a time over weeks or longer and work my way up to a full portions but I hold in my mind what it tasted like and how I felt eating it before the current crisis and it does come back. But during the stressful time not being able to enjoy those new foods adds to my stress and if I were in your situation I‚Äôd be completely destroyed too.",,,,TashaT50,,-1,-2.8107688,-2.782595

I‚Äôve survived, my safe food list has expanded over the years, it hasn‚Äôt seriously impacted my ability to socialize, eat out, or attend events in years. It can get better. I consider myself fairly recovered during good times but during crisis and times of great stress various of my food restrictions reappear but not as severe as they were. 

My mom started me on cooking with her at 3 - somewhat age appropriate as I grew up. This helped in many ways.
* I got over much of my gag reflex from touching or being around unsafe/gross foods. I wash my hands a lot when cooking and go through many paper towels so I can throw them away as soon as I‚Äôve used them. 
* It increased my ability to eat around most foods I found gross, not all, fish/seafood still had a ‚Äúcannot eat anything for up to 6 hours if I smell it at eating times‚Äù. 
* Having control over cooking and learning to modify recipes expanded my safe foods. More so when I got older than as a minor living at home but even as a kid. I‚Äôd sometimes be distracted and lick my fingers which led to finding recipes I wanted to modify because what we were making was interesting but not to my taste.  Learned doubling and tripling seasonings I liked could increase the chances I‚Äôd eat something which made a huge difference in the number of chicken, pasta, beef, and pork dishes I can eat - instead of having a single dish or brand I could eat 10-20 dishes by my teen years
* My knowledge of recipes made it easier to order off menu in restaurants as I knew what ingredients they had on hand based on the menu and I knew what quick easy dishes they could make with those ingredients 

Important dinners: Check menu beforehand to see if there is anything you can eat. If not eat beforehand hand. If possible have bread, something to drink, if you eat salad or some of the salad vegetables eat those (ask for no dressing). At events I‚Äôve always said the smell of food is making me nauseous and kicking off a headache due to one of my various chronic illnesses but otherwise I‚Äôm fine and no I don‚Äôt have something anyone needs to worry is catching.

You may find cooking in school helps with your ARFID but see about wearing gloves and a mask (keep in mind these may help with ARFID but cause social issues), maybe getting an anti-anxiety med just for that class, sitting down with your parents and the teacher to explain ARFID, your particular issues, and why you may need to walk out of class sometimes. You may want to start trying this at home to see what works for you (gloves, mask) and what doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not going to be easy but it likely will help you in the long run. You can start out at home just sitting in the room close to foods/ingredients you expect will be part of the class. 

How do we not die? Thankfully we live in a modern world and for many of us we have access to our safe foods, meal replacement drinks and bars, and feeding tubes if things get really bad. That said it‚Äôs important to take supplements, expand our safe food list, get regular checkups and blood test, as lack of good nutrition can cause a number health issues some which may not show up until later in life.",,,,TashaT50,,-1,-2.5269408,-2.8486347

Salad: iceberg and romaine lettuce, occasionally I can do baby greens, tomatoes, cucumbers, grated carrots, scallions if sliced super thin

Snacking on raw veggies either sprinkled with salt or with onion soup dip: baby carrots, celery, tomatoes, cucumbers 

Cooked if frozen or fresh nothing canned: corn, corn on the cob, baby carrots, sliced carrots, tomatoes

If minced very thin in soups and sauces: peppers, onions, shallots, leeks, scallions 

Sometimes veggies currently working on: minced peppers & onions in things like omelettes, broccoli stalks NOT florets, the onions in French onion soup and similar (I love the broth but don‚Äôt eat the onions).

This is excellent for your body, irrespective of scale weight. I know we live and die by numbers. On the bar, on a measuring tape, on the leaderboard, on the scale, in MFP.... It's what we do. It's how we are.   
Our bodies are the only thing we ever truly own. Its care is everything. Making it stronger and better able to take on the world, however that happens, is the best thing we can do for ourselves and our family. 

I know it's so hard. I know it. The scale can destroy us for the day/week if it doesn't say what we like. I know this so much. We just have to do all we can to rationalize this and reconcile it in our minds. Logically, we know it doesn't make sense but mental illnesses don't. Fight back anyway.

Your muscles are pulling in water thanks to the microtears in your training/lifting breaking down the tissues and building them up again. That inflammation (this is GOOD inflammation!) weighs something. And it's good. Bone density that will keep you safe if you fall and carry you into your old age weighs something. This is good too.

They always make such a big deal about not finishing their food when there's just scraps left. I'm sure they wouldn't open another can of chili to eat one single spoonful if they were still hungry for one, so why bother leaving a spoonful of it? As if perfection exists.

post,2022-05-24 20:28:17,2022-05-24 20:28:17,fuckeatingdisorders,ux07qv,"From my experience, as someone who has nearly recovered but continues to slip every few weeks and then notices things like these. I still struggled with some if not most of these while eating enough but I now understand where that came from because when restricting it's so much worse.

\- Not knowing what to eat. For real! Normally I either get slight cravings or just kinda eat whatever I have at hand that sounds kinda good. When I'm starving (even when I accidentally delayed a meal for too long while genuinely trying to recover), nothing sounds good even though I desperately want something. Choices get so hard!

\- Liking every food. Although we may convince ourselves we don't like our fear foods, often everything looks appetizing. I was picky as fuck before my ED and whilst I luckily won't be like that ever again, I'm finding out there are foods that taste like shit to me, *especially* the crap I was filling up on during restriction but I also used to hate Biscoff spread as a kid, loved it in the tiny amounts I allowed during anorexia, hate it again now. 

\- Wanting your food to taste perfect

\- Wanting your food to look perfect

\- Food hoarding and getting anxious when you're low on anything

\- Feeling absolutely horrible about any food waste

\- Feeling the strong urge to take and share pictures because of this ethereal thing we call food (even when it looks like shit)

\- Being intensely uncomfortable when other people see you eat

\- Having a huge interest in what other people are eating

\- Thinking other people's portions would never be enough for you, even though you are eating way less on purpose. This ties in with the way many disordered people get super upset when they see other people have starbucks coffee for breakfast or skip it altogether when, although this is not healthy at all, those people are probably not doing it for disordered reasons and probably don't feel like shit. They were just not chronically hungry. 

\- Genuinely craving lots of fiber???? when really chronically hungry???? explains the oatmeal obsession of all the fake recovered influencers and a lot of people who are genuinely recovering. I had it for the longest time in recovery and still ADORE oatmeal but I will eat a different breakfast and just go on with my day. I used to feel anxiety at not eating oatmeal in the mornings during quasi even when the other breakfast I planned didn't scare me by itself. it also explains the way some of us in the depths of our ED's weren't lying when we claimed to genuinely love salads. I only started craving little to no vegetables when I was solidly into recovery. Guess it has something to do with never ever being satiated, so at least we try to be super full as a sad substitute.

\- Strangely enough: feeling the need to eat less the next meal or day

of course the obvious, but I'll note some of them down for a reminder: 

\- Loss of interest, concentration, emotion and creativity *for those who genuinely think they are no one without their ED. even if you have depression or other issues, I promise your ED is the main reason nothing matters to you rn. you can spontaneously develop interests in a nourished body* 

\- Thinking about food

\- Watching a lot of food videos

\- Being upset when someone takes a little bit of your food 

\- Not wanting to be around others; isolating yourself",,,,myceliumfriend,Mental ED symptoms that are at least partly linked to being (chronically) hungry,-1,-5.1372123,-1.4983319

If you needed breakfast every morning, you will probably be hungry in the morning for the rest of your life because you are a breakfast person. I also think everyone with past disordered eating should continue having breakfast because it may lead to a slippery slope otherwise. However, you will wake up not starving!! I know you're going through EH and it absolutely passes. A video I recommend is by Hat Did Beat This ""Recovered Hat reacts to extreme hunger"" where she reacts to her own video about her EH.

It says that anything lower is dangerous, which most people disregard, but what they don't disregard is the myth that you can literally gain weight while eating lower than that because of 'starvation mode'. (Metabolic adaptation does exist and it's dangerous but it does not result in packing on the pounds because you starved yourself eating 1100 calories instead of 1400) So basically, for many people with eating disorders it started off as the most effective way to lose weight in their minds.",,,,myceliumfriend,,-1,-4.9410863,-2.6355288

one time my sister told me i had a 'pretty day'. i did feel kinda cute in mirrors that day bc my face had color and was relaxed instead of anxious and dull. yet i also felt ugly and bloated as hell from eating lots those days. it's one of the best appearance compliments i ever got because it proved to me that i really do look better when i'm fed.",,,,myceliumfriend,,-1,-4.498617,-1.6283134

i'm not a half a cup of oats, 2 slices of bread kinda person. i don't think i'll ever be. healthy for me isn't instagrammable. it's double servings and other people's leftovers. i want a life where i'm not thinking about this. i've seen the light at the end of the tunnel once so it must be possible.",,,,myceliumfriend,,-1,-5.09267,-1.9481516

>- Speaking of boys, I noticed that when I started taking care of myself, my entire energy changed. More boys are talking to me and flirting with me. During anorexia, I separated myself from everyone, and nobody ever noticed me. Now that I am becoming much healthier, I am making more friends, and talking to more boys.

I wanna zoom in on this because I've thought about it a lot. This has been super challenging to me. I was at my worst during lockdown so sometimes I think that's why no one was into me... but then I remember that I spend another 1-2 miserable years in quasi after the strict lockdown. After I went all-in, suddenly men became interested in me, to the point where it overwhelmed me. With my long history of quasi and at a non-critical weight, I actually didn't have much edema and went through hypermetabolism first thing, so I got all the benefits quickly; I saw the results of repair within weeks and felt them within days. 

It was actually troubling for a while, because my body image was problematic and I still have this twisted idea that I could only be attractive if I'm as skinny as possible. The sexual/romantic attention caught me off guard because I was barely expanding the tiny world my ED had me living in. I could hardly hold a conversation because I had no idea what I liked and wasn't up to date with anything I had previously loved.

Within the framework of ""the body attracts and the soul keeps them there"", recovery is the solution to BOTH. That's not to mention the fact that personality also attracts. Your healthier self is more attractive, and when you're mentally no longer a zombie, you can actually build connection.

I'm nowhere near recovered (because I relapsed. All-in got me nearly fully recovered within months after years of struggling) but so much better than I was. Last week, I reminded the guy I'm seeing that I hadn't tasted his dessert yet. I've thought about him like 10 times more than about food in the past week. It gets better.",,,,myceliumfriend,,-1,-6.5590463,-0.37661457
comment,2024-01-12 07:26:59,2024-01-12 07:26:59,fuckeatingdisorders,khhkjwt,">I am talking about 4-6 times a DAY.

This isn't even gross to me, it's so satisfying!!!

>No matter HOW MUCH protein, fats, or perfect 'macros' are in a meal to make a normal person feel satiated, my stomach feels empty. For example, before I had anorexia, I would always enjoy a lovely bowl of oatmeal with protein powder, yogurt, fruits, and peanut butter. That would hold me over for HOURS. However, as I went through ana and decided to recover by honoring ALL of my extreme hunger, that bowl of oatmeal does me no justice. Even if I double or triple the servings, I still feel like a black hole.

Actually thank you so much for saying this. Right before opening Reddit I went through a sudden bout of EH and was panicking. I ate pretty much that perfect oatmeal bowl you described and then another apple and I still felt like I hadn't eaten in ages. Then more snacks. Desperately tried to find the perfect macros, because y'know, according to diet culture, I just need to eat an entire chicken to be full and support my mooscles. Waited. Felt like the food had been teleported into the void. Guilt set in. Now I've been reminded of the benefits of honoring that hunger! Thank you.",,,,myceliumfriend,,-1,-3.8795798,-1.6456175

Bulimia for me came after I disliked the weight gain after doctor and parents told me that I got to skinny. Its at this point sort of a hobby, which is bad. But as we say in Dutch, if you cant as it must, it must as you can - if that makes any sense ;). You can get some control of bulimia by planning your b/p.

Think about what goes into an elaborate soup, you may have a list of a dozen ingredients or more which on paper as a recipe may seem daunting like you'd need to buy out half the store just to make it, yet when you've got the actual finished product in front of you, it's like... is that it?

The struggle is painfully real, and it was the primary factor in me developing my ED. My first boyfriend ever was suuuuper into porn. We'd watch it together and he'd ask me if my butt had ever looked like the actors, if my hair had always been the way it was, etc. Comparing me to all these impossibly beautiful, submissive women. 

We'd be in the same room, sitting not 4ft apart and he'd be watching cam girls while half-heartedly talking to me. When I caught him, he started hiding and lying about it, and eventually even intended to cheat on my with some other guy (he was bisexual). 

The sad part wasn't even his addiction to it. It was the fact that he was hiding it from me. Like, you can't trust or have a healthy relationship with someone who lies to you.

His indiscretions definitely led to me restricting and b/ping full stop. I was so tired of him comparing me, so tired of him watching other girls on the street and expecting our sex to be constantly evolving to be closer to porn... that I finally just went online to find a diet and dove completely into the proana community. It was so hurtful and I felt so trapped.

Eventually I realized he was never going to change without therapy (to which he would not go) so I dumped his ass. But it's taken me like 8 years to finally understand that people's interest in porn over reality isn't about me.

SORRY I JUST DUMPED ALL THIS HERE I have a lot of feelings about EDs and porn. üòî",,,,lacroixlite,,-1,-6.0121126,0.70567214
comment,2021-02-25 23:38:01,2021-02-25 23:38:01,bulimia,gorp23l,"EDIT: oh my god this is so long. Please don't take this the wrong way, I honestly just have a lot of feelings about the way porn relates to EDs. Feel free to delete or ignore this if it's unhelpful! Though I do hope it helps!

First I want to say that I 100% relate. I just made another comment about my ex's porn obsession and it was agony. So you're so not alone, queenie. I feel you. We all feel you, for real.

The thing is (and I hope this is helpful for you because you do NOT deserve to suffer or have your self-worth debased),  porn isn't actually the issue. It's the replacement of real intimacy with quick, physical pleasure. Anyone, male or female, who would rather look at porn or who wishes YOU were more like a pornstar, cannot have a healthy relationship with you because they don't want one. 

I repeat: The problem is NOT YOU.

The problem is fear of intimacy and an insecure attachment style. People look to porn because they don't want to risk investing in what is real. They don't want to get hurt, and denying their partner for something that is predictable and cannot hurt them (like porn) gives them the boost that they need to feel better about themselves. Porn will never abandon them, reject them, or find someone new. They can control porn. What they can't control is you.

I don't mean to invalidate your feelings, because they're totally valid. But I get the feeling that you blame yourself for not being attractive to your partners - even the ugly ones, lol. When the truth is, queen, that you could be a model and your partners would still look elsewhere because they have an insecure attachment to real people.

I was at a seminar yesterday about this, and the speaker reiterated the fact that those without healthy attachment are bound to treat us like shit. And it sounds to me like you were treated like shit. I could be totally wrong and if I am, please correct me. But the men who were in your life were not looking for a real relationship. They don't know how to have one.

Again, your experiences are valid and I know how you feel. This might not help at all, but I at least want to reassure you that *not all men are like this*. I've seen friends find healthy relationships after experiences like this and it *is* possible. But you have to stop hating yourself for not being perfect. Anyone who's asking for perfection is asking for the impossible, and trust me when I say that you don't want that.

I'm sorry if this is too long or if I've overstepped boundaries. I just remember SO vividly how I felt about porn in my relationships AND outside of them, and it hurt really deeply. 

I don't want you to hurt, queen. ‚ù§Ô∏è You deserve better.",,,,lacroixlite,,-1,-6.0515003,0.727928

It hurts when they say something and you almost instantaneously  brace yourself for whatever cruel thing they may throw at you next.

And that's called verbal/emotional abuse, queen. There's no other way around it. If it's a repeated  pattern that you've seen over and over, that pattern is called abuse. They won't do it in front of your friends usually, and they'll find subtle ways to punish you in public ‚Äî but it's still abuse.

I'm not trying to tell you to call the cops on yohr Mom, I just want you to know that (a) it is not okay how she treats you, (b) there IS help and a way out, and ( c ) what you're feeling is completely valid; you are not alone and it's 100% okay to cry.

Your situation really blows. Really. I'm sorry you're having a rough go with your mom - especially while you're at a clinic. Again, it sounds like the combination of emotional and verbal abuse from her - which is all just used to put you down. Continuing to compare you to other, possibly thinner (cough sicker cough)
girls while you're all there for *treatment?* That's wrong. It's wrong and it put you in tears. And you deserve so much better than this. üíñ

If you get the opportunity while you're there, please reach out to a counsellor, therapist or group facilitator. The psych doctors tend not to be very helpful for dealing with the feelings you're experiencing, but I've had some very positive and heartwarming talks with, say, the art therapist and group counsellor who were on my unit. Even some of the other patients and nurses can lend an empathetic ear. You're not alone, queen. I swear.

Worst case scenario you have us. ü§°

Also: if you feel comfortable doing so... please mention your mother, the things she says, and how she makes you feel. Tell a therapist, a caseworker, another girl at the clinic... Anyone. tell anyone that you feel you can trust. 

Because no one should be made to feel like they aren't good enough. And you are, sweetie. You are *so* good enough.

it's hard. but it gets better. if you look for the best parts of you - the parts of you that you believe being thin will bring out in you - you'll find that they're there already, and were all along.

However: recovery *is* possible. I‚Äôm 1 month and 25 days ‚Äúclean‚Äù from mine, and life could not be more beautiful. It‚Äôs such a relief to not have all the twisted thinking that goes along with an ED in my head anymore. I see people normally (not as thinspo), see my body normally, and all in all‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just great.

If you want to recovery, please try. Before my ED recovery I‚Äôd had it for 9 years. That‚Äôs 9 years I will never get back. Please don‚Äôt give up on yourself though. No matter how long it takes‚Ä¶ reach for that happy ending. You‚Äôre so worth it.",,,,lacroixlite,,-1,-6.465521,1.0856843

You matter. If I were there I‚Äôd make you some soup. Even one spoonful would be enough. 

I say this as someone whose family couldn‚Äôt care less about what happens to me. It isn‚Äôt wrong to expect or even want a favorable response even if you‚Äôre not willing to recover. You don‚Äôt have to be eating or to be well to expect others to WANT you to eat. You shouldn‚Äôt have to *earn* empathy and compassion with any kind of action on your part. It‚Äôs *implict* that the people who claim to love us express that in observable ways. 

And even if you DID want their attention just for the sake of it? Who *gives* a fuck? Human beings need attention. It isn‚Äôt a goddamn crime to want the people we care about to pay us notice. The postmodern aversion to ‚Äúwanting attention‚Äù is fucking absurd and based in a scarcity mindset: ‚Äú*I* don‚Äôt get any attention and I don‚Äôt expect any so you shouldn‚Äôt either!!‚Äù Like, please.

To prove the point, in my case, it isn‚Äôt even just anorexia. I was in the ER a few months ago for unrelated issues and not a single member of my immediate family blinked twice. 

It‚Äôs not you. You‚Äôre not wrong. You deserve better.

But the fact that you aren‚Äôt getting the love and concern you deserve doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt deserve it. It only means that your circumstances suck and that it has nothing to do with you. The ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt want to push you or fight you‚Äù excuse only goes so far. Maybe they don‚Äôt want a conflict, but that‚Äôs still about them and not you. It means they‚Äôre unable to cope with the emotional consequences of forcing somebody to do something that‚Äôs good for them.

So fuck em. You matter and you don‚Äôt need them to believe it for it to be true.

Take care of yourself. I care. I want you to live. I‚Äôm not gonna force you to recover, but please don‚Äôt die at the very least.",,,,lacroixlite,,-1,-6.836767,-0.4259209

My mom has struggled with ED her whole life and that kinda pushed me into that direction as well with her comments towards me and about herself, being weird about food and glorifying underweight models. She regrets it now seeing how bad I am going through it. But body dysmorphia and mental instability is hard to deal with and I can‚Äôt blame her for it. As I got older my bulimia got worse and multiple times daily sometimes every meal. I want to get help and change but it‚Äôs very hard because binging and purging is an eating disorder and a coping mechanism for me and I‚Äôm almost scared to lose it. And it fuels it when people tell me I look like I‚Äôm losing weight‚Ä¶ (maybe this is part of the reason they tell you not to say that anymore lol) had times of just plain old not eating as well. On the other side of the toilet (lol) I‚Äôm a barber, a musician, I ride horses and barrel race, I go to the river every weekend, and honestly enjoy my life with my boyfriend and dog. My boyfriend actually knows About my bulimia. He didn‚Äôt for awhile and then he heard me doing it. He tried to push me to get help for a long time then realized it needs to be my decision.

There was so much grief from childhood  and adult trauma(s)  I hadn't processed despite years in therapy.  I kept getting injured (thanks to overexercising) and the self hatred was at an all time high.  A bad sports injury forced me to rest (along with COVID lockdown) and that's when the shit got real.  I couldn't run or starve or purge the pain away.  I finally broke and that's when the healing began.  So I truly believe it's never too late to heal.  Life on the other side of bulimia may be so amazing for you, but you'll never know if you aren't here anymore.

I started down the road at 14, lost a ton of weight after sexual abuse by a neighbor, got some therapy (not good stuff though as this was back in the early 80's ), and put enough back on to look ""healthy"" and then when stresses would hit my life (abusive ex husband, death of a parent, etc) , I'd lose weight again and start the shame and self hatred spiral.  I don't think I ever really uncovered the pain, grief and trauma that led to my ED in the first place, UNTIL the pandemic. The gym shut down, I got injured, I gained a few pounds, I got a bone density scan (osteoporosis) and had to sit in the rubble of the pain destruction I'd never deal with.    The self loathing and hatred I still felt towards this body of mine was still there.  Just buried away.  Now I'm really trying to work through it, I'm 53 and this (as you know) has occupied my way of thinking for so long that it's become part of the lens that I view the world through.   Loving ourselves is so damn hard, no matter the size.  I just wanted you to know that you are not alone.  I'm not overweight but I still hate myself.  Working on it though and each time I cry I think ""well another layer of this grief is releasing"" and it seems like that is a good thing.  I'm sending you support on your journey.

My therapist had me do an exercise called  ""The worst day with my ED"".  I wrote about a day that I felt was one of my worst.  For some reason it helped to write it down and then share it with my therapist.   I felt such shame but as I read it aloud I also felt this overwhelming compassion towards myself.

i always thought that a man having an ED would be more difficult due to the stigma around men's mental health in general.


>In what ways would you like to be more feminine? If you could take that part back what the ED stole from you, that could help bounce those other feelings you‚Äôve mentioned.

i've always looked a bit more masculine compared to my female relatives, and my ED really highlighted those features, especially in my face; darker brows, more body hair, and a sharper jawline makes me look like a guy, it's weird.

haha no, i think that being underweight has made my jawline look much sharper because of lower body fat. but maybe i've always had a sharp jawline lol. i've also grown lanugo *everywhere*, especially around my jaws and the sides of my neck, so that adds to the more masculine look. it makes me feel so much less of a woman.

I guess it makes me look more child-like than the mature adult I should be. At least I can still grow facial hair to make me look older. But when I shave I look like a teen lol.

i understand. i think EDs make us all look a bit child-like because it stunts growth. how old are you? of course you don't have to share that, but i genuinely think i don't know any adult men that have anorexia, or at least share that they do.",,,,_-ollie,,-1,-6.233219,-0.7318435

well, perhaps? to be honest, i haven't thought of it until i replied to your comment. i do shave some of the darker hair, but not the fine/light hair. and yes, it does grow back. it's not that bad though, it's easier to shave it than wax it off.

i understand what you mean. weight gain doesn't mean you're recovered. i don't always want to lose more weight, but i'm also terrified to gain weight. it's okay if you're not satisfied with yourself right now, things take time.

i always wondered if the thoughts about weight gain and food ever go away. if they don't, then maybe that's why many ""recovery influences"" on social media go from anorexia to orthorexia; maybe their thoughts don't go away, they just find a new outlet for it. i'm not saying that people don't ever recover, but there's a large amount of people who develop orthorexia after having a different type of ED.",,,,_-ollie,,-1,-6.044154,-0.6987642

mentioning binging and purging in example!!!!
Couldn‚Äôt find many examples but one person was talking about how they had binged and physically couldn‚Äôt purge it. One person in the comment mentioned they didn‚Äôt want to encourage it but recommended a drink that would help them throw up. 

I completely understand that the OP felt terrible and the comment wanted to help them to feel better but I feel like some stuff can come of as triggering to someone stumbling across it or the OP(s). I think that you can relate to whoever you want, express however you want but not to forget that telling someone ‚Äúsame‚Äù versus saying ‚ÄúI did this to make myself throw up‚Äù is two different things.

Definitely don‚Äôt think that it is (most) peoples intention when entering this group. I don‚Äôt think anyone, except a evil person, would want someone to continue to suffer a awful disease like bulimia, but as someone who‚Äôs been through recovery it‚Äôs obvious that the ED doesn‚Äôt make you think the most logical. Doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs right to promote bulimia ofc. I understand that this group is a bit confused (the two points/two types of people who‚Äôve joined the community).

I think it‚Äôs pretty clear that no one should encourage an eating disorder. There‚Äôs a clear difference between venting and encouraging an eating disorder. I myself this week removed myself from this group because it actually made me feel like I wanted to become bulimic again. Doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs their fault, people have to be able to learn their triggers. I usually recommend venting but not reading through posts if you know you cannot handle it.

ps. no need to argue about promia or ana websites but the description of this group is literally ‚Äúpro recovery‚Äù which means no pro bulimia or pro anorexia or pro anything.

The first months were terrible to be honest, as you said, I was bloated too and had the constant fear that I would just gain a pound or two. Since I had slipped into two different disorders at different points of time it was a bit of a struggle not restricting or not to overindulge. I felt like was thinking even more about what to eat or not, how I looked etc aka more fixated on everything. I just tried to tell myself ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to become the statistic of those who don‚Äôt make it‚Äù and just fought the urge. (Fighting the urge is hard, don‚Äôt get discouraged if you do relapse, just continue trying to recover despite the setbacks).

As the months went by and I just tried to recover (I can‚Äôt remember at which month) I suddenly didn‚Äôt wake up every morning thinking about what foods. For me, I was constantly thinking about food (in a negative way) sometimes even dream about it, but after a while it kind of faded. I think I might have had an easier recovery than some, so I‚Äôm only speaking for myself, but I felt myself going back to the old me. The child me who could eat whatever she wanted without thinking about the content or what I should do before or after consuming it.

About the weight, that probably took me the longest time to come with terms with. When I got to my set point or what was ‚Äúaverage‚Äù for my height, I honestly felt more beautiful at that then when I felt approved by my eating disorder. Not that you should base your value on what other say, but people who didn‚Äôt know I was in recovery told me I looked healthy, that I looked well and happy. Just by taking care of myself and trying to love myself more and more everyday the better it  got.

Try to love yourself despite how you look, feel or do. Also if there‚Äôs anything you would like to know more about, just DM me (:

I look back at the years when my disorder was much worse, and I realize I will never get that time back. it was lost to the disorder. anorexia was more important than anything to me. I was dying at one point and literally couldn't stop the behaviors. I was reading old food diaries I had written and feeling so embarrassed. it's a miracle I did not die. can't believe I did that to myself. I guess I am angry at myself. how could I care so little about myself? anorexia ruined so much, even though at the time, I couldn't see it. the scale was so important to me. wish I had never found that stupid scale. eating disorders hurt every part of you. they destroy you, inside and out.

I cannot go back to treatment. I am losing weight without trying. my body is having trouble absorbing calories and nutrients from food. treatment wouldn't fix me at this point. this is scary and I am obviously upset and angry I didn't treat my eating disorder sooner. I do not want to be losing weight. I hate that I am so sick and underweight, but my body is now damaged. Anorexia nervosa is not a weight loss method. it is not a diet that you start. it is a debilitating mental illness that consumes the lives of the people who have it. people who have anorexia do not want to be suffering like this. we do not want to be in pain like this. it's not a choice.

But there are other complications that are often not discussed or not talked about. These complications are common, but are often not talked about enough. years ago, I didn't even know things like this could happen. Frequent, painful urination is one huge complication of anorexia nervosa. this is the worst complication of anorexia I have ever experienced. It is truly miserable. and I have been to several doctors and they cannot fix it. and it is so painful. anorexia nervosa can cause bladder issues, and nerve damage. There is something called autonomic neuropathy which causes damage to your nervous system, your digestive system and your bladder. Apparently anorexia can lead to this condition for some. anorexia can cause damage to your kidneys and other vital organs. Your immune system becomes weaker when you are anorexic, which means you may get sick more often, and you may not be able to fight off infections and common sicknesses that otherwise healthy people could. for example, I became sick with a common cold once, and it made me so incredibly ill. it was the worst feeling ever. I felt so sick and weak. and I was so relieved when I finally got better from the cold, even though it took forever for my body to feel better. My friend who was anorexic for years, got sick with pneumonia and she died from complications. the anorexia was a contributing factor in her not being able to get better from pneumonia. and she had actually tried to get better throughout her life so many times. she was in treatment for her eating disorder several times. and it makes me sad to think that she got sick and her body couldn't fight it. anorexia nervosa is really serious. and the complications listed here are things you don't want to happen.",,,,Coffeegreysky12,scary side effects from anorexia that don't get talked about much,-1,-6.644606,-0.64671475

I do not necessarily think people who begin to suffer from eating disorders think there is anything forbidden or mysterious about trying to starve themselves to death. even in the beginning. you have to be deeply unhappy in order to do this to yourself. no happy, well adjusted person would develop anorexia. there is no beauty in an eating disorder.",,,,Coffeegreysky12,,-1,-6.58024,-1.0644066

I get that, it's not right. this doesn't mean that severely underweight people with eating disorders have it any easier or that they shouldn't be allowed to talk about their problems from being severely underweight. Just because being an underweight person with an eating disorder is ""less common,"" doesn't mean their problems are not serious or not relatable. I am an underweight person with anorexia. I can only talk about my experience with being underweight, I shouldn't have to censor myself so that I don't hurt the feelings of people who happen to weigh more than I do. it's not about fatphobia, some people are just naturally skinny, and underweight. and we have feelings just like people with eating disorders in larger bodies.",,,,Coffeegreysky12,,-1,-6.5770736,-1.720493

I bet that feels very uncomfortable. but it's also hurtful to underweight people to be insulted for being underweight and be told they just need to ""eat more.""(believe me, it happens)....and being underweight doesn't necessarily mean you automatically get treatment and an easy recovery. first of all, you have to want to recover. being underweight doesn't just cause everyone around you to always treat you kindly and with concern, that's another stereotype that glamourizes being underweight.  It's not a contest about who suffers more, based on how much the person weighs. skinny people suffer. people in larger bodies also suffer. our experiences may not be as typical as the normal weight/ overweight person with the eating disorder. doesn't mean our experiences are less valid. again, it's great to advocate for people with eating disorders in larger bodies because they don't get enough support. but underweight people deserve support as well",,,,Coffeegreysky12,,-1,-6.6312804,-2.0556831

It's a very serious illness. there are different types of eating disorders that affect people at different weights. But no matter what type of eating disorder you have, it ultimately will not do anything positive for you in the long run

An eating disorder will not:

make you happy

make you more confident

make you healthier

make you feel proud of yourself

make you love yourself

make you feel special

make you feel beautiful

An eating disorder will:

cause mental and emotional suffering

cause you to lose your confidence

make you unhealthier

make you afraid

make you unhappy

make other people worry

make you feel ashamed

make you sick

ruin your life

post,2024-07-30 18:49:37,2024-07-30 18:49:37,AnorexiaNervosa,1eg1at9,"I have severe and enduring anorexia. I've suffered from it for 18 years. I never fully recovered. I tried inpatient treatment twice, but it didn't help me. I have autism as well, and the inpatient programs I went to did not take this into consideration at the time. I am experiencing severe medical complications from prolonged malnutrition, like an inability to digest nutrients properly from the food I eat. This is resulting in unintentional weight loss and stomach pain. I also have bladder issues and painful, frequent urination. Due to the embarrassment of the symptoms, I don't want to go to the hospital. These symptoms have been going on for three years and have not resolved. I am on palliative care for my eating disorder. My doctor has told me I could die if I don't turn things around and explained my body can't process the nutrients from food properly because of how long I have starved myself. She said it will take time for me to feel better and that I will have to push myself to eat more, despite the pain I am in. And that's very difficult. Because on days when I am in pain, it's hard to motivate myself to eat more. My parents had a hard time accepting the severity of my illness, and wouldn't take it seriously, until the nurse from palliative care explained it to them. They are very supportive, but I think it makes them sad to talk with me about this. They will take me to my doctors appointments, but don't want to listen to me when I explain to them how bad my pain is. My doctor is trying to get me set up with an online eating disorder program that works with people who have autism and anorexia. I just want the painful medical complications to go away. I try to eat more, but it doesn't make me feel better. My weight won't go up. I can't go through a day without feel pain and exhaustion. I don't want to get worse, but I feel I've been sick for so long, that I may not be able to completely reverse these medical complications. I know this is serious, but I have a fear of change. This fear of change makes me afraid of trying new things, new treatments. Talking to new doctors gives me anxiety. But I know if I do nothing, I will continue to decline. Can anyone relate? Anorexia is such a serious illness. Anyone who is struggling, I advise you to seek help as soon as you become ill. I was very stubborn and refused to listen to the doctors years ago, who told me I needed to treat this right away. I stayed sick for years, and now my behaviors are deeply entrenched and hard to break. Due to being autistic, I also have sensory sensitivities, rigid thinking, and issues with my hunger cues, which are things not typically addressed in anorexia treatment. I think being autistic makes my behaviors more engrained. I don't think recovering is impossible for me, but it is more difficult for me at this point. And that is why I need a treatment program tailored to fit my specific needs. Anorexia is a heartbreaking disorder. No one deserves to suffer with it. I do have a therapist and nutritionist and I hope the online program can offer me some advice about what to do. ",,,,Coffeegreysky12,End stage anorexia,-1,-6.8020897,-0.14280294

post,2024-08-12 21:02:05,2024-08-12 21:02:05,AnorexiaNervosa,1eqp90b,"As someone who has suffered from anorexia for 18 years and has what is called severe and enduring anorexia, I would like to offer my perspective on chronic anorexia and the way it progresses. When I see people who have only been ill for a short time say they wish they were sicker so they feel valid, it makes me sad. When I see people say they want to get worse so someone will care, it makes me sad. So if you have not been ill for years, if your eating disorder has only gone on for a couple of months, a year, two years, if you think no one will take you seriously or care until you lose more weight or become sicker, I am here to tell you that you are not alone. Your pain is real. Your illness is real and you have nothing to prove to anyone. When you find yourself wishing you were worse, or thinking you are not as bad as someone else with anorexia, imagine this. You start wanting to lose weight, for whatever reason. Maybe you are sad. Maybe someone was mean to you. Maybe you went through trauma. Maybe someone made fun of your weight. Maybe you just started restricting your food intake, and you can't really think of a reason why. Whatever the trigger, something clicks in your brain. And the eating disorder is now the most important thing on your mind. You find yourself obsessing over your body, your weight. You lose weight. But you are never happy. So you keep going. The number on the scale will become the most important thing to you. People around you start to notice there is a problem and you aren't acting like yourself. But you ignore their concerns. You start to become emaciated. Your bones become weak. Your heart beats fast. You find yourself thinking about food and worrying about what you will eat. All you can think of is that you want to lose weight. But you don't realize at this point you have a serious problem that is deadly and requires treatment. Anorexia has become your entire world. It offers you predictability and control, in a world where you feel out of control.  But deep down, you know what you are doing isn't healthy. But you believe you aren't that bad yet. You keep going. Losing more weight. You hide your body in layers of clothes, but people keep asking you about your weight loss. You want to be left alone, to continue what you are doing. But people who care can't stop worrying. And they want to help you. Your doctor tells you that you need treatment and that anorexia nervosa has a high death rate. You don't believe you can die yet. But a part of you fears this. Eventually, you get hospitalized and threatened with a feeding tube. You look around at other ed patients. They are all hurting in their own ways. Some people are recovering. Some people are struggling with eating. You wonder why you can't be like the people who are getting better. When you hear doctors telling you to treat this as soon as possible, to listen to the advice they are giving you, you ignore it. Because you want things back the way they were. You want to starve yourself, to lose weight, to see the perfect number on the scale. But eating disorders lie. And no number is a perfect number and no matter how much weight you lose, you will never find the happiness you want. Because an illness like anorexia does not give you happiness. It takes it away. You are not a chronic sufferer yet. You don't stop and consider the consequences yet. Or what will happen to your health in the future. You are so sick that you are in the hospital with people trying to get you to eat more. But it still has not dawned on you how ill you are. Some people with anorexia will never go to the hospital for their eating disorder. But their pain is just as valid.  And they are just as sick as people in the hospital. Some people with anorexia will never have a feeding tube. But they are suffering just like all the rest. Eating disorders affect everyone differently. And eating disorders don't care what you weigh when they cause permanent complications. People die of eating disorders and you often don't realize you are at that critical point, until damage has been done. Years later, you have what is called severe and enduring anorexia, chronic anorexia. You find you are suffering awful and painful medical complications. You are older, and getting better seems difficult. Your behaviors are more entrenched.  You are on palliative care for your eating disorder. Even though you know you are hurting yourself, you find a comfort in your illness. And that is the tricky part. Because to get better, you have to put up with being uncomfortable. You finally feel sick enough, but what did it get you? Your body is declining and your health is worse. You could die. Because all an eating disorder wants is to cause the person suffering and no one deserves to suffer. So if you find yourself feeling not sick enough, I am telling you that when you are in physical pain, a chronic sufferer, you will wish you had listened to people sooner when they told you to treat this earlier. We all all valid. We all deserve support and understanding. We all hurt. And we all deserve to heal, not suffer",,,,Coffeegreysky12,"Things to consider when you feel ""not sick enough.""",-1,-6.66722,-0.5995099

post,2024-09-11 14:53:46,2024-09-11 14:53:46,AnorexiaNervosa,1fec3xc,"Thinking about these awful moments during my eating disorder helps to motivate me to do better, to not get worse. An eating disorder does not just affect the person who has the illness. It will affect everyone around you that cares about you. Even if you think they aren't paying attention, usually, if someone loves you and cares about you, no matter how hard you try to hide it, they are going to eventually notice you not eating/losing weight and say something to you. 

1, One of the saddest moments I can remember is when it was around my birthday and I was severely ill and had lost a lot of weight. And my mom asked me to weigh myself in front of her and then she broke down in tears when she saw how low the number was. So for the rest of the day, all I could think about was her reaction and how much my illness was hurting her. I had a difficult time enjoying my birthday because her reaction upset me and I just felt terrible for making her worry. 

2. When I was staying with my grandparents, I would go out jogging, every day, on this big hill. I was really sick then. My grandfather told me that every day, he wished it would rain, so that I wouldn't be able to jog and lose more weight. He started crying and told me he didn't want anything to happen to me. This reminded me that even when you think your family isn't paying attention or doesn't notice your behaviors around food and weight, they are noticing. I've never forgotten the look on my grandfather's face when he told me that. 

3. On a vacation to the beach with my cousin's family, I dressed in layers, oversized hoodies and jeans, during the entire trip, even when it was hot out. I had such a distorted view of my body that I didn't realize how sick I looked then. And I didn't want others to ask questions about my weight loss, so I tried to hide it. But everyone noticed my weight loss and behaviors. I took my bathroom scale on the trip. And would spend lots of time in the bathroom checking my weight on the trip. My uncle noticed I had a difficult time eating and he started asking me what he could do to help. He was very understanding and made me feel not alone. But the trip was hard to enjoy because I cared more about what the scale said at the time, instead of focusing on having fun at the beach

4. Being told in inpatient treatment that I was at risk of dying at the time and that I needed to take this seriously and work on the eating disorder now. I was younger and just wasn't thinking about the future back then. It's not my fault I have an eating disorder, but it's something I think about often. I was seriously ill at the time and just kept saying to everyone that it wasn't that bad and I could handle it. I refused to listen to the people in inpatient at the time, and quickly relapsed and refused residential treatment as soon as I got out of inpatient. Then, I stayed sick for years. And never worked on getting better. I'm now realizing what a mistake that was, because now I have severe medical complications and my illness is chronic. I'm trying to get better, but it's not easy. My doctor told me to not be too hard on myself, as I didn't choose to be sick. 

5. Meeting a good friend in inpatient treatment, who was also anorexic. Becoming close friends with her for years, writing her letters and calling her on the phone. And then finding out later that she died from complications of her eating disorder. She was one of my closest friends and very kind. And I've never forgotten her. 

6. When I wasn't answering my phone one day, my dad drove to my apartment and knocked on the door, worried. I didn't realize he was worried. He said he had been trying to contact me for hours and I wasn't answering my phone. Something was wrong with my phone that day and his calls weren't showing up in  my phone. My dad, who rarely cries, broke down in tears, saying he thought I had died from my eating disorder and that's why I wasn't answering the phone. I felt so bad and tried to reassure my dad I was fine. But seeing my family cry is something that stays with me. Even if I argue with my parents sometimes about my disorder, they are always here for me. They don't always understand my eating disorder behaviors, but I know they love me a lot and would be sad if anything happened to me

  
7. When I fainted in front of my dad and he caught me in his arms and my mom ran over to me, panicking. That was really scary and I am glad my parents were there to make sure I was okay

8. Being so obsessed with my scale that I had to have it with me at all times and cared more about what it said, than anything else. I've since gotten rid of my scale and my doctor said that's a great thing. But I do remember, for years, the scale was one of the most important things in my life

Eating disorders are not fun, or cute or enjoyable. They are painful, isolating and scary. Painful not only to the person, but everyone around them. ",,,,Coffeegreysky12,Saddest/scariest moments during my anorexia,-1,-6.275102,-0.4482698

You are valid

If you've never had a feeding tube

If you are experiencing severe complications from anorexia

You are valid

If you don't have a therapist

If you do have a therapist

If you eat mostly junk food

If you eat mostly healthy food

Or if you eat a combination of both

You are valid if you have atypical anorexia nervosa

You are valid if your family has a hard time understanding your illness and doesn't really ask you about it

If your family is incredibly supportive of your struggles, and takes you to any appointments you need

You are valid if you've only been sick for a few months or a year

You are valid if you've suffered for many years and are a chronic sufferer

You are valid if you gain weight during recovery

You are valid if you lose weight through your illness

You are valid if you have other disabilities or disorders, alongside your anorexia nervosa

You are valid, even if you reach out to someone, and they dismiss how you are feeling

You are valid if inpatient treatment wasn't very helpful for you

You are valid if you've had successful inpatient treatments

No one's experience with anorexia nervosa is going to look exactly like someone else's. We are all suffering. We all have unique situations and experiences. Your thought process with this illness will be different. Your behaviors and how you respond to treatment and therapy will be different. Just because your illness looks different from another person's doesn't mean you aren't valid and you aren't suffering. We all are not supposed to have the same experiences. Because everyone is different.

Anorexic people can be seriously ill and still eat junk food and sweets. Not everyone with anorexia compulsively exercises. You won't behave the exact same way as another person with this disorder. I know plenty of anorexic people that like eating things like chocolate and ice cream. They are still anorexic and their struggles are still valid.

One thing I wish other people would try to understand is that a person who suffers from anorexia is in pain, whether that is physical, mental or emotional. They did not wake up one day and choose to starve themselves. And they are not doing it to look a certain way or because of vanity. It is not about vanity. It's about being in pain and feeling bad about yourself and you don't know how to cope with it, other than to restrict your food intake and lose weight. Even if you reach a very low weight, you still feel unhappy with yourself. So I wish people who have never suffered from this illness would try to be more compassionate to those who have it. It is not an easy disorder to cure and the person going through the illness needs support and understanding, not harsh judgements and criticism.

You can't always tell who has an eating disorder, by looking at them. People with atypical anorexia aren't underweight. They are still sick and can experience medical complications. Yes, there are severely underweight anorexic people, who look visibly sick on the outside. There are also people who don't look ill on the outside, but this doesn't mean they aren't suffering. The mental pain you go through with this disorder can't be seen. Both anorexic and atypical anorexic people are suffering. 

Recovering can take years. Some people won't make a full recovery. Relapses after treatment are very common

There are a wide range of medical issues that anorexia can cause. Heart and bone problems are common. Other complications that don't get talked about enough are things like bladder issues, digestive issues, stomach problems, nerve damage. There are a lot more. What happens to each person varies. You won't experience the exact same health issues that another person is experiencing, even if both people are dealing with anorexia

Eating more food doesn't automatically mean you are cured. Anorexic people still eat.

Saying ""just eat"" is counterproductive and doesn't make the person get over the illness. Saying ""I'm sorry you are struggling with eating"" is more helpful, than demanding the person eat more. This is a serious mental illness and you can't shame or scold a person out of it. 

There is no ""sick enough."" If you are experiencing mental and emotional pain, have low self esteem, and start restricting and losing weight to an unhealthy degree, that's the moment you are sick. You have nothing to prove to anyone. If you feel bad about yourself in any way, that's the moment your feelings are valid. You don't have to get worse, so more people will care. Someone cares. 

Anorexia isn't about trying to look a certain way or about vanity. It is an all consuming, deadly mental disorder. One with the highest mortality rate of any mental illness. People who have this illness are suffering. They aren't choosing to starve themselves. They have an illness. An illness that takes therapy, support from family and treatment to overcome. Even when you go through treatment for this illness, you can find it very difficult and you can relapse. 

Not all treatments for anorexia are helpful. Not all anorexic people want to be treated with inpatient treatment. Some people have chronic anorexia and complex situations. Some people have other disorders or disabilities, alongside anorexia, and typical anorexia treatments won't be helpful for them. This is why you should have treatment tailored to fit your needs. And a treatment team that listens, but doesn't pressure you or try to put you in a box. You won't have the exact needs as another anorexic person. If you have other disorders or disabilities that complicate your efforts at recovering, then your treatment team should make adjustments for you. No one should be given up on or made to go through this alone. Even if you have suffered for years and have a hard time thinking about what your life would be like without this disorder, you deserve support and understanding

If you are younger and just found out you have anorexia, I hope you have support around you

If you are older and have dealt with this disorder for years and are considered chronic, I hope you have support around you

You are not a burden. You are not a failure. You are not too difficult

We all deserve to be at peace with ourselves.

post,2024-10-23 14:14:35,2024-10-23 14:14:35,AnorexiaNervosa,1gablcz,"Anorexia nervosa is a difficult disorder to live with

It's not easy for others to understand

There are a lot of misconceptions about it. It's not an illness that can be cured by demanding the person eat more

Just because the person eats more food, doesn't mean the illness in their mind is cured or has gone away

Many people have chronic anorexia and have a hard time fully recovering

Anorexic people still eat

We don't always eat health food or salads

We can eat junk food and sweets. We can like the taste of ice cream and chocolate

Anorexia is a mental illness. It's not about the types of food you eat.

Atypical anorexia is a serious disorder. But because people with atypical anorexia are not severely underweight, they don't always get the help they need or the support they need

There are many severely ill people who do not look severely ill

There are very underweight anorexic people. The ones who when you first glance at them, you know they have an illness.

But not everyone is going to look severely emaciated.

Some people with anorexia have never had a feeding tube or stayed in an inpatient facility

You can still die from anorexia. At any weight, because it causes damage to your body

Even if you stay in an inpatient facility, even if it gets so bad to where you need to use a feeding tube, even if you lose so much weight that you are constantly freezing, and even if people start worrying over you and asking you to eat more

It will never be enough

The ed will never be satisfied

As soon as you reach the number you have in your head, you will change your mind

And go even lower

But no matter how low the number goes, you are never going to be truly happy

At my worst, I hid my body in oversized sweaters. I would use a heavy blanket or stand near a heater, in summertime, because I couldn't stay warm

I'm not happy about being underweight. I didn't reach a low weight and go ""This has made me feel better.""

It didn't make me feel better

Before anorexia, I was a naturally skinny person. A naturally healthy weight. I had a body that I never felt bad about. I liked myself. I had no problem with the way I looked before anorexia. I would wake up in the morning and fix my hair and put on a nice outfit and go on with my day

I struggled with social anxiety and depression before I was anorexic. People in school were mean to me. I was bullied for being quiet and had a hard time making friends in school

Never once thought about losing weight while growing up though. Not as a child. Not as a teenager. It just wasn't something I focused on.

All that changed, when I stood on the scale one day. Got intensely focused on the number and decided I wanted it to be lower

It made me into a different person. But I didn't choose my disorder. No one chooses anorexia. It just happens. My reason was because I was feeling anxious and controlling my weight/food intake relieved some of the anxiety and depression I felt. But only temporarily

I found that losing more weight actually made me more depressed. It made me more obsessive. It made me stop focusing on certain things

All my time, energy and thoughts were devoted to checking the scale. Seeing the number

Yet no matter how low it went, I still felt sad

Even when I almost died from anorexia, I didn't feel happy. Even when I almost got a feeding tube, I didn't feel sick enough. Even when my mom would cry when she would notice how much weight I was losing

Even when I got multiple warnings from doctors that anorexia is serious and I needed treatment, I just wouldn't listen

We all go through different experiences with this disorder. We all have our reasons for falling into it. We don't choose it. And we aren't happy about it

Some people make a fully recovery. Some do not

Some people will look visibly sick. Even if you look visibly sick, you won't feel good about yourself. The number takes up a lot of your time. Is it the right number?

What is the right or correct number? The truth is there is no right or correct or perfect number

I am more than a number. Even when my eating disorder is shouting at me to restrict, lose more weight, to hurt myself more

You are more than a number and you deserve more than being consumed with thoughts about food, your body and your weight

I wish people who have never suffered from this illness would feel more empathy for those who struggle. If someone with anorexia is having a difficult time completing their meal in inpatient treatment, scolding them or shaming them isn't going to help them

Compassion is what people with anorexia need. Even if you don't understand everything about the disorder, it always helps to be compassionate. We often have a hard time showing ourselves the love and compassion we deserve. And when others around us treat us like our illness is a choice, or like we can simply get over it if we just eat more, it really doesn't help.

Anorexia doesn't have an off switch. You can't just turn it off if you get tired of it

That's why learning and being understanding about this illness, and being patient with the person suffering, is so important",,,,Coffeegreysky12,I wish people who do not have anorexia would be more sympathetic to those who suffer from it,-1,-6.8400793,-0.9287305

post,2024-11-13 14:48:29,2024-11-13 14:48:29,AnorexiaNervosa,1gqej0s,"Anorexia nervosa is not a diet. It's not a weight loss method. It's a devastating mental illness. It is not about being superficial, or trying to look a certain way. It's about being in extreme mental and emotional pain, feeling uncomfortable and not knowing how to cope with those feelings. It's not something you choose to do. Everyone develops the illness for different reasons. Everyone struggles in different ways. At first, you start off wanting to lose a few pounds. You get locked into the habit of constantly checking your weight. You see the number on the scale go down, and yet, you are never satisfied. For some reason, when you reach one number, you set the goal lower. And you keep losing weight. And that is why it is unhelpful to shame or scold a person with an eating disorder and demand they eat more. It is not that easy. And because it's a mental illness, it takes lots of support and treatment to overcome it. Even with treatment, many people with anorexia wind up relapsing. It is often a very isolating disorder. I think a person has to be very unhappy in order to continue to starve themselves. But no one chooses this disorder. It can cause severe medical complications. And it has one of the highest mortality rates of any mental illness. Even though I now experience painful and severe complications from my disorder, I find it very difficult to fully recover. Everyone has their own definition of what recovery looks like. Some people find inpatient treatment helpful and some people recover quickly. And some people are chronic sufferers and will struggle with this disorder for years. There is one thing we all have in common. Everyone with this disorder is hurting, mentally, emotionally, physically. No number will ever be good enough. No number is perfect. Reaching a certain number won't suddenly make you a happier person. Whatever was driving you to starve yourself at the beginning, will not suddenly go away, because you become sicker. For me, focusing so much on losing weight just made me more obsessive. I miss the days where I woke up and didn't think about or worry about my weight or the number on the scale. But those days seem so far away now, like a distant memory. I was happier before I was anorexic. I became more depressed, with the more weight I lost. Yet, I still can't let go of my disorder, even though it's caused me awful medical issues and pain. Whatever the person's reasons are for starving themselves, they aren't choosing it. And I wish people who have never experienced anorexia for themselves, wouldn't be so quick to judge those who suffer from it. What people with anorexia need is compassion and understanding. The illness already makes the person feel alone. Shaming them for something they didn't choose to develop is never the answer.

post,2025-04-02 21:37:07,2025-04-02 21:37:07,AnorexiaNervosa,1jq0lqf,"When I first became sick, I denied there was a problem. I pushed away help. I became very secretive. When people tried to get me to eat more or asked me about my weight, I said I was fine and nothing was wrong. This line of thinking quickly changes as soon as you start to feel the affects of this disorder. It starts off with wanting to lose weight. Everyone has a reason that the illness starts. Then you start obsessing over it. So it no longer becomes something that you can just stop. Soon the number is all you think about. You start feeling cold, feeling weak, and become afraid of gaining weight. And in the back of your mind, you know it's unhealthy. But you have a hard time time stopping the behavior. When I ended up in the hospital for anorexia, I pushed away the help. I didn't think I needed to be there. So I just would not listen to people when they were telling me this is serious and to treat it early. I was stubborn and deep in my disorder. This was when I had only been anorexic for two years. So it wasn't chronic at that point. I was younger and just not considering the future and the consequences of not treating this. While in the hospital, I was very anxious and afraid. It was probably one of the most difficult times in my life.  What made it easier was the other people there who were also dealing with eating disorders. It made me feel not alone. I went through two hospitalizations for anorexia. They told me I had osteoporosis. They wanted me to go to residential treatment. I just did not listen. And after I got out of the hospital, I went right back to losing weight. This is where my behaviors started to become more entrenched. I tried outpatient therapy a few times. However, I never stuck to outpatient treatment. And my disorder became more severe. Years later, I have severe and enduring anorexia. I have never reached a point in my illness where I managed to fully recover. And I feel a sense of sadness and regret that I did not listen to my treatment team years ago. However, it is not my fault I developed this disorder. Now I suffer from very severe medical complications as a result of prolonged malnutrition. I was unaware these complications could happen as a result of starvation. My body can no longer absorb the nutrients properly from the food I eat. This means I lose weight without trying and have a difficult time gaining weight. When I attempt to eat more, I get stomach pain and digestive issues, and feel hunger after eating. And it makes gaining weight difficult. I also have painful and frequent urination, which I have been unable to successfully treat.  The pain has made me more stressed and anxious. And when I get stressed and anxious, I have a hard time motivating myself to stick to treatment. So I am essentially staying at home a lot, in severe pain from these symptoms. It makes me feel like I can't go out and do things, and that will affect a person's mental health. And the pain never stops. Along with these complications, I feel tired and have become more depressed. My treatment team includes a therapist, a doctor and a nutritionist. However, I am very rigid in my thinking and have autism, along with the anorexia nervosa. I have sensory issues around eating and difficulty adjusting to new routines. This is likely why inpatient treatment was so difficult for me. When someone on my treatment team recommends I try something to make myself feel better, I do not always follow through with what they are asking me to do. I do not like change and have fear around it. But a part of me knows that in order to get better from something like anorexia, you have to accept certain changes. I know there are treatment programs out there for those with severe and enduring anorexia and autism. This is an awful disorder. It not only causes pain to the person who is going through it, but to everyone who cares about them. My parents are very supportive and help me with things, but even after I have struggled with this for a long time, they do not always understand my eating disorder and why it is so hard for me to recover from it. Everyone who has this disorder deserves support and understanding. It is not your fault that you have this illness. If I could go back in time, I would have treated this sooner, before it became worse. But I know I can't change the past. I don't want to be in constant pain and I want to feel better.

And it can cause digestive issues and organ damage. I just did not realize that starving myself for years would cause such complex health issues. Because of chronic and untreated anorexia nervosa, my medical complications are hard to treat and really painful. Very early on in my disorder, it caused health issues. But because I was younger and went to treatment early, they were able to be reversed. But I never fully recovered after my inpatient treatments, meaning I did not do what they wanted me to do. I did not fully restore weight, I did not attend residential or outpatient treatment, and I did not continue to get treatment after leaving inpatient. Years later, I have severe and enduring anorexia. And it's affected my health in a lot of ways. One thing I didn't realize this illness could cause was that it can affect the way your body processes and absorbs nutrients from the food you eat. My doctor told me because I have starved myself for years, this has made it harder for me to eat and gain weight. When my body was healthier, I was able to eat and put on weight if I wanted. Now when I eat, it hurts my stomach, I get digestive issues, experience hunger after eating and notice that it's hard to get my weight up. The weight loss I experience now isn't intentional. Anorexia can cause GI issues but I wasn't aware it could be this bad. I get different answers from people. I've been told this is what happens when the illness is progressing towards end stage and the body can't handle food the way it used to. This illness is also affecting my bladder, something I never thought about when I was younger. I experience very painful and frequent urination, which is affecting my quality of life and basically keeps me staying at home a lot. It's the worst pain I've ever felt. Because of the pain I experience because of these symptoms, it's made me more depressed. I'm on palliative care for my anorexia. I am also being treated with outpatient treatment, but because my medical issues are so severe, I have not been able to find any relief from them. But if I could go back in time, I would have listened when people were telling me that this is a serious disorder and when left untreated, it can cause severe complications. I don't want to get worse. And I hope I can find a way to start feeling better. I may have to live with side effects from long term anorexia. I also have discomfort with the idea of being treated in a hospital type setting. I feel embarrassed about my symptoms and also struggle with the need for a routine, due to being autistic. And so whenever someone suggests that inpatient may be helpful, I remember how traumatizing my last treatments were and simply don't want to go through that again. I see a doctor, therapist and nutritionist, but I've been told my symptoms are too severe and they simply won't improve with just outpatient. But the idea of inpatient makes me so anxious. I wish there were more treatment options for complex health issues. And more options, in general, for those who are both autistic and anorexic. While no treatment is perfect, I face extra challenges because my brain responds differently to therapy and treatment, because of autism. Things like group therapy, new environments and new routines give me a lot of anxiety, and that's likely why I was never able to adjust to inpatient treatment. I've never been to residential but I think I would have a difficult time with it.",,,,Coffeegreysky12,Medical complications I didn't think could happen because of anorexia,-1,-6.5862303,-0.69795555

post,2025-04-12 22:07:05,2025-04-12 22:07:05,AnorexiaNervosa,1jxspd7,"Your goal weight will never be enough and you will want to set it lower. You will never be satisfied. No number you reach will bring you happiness

You never stop thinking about what you are going to eat that day or your weight. You can't switch off the disorder once you get tired of it. 

Sooner or later, people in your life will notice a change in your health and behavior and say something to you or express concern, even encouraging you to get treatment.

It's not glamorous. The side effects are awful. One of the worst side effects of anorexia I have now is the fact that it's messed up my bladder so badly that I experience painful and frequent urination. The pain is constant and so far, I have not been able to find treatment for this symptom. This symptom keeps me staying at home. It's also worsened my depression and anxiety. But I had no idea anorexia could cause bladder issues. I would encourage people to read more about anorexia and bladder issues, because when I was younger, I didn't know about this side effect. Malnutrition will affect your body in ways you don't always think about, until it happens to you

Anorexia has the highest mortality rate of any mental illness. Whether you have had the disorder for a few years or 18 years, it's deadly and requires treatment

You don't have to be hospitalized to be suffering greatly. There are people who have severe anorexia who aren't in a hospital. It's just not something that everyone finds helpful. At the time of my last hospitalizations, which were years ago, I had a few medical issues but they weren't painful. And as soon as I began the refeeding process, they went away. But my obsession with losing weight did not and only grew worse. Not every person with anorexia wants to be hospitalized. Even though my medical complications are worse now than before, the idea of going back to inpatient causes me a great deal of anxiety. 

You don't have to have a feeding tube to be considered sick enough. I've never had one and the idea of having one scares me. If you are starving yourself and worrying constantly over what you can and cannot eat, you are sick. You don't have to prove anything to anyone. If you are suffering, you are suffering. You don't have to get to a certain weight or wind up with a feeding tube to be considered ill. Everyone with this illness experiences it differently and hurts in their own ways. 

Even if you go through inpatient treatment and years of therapy, you may still find yourself struggling with disordered thoughts and behaviors. While some people will make a full recovery from this, other people will become chronic and find it hard to let go of the illness completely

Recovery can take years, and relapse after getting treatment is common. This is not an easy disorder to cure. 

Eating more food doesn't just make the illness go away. 

People who suffer from this disorder aren't being vain and it's not just about being skinny or wanting to look a certain way. It's a devastating mental illness that affects everything in the person's life and everyone who cares about that person. It's not a weight loss method or a diet. It is a dangerous disorder which requires support from a team of people who know how to treat it

It is common for a person suffering from anorexia to be in denial at the beginning of their disorder. But eventually, the person recognizes they have a problem. But asking a person with anorexia to ""just eat"" is not helpful and won't cure them.

post,2025-04-14 00:02:19,2025-04-14 00:02:19,AnorexiaNervosa,1jylppe,"There are a lot of misconceptions about anorexia. Here are the ones that stand out to me the most

1. That inpatient treatment will help everyone or cure the disorder. Inpatient helps some people, but ends up traumatizing others or simply doesn't help with the anorexia. I still have awful memories of my inpatient experiences.
2. That all people have to do to get better is eat more. Anorexia is a serious disorder that a person doesn't choose. And they can't simply turn off the thoughts and behaviors. It requires treatment and support to improve
3. That anorexic people only eat healthy foods. You can be anorexic and eat sweets and carbs. People don't just eat salad all the time
4. There are a lot of medical complications that can occur. Most people hear about how the illness affects your heart and bones. But these aren't the only health issues that can happen. Anorexia can also cause nerve damage, bladder incontinence and urgency, and damage your digestive system, affecting the person's ability to absorb nutrients from the food you eat.
5. Treatment resistance is really common. And most people who are sick often don't just get treatment because you ask them to. It's common to be unsure if you want help or anxious when the topic of treatment is discussed
6. Recovery doesn't instantly occur because you reach a certain weight or because you become medically stable. Even after treatment, a person can still be struggling with anorexic thoughts and behaviors. And people can relapse. For some, recovery can take years
7. When you have severe and enduring anorexia, the behaviors are more entrenched and the person didn't choose to be sick for a long time. At this point, the person needs specialized treatment. But not all anorexia treatments are set up to handle complex and long lasting anorexia. Treatment needs to be tailored to fit the person's needs. While not every person will be able to let go of the illness completely, you still deserve support and understanding
8. That anorexia only happens to younger people. Anorexia affects older people too
9. Anorexia is not about just weight loss. It's about feeling bad about yourself and not knowing how to cope those feelings. There is no weight loss or number that will bring happiness. A person with anorexia often has depression or anxiety, and these feelings won't just disappear because you lose more weight
10. There is no sick enough. If you are obsessing over your weight and food intake, you are sick. Everyone experiences the disorder differently. Everyone has different health complications and different reactions to treatment. Just because another person has different symptoms or health issues from you doesn't mean they are suffering more. Every person with anorexia is suffering in their own way.",,,,Coffeegreysky12,Misconceptions about anorexia nervosa,-1,-6.9253016,-0.87971437

post,2025-04-22 14:26:26,2025-04-22 14:26:26,AnorexiaNervosa,1k57n49,"It makes me sad to see some people with anorexia say they need to lose more weight or become sicker, so that it feels worth it to get better. Or so more people will show concern for them. As someone who has had anorexia for 19 years and has never fully recovered from it, here is what I learned from putting off help, from avoiding treatment and essentially staying sick for so long

When the anorexic voice is shouting at you that you need to lose more weight so you feel valid, that thought pattern is an indication of just how sick you already are. Healthy people don't wish they were sicker. So if you ever think to yourself ""I feel like I need to lose just a little more weight and then people will take me seriously,"" that is when you have a problem. And your problem is serious

The thing is, you could become emaciated and be admitted to a hospital. You won't feel like recovering, even then. The malnourishment will affect your thinking. You may not actually feel ill. But doctors are telling you otherwise. You may still believe that you need to become even worse. You are chasing after a feeling of validation. But even at your sickest, you will never feel it.

I felt the same way, at the time of my inpatient treatments for anorexia. I was severely ill. But certainly didn't see it. When my treatment team told me they thought I was at risk of dying and they would not allow me to leave the hospital, I did not believe them and refused to listen.

Each time I asked to leave the inpatient centers I was at, I was told no. They told me they were worried I would die if I left the hospital. Sounds like that would make a person snap out of what they are doing, doesn't it? But not with anorexia. That's why this disorder is so scary. Each day, different plates of food were placed in front of me. While nurses sat beside me so I couldn't get rid of the food. I struggled to get through each meal. But I knew if I did not eat the food, I would get a feeding tube. So day after day, I had to sit through breakfast, lunch, dinner and several snacks, consuming every morsel. While my eating disorder brain shouted at me to get home and lose the weight

They didn't want me to burn off the calories I was eating. So they wanted us all to sit down and not stand as much, after we finished eating. If you had to go off and get blood tests down stairs or talk to one of your therapists, some people were so sick, they moved them around in a wheelchair. I was the only anorexic person who wouldn't get in the wheelchair to go downstairs. I didn't feel like I needed it. My body temperature was so low when I first got there, they put a warming blanket on me to get my temperature up. I did not feel like I needed a warming blanket. But I had to sit there with it on. They told me my weight was so low, that it was affecting the function of my organs. My response was ""I would just like to go home and lose weight again.""  When you are ill, you aren't always going to feel like you are ill. And starvation affects your thinking. So I was really not interested in being helped. But I knew the only way out the hospital was to eat the food and do what they said. I did not go to residential or outpatient afterwards because I wanted out of that controlled type of environment. And residential sounded scary to me at the time. I didn't even consider it. I just instantly refused.

So there was never a point during my inpatient hospitalizations where I thought ""I am really sick and these people are absolutely right. There is a reason they are working on refeeding me and why they want me to go to more treatment after I leave here."" Those thoughts didn't cross my mind. I was younger and had only been anorexic for two years at that point. Because of my age at the time, my brain likely wasn't fully developed. Malnourishment was affecting my thinking. And while I gained some weight during treatment, I never fully restored my weight. I was at a healthy weight for my age and height before my eating disorder, but I have never returned to that weight. So this caused further problems. After leaving inpatient, I lost every pound I gained. During my second hospitalization, I became even sicker. I weighed even less during the second inpatient admission than the first one. This was the hospital specifically designed for those with anorexia, where I was really scared. This was the hospital where they wanted to give me a feeding tube, because I was refusing food. And you know what? I didn't feel sick enough, validated or like people were trying to look after me and help me. When I heard the words ""You aren't eating so you are getting a feeding tube,"" I got so scared and, after that, I agreed to start eating. They are basically trying to keep you from dying. There were people of all ages in the hospital. Some were recovering and some were really sick. Even when you are really sick, you are never going to feel valid. I did not view treatment as people trying to save me at the time. I viewed treatment as people trying to take away my control. I was angry at my parents for driving me to both inpatient centers and leaving me there. I wanted to go back home with them whenever they came to visit. I felt like my choices were taken from me. All the weight I gained was lost. I didn't learn anything from being in the hospital. I only had negative feelings towards the places I went to and never wanted to go back

Fast forward to now. It is years after my inpatient hospitalizations. I am still very sick and have severe and enduring anorexia. For years, I remained malnourished and at a low weight. I tried a few therapists and attempts at outpatient treatment. Nothing that stuck with me and got me to change my thinking. No further inpatient treatments. For a long time, my body kept going. The first medical complication I ended up with was osteoporosis. I was younger during my inpatient stays, so because I was renourished right away, my body was more resilient and healed from the damage. I put more strain and stress on my body by continuing to starve it. Now my anorexia is affecting my organs. Some of my medical complications are possibly permanent. I did not know starvation could damage the bladder and cause things like frequent urination. But it can happen, even when you do not think it can happen to you. By not treating my disorder, and never coming to terms with how ill I truly was at the time of my inpatient stays, my disorder just grew more severe. The ed thoughts louder, the behaviors more engrained. I am on palliative care for my anorexia. My parents are still helping me but I know that it makes them sad I have not managed to fully recover from my disorder. I am trying to remain positive. I am glad I am still here. I want to work on getting better, even if it is going to be difficult

There was a girl in inpatient who became a very good friend of mine. She was a few years older than me. She was severely ill, like me. We enjoyed each other's company during our hospital stays. She had been through repeated inpatient stays. She was so ill, but could not see it. She was emaciated, but asked me if she looked fat during my last week there. Hearing her say that made me sad. But it's really what she thought, no matter how many people in treatment tried to tell her, otherwise. Anorexic people often have a distorted view of themselves. You can be really thin, and think you need to be thinner. You could be thin and actually see yourself as overweight. She stayed in touch with me for a few years after I got out of the hospital. She never fully recovered. I am sure that she never reached a point where she truly felt sick enough. She starved herself for so long, that her body simply couldn't handle it anymore. She passed away five years after I met her. During those five years, I stayed in touch with her by calling her on the phone and sending her letters. Her death really affected me. But I did not reach out for help for my anorexia after she died. I got worse

So if there is anything to take away from this post, it is this. Your eating disorder has one single purpose. And that is to make you unhappy. Your reasons for developing this illness will be different from another person's. Every person deserves to feel like they are not alone. And like things can get better for them. I do not think recovery is impossible for me, but it is more difficult because I have been sick for so long. I have to work really hard to change certain behaviors. Some days, this feels impossible. No matter how low your weight goes, whether you have had a feeding tube or have never had a feeding tube, no matter how many medical complications you end up getting, and no matter how many inpatient stays you have gone through, you will never feel valid. You will never feel sick enough. Your illness will convince you that you aren't that bad and things could be worse. Becoming sicker just makes you sicker. I wish I had not put off getting help. I wish I had not waited until I developed medical complications to get help. Now I am in physical pain and older, with an eating disorder. Now, I have to fight even harder than before. Because now, my body isn't as healthy as it once was. You don't think an eating disorder will become chronic, certainly not when you are younger and it just started. If you end up becoming chronic, it is not your fault and you deserve to feel supported. There is hope for everyone to improve. Although this disorder does have a high death rate. People did everything possible to help my friend that died but she was just too ill. I still think about her often. So if you are struggling and not feeling valid, I want to remind you that you are valid. Whether you have suffered for a year or 20 years. And you deserve better",,,,Coffeegreysky12,What I learned from not recovering early,-1,-6.823085,-0.6807629

post,2025-05-05 17:18:30,2025-05-05 17:18:30,AnorexiaNervosa,1kfh7yj,"I generally wonder how people who are at a healthy weight, are able to eat healthy and eat enough food, without starving themselves, without obsessively checking the scale, without constantly thinking about what they eat and how it's prepared. How healthy people who aren't anorexic can just try a new food because it sounds good. How they go about their day, without constantly worrying about the number on the scale

I know the obvious answer is they aren't anorexic. Some people who are not anorexic have disordered eating or they go on diets, but it never turns into anorexia. But I am mostly talking about people who are able to maintain a naturally healthy weight, while not starving themselves. They do not overeat or undereat, and they do not suffer health complications because of it

That used to be me, before this illness came into my life. I have been naturally thin, my entire life. Before my illness, I could eat what I wanted, without having to strictly monitor my food intake or constantly check my weight. My weight was just at a healthy weight. I never went above or below the number. Then one day, I decided to step on a scale and for some reason, couldn't stop losing weight

So now I am very underweight. And I miss how I was before. I miss not worrying about food or weight gain. But now that I am underweight, I am a lot more anxious than I ever was at my previously healthy weight. At my healthy weight, my mom always told me how pretty I was. But ever since I have been sick with anorexia, my mom always asks me what I am eating and is always worrying about me. She no longer calls me pretty. She sees how my illness changed me. No one in my family suffers from anorexia so it is a very isolating thing to go through. Also, I find returning to my previously healthy weight, the weight I once felt confident at, to be very anxiety provoking. Even when people tell me I wouldn't be overweight if I ate more and that gaining weight would improve my health and quality of life. I know I wouldn't be overweight if I ate more. But the idea of the number increasing is what bothers me. I know I would still be naturally thin. It's in my genetics. But the idea of the number going above where I want it to be is what I have anxiety about. 

This disorder can change your thinking and how you view yourself. It is why anorexic people often do not stop losing weight, even when others approach them and tell them they are becoming too thin. I lost my freedom when I stood on the scale. ",,,,Coffeegreysky12,How do people without anorexia not worry about their weight,-1,-6.7920456,-0.9005343

post,2025-05-09 22:49:37,2025-05-09 22:49:37,AnorexiaNervosa,1kivm1y,"I had a very good friend who suffered from severe anorexia. I met her when I was hospitalized for my eating disorder. I related to her in lots of ways. She was an interesting person. I like art. She also liked art. I liked to write. And she liked to draw and paint. So we could have discussions about that. I could joke around with her, because she didn't take herself too seriously. We talked about a lot of different things, not just our eating disorders. I feel like she understood me and if I happened to be struggling with something, I could talk to her about it. And she could talk to me about something she was struggling with. 

But one thing I remember about her is that she was very entrenched in her disorder. She was very sick. And she had actually been through more anorexia treatments that I had received at the time. She had struggled with her anorexia a lot longer than me. I could already tell that her disorder was really difficult for her to overcome. She had problems accurately seeing how she really looked. She believed, at a very malnourished weight, that she was fat. Some anorexic people have body image distortions where they truly cannot see how they look on the outside. And I think this was an issue she had, and it was really difficult for her to overcome it

While I enjoyed our conversations and she was a very kind person, she also needed reassurance that she was not overweight. She believed that she was. Even though she looked emaciated to me and to others. And when I arrived at the hospital, she had been there much longer. She had also tried previous treatment centers before the one I met her in. And I guess she needed more monitoring or she kept relapsing

I was watching tv in the day room at the hospital and she came up to me and the words she said made me feel very sad for her. She said to me ""Do you think I look fat?"" And I felt really bad. She trusted me enough to confide in me that she was struggling. A lot of people sometimes keep their feelings to themselves when they are struggling but she liked talking to me. I liked talking to her. I wanted to reassure her. I said she looked fine. But I do not think she believed me

The problem with this disorder is that it is a mental illness. Everyone around you sees you one way and you can see yourself as another way. My struggle with anorexia makes me attached to wanting to weigh a specific number and being afraid of the number increasing. I do not view myself as overweight. I see that I am thin. I am terrified of the thought of weight gain, not of the thought of becoming fat. But my friend believed that she looked fat, no matter how thin she actually was. And I think that she continued to struggle with low self esteem even after she left the hospital

I stayed in touch with her for years after I got out of the hospital. I wrote letters to her. I called her on the phone. She was a very unique and intelligent person. She also struggled with a lot of pain. I never found out the exact reasons why she developed her disorder. But I remember her personality and how she was always very kind to everyone around her, no matter how much she was struggling inside. 

She died of of complications of anorexia. She died at a younger age. She never fully recovered from it. But she did try to get better. I think about her a lot. I miss our conversations. Being in inpatient was a very lonely and frightening time for me and talking to her made me feel less alone. This is a tragic disorder. It harms your health. It can change how you view yourself. It is nice to talk to others who are struggling with this. I've never forgotten her. I want to work on getting better from my disorder.

post,2025-07-06 16:41:53,2025-07-06 16:41:53,AnorexiaNervosa,1lt5pvj,"You think you have things under control at first. You start restricting your food intake and losing weight. You reach a number you have in your head. But you don't stop at that number, because this is a serious mental illness. And there is no off switch. You will never feel sick enough, underweight enough. You can start to look visibly ill, and you may think at that point, you are going to turn things around. Pursue recovery, because you've finally proved at this point you are sick. But you won't. In fact, resistance to treatment and finding comfort in this disorder, being in denial of how ill you are, is very common. I remember being hospitalized, severely ill, with failing health and people afraid I would die. I didn't have good insight back then. I thought everyone worried about me and trying to make me eat was wrong. That's what this disorder does to you. You can be in a hospital, emaciated, about to get a feeding tube because you are refusing to eat, and you still won't see it. I didn't see it at that time. My only focus at that point in time was my weight and what the scale was saying. Instead of thinking about the fact that people in the hospital were trying to get me healthier, all I thought about was my weight. I was younger, so I wasn't focused on the future consequences. And there are consequences to staying sick, remaining in a malnourished body. There are side effects to starving yourself. It is different for everyone. Maybe you start to notice you get cold easier and can no longer stay warm. Maybe you start losing energy and your bones start to weaken. Maybe you find it's hard to sleep at night. Your mind starts only focusing on what you eat, what you weigh. All other concerns drift into the background. Hopefully, you have people around you that try to get you to understand that what you are doing is deadly and that you need help. Maybe you will recover early, and find a way out of this disorder, before it becomes chronic. Maybe you accept to go to treatment and be refed. You accept help, knowing help means weight gain and letting go of the ed behaviors. Some people do very well in treatment and they never go on to be chronic. But for others, they don't respond the same to hospitalization. They stay sick for years, medical complications become worse. And full recovery seems impossible at times. But if you go through treatment, and it doesn't work, maybe it was not you that resisted the treatment. Maybe the treatment given was done poorly and people didn't tailor things to fit your needs. Everyone is different. Everyone reacts differently to treatment. Some fight the process. Some go along with it. It's not easy for anyone. And at any point in your disorder, whether you have been sick for two years and twenty years, you can suffer medical complications. You do not have to feel sick, to be sick. If you had asked me at the time of my inpatient hospitalizations if I felt sick and like I needed to be there, I would have said no. I was in denial. I didn't feel any pain or discomfort at the time, even though I was near death. No matter how many times people repeated to me they were afraid I was going to die, my illness had taken over and malnourishment was clouding my thinking. And I couldn't agree to what they said. I eventually agreed to eat, but only under pressure, because I felt I had no other choice. And when you go through treatment, and you aren't willing to see you have a problem, then you are going to have a difficult time getting better. When I was younger, I was unaware of all the terrible consequences. I had no idea there were so many side effects. Many they will not tell you about and you often do not consider things, until one day, they hit you and then you can't stop thinking about the damage done to your body. Damage from anorexia can be silent. It can occur for many years. Because this illness is an addiction, you may think because you do not feel bad, physically, that you can keep going. But your body can only take so much. I wish I could reverse time, and go back to the moments people were telling me to treat this early. I pushed away help after my hospitalizations, believing I could go home, retreat into the safety and comfort of my disorder, which was actually anything but safe. For years, my disorder grew more and more severe. And I avoided further hospitalization, for the fear it would be another repeated cycle. Then, my body began to show signs of damage. I have a hard time controlling my bladder, and get frequent and painful urination. This symptom basically keeps me staying at home all the time. And I have found no way to reverse it. It's not just frequency but constant pain. And this will erode your self esteem quickly. I wish I was warned about anorexia and bladder issues. But I had no idea. And that is the most devastating thing about this disorder. It silently takes away your comfort, your peace of mind, and steals little bits of your health in the most cruel ways. My digestive system is damaged from all the stress. Years of remaining at a low weight, never fully restoring my weight to a healthy level, has caused organ damage. I used to be able to eat and gain weight. But now, my body doesn't respond to food the same way, and I lose weight, unintentionally. It's not just weight loss, but chronic pain, stomach issues, and a general weak feeling. I was unaware that palliative care for anorexia existed. But I find myself on palliative care. I was unaware my disorder would become deeply entrenched. I was unaware these medical issues would have such a huge impact on my quality of life. Once a disorder becomes chronic, it is not impossible to get better. But you need support and understanding. With this disorder, it consumes your thoughts. You do not know why, but that number you see on the scale means so much. Yet, you long for a life free from this disorder and you try to be positive. But with anorexia, also comes depression. You do not see things in the same way that a healthy person without anorexia sees things. People say ""go to treatment"" and maybe things will get better. But a lot of people with anorexia fear change, fear changing what they are doing, even when a part of them understands the harm this disorder is causing them. Even if you wind up with very painful medical complications, even when people are waring you that you can die, even when you are a chronic sufferer, on palliative care, and feeling unsure about recovery, you will never feel sick enough. You will try to convince yourself that you can keep going like this. But that is just the disorder lying to you. Anorexia isn't fun. Anorexia isn't peaceful. Anorexia doesn't give you a break when you get tired of it. I try to be hopeful I can get better. What that may look like, I cannot predict. But I do miss the days when I did not have an eating disorder in my life. It's not glamorous or fun to suffer.

It‚Äôs seriously the most fucked up diagnostic decision, if there‚Äôs absolutely no difference in the mental aspect of the two mental illnesses, why are they two separate diagnoses?? Malnutrition and all the risks associated with that can happen at any weight, but this diagnostic criteria really underplays that.

I‚Äôve still gone through periods of isolating myself from people because I hated how my body looked with gaining weight even if it wasn‚Äôt realistically very much weight. My ED didn‚Äôt really believe that it wasn‚Äôt very much weight. I‚Äôve still struggled to socialise because I was ashamed of the quantities of food I was eating compared to everyone else, I‚Äôve still had acne breakouts, I‚Äôve still had the really intense (and hot) recovery farts that made me not wanna be around anyone. I‚Äôve still experienced all the mental distress of ignoring the ED thoughts. 

Eating disorders are mental illnesses and that means what weight you are doesn‚Äôt necessarily effect how you feel, and that carries over to recovery. Recovering into a slim body doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you **feel** pretty or beautiful, no matter how others may view you. I pretty much followed the path you describe in here, but only now after over a year of (more or less) recovery do I actually feel pretty sometimes, and I can assure you that encouraging to people to continue because it gets better has never been any easier for me to say just because I‚Äôm still quite slim.",,,,busted3000,,-1,-6.669273,-1.8591619

Comparing your intake to others is not going to bring you any happiness, especially comparing it to social media influencers who are paid to claim they eat a certain thing every day. Let me ask you, when you were eating less than 3 meals and 3 snacks a day, when you were restricting your intake, did you feel physically good?

&#x200B;

I was looking through body positivity and ED recovery posts on Instagram. People were posting about loving yourself at every size, eat how you like and not how others tell you to, benefits of recovery etc. A good majority of comments are all from actually intelligent people, commenting more positivity and spreading the love. That‚Äôs great! But THEN come the grown ass men with ‚Äúyou shouldn‚Äôt be promoting obesity!‚Äù,  ‚Äúas long as you‚Äôre eating healthy you‚Äôre fine!‚Äù, ‚Äúfat isnt healthy!‚Äù, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs so unhealthy why does everyone look up to her!‚Äù Ok, you get the picture.   


Its not just that. In real life too, I get comments about giving into extreme hunger from my Dad and male Friends. ‚ÄúStop eating so much junk, it‚Äôs not healthy‚Äù and ‚Äúmaybe try eating fruit and veg instead if you‚Äôre so hungry‚Äù and they make jokes about how much I‚Äôm eating. GRRR!! I also used to get comments when I was really ill a while ago ‚Äúyou look fine to me‚Äù.  It‚Äôs always men! Ok, some women do say dumb things too but it‚Äôs 90% men. I also read posts on here about how peoples boyfriends make comments about their body and it triggers them, and I just think, grrrrrrrr.

Why are men so blind when it comes to ED‚Äôs, the body positivity movement and any topics related to that? I just wish they‚Äôd shut up and educate themselves before ranting on like idiots. They just think theyre so entitled to give their shitty opinion all the time. Fuck them.

I see lots of comments on how it‚Äôs common to recover into an overweight body, including overweight by (stupid) BMI standards and people who are classed as plus size. Yet, all the recovery influencers I see are always still super thin and look malnourished, yet are like ‚Äúrecovery‚Äôs so worth it I feel so great and happy in my body hehe!!!‚Äù Now I‚Äôm definitely not saying that recovering into a smaller body is wrong or anything, people are naturally petite and I get all that. But I just don‚Äôt wanna feel like I‚Äôm the only person who has recovered from an ED and recovered into a larger body. I would rather be in a bigger body and happy than in a smaller body and miserable/sick. But if other people could say, like, ‚Äúhey! I recovered into a larger body! I exist!‚Äù Just so I know that I‚Äôm not the only one chilling over here then I would really appreciate it. This post is kinda stupid really but I just wanna feel like theres other people who are the same and understand me :‚Äô)

EDIT: thank you all so so much for the comments!!! You have all made me feel so happy and so grateful. I‚Äôm so glad I chose recovery.

post,2022-02-08 13:45:14,2022-02-08 13:45:14,fuckeatingdisorders,snklqq,"A thought I‚Äôm pretty sure we all share is that when we are ‚Äòthinner‚Äô, that makes us more ‚Äòbeautiful‚Äô. Or worthy, or confident, etc. I definitely thought this, and I thought that when I‚Äôd gain weight in recovery that I would become unattractive, ugly, undesirable etc.

Well, bitch, I was wrong. In many ways. Here‚Äôs a list of whats happened since I‚Äôve gained weight:

* I‚Äôve had 3 people ask me out. During my ED, I had no one ask me out. One called me beautiful, and apparently one described me as the ‚Äúperfect woman‚Äù behind my back to his friends. I‚Äôm overweight. I didn‚Äôt think ‚Äúperfect woman‚Äù and ‚Äúoverweight‚Äù would go hand in hand, but fuck yeah, here we are. 
* All my family and family friends have told me how much better I look and how much happier I am. When I was thin, I was miserable. I‚Äôm happy now. That makes a massive difference obviously.
* I‚Äôm so much more confident now. Confidence is a big thing, and when I was in my ED, I was always so worried about my appearance and what I looked like that it defeated the whole point of ‚Äúthinner equals confidence‚Äú, so there‚Äôs more proof it‚Äôs bullshit.
* Speaking of confidence, my boobs have come back, which to me is a huge win. I can now show a bit of cheeky cleavage, which for me makes me feel more confident and better about myself. That‚Äôs me personally, I like big boobs. Now I have them.
* One of my friends said to me after not seeing me since I‚Äôve started recovering, ‚Äúwow, you‚Äôre hot now‚Äù

Idk the full point of this post tbh, it‚Äôs just proof that thinner doesn‚Äôt mean beautiful. I feel more beautiful now than I did before, and I‚Äôve had more attention in that way I guess? Hopefully it helps u guys feel a bit better about recovery. If you think that gaining weight will make you unattractive, you‚Äôre wrong. Trust me :)",,,,Fuzzy_sleep,Here‚Äôs proof that thinner doesn‚Äôt equal beautiful/hot/whatever,-1,-6.8900347,-2.1987348

I can always go get more if I actually feel like I want more. It helps because I will almost always get at least a few bites down, which IMHO is better than zero bites. 

Seeds and nuts are great for this, they don't go bad or stale so you can have a little bowl that you're snacking on all day. They are packed with protein which helps to make me feel more full than other snacks like chips or whatever. Also you can usually find whatever flavor you happen to be craving, or leave them plain if you want something bland.

As an adult, I talked to my primary physician and talked to them about my issues. They did bloodwork on me and a bunch of tests, and I was fine. The doctor told me something I'll never forget, she said ""eating junk is healthier for your body than eating NOTHING."" And that stuck with me. I was starving myself because all I wanted was doritos or french fries or chocolate or pizza.

If youre working out for 1-3 hrs a day (and believe me, I know some of yall do, hell, sometimes *I* do, for sure) then no, 1600-1800-2000 whatever kcals IS NOT ENOUGH.

So let's say your bmr is between 1100-1350 kcals (which unless you're super short, THIS IS YOU). 

That means you need to take in 1100 cals just to run your organs. 

Except it takes cals to digest food, too. TEF varies by food product, but 10-15% is reasonable. 

So, that means that to net 1100 cals, you need to eat 1300. 

That means that just laying in bed, propped up in pillows and whatever the fuck else, you need 1300-1400cals. 

Moving takes cals. Sitting up takes cals. Typing on your phone takes cals. Exercising (like most of us do) - more cals.

I see so many posts here about ""I'm never satisfied on maintenance calories, so why bother?"" ""I just want to EAT AND EAT AND EAT, when will it end???"" ""Normal meals just *aren't enough*"" 

It gets better. Yes, at first all you want are large meals. You're hungry *all the time*. 

Sorry, but what did you fucking expect? You just spent X amount of time starving yourself. You're physically deprived of nutrients and calories. Your body wants them back. If you ""estimate"" that you're eating maintenance, odds are, you're overestimating. If you *know* you're eating maintenance, well, you still might be hungry for more, and you have 2 options. 

1) Wait it out. Your body will normalize if you just *fucking eat consistently*. This means eating maintenance *every day*, regardless of how you ate the day before. Note: this will mean anything from a few weeks to a few months of being hungry despite eating maintenance. 

2) Eat above maintenance. Seriously, an extra bowl of cereal for a couple days will not be the end of the world. Normal people do this all the time. Don't torture yourself. Fucking eat. You're not special just because you can ignore basic bodily signals. 

I've been eating *actual* maintenance of 2500+ for months. I have not ""blown up."" I just don't feel like shit all the time, have actual energy, and can eat regular- sized portions and feel satisfied. Sometimes I eat an entire pint of ice cream because it's just ~the vibe~, but there is no part of me that feels like it's a *need*, and honestly, most of the time I want *nothing* to do with *that much ice cream*.

Ultimately, it's caloric and macro/micronutrient sufficiency that drives satiation. A professionally designed meal plan may be able to achieve that while the portions don't look 'insane.' 

There's also a mental part of restriction, too. For me, if I know I have a whole jar of peanut butter in the fridge, and that it's mine, and that I can have it *whenever,* I just...stop caring.

post,2021-11-11 21:18:09,2021-11-11 21:18:09,fuckeatingdisorders,qrvai6,"I've cycled through ED-recovery-lapse-relapse-lapse-quasi-lapse-relapse\[...\] (I'll be 23 in a week and started this bullshit when I was 20).

Note: I know there are different EDs (BED, bulimia, etc.) but I really only have experience with restrictive ED so...sorry. I can't write to everyone's experiences, only my own.

There's a LOT of panic in this sub about extreme hunger, and it's been a while since anyone's bumped a post about what it's like when you're NOT experiencing extreme hunger, so I figured I'd attempt one. Please call me out if I say stuff that isn't helpful for people in early recovery and I'll edit ASAP.

Also, if you have weird cardiac symptoms, REGARDLESS of level of restriction, PLEASE seek medical attention if you can.  

That being said, here's what I've learned/experienced/would advise:

1. Stay the FUCK away from IG/TikTok ""extreme hunger"" or ""What I eat in a day - ED recovery"" posts. You don't know if they're still restricting (they probably are), how far into recovery they are (I seriously doubt anyone documents their first 2-3 days of extreme hunger on social media because you're too busy with the insane feeding frenzy that is extreme hunger). If you're panicked about how much you're eating, comment and we can talk through it. (If you've gone through extreme hunger and you want to also offer to support, feel free to do so in the comments!)
2. DO NOT COMPENSATE. None of this ""okay that was fun but since I CLEARLY ate \[amount\] over \[allowed amount\], tomorrow needs to be more reasonable!"" Whatever you ate *today* is whatever you ate *today*. Tomorrow is a new day. If you're still hungry, EAT. If you're not hungry, stick to 3 meals and add a snack or two. Stay hydrated but don't water-load (this does bad stuff to your electrolytes in addition to just being miserable). 
3. Don't fight it. Seriously, loading up on, idk, iceberg lettuce or whatever ""diet hacks"" you've heard is really just setting you up to be simultaneously STILL REALLY HUNGRY and also full of...lettuce. See ""water-loading,"" because really, that's what veggie-loading is.
4. It's okay if you literally find yourself just wanting high-carb, processed foods like yknow...PopTarts. They're quick energy. Your body wants (and needs!) quick energy. Don't try to ""slow-carb-Peak-Nutrition"" your way through extreme hunger. 
5. DO NOT WEIGH YOURSELF THE DAY (OR WEEK) AFTER IT SETS IN (OR HELL, AT ALL). DO NOT. DO NOT. DO NOT. It is ALL water and food weight. (Eventually, your brain might reset to realize that gaining weight is actually the better alternative to endless physical/psychological suffering and/or death, but for now, I'll just tell you - REAL weight gain takes TIME. A LOT OF TIME. Mathematically and physiologically, you need a LOT of extra food over a substantial period of time.) 
6. Don't set a time limit. Ideally, free-eating will be your LIFE, not just X days/weeks ""while I'm recovering."" Extreme hunger won't last forever, but freedom with food is the *goal.* 
7. It's okay to enjoy food. It's okay to enjoy eating. It's okay to enjoy giving yourself freedom to eat unrestrictedly for the first time in however long it's been. It's okay. You have not somehow failed, you are not somehow lesser. You're killing it. 
8. ...don't try to safe-food your way through extreme hunger. please. it's miserable and I'm experiencing second-hand misery just thinking about it. Get some goddamn Nutella, REAL ice cream (none of that Halo Top bullshit), cook pasta and rice instead of shirataki noodles and cauliflower, eat the egg yolk. Get a cookie (or several!) without the protein content as the main attraction, get a Starbucks drink that makes your ED tremble in fear. Conquer the weeds and the gremlins because make no mistake, they want nothing more than for you to continue suffering. 
9. Food is energy. That doesn't mean you will feel energized. I'm sorry but your body is TIRED. Even if you didn't realize it beforehand, restriction is EXHAUSTING and if you find yourself literally ONLY eating and sleeping, that's normal.
10. You don't get a say in when it ends, and the more you fight it, the longer it will take. If you can listen to your body through extreme hunger and recovery, you get your life back. It'll be worth every minute, but you just gotta stick it out. 

Also, here's a sample of *one* of my days with extreme hunger, for anyone curious:

* Entire large pizza (16-18"")
* order of mozzarella sticks (8)
* 9-12 poptarts
* 1-2 pints of ice cream
* ice cream sandwich
* 3-4 nut butter sandwiches
* 2-3 sleeves of saltines
* 2 protein shakes
* cereal
* 1-2 apples
* tiramisu
* steak sandwich
* probably more things that I'm forgetting because this seems too little for extreme hunger

...and I was still hungry the next day, so I ate. There were no ""protein oatmeal bowls"" or ""green smoothies"" involved. I wanted some *fucking calories* on an order of magnitude that  spinach was *not* going to deliver, and so I *fucking got some calories*.",,,,tkdaw,What I've learned about extreme hunger,-1,-5.1154904,-1.6800385

If we had the answer to that problem, none of us would be here. Binge eating isn‚Äôt a one size fits all approach to healing. Some people are moderators and some people are abstainers  and some people fall in between. Some people can do intuitive eating and some people cannot because it wouldn‚Äôt make sense or be possible with their lack of hunger hormones or hunger/ satiety cues and signals. Coming to this sub and expecting others to help you stop bingeing is absolutely not going to happen. Again, if we had the answers, none of us would be going through the cycles. 

Listening to podcasts about binge eating is probably the BEST and MOST EFFECTIVE way to get the support and the inspiration needed to stop bad habits around food or eating . Podcasts are FREE :) and there‚Äôs thousands of them. If you just type in bingeing or eating disorders in Spotify you get all the support and information you need to get through really bad moments with ED‚Äôs. 

Here‚Äôs a list of them that you can listen to! Spotify is easy to navigate. Listen to episodes with the topics you‚Äôre struggling with. Podcasts can help you re wire your brain and help change your habits. 

‚Ä¢ The Recovery warriors shows

‚Ä¢ What you‚Äôre craving 

‚Ä¢ Nutrition matters podcast 

‚Ä¢ Any podcast you can find with Isabella foxen duke

‚Ä¢ any podcasts with James clear (author of atomic habits) 

‚Ä¢ Brain over binge podcast 

‚Ä¢ Any podcasts with Glenn Livingston 

‚Ä¢ The psychology of eating podcast

‚Ä¢ Food junkies - amazing !!!! 

‚Ä¢ any podcasts with Joan ifland 

‚Ä¢ any podcasts with Mary roberts and Jessyca Reynolds 

‚Ä¢ unsweetened sio 

‚Ä¢ any podcasts with Susan pierce Thomson 

Hope this helps. Knowledge is power. Support is medicine. Habits can change but it requires the will to WANT to change. And trust me, I‚Äôm not perfect because I have a host of Ed habits I am trying to release. :)

It‚Äôs basically just giving people ‚Äúwill power‚Äù to not eat. And that‚Äôs what causes the weight loss. It‚Äôs basically anorexia in an injection. It‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ when I eat tiny portions of things I obviously don‚Äôt feel the need to throw up. But eating for me is never eating small portions. I have anorexia but I eat volume amounts of my healthy orthorexic foods. If I just ate a small portion of food once or twice a day I would be even more anorexic than I already am. So what the fuck am I supposed to do.,,,,Queenofwands1212,,-1,-6.4187922,-1.5080923

But I know deep down it‚Äôs because I am deep in the addiction of the ED. When I feel my clothes fitting looser, when I see my body getting smaller it‚Äôs the only thing that truly gives me this drug like high. I‚Äôm not proud of this, but I know it‚Äôs stemming from addiction. As folks with Ed‚Äôs we are in an active addiction, just not to a substance, we‚Äôre addicted to feelings and sensations and habits and behaviors. Sometimes I even think I am a food addict, like I‚Äôm ‚Äúaddicted‚Äù to my healthy low calorie sugar free orthorexic safe foods, but is it really food addiction or is it actually because my body and mind are starved and malnourished. So when I do finally work myself up to eating, it makes me feel high too. Like the safe foods make me feel high. It feels like I enjoy food too much even if it‚Äôs low grade stupid safe foods that any normal person would not enjoy whatsoever.  Eating has become something I dread and simultaneously look forward to as if it‚Äôs the highlight of my day while it‚Äôs also the darkness of my night because eating comes with chaos and panic and discomfort and purging and overwhelm. It‚Äôs like nothing I do has any outcome of winning. I try to eat more and that backfires into potential weight gain and purging. I starve myself more and that gives me a false high and euphoria because of the addiction. Some days I am completely obsessed and fixated on food and what foods I want to eat or could eat and some days I have no hunger and food isn‚Äôt on my mind at all.

Incredible that they have these meds to help
Folks who have obesity.  My issue is with the people who don‚Äôt have obesity but they are somehow getting these drugs and losing tons of weight and it‚Äôs just enforcing Ed behaviors and lifestyle for them. Tons of woman in Hollywood, probably hundreds of thousands of  people who don‚Äôt have much weight to lose at all, but they are becoming sick and ill both physically and mental from these drugs. Hence why I labeled it as Anorexia in an Injection. 

overweight or obese people are taking ozempic and other glp1s and they are saying all their food noise and food obsession has lifted and just gone away. Isn‚Äôt that nice? Meanwhile, All of us idiots with anorexia are just raw dogging it because well, it‚Äôs a fucking real mental illness.

No, really. Eating past physical fullness is **extremely** common in extreme hunger. I would go as far as saying that extreme hunger cannot exist without eating past physical fullness at least once.

A caring, supportive environment is always the best to achieve full and sustainable recovery.

However, I also do feel that...I don't know, us with EDs don't really like to be told certain things - we know those to be true, but we hate hearing them nonetheless. 

So here's some ideas that I have that usually get me into heated arguments with other people in recovery:

1. **it is a choice to engage in any kind of behaviour**. You can say all you want that ""I can't help but restricting"", ""I can't stop purging"", ""it's beyond my control"" etc., but the harsh reality is that you DO have a choice. You DO choose to engage in those behaviours. You CAN choose not to. You didn't choose to have an ED, but you do choose everyday to keep having one. There is no one, no one but yourself that forces you to keep restricting, purging, exercising or whichever other behaviour characterizes your ED. 
And so many people interpret this as ""it's your fault/you just have to do it"", whereas this is absolutely not the case. What I am actually trying to put across is that you DO have the control to change your actions. And this feels incredibly empowering. Knowing that, you also know what to do next - which doesn't mean you have to do it alone; you may very well have to ask for help. But it's still up to you. 

2. **your triggers are your problem**. Yes, society is shit. Yes, people are often assholes. Maybe they try to be nice, and they fail. Maybe they don't understand how you feel. Maybe no one does. But as an adult living in the real world you cannot expect anyone to accommodate your issues. You probably also say a lot of stupid stuff that might hurt someone else and you don't know anything about it. That's life. Recovery is also learning to be confident enough that you don't have to be bothered by any random comment you read or run back to your ED everytime you feel uncomfortable. 

3. **you have to quit all the excuses**. You can trick your therapist, your dietitian, your parents, your friends, strangers on the internet and everyone else into believing all you want them to believe. That you ""forgot"" to eat, or you ""just want to walk to manage anxiety"", or that you ""are doing everything you can"". But in the end, the only person that loses is you. Real life doesn't care about any shenanigans and if you're not fully honest with yourself and the others you will just be wasting time that no one will give you back, while the rest of the world goes on without really caring about you.

I'm very against this kind of gender stereotypes :) and I know how lonely and shameful it feels to be a guy with an ED. But the point is not to harden up and stop whining, the point is just realizing that you have all you need to change this situation, and that taking responsibility doesn't mean playing a blame game - it doesn't mean wallowing in self-pity because you were too much of a dumb shit to change. It means knowing that however shitty, unfair and miserable it might feel, it is your problem and only you can get out of it. It means accepting that no one is forcing you to engage in behaviours and you can actually take steps to stop. Part of this awareness can also mean being humble enough to recognize that you're not accountable, or that you need help, or that you do not feel like taking those steps just yet (and maybe do not even want to). 

It's not my intention to break anyone down and calling people out for fun. What I want to do is to convey the message that no matter how helpless and desperate you feel at the moment, no matter how out of control it seems, it's not out of your control. You have a choice. You have a way out. And you can choose to follow that way out.

For me personally, once I realized that, it was like a gate had opened - a new world of possibilities.

No it's not.

The only reason why I feel out of control in my life is because I have a fucking ED that doesn't allow me to focus on what truly matters because I can't stop thinking about food. 

And the only reason why I feel ""in control"" when I restrict is because I am afraid of gaining weight and I am afraid of giving in to my extreme hunger, therefore my brain rewards me for that - guess what, I have an ED, therefore I feel ""in control"" when I engage in ED behaviours. Who'd have thought.

The only reason why I feel anxious around mealtimes is because I am afraid of eating too much and gaining weight.

The only reason why I feel ""out of control"" when I binge is because I don't want to gain weight and binges are conductive to that. My brain uses feelings of fear, guilt and self-loathing to motivate me not to binge anymore.

People who are afraid of spiders feel ""in control"" when they stay away from spiders and their brain rewards them for staying the fuck away from spiders. No shit Sherlock.

My life wasn't perfect before the ED and it won't be perfect after it (if there's ever gonna be an ""after""). But I felt so much more ""in control"" when I could engage in normal adult activities. I felt so much more ""in control"" when I didn't care about food or calories and didn't feel the need to compulsively restrict my food in order to stay under an arbitrary caloric amount, like that was the single most important task in my entire existence.

This alone already feels like the biggest most catastrophic event ever happened in the entire history of the universe. The fact that I'm at a healthy weight makes it even worse, if possible.

That said.

I slept better last night. It had been several nights of bad sleep but last night I slept well and never woke up - also because I didn't drink my usual [insert excessively high number of] cups of caffeine-free tea and diet sodas, therefore I didn't have to pee all the time.

I'm wearing short sleeves today. I'm not cold.

I'm *somewhat* less hungry than yesterday. My mind is *slightly* less consumed with pictures of mountains of peanut butter to gorge on.

Time goes by faster! I found myself staring less compulsively at the clock waiting for the next meal to come.

My mind feels freer. I just spent a couple hours straight working on a project without realizing I wasn't thinking about food.

I'm less fidgety. I'm just sitting on my chair like that.

I am fully aware that this kind of posts comes from a good place and they're genuinely meant to be helpful. Yet I still find them somewhat problematic.

Everyone has its own idea of what is restriction and what is ""needed"" or ""allowed"" and it might be problematic to use a single figure (like say 1200) as a blanket benchmark, because it tends to reinforce the idea that everyone with an ED eats less than 1200 a day - and therefore if you eat more than that you don't have an ED, because you know how ED logic works! In my case for example I eat way more than that on a daily basis, yet I am still restricting very much and I still have an ED, I promise.

I once made a post on another subreddit where I wrote that BED as a term/diagnosis/self-diagnosis gets thrown around a bit too much, according to the view of me. Most often people who come from restrictive backgrounds and say they ""got BED"" actually have still some sort of restriction going on, either actual straight up restriction - like, fasting/purging or eating overly healthy for days after a binge - or mental restriction (feeling extreme guilt and shame around food, etc.). So in those cases I would actually say they have bulimia or ednos, but who am I to judge.

I do believe that actually transitioning from restriction to BED is a very rare occurrence that honestly shouldn't be a real concern for most of us. I mean, our body DOES have self-regulating mechanisms that DO work if we listen to them, and it just makes no sense that we just keep binging endlessly if we didn't use to do it before our restrictive ED kicked in.

Now, I am also one that feels I ""got BED"" after eating an extra slice of turkey and I will DEFINITELY be the rare exception who will just binge into oblivion, but that's because I'm a fucked up hypocrite.

I know it's hugely unpopular, and I know some of you do it. But honestly, I don't believe it. I think it's just one of the many excuses we put together. I believe that in the vast majority of cases we *know* what's the bare minimum. We *do* have an idea. We're just scared of accidentally eating more than that, so we count calories to actually make sure we don't eat too much. 

Now, there are certain people, especially those who are very young and very deep into AN, who genuinely might have impaired cognitive capabilities and might truly not be able to recognize what's a ""sufficient"" amount of food. But usually those are looked after by professionals, so let's just say I'm not referring to them. I think that really most adults do have an idea of what a portion size is and don't need to count calories for that.

Let's say you have doubts that you haven't eaten enough. What's stopping you from just going and eating more? Maybe you don't feel ready to do so, don't feel brave enough to do so, which is totally okay and absolutely normal, but it's a different issue.

Or let's say that you have no guidance and just feel scared and overwhelmed and don't even know where to start. Say you struggle with binging and purging and just want to be stable for a while. You can try and visually guess what a minimum amount of food is by looking around. Look at what others are putting on their plates during meals. Look at fast food portions. Think about what you'd feed another person with. Imagine you have a child to take care of and that child comes home after school and you have to make lunch for him. Or imagine you have a friend over for dinner. Would you count calories in that case? Or maybe you would just estimate? I'm sure it's in your ability to do so.

I so often see people in recovery saying that they stopped restricting, or that they don't restrict, and encouraging others to do the same...yet when they show what they actually eat it's just a very normal meal plan with normal or even small-ish portions.

I mean...I don't wanna invalidate or gatekeep them, I'm sure they believe what they say, but is it possible that for every single person in recovery out there ""stop restricting"" magically means ""eating in a very balanced way according to a perfectly crafted meal plan that just allows you to maintain your weight and maybe slowly gain a bit over time""?

I fully embrace the idea of eating without restriction (*truly* without restriction) to recover, whatever way you wanna call it, ""all in"" being one of them. And I also agree with the concepts of accepting yourself at any weight etc.

So just to make that clear beforehand and let you know that we're mostly on the same page recovery wise.

But the problem is, this method of recovery has been ""taken over"" by certain people and rhetorics. Very common concerns in the style of ""will I gain weight forever? Will I just binge myself to oblivion? Will I ever stop eating?"" get dismissed somewhat snidely as disordered thoughts of a poor soul in denial, or worse downright silenced with comments like weight is not correlated to health which are frankly bullshit and make me just as angry as people trying to scare me off purging because ""you only purge half the calories"" or the whole ridiculous starvation mode pseudoscience. Not to mention the ""fatphobia!!"" mantra.

So you inevitably have loads of people that are already in a very shaky, unstable and anxiety-ridden place who get irrationally angry towards it, because they just can't make sense of it and feel they're being treated passively-aggressively as dumb children if they try to raise some concerns and issues.

That's the point - it's not. Not necessarily. Or at least, not in the sense of ""phobia against fat *people*"". Many of us in recovery do not give a shit about fat people honestly - I mean that in a positive sense. You can be afraid of getting fat without having a negative opinion of fat people.

When I was at my lowest weight people would comment and say things. Would they be ok if they were at that weight? No. Were they against thin people? Obviously not.

>We know fat people can be healthy. 

We know that everyone under any circumstance *can* be healthy. I was ""healthy"" at my thinnest. I know plenty of smokers who are healthy. You can, or cannot, be anything.

Additionally, not everything is about diet culture - obviously diet culture is a thing, and a huge thing in EDs, but it can also be irrelevant. For me personally, I had to google what it was at first because not only I had never come across the term, but I never really experienced it in my life. Bringing diet culture into the discussion can be problematic sometimes because it could end up trivializing a person's complex history and upbringing to a one-line issue.

That's really untrue. Most people in real life really (and luckily) have nothing against fat people while not wanting to become fat themselves. Just like people don't want to smoke but they don't have anything against smokers.

That was true for pre-ED me btw - I didn't *want* to become fat but at the same time fat people were never really on my radar. I had/have some in my own family as well. 

>Diet culture specifically stems from fatphobia and racism‚Äîespecially towards black people.

Diet culture is rife in places with no black people at all, or even with an ethnically homogeneous society. I think you're oversimplifying the issue, or maybe you're applying an American-centered bias.

>Idk what you mean by ‚Äúeveryone can be healthy.‚Äù Is that an insinuation that fat people can be healthy but doesn‚Äôt mean they are?

No, it means that fat people can be healthy just like overly thin people can be healthy, smokers can be healthy, binge-drinkers can be healthy.

Over time, it has become widely known and public that fat people can also have EDs - and this awareness in itself is a good thing of course, but their minority has now become dominant in the recovery discourse, and the recovery strategies that are meant to help them have now started to trample any other idea that might be helpful to someone else. For the same reason I've even had someone telling me that ""EDs are rooted in racism"" (?).

Don't get me wrong: I DO believe fatphobia is a thing, I DO praise fat people with EDs for being able to recover and accept their bodies, I DO sympathize with whatever struggle they might face, I DO believe that eating without restriction is the only true key to recover and I am the first one to call out those who bullshit their way into restriction by telling ""I jUsT wAnNa bE HeAlThY!"".

But. I also believe that the whole challenge your inner fatphobia, your ED is rooted in fatphobia etc., is also primarily directed towards fat people themselves and it is meant to help THEM deal with THEIR struggle. And while I do believe that certain parts of this discourse can be helpful for everyone, I also believe that if you just blanket apply the same rhetoric to every possible ED on the planet it just becomes yet another fad trend like the whole 90s media frenzy about fashion catwalks causing teens to starve into anorexia, or those outdated ideas about EDs being caused by young females having mommy issues. It just trivializes both sides of the debate and ultimately doesn't really help anyone - and yes, it also leads to extremes such as the pseudoscience claims you listed.

I guess the point in recovery is not and cannot be to just deny that obesity, or any other kind of weight extreme, can cause negative health outcomes.

I had been restricting heavily for a while, lost a lot of weight, was very underweight and had no idea what was happening to me. I was cold, weak, numb, obsessed with food. I was no longer myself.

And so I did. I enjoyed it. I didn't really care. It was awesome - I got to eat all the food! Got to get rid of my stupid looping thoughts about eating! And leave this scary beast behind for good! 

Then, as I approached my pre-ED weight, I started to get scared that I'd never stop eating. And I turned to the internet for comfort.

(A) Anyone who chooses to address their body dissatisfaction or anxiety or what-have-you by starving themselves or purging is not mentally well to begin with, and

(B) EDs tend to take on a life of their own. Once you start, it's hard to stop. Forgive me for snooping on your profile, but you mentioned before that you've dealt with this for 4+ years now?

comment,2021-08-07 21:26:47,2021-08-07 21:26:47,fuckeatingdisorders,h83lc5u,"I honestly don't think this is an unpopular opinion...it's pretty well-acknowledged amongst the ED circles I'm in that treatment centers are, at best, problematic, and, at worst, actively harmful.

Like you, I think that hospitalization for medical issues (and/or severe psychiatric issues like acute suicidality) followed by individual treatment in the community is the way to go. A few things, though:

First, community-based treatment often relies upon meeting the patient where they're at and working with them to minimize harm/practice harm reduction where it's indicated. The problem with harm reduction is that (a) in the U.S., insurance companies usually have strict criteria for how much progress you ""should"" be making and how fast, and they might not cover services that practice a harm-reductive/patient-centered approach, and (b) individual providers may be hesitant to take on ED patients who they think of as a ""liability,"" especially if they are not making ""enough"" progress or working towards the goals that the provider thinks should be prioritized.

Second, I don't think there's a good solution for treating children and teenagers who point-blank refuse help. The best practice is to use family-based treatment, but FBT will not work in a number of situations. For example, FBT is time- and resource-intensive and probably won't be possible in a family where both parents/caregivers work full-time or in a single-parent household. Also, in a situation where there is abuse, FBT will not be effective. In those situations, it might be in the best interests of the child or teenager to get help in a residential setting. But as someone who received treatment as a teenager in an ethically-questionable facility that has fucked with me long-term, I still feel uneasy saying that.

Finally (and this is purely me playing devil's advocate), I *do* want to point out that you can be grateful that a facility saved your life AND resent the way they went about doing it. Which is certainly the case for me and probably lots of people who have been in inpatient/residential treatment.",,,,sorcerers_apprentice,,-1,-6.7907825,1.0138265

Usually, they *will* start you out on some kind of structured/portioned meal plan so that you can get used to eating an appropriate amount of food again first, but then they'll transition you to following your body's cues. The caveat here is that this initial meal plan will probably be very, very far from restrictive if you are underweight--it will probably be designed for weight gain. Just throwing that out there.

But if you don't think treatment is helpful...maybe it's not. I've always thought it just keeps me stuck in eating disorder world and disconnected from the ""real world""/my actual hopes and dreams and goals in life. In that case, there are lots of resources out there that might appeal to you.

It's embarrassing...I found myself trying to hide my weight much more than when I was younger--not because I didn't want to be ""found out,"" but because I was ashamed of how emaciated I'd become. I was also trying to figure out how to navigate treatment while working a full-time job, and ended up deciding it was not worth it because goddamn is treatment not set up to help adults who have to work. It's depressing, and it's brutal, and it's hard to escape.

I do think recovery is possible though. I'm not ""recovered"" per se, but after getting on the right meds, getting out of an extremely toxic/abusive relationship, and putting effort into surrounding myself with a positive group of people...I'm getting there.

It sounds like you've given your girlfriend some very sound advice, and lots of love (good on you!) and you did everything right, but she's not ready to listen. Sometimes that's the painful thing about eating disorders, people see ""positive"" results (i.e. they start losing weight) and there is just no convincing them that what they're doing is unhealthy because they see weight loss, which they (falsely) equate to health. But as you know, these ""temporary"" behaviors do become habits and we can spiral into some very medically destructive behavior without realizing how much damage we are doing until its way out of control. 

If she said she's only doing it for ""one week"", even though we both know what's likely to happen, just sit her down and say, ""Look, I know you feel like I'm not being supportive but I'm just really worried about your health because I know, because of what I experienced, that you're not eating enough to support your body and feel good. If this is really just for one week, then I can live with that. But in 7 days we need to sit down and make sure we have a plan to get you back on an eating schedule that is metabolically sustainable and I'd like to see you eating more than one meal a day so I know that you're taking care of yourself."" And then once that seven days is over, I would re-present her with that good scientific information you and I both know about chronic restriction and eating disorders.

Even if you can‚Äôt resist them right now, you can change the way you feel about them. Get angry! Be sad! Start countering those thoughts with good information that disarms them: 

Restricting after a meal doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúbalance out‚Äù the calories - we don‚Äôt work like that metabolically. Restricting always puts your body under stress, no matter how much you‚Äôve eaten before.

You can‚Äôt ‚Äúlose‚Äù water weight - the bloating will subside once you‚Äôre eating and drinking enough to recalibrate the minerals in your body.

Eating is not ‚Äúearned‚Äù it is a natural biological process and one of our most basic physical needs. 

Body size or weight gain are not limiting diagnostic factors for eating disorders. Fat ppl have disordered eating. Thin people have disordered eating. It‚Äôs about the behavior, and al of it is harming you.

Even if the behavior doesn‚Äôt change right away, if you can intentionally repeat these truths and counter your ED thoughts with them, you will start giving TRUTH the power, instead of your ED‚Äôs lies.

Two reasons:

1) Differential diagnosis. Especially when it comes to mental health, it is super important that your clinician rule out your ED before treating your symptoms as whatever mental health issue you are there to be treated for. 

2) Medication management. If they're prescribing you medications that may suppress your appetite OR prompt changes in weight, they REALLY need to know this presents additional risks for you. Medications have side effects for everyone; ideally clinician and patient together decide if that benefit-to-cost ratio is therapeutic. 

Mental health treatment should be supportive of your recovery, not working against it, and your psychiatrist can't make sure that happens if they don't know the full picture.",,,,petitelinotte212,,-1,-6.502965,-0.08182173

I don't have a ton of choice when it comes to doctors, thanks US healthcare system, but I would try someone else after this encounter. One way I've learned to broach the subject of ED with new clinicians during a consult, is to simply ask them if they have experience treating patients \[for whatever you are there to be treated for\] with ED.

I'm sure she thinks she's helping, but she doesn't understand ED and carries a lot of the misconceptions most people do around what makes us sick. Unfortunately bringing those misconceptions into your home can really undermine your recovery, and you're going to need to draw some boundaries with her. I would slide some materials her way, maybe just send her some links to websites you think have good and helpful explanations so she can begin to understand why, if she wants to help, demonizing foods and telling you to ""eat less"" is the opposite of helping. The problem isn't the food. The problem is the compulsive need to control and restrict in order to feel ok - and the overwhelming fear of what will happen to our bodies if we're not controlling and restricting that is terrorizing our lives. 

Maybe start by saying, ""you know Mom, I've been thinking about what you said about keeping junk food out of the house and I think what might actually be more helpful than removing the food from the house, is removing the SCALE from the house."" I found it really helpful to stress to my family that my recovery goals were not about my weight in any way, but about healing my relationship to food so I can eat when I'm hungry and not be stressed around meals. Fixating on my weight as it fluctuated in recovery was not only not helpful, but was a huge obstacle to making the right choices for my health.",,,,petitelinotte212,,-1,-7.1670346,0.05557307

comment,2022-06-21 15:19:06,2022-06-21 15:19:06,fuckeatingdisorders,id6vupt,"It is not normal for your fianc√© to be showing you pictures of girls he finds attractive, or pointing out other women he's attracted to. Of course its natural to feel some degree of physical attraction to other people, but I think its really hurtful to bring those images or point out those people to *you*: there's an implied comparison between you and these other women, which is making you feel insecure - and I'm sure he's aware of that, unless he's incredibly stupid. That's not healthy, loving, or supportive, to feel like you're being scrutinized. 

Attraction to purely physical qualities is part of nearly every relationship in the beginning, but by the time you're thinking about things like marriage, your love should have deepened into a stronger bond beyond the physical: there should be admiration, respect, and loyalty that aren't about your appearance. You're going to spend the rest of your life with this person, surely he understands that you will both age, your bodies will change, and you should both expect to be loved regardless. Sex is also not something one party demands and the other submits to - sexual desire should be mutual and shared, as should sexual pleasure, its not an obligation. Its up to both partners to foster desire in their partner if they want to engage in intimacy: if you're not feeling it, and he really wants sex, then he needs to learn what does turn you on and do those things. He doesn't sound very concerned with your pleasure. Is that what you want the rest of your sex life to be?

I don't know my friend, I think the problem here is your fianc√© - you actually sound like you've handled your ED recovery beautifully and he's just dragging you back down. Maybe you *should* just go home and get back into therapy. He's clearly in your head, and as we all do in relationships that aren't the best that we really want to work, you're rationalizing and normalizing this treatment: but it isn't ok. Whether or not you're ""ok with it."" Though I suspect once you're out of his grasp and back in therapy you'll probably realize that you aren't (nor should you be!)",,,,petitelinotte212,,-1,-5.9682393,0.7808565

I'm 37 now and my family still won't acknowledge my eating disorder (my mom still refers to it as my ""body issues"") nor me not being neurotypical, they put me on stimulants as a teenager and when that didn't change me into a different person, they decided I just didn't have the ""willpower"" to ""do better"". Meanwhile I graduated from high school with honors, got myself a scholarship to college where I also worked to support myself, and at the first opportunity moved 3000 miles away from them so I could finally live the life I wanted to and started learning about myself for real. So you're not alone. But its not ok that you're going through this, and one day when you have some distance from the situation and you're living independently, you will be able to heal. Like you've already begun to with your current partner, you will find people who believe you, accept you, and love you unconditionally - and through their example you'll have the opportunity to re-parent yourself in this way. A happy and full life is out there for you, though it may not be accessible right now <3 It gets better. I promise. 

Remember, if your [boundaries](https://www.talkspace.com/blog/family-boundaries/) aren't being respected, you can always leave.

comment,2022-09-14 15:57:52,2022-09-14 15:57:52,fuckeatingdisorders,ioethms,"I def relate - my restriction really ramped up in college because I was broke af (going to college was expensive enough!) and I began skipping meals to see how little money I could spend, it was almost a game to see how low I could get my weekly food budget (got it down to $8 a week once, which should have been a red flag, but I felt like I had really accomplished something!) It gave me *more* positive reinforcement and a pride in not eating because a) I was thinner and b) had more money in my bank account. Both felt like a victory to me. Years later, I wound up in ED treatment, and I *know* those years of scarcity contributed heavily to that. Yes, weight stigma and diet culture drove my ED, but also not wanting to 'waste' my limited funds on food which wasn't about my appearance at all. 

What I'll say about justifying spending money on food when its so easy not to eat: spending $50 a week on food now will cost you a lot less in the long run than spending THOUSANDS on healing from years upon years of the internal ravages of ED. That *will* impact your long-term spending goals, and I can say that with confidence now that I'm 37 and spent the last 6 years spending $120/week on therapy - that's over $37k. Money spent on eating and even some costs to start recovering (of couple of clinic meetings, or some coaching) gives you the greatest cost benefit, and the *sooner* you do it, the more time you'll get back, which compounds your benefit.

That health and healing are things you feel, not things you compute.

I was never outside a ""healthy"" BMI range, even at my sickest, and my life was still down the tubes: and I refuse to be gaslit by people wholly unconnected to me. Don't get me wrong: I rely on physicians for my general health, I'm not at all against science or clinical care.

For example: say a binge you have frozen pizza, ice cream, and a package of cookies. You now have the cardboard pizza box, the plastic the pizza was wrapped in, the cardboard tray the pizza sits on inside of the plastic, the ice cream container and its plastic top, the plastic wrap you peel off the top of the ice cream, the plastic cover for the cookies and the tray the cookies sit in. Just with those three foods alone you now have to discard all of that waste. It piles up *so* quickly!

I‚Äôve been MIA for some time now, both having been in Inpatient and just needing to step away from these communities for a moment. 

I wanted to share with you all that I am currently in kidney failure, and awaiting lab results to determine which stage I am at. I am only 32 years old. There is little hope that I can recover at this point without major medicinal intervention, of which I am not willing to do. I have suffered long enough, and wish to die with my dignity. 

I have suffered for over 25 years with this terrible illness, and I wanted to compassionately warn you all that death by EDs is a VERY REAL THING. I hope this shakes you to your core. I am 32 and dying. It could be within days, or months, but I will die from this. 

I wish you all nothing but healing, and peace. I am terrified. My family is in ruins. I truly cannot believe I am writing this post.

Thank you to every single one of you who has sent me well wishes; I take every word to heart and I have made some beautiful connections here. You are spectacular people, and you deserve full recovery.

Be well, friends ü§ç

ETA: Wow, thank you all for your incredibly kind words of love and support. This is the exact energy we all need, here.

In incredibly surprising news, my lab results are in, and by some chance of all that is good in the world, almost every single value has SHOT up; not just little jumps here and there, like major life-changing amounts. My doctor, family and I are shocked, as I haven‚Äôt changed any behaviors! 

I don‚Äôt know what to make of this; is it a second chance? I have so much thinking to do.

A family tradition is to take a day trip with my family to Sweden to buy cheap food, clothes, electronics and most importantly, candy! Due to covid and ED I haven't been there for 3 years. I always used to buy 1+ kg of assorted candy, and that was always a highlight of my summers.

Fast forward till today, I went to Sweden again with my Dad, but also my ED. We did some shopping, and ate a delicious pizza for lunch, and I ate the whole thing. Then, I went to the candy store: literally being a kid in the candy shop! There are hundreds of different candies, chocolates, caramels, fudge etc. and I went absolutely insane! I picked all the candies I wanted (literally so much chocolate and fudge), and filled my bag with 2,3kg of candy! Not only that, I bought 2 large toblerones, 360g each, so in total over 3kg of candy :-)

So now for the next weeks I'm going to thoroughly enjoy my 3kg of chocolates. And also, dinner today is going to be pizza even though I ate pizza for lunch.

But I absolutely agree that thin privilege is all too real.

Regarding recovery accounts: I avoid them like the plague after I've clicked on some that were linked on various boards.

That's not my reality. My reality is having to deal with the health consequences of long-term ED.

Unfortunately not only the ED community buys into this but also the professionals treating people with EDs.

This. 

Even if one doesn't go down the ""moral failing road"", trying to reassure people with a ""No, you won't get fat!"" implies that it's a thing that needs to be feared. 

My thoughts about this: ""Well, how do you know I won't get fat, especially if there is a lot of weight suppression going on? By telling me that I won't be getting fat you're doing nothing to alleviate my fears, on the contrary.""

She will eat chicken but only seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic. Same with pork and beef and salmon. The other protein she eats is the occasional cocktail shrimp no sauce. For fruit she eats watermelon, grapes, specific types of apples, and mandarin oranges. The only cooked vegetable she will eat is green beans. She eats all colors of bell peppers, cucumbers, celery, baby spinach, and lettuce but it has to be shredded. She is fine with most starches but will only eat potatoes in the form of fries from very specific places. The only sauce she will eat is alfredo. She will not touch anything that has tomatoes. So no ketchup, no pizza sauce, no spaghetti sauce. She can tell if I bought a new kind of pasta.

She has intense anxiety surrounding food. She needs to have control over what she eats. She has been like this since she was a toddler. At 12 she is better. We have a system worked out. If I am cooking something she doesn't like she is allowed to make her own dinner. She can cook and is quite the avid baker. If I am making pasta alfredo she gets pasta with alfredo sauce on top and whatever meat element on the side. For tacos she gets unseasoned ground beef, a tortilla,  a pile of cheese, a pile of shredded lettuce, and sometimes a pile of sour cream. These are all eaten separately. For spaghetti she gets plain noodles and usually adds parmesan. 

This is just a general idea of her around food. Does this sound like ARFID to you?

comment,2021-04-24 09:10:07,2021-04-24 09:10:07,bulimia,gvnwf7d,"Binge eating is a coping mechanism that you use, because you had to figure one out on your own. You were never taught how to cope in a different way, so don't beat yourself up about it. Even about the eating meat (I'm not a meat eater too), it's more than okay to slip up here, not even just because of the ED, but because you are a human being and no human is perfect.

It's really hard to pull yourself out of a depression, but it will pass. When I'm in this phase I will have a list of 'bare minimum' activities to do, including passions that relax me like art. And then if I have a day that's better I'll commit to doing a bit more like a walk outside, work, etc., But the important thing is that my expectations are realistic and not another thing I can beat myself up about. It's important that you know you are doing the best you can right now, and you will get back to your normal and best self.

Covid makes it all so much harder, but when you're ready throw yourself into making friends. Join a club, find a group hobby, a yoga class or meditation class or something.

While I got diagnosed with anorexia a few weeks back (she doesn't know, just my dad), and I highly suspect I inherited it from her. The only difference is that hers remains hidden while mine blew up. 

Now, I decided to challenge myself to eating a banana cause I really really wanted to eat one and I wanted to beat the fear of fruits that I have. Because I, with all my heart, love fruits and know they're extremely healthy. 

Anyway, I grabbed the banana and sat next to her and she went like: ""be sure not to have more than two a day.""

My hands were already shaking from having the banana, but I turned to her and asked why and SHE LEGIT SAID: Carbs.

The thing is, she doesn't know about my eating disorder (just my dad) but we've kinda been on the same boat.

Recently, we bought a crazy amount of seasonal fruits and we made a fruit salad. I, at the very beginning of my ED, was very afraid of fruits but I forced a habit onto myself, which was to eat fruits as much as I want, cause I refused to put them under my ""fear food"" list. I just love them too much to do that.

My mom, however, only sticks to oranges and apples because she's absolutely afraid of bananas and pretty much all fruits BUT when she saw me grab two plates of fruit salad, she kinda got encouraged into grabbing one herself and SHE CUT A BANANA INTO IT.

I had a bad headache, couldn't look at lights, had ringing in my ears, and the cherry on top was my stomach. It was in so much pain, literally could feel indigested food roll around in it and cause severe stabbing pains. I was so lightheaded and detached I could barely walk. 

But later on in the day, with the help of medications and subtle self-care, my body fought off the fever and... ü•∫ 

Ugh I'm gonna cry. 

My joints are so much better, my stomach is kinda still in pain but waaaay better than this morning, I'm no longer lightheaded and I overall feel great now that the fever is gone. 

So it dawned on me... 

My body, single-handedly pulled through. It fought off the sickness and took care of the pain, all on its own. 

Though yes, I'm still on my bullshit and weight loss is still my one main goal, but something clicked in my mind even if only for today. 

I will listen to my body's cravings. Just for today, I will eat what it's been craving for days now. Just for today, I'll reward it for what it's done for me. Just for today, I'll have it eat as much as it wants till it feels satisfied.

comment,2020-12-26 19:20:15,2020-12-26 19:20:15,AnorexiaNervosa,gh3fx7f,"All very, very good reasons:)

-Memory! I used to have good long- and short term memory. Now I can‚Äôt remember if I even locked my front door or what my friend told me thirty seconds ago.

-Cognition! The brain fog makes me miserable and renders me unable to function in my job.

-Mood and humour! When did I lose my jibe? When did I start existing like a ghoul sent to plague my surroundings like a dark cloud?

-Peace of mind! I‚Äôm so jittery and anxious every waking hour, and even when I am able to fall asleep, which is rare, I sleepwalk, and it‚Äôs getting dangerous. One morning I had unlocked my front door (fortunately not the security chain). This may not be eating disorder specific, but it‚Äôs probably connected to my being angst ridden and miserable.

-For my family! My GP told me the straight facts, and my parents, however much they fucked me up should not have to bury me, nor should my niece and nephew have to know that their aunt died because she didn‚Äôt eat.

-I actually know how to cook. So having friends over and making dinner for them without spending the day in complete panic would be nice.

My silouette du jour is wide jeans and wide shirts, I kinda look like a banner. I don‚Äôt wear tight fitting clothes ever. I have to look semi presentable for work (rarely full business formal fortunately), but I can get away with jeans and a fine knit wool sweater or button downs most days. This winter I wore two pairs of presentable wool trousers that both fit well enough with a belt that I didn‚Äôt look too crazy, with very large and long (but nice quality) wool sweaters. It suggests the general idea of a professional-ish person, but renders it impossible to gauge the shape of my body. For spring I‚Äôm in dark wash, wide jeans and big button downs. I find for work the trick to mitigate this hobo look is materials, cuts, shoes and coats as well as being groomed. I wear a-line or men‚Äôs section coats without belts at the waist. For summer it‚Äôs basically the same, only swap jeans for linen suit pants or similar. Colour is also important for looking put-together (and invisible), I have a lot of black and dark blues for bottoms and sweaters because it‚Äôs so easy to combine. Trousers that fit me at the waist are usually too tight for my taste over hips, buttocks and legs, so I size way up and alter them at the waist. Probably wouldn‚Äôt if I had to pay for the alteration, but I‚Äôve learned how to do it myself. 

If I‚Äôm not working it‚Äôs very baggy, but nice clothes that I like. I‚Äôm currently not in any zoom meetings (halleluja), and the past two weeks I‚Äôve been in just huge, nice heavy cotton t shirts that go beneath the buttocks and beneath the elbow and levi‚Äôs high ribcage wide in the indigo wash. I look like a cartoon, but I actually like it very much. And a hooded, thin parka. I prefer clothing that‚Äôs not cinched waists and such, I‚Äôm sure that helps me. (I realize now I don‚Äôt sound terribly chic.)

The safe hoodie is a hero! My favourite one went out of production, but I wore my last one until the sun and the salt from my persoiration had mostly bleached it from navy to a weird beige:) RIP hoodie (2014-2020)",,,,pathologicalprotest,,-1,-7.5559673,-3.42225

Do you know how many times I've been told to take the high road in my life? Do you know how many times it's actually solved anything? On a Venn diagram, it's two circles with zero intersection.

All taking the high road means is that you act like it never happened, and if you act like it never happened, then it comes across as ""it was OK, not a big issue"".

You take the high road on minor disagreements like getting into a row over decorating or going or spending too much on a hobby. Not on someone putting expired milk into the safe food of someone with ARFID, then smugly announcing it to them. OP literally said they've now lost an entire *category* of safe foods.

If you've got ARFID or live with someone who has, you know the impact that losing a safe food can have.

>That seems a bit over the top and dramatic over an easily fixable situation. Just move on and take the steps to ensure your food is prepared the way you like it. No need to snub your Mom.

What planet do you live on?

Easily fixable? Unless you've got a time machine in your back yard, it's happened, it's not happening. The mother has violated trust, damaged her childs already limited diet and actually thinks they did the right thing.

Snubbing her is the *absolute bare minimum* she deserves - it shows her that her actions have consequences. Honestly, I wouldn't blame OP if they moved out and went no contact permanently.

And it's not a case of ""make sure the food is prepared the way you like it"". The mother *knows* how to prepare it. She just doesn't give a shit and decided to violate trust to prove that a mental illness is all in the head. No shit. That's why its called a MENTAL ILLNESS.",,,,axw3555,,-1,-3.3186247,-3.369579

The one I would probably take is the hot headed one - give them an ultimatum - the next time they try something like that, you will fucking humiliate them, no matter who is there. 

My mum does it sometimes with me (no malice, she just says something without thinking). Last time I got so annoyed because she wouldn‚Äôt drop it with the waitress at the table that I brought up literally everything she‚Äôd ever mentioned not liking - fish, sweet corn, Oreo cookies on the desserts. Just kept reaming it off and asking if she wanted them added to her meal.

The cooler approach would be to point out that if she does that in public without thinking, it might end up giving her a reputation. Like that old story of the woman who went full Karen in a Starbucks on the way to an interview, held up the whole place.

When she got to the interview, her interviewer had been in the line behind her, and her behaviour had given a bad impression of her to the interviewer. The interviewer just went ‚Äúafter what I saw this morning, I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll waste the time‚Äù.

So if your sister doesn‚Äôt learn to keep her trap shut and reel her behaviour in, she could end up doing real damage to her prospects in life.",,,,axw3555,,-1,-7.5734735,0.23208131

Generally, the more specialist the subreddit, the less chance there is of running into an asshole (probably because in a sub with 30k members, 10% actively posting, consistent asshole behaviour is more likely to stand out than it is in a 1.5m member sub with 10% posting).

So if you goto ARFID, FairyTail (an anime), StormlightArchive, etc, you'll get a lot more tolerance than you will in AskReddit or News (and that goes tenfold for StormlightArchive and the other Brandon Sanderson subs - the closest I've seen to asshole behaviour there in literal years of browsing StormlightArchive, Cosmere, Mistborn, are things like disagreements over the interpretation of in-universe abilities, and those never go beyond disagreement).

Then there's the simple anonymity factor. I'd place good money that virtually none of these jackasses would be willing to say any of it to your face. But behind the anonymity of a free username they can dump whenever they want, they'll say anything they feel like.

comment,2021-10-20 02:27:40,2021-10-20 02:27:40,EatingDisorders,hhbbu5o,"I am really confused here. What exactly DO you want? You don't want inpatient, and you don't want outpatient. You don't want professionals who are educated to help you, you don't want anything that resembles a meal plan, you don't want anyone to enforce normal eating habits.What actually does *effective help* mean to you?

I'm also curious, what is your ED about? What purpose does it serve? Why are you scared of change? If what you're saying is true - there seems to be nothing stopping you from ""just eating"" other than your own free will .. why can you not just do that? Why can't you binge and not purge, knowing that eventually your body will not longer need to binge? You obviously cannot be afraid of gaining weight if you are worried that treatment restricts your eating, most people are terrified of being given too much. 

I feel like you just want this magic wand waved, but thats not going to happen. You can recover on your own - you know what you need to do and you have the desire to do it - so go ahead? Most people who need treatment centres do so to learn the exact things you don't want a bar of (portion control, meal times etc) and to work through whats driving the ED (control/emotions etc which do not appear to apply to you).

If you do not want to go residential or outpatient, my practical advice would be to read Brain over Binge. Once you've committed yourself to stop purging and stop restricting, you will stop binging too. But it has to be in that order. It sounds too easy, but the way you're describing your ED, it sounds 'too easy,' I'm not sure if it's denial, but I really want you to think about WHY change is so hard. Because from what you've said, it's very much ALL about control.",,,,runninginbubbles,,-1,-5.4525695,-0.8903307

While the 'cause' doesn't necessarily need to be psychological, the reason we *hold on* to our EDs, and are so resistant to treatment, is very much a psychological thing. This is what I mean by 'a purpose.' If our ED gave us no perceived benefit, or served no purpose, we'd give it up in an instant. But there is SOMETHING that keeps us hooked onto the thoughts. And for you it sounds like it's partly phobia of weight gain. Which is common in EDs, but it is psychological, and it's irrational - gaining weight is not a bad thing. You will not binge yourself to death, you will not become morbidly obese. (All phobias are psychological. And my grandma did a fear-of-flying course, they absolutely do share the chances of being in a crash - the minimal risk actually helps people realise planes are safe)

No one is 'judging you' or making you restrict. If you had three bowls of cereal at home, you'd probably restrict later on to compensate? That's contributing to this binge/restrict cycle. In treatment, they'll teach you to eat one bowl, that's not restriction - that's normal, and train you sit with the urges to eat more. In a few hours, you may be given a snack, and then lunch. That's what normal eating is. Until your brain knows that it will get food soon, it will constantly be urging you to binge.  You cannot trust your own brain right now to tell you what it needs, because it's starving. You need other people to make those decisions, and not wanting to do so, is a form of needing 'control.' You need to re-wire your brain, and the only way to do that is sustained, regular eating patterns. And if you can't do that in the community, you will need residential care to fix it.

**Unfortunately with recovery, the only way through is to allow yourself to feel the guilt and discomfort when you binge, without purging, and without restricting. You will binge, it will happen. But you have to learn to sit with it and not compensate, that is the only way to stop doing so. You need to gain to a healthy weight, and you will feel fat. Recovery is uncomfortable. You will feel all the things that were suppressed by your ED.  And sometimes I believe that it's only during recovery, that we realise what exactly what our ED served us, what it's purpose was and the reason we relied so heavily on it.**",,,,runninginbubbles,,-1,-5.558491,-1.0922639

Then what, you'll panic, and purge or restrict? A person who is so deep in their ED cannot make decisions around food, your decision is too clouded by what your ED has to say about it. You need to let someone make the decisions for you, and accept that perhaps you don't know best when you're in this frame of mind. You being combative isn't helping. A treatment centre won't make you restrict. 
Binge eating is self harm behaviour, so I'm not going to say it's good. Look, the only way you're going to stop binging is by NOT restricting or purging afterwards. You have to be able to sit with a binge.",,,,runninginbubbles,,-1,-5.4002247,-1.0349236

Restriction is eating less than what your body requires. A treatment centre will not do that, and I highly doubt you will be hungry when you're there. They give you enough. ""If i want more than what they give and they don't allow me to get it"" - that just sounds childish imo.

&#x200B;

>*That binging is bad, that I don't really need that food, and therefore I should keep restricting because it's all just in my head and one bowl of cereal is enough.*

You're forgetting there is plenty of middle ground. Just because binging is bad doesn't mean you should keep restricting. Restricting is even more bad for you. Both are self-harming. (And three bowls of cereal is not a binge - I am talking about binge eating as in thousands of calories in one sitting) Your binges are purely reactive eating, that is a response to starvation. They will not stop until you start eating enough and regularly. 

&#x200B;

>*So if a starving boy in Syria binges, he's self harming?*

Are you actually comparing eating disorders to extreme poverty?   


I'm going to leave the conversation here. Until you accept that you need to stop restricting in order to stop binging (or reactively eating.. whatever you call it), you will not get better. I had extreme hunger for about 8 months, and most certainly binge ate most days. I eventually gained to a healthy weight, and now I don't binge.

Unpopular opinion incoming - **please remember that someone 'not being valid to me' doesn't mean they don't have an issue. Me 'not believing they have an ED' doesn't mean they DON'T. My opinion really doesn't matter. You don't have to think I am valid either!** 

A friend of mine used to talk about the time she had an (undiagnosed) ED when we were in high school. I don't call what she 'went through' an ED for various reasons I won't get into.

I think a lot of people on tiktok/instagram etc claim to have EDs that don't - they have disordered eating or get a bit obsessed with diet/exercise. I don't think many of them have valid EDs. 

Nowdays, many of the above people could get diagnosed if they went to their doctor and listed off the symptoms they've convinced themselves they have. For example, if you scroll tiktok, you can pretty much learn what you'd need to say to get diagnosed. 

I used to follow a number of girls who are diagnosed who also have personality disorders, I truly believed they exaggerated their ED symptoms as a way to seek attention (seeking attention isn't necessarily bad, it's a part of their illness/trauma response).

\- Extreme weakness. Started with things like struggling to lift legs to get up stairs, then being unable to bend down to pick something up (unable to stand back up) then struggling to stand from a sitting position, then having to physically pick up and move one leg at a time to get onto the bed, paralysis of one side of the body and eventually being unable to lie flat because he was certain he'd not beable to push himself back up. 

\- Incontinence, bladder and bowels. 

\- Heart rate irregularities - really slow to really fast

\- Difficulty swallowing, every swallow felt like choking. Eventually he'd just spit rather than swallow.

Anorexia is the complete opposite of that though. Anorexia creates a LOT of food noise and a huge obsession with food. 

>People are paying to inject themselves with drugs to help them basically become more anorexic... 

Ozempic doesn't make people have anorexia. It helps obese people lose weight and become a healthy weight. Not severely underweight.

People want to 'low key' be slim , not anorexic.

""I think the only people capable of being an effective ED specialist are those with lived experiences of EDs?""

I disagree wholeheartedly. Providers use evidence based models of treatment, which is pretty standard across the board. Regular, adequate nutrition is key. Clinical psychology to address underlying stuff sure. But the knowledge these professionals have can be taught. They can't learn what it truly feels like, but I believe that is not a necessary part of treatment. There is not one thing that a person can say that can make you want to recover. It has to come from you. And it's as simple and as difficult as eating regularly, restoring nutrition (and weight, FULLY) and consciously, consistently choosing to go against the ED. And you don't need a person with lived experience to tell you that.

Peer support has its place. In fact can be very useful for some illnesses, but ED's? Mmm, not always. I think people with lived experiences with EDs should be very careful about going into work in the field. A lot of people with eds are driven into nutrition/psychology/mental health nursing degrees/careers and it does not come from the right place. We're obsessed with food, it's expected that we'd go into a job that could focus on food, weight and eating disorders - we want our lives to revolve around it. It is about you, rather than the people you treat. 

I couldn't think of anything worse than having someone with lived experience of an ED treating me (unless it was a very long time ago) because I wouldn't trust their motive to be there.",,,,runninginbubbles,,-1,-6.648253,0.68086183

It‚Äôs good if u can make it yourself so it can be healthy like some good flour and less oil. You can even switch the cheeses to some healthier ones and try to reduce cheese and oil overall. Having a protein with this could be great - look into what you would like. ( if u are like me and hate any protein options you can go for protein shakes!). 
I remember some cake recipes for picky eaters (I‚Äôm sorry for saying this but the video was taking about this) showed how one could add vegetable and protein like chickpeas while baking cakes and bread it wouldn‚Äôt be noticeable see if u can do that

I think including some vegetable/salad/protein would be helpful- even if it‚Äôs one bite. (For example I hated cucumbers all my life until I dipped it in hummus and I can eat a vegetable now yay even though I can eat it with only hummus hehe)

I had no idea how malnourished I was until I started taking a multivitamin. Like seriously, taking just the one pill a day made a huge difference in a lot of things I didn‚Äôt know needed improvement.

Tw- Self Harm

>!One of the weirdest things I noticed about taking vitamins was how frustrating it made self harm. It was so annoying!! It was like any time I got enough blood flow to be satisfying it‚Äôd start clotting. Then I realised it was because I‚Äôd been taking a multivitamin... basically I‚Äôd just grown accustomed to having very little clotting factor and was annoyed that my body was working properly.!<

Also, a dentist asking numerous questions about my vitamin intake and stuff was confusing until they asked specifically about vitamin C. I had to live with the realisation that they were trying to figure out if I had *scurvy.* 

Granted I am more susceptible to side effects of malnutrition because I grew up malnourished af, but I still was surprised by these things.

I‚Äôve had issues with people watching me eat because of this super traumatic thing when I was 7, so even if I didn‚Äôt have a restrictive ED it would have fucked me up. I couldn‚Äôt even manage to eat at school until the end of high school over that, like forcing me to eat (especially while being watched) was bullshit. 

My sister used to buy me high-calorie snack foods and give me a due date. Like here‚Äôs one of those like 2 foot tall tubs of cheese balls, have it gone Friday. I had mixed feelings about that because on one hand she asked if I wanted her help and I said yes, but on the other using guilt from people spending money on me to make me eat sucked.

comment,2021-04-23 21:09:08,2021-04-23 21:09:08,AnorexiaNervosa,gvm1bj9,"My parents trained me to have anorexia, like I have been obsessed with not gaining weight for as long as I can remember, like years before I learned what calories were in 5th grade health class. That being said, I only have ‚Äúdon‚Äôts‚Äù to share.

Don‚Äôt force her to eat. After I was diagnosed at 15, my parents would sit and watch me eat and not let me get up until I cleaned my plate. All that did was lead to me throwing it up, and it made me feel more panicked.

Don‚Äôt ever comment about anything at all in terms of nutrition facts. Never do it. When I was 22 I bought myself instant breakfast when I was trying to stop losing weight because my brain decided that beverages didn‚Äôt count. My dad walked by and went ‚Äúoh my god, do you have any idea how much sugar is in that?!‚Äù It‚Äôs been almost 2 years and I haven‚Äôt touched it since. The idea of it makes me cry. There are a million examples of this, but it always gets under your skin and you remember it forever. A passing comment for you about food content can easily become an obsessive fear for your child with this illness. 

Don‚Äôt comment on her body at all. ‚ÄúYou look so much healthier!‚Äù means ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre weight gain is super obvious. You look fat and disgusting. You need to stop.‚Äù But also, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too thin!‚Äù means ‚ÄúThank fuck, it‚Äôs working. I can‚Äôt stop now.‚Äù Like this is a mental illness and brains will do literally anything to make a comment about weight feed into the disorder. My parents never did this, they said things like ‚Äúoh good you‚Äôve lost weight. Don‚Äôt gain it back.‚Äù To be clear, they‚Äôd say it when I was underweight. But that one is more obviously bad, so I used examples that people in town have told me instead.

Don‚Äôt comment on anyone else‚Äôs bodies, not even your own. My dad is fatphobic and would mock random people on the street, and like now I just think everyone thinks those things but like only about me. My mom would grab at her stomach in the mirror and tell me how much she hated it and how disgusting she felt, even when I was like 6. There wasn‚Äôt anything wrong with her stomach, at least not to me. If her healthy stomach was disgusting, what did that mean about mine?? I had bad body dysmorphia, and I thought my stomach was much larger than hers. When I was 12 my dad came to me and instructed me to manipulate my mom into running on the treadmill because if she didn‚Äôt start losing weight now she‚Äôd just keep gaining it. She‚Äôd had a baby 3-4 months prior to this convo. He at least tried to pretend to care about her health, so even if we pretend I believed him, telling me he wants me to help her because he loves her told me that nobody loves you if you‚Äôre even a little overweight. It‚Äôs a mental disorder, your brain makes weird shit up. If you talk about weight, your brain will find a way to make it motivate you to restrict. 

Don‚Äôt accuse her of throwing up if she‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs just hurtful and offensive. Then you think oh if they thought I was throwing up it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm eating too much and should be throwing up, so then you feel like you have to. 

Don‚Äôt lie to her about her body. People around town like to lie about my body. They‚Äôll comment on it and I‚Äôll say I have anorexia and am Xlbs underweight, and comments about my body make it harder to make healthy choices. Then they‚Äôll try to lie. Obviously telling me I look healthy and just fine when I can see most of my bones is a bad idea. You might want to help her feel better about her appearance, but definitely never lie. If you have body dysmorphia you almost have to believe the people around you, and when they‚Äôre lying it can seriously mess with your concept of reality.

Don‚Äôt make her feel guilty. My sister used to buy me high-calorie things and give me a deadline I had to eat it by. I felt guilty that she spent money on me and I knew I‚Äôd disappoint her if I didn‚Äôt eat it, but it just led to me shamefully eating it as fast as I could while I cried. At the time I thought it was nice because it was the only time anyone had ever cared enough to want me to try to do better. I wouldn‚Äôt actually wish that on anyone else, though. 

Don‚Äôt tell anyone. I know you might want to talk to your own parents, but please don‚Äôt. When mine did that it made it super uncomfortable to talk to my grandma and aunt who I‚Äôd been close with, and it‚Äôs taken me nigh on a decade to try to get past that. People treat you different, even when they mean well. You can tell if someone told them. Feeling like everyone knew just made me feel extremely ashamed and exposed. It also felt like my parents betrayed me. 


Sorry for the long comment. I tried to explain why I chose each of the points I made because like they don‚Äôt make a ton of sense without the background of what the disorder hears and tells you. I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs all universal, but I know at least some of it is. You can also hear about it on YouTube, just search something like what anorexics want their parents to know. I think I‚Äôve seen a few videos listed under that premise",,,,petewentz-from-mcr,,-1,-7.3096485,-0.08637646

I went to an auto shop today because my battery isn‚Äôt working. When he told me how much they cost I cried, which is embarrassing enough. It‚Äôs not as bad as having your card declined on a $3 purchase or something, like plenty of people don‚Äôt just casually have $200! I don‚Äôt even think that reveals me to be low income tbh. He said we could try charging my battery to see if that helps, so I was hanging around the store for about half an hour while it charged. I took off my hoodie and coat because it would be a while and if I get used to inside temperature with them on then I‚Äôm fucked for outside. They offered me a candy bar and I thanked them but politely turned them down. Something that isn‚Äôt strange or sus. 

I could hear them whispering to each other, like ‚Äúwhen do you think was the last time she had a meal?‚Äù 

They thought I was starving. Like, going hungry. 

Super awkward. I wanted to disappear, to disintegrate. To cease to exist. 

They offered me a muffin from like a 4 pack and stressed that if I didn‚Äôt eat it, it‚Äôd be thrown away. I did not want this muffin, but it felt like it‚Äôd be selfish to turn it down. They were trying to be so nice, and I‚Äôm out here misleading people just by existing in my body. I feel so guilty and horrible. 

My finances are basically nonexistent right now, but they didn‚Äôt even know that. They just knew I didn‚Äôt have $200 and look like this.

This isn‚Äôt the first time people have come to that assumption, like people offer to buy my groceries for me kind of a lot if they see me checking out, especially if they see me change my mind about something. I don‚Äôt let them, it just feels so wrong. But this was the worst it‚Äôs ever been, I think because I heard them mention my weight/body.

Just wanted to let y'all know that I have spent the past few months directing an ARFID documentary. We wrap on it later this month and hope to have a premiere sometime in upcoming months as it goes to the festival circuit. 

I made this to help raise awareness to ARFID as so many people have no idea it even exists. 

Check out the trailer below for ""Not Just a Picky Eater""!

The 2023 update I include at the end of the movie does add another tie to autism. Here‚Äôs a longer excerpt from the article: 

The researchers discovered that the genetic component for developing ARFID was high, 79 per cent. This means that 79 per cent of the risk of developing ARFID are explained by genetic factors.

‚ÄúThis study suggests that ARFID is highly heritable. The genetic component is higher than that of other eating disorders and on par with that of neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism and ADHD,‚Äù says Dr. Dinkler.",,,,solidsimpson,,-1,-3.314966,-4.069655

comment,2023-02-16 10:21:11,2023-02-16 10:21:11,ARFID,j8r42j8,"I'm vegan with ARFID and I found it was really hard to give up cheese because of my condition, as pizza is one of the only things I can eat. I eventually went fully vegan by making myself try loads of different alternative cheeses (most of which were horrid) until I found one that I actually liked. Since bread is a safe food I also tried varying the types of bread I have, like sourdough, focaccia, seeded, etc., so you could try finding variants of a safe food. I think there's very few excuses for eating animal products but ARFID is one of them, because I know exactly what it's like to have it. If a large amount of the foods you can eat have animal products in and you can't eat the alternatives made without it, then you shouldn't feel bad for buying them, because otherwise you might starve. Yes, animal products cause suffering and death, but being vegan is about existing whilst causing the least harm possible, not just cutting out animal products. Therefore I'd consider someone who wants to give up animal products but can't because of ARFID pretty much vegan anyway. It's good that you want to, and if you find any alternatives that's great, but not at the expense of your own wellbeing.",,,,Manospondylus_gigas,,-1,-2.6160507,-3.5634446

Law ‚â† morality. Many ethical things are illegal and many unethical things are legal. 

Cannibalism doesn't cause health issues if you do your research first (i.e. not eating the brain and ovaries). 

It's not morally wrong if it's done consentually. Why assume all cannibalism is unethical?

comment,2021-01-18 13:39:45,2021-01-18 13:39:45,EatingDisorders,gjpvrpn,"I think the common thought (and probably the right one) is to not focus on weight loss during this stage of your recovery. And I agree, because I'm doing the same thing and it is a constant struggle.

That being said, this is what worked for me (for about a month before relapsing since the new year): eating *really* healthy meals and working out. That helped disrupt the b/p cycle because I didn't feel as much guilt after eating. Working out helped because burning all that energy made my body desperate enough for energy that I was GOING to eat. It's easy to starve yourself of nutrients if you then just lay in bed all day; it's harder if you're maintaining a somewhat active lifestyle.

My meals were usually a meat, a cooked vegetable, and some sort of huge salad with cheese, craisins, whatever crispy toppings i like, and a homemade dressing (so i could control the amount of salt, fat, and sugar). I tried to minimize saturated fats and sugar, but not shy away from them if needed (like, i don't need butter on broccoli, but I didn't want to hold myself back from adding a bit of honey, cheese, or EVOO to something if i know I'll really enjoy it). As my workout intensity increased I noticed I was getting lots of headaches and tried integrating more carbs, which definitely helped; for me that meant a plain, baked sweet potato or sometimes brown rice. I snacked on fruits and had greek yogurt with granola, dark chocolate, and craisins for when i was caving something sweet. Or a cup of hot chocolate. Or cookies and milk if I felt like living dangerously  :) 

For exercise I literally just jogged in place in my apartment. Sometimes while watching TV. Sometimes listening to the Hamilton soundtrack. Sometimes fast, sometimes just walking. Not necessarily hitting a number of steps, but trying to beat my lowest number over the previous seven days. AND I didn't weigh myself. Weight loss was based on how my clothes fit and comparing my overall fitness (i.e. only being able to jog for like 20 seconds vs 10 minutes)

For me, this was the healthiest I'd been since the pandemic causing ALL my ED behaviors to flair up in the worst way, and I'm trying to fall back into it. I liked being able to enjoy food and enjoy my body without fighting the urge to punish it every time I ate something. 

Good luck with all the things!",,,,AnaDion94,,-1,-5.30582,-1.8436685

For me, what works best (and i got about 6 weeks in with no issues before relapsing due to the holidays) is eating a lot of super healthy food and doing some amount of exercise. I think i initially gained a few pounds, because my body wasn't used to digesting, but then starting losing much more effectively than i was pre-recovery. 

Most of my dinners were a giant salads, lean protein, and some cooked vegetable, only limiting refined sugars and saturated fat, but not particularly strictly. I started integrating carbs (sweet potatoes, whole grains) once my workouts got more intense, and I could feel that I needed more energy. But generally, I find that working out (and by working out i mean i jog in front of the TV and sometimes do squats) and eating healthy foods helped eliminate the guilt trigger and ""purge"" response and also kept me from gaining while recovering.",,,,AnaDion94,,-1,-5.3554964,-1.9001703

On vacation with my boyfriend and trying out new restaurants? I can just opt to not care. I‚Äôll probably care later. I‚Äôll probably freak out and weigh myself when I get home.

I‚Äôm mid-30s, been dealing with this BS for 2 decades, and am in the middle of a relapse I didn‚Äôt realize was happening in 2021 until it was too late to pull myself out. I‚Äôve been trying like hell to follow my team‚Äôs plan, but the ED voice is so loud.

And not just to me. It effects my husband more than anything, and  that pisses me off. My ED makes me a callous bitch, who has the ability to say extremely hurtful things I never would say in my right mind, and my poor husband always gets the brunt of it. And he is THE most supportive and patient person on the planet. Last night there was a blow up so bad that he broke down crying, saying he felt like he‚Äôs living with an abuser, because the ED is running the show. He wasn‚Äôt calling me an abuser, but he said when the ED has taken over to this extent, every day feels like he‚Äôs living through abuse and gaslighting. I can honestly say I never realize/intend for it to happen, but hearing him say that as he broke down in tears last night absolutely destroyed me and made me want to fight like hell to never make him feel that way again. I may be the worst wife ever, but I‚Äôm determined to get back to the version of me he fell in love with years ago. I had an ED, still, but I also had a personality‚Ä¶fun‚Ä¶laughter‚Ä¶hobbies‚Ä¶interests‚Ä¶the ability to care about others or anything in life‚Ä¶a functioning brain‚Ä¶all things my ED steals when it‚Äôs running our life. And I say our life, because it‚Äôs never only the person with the ED who‚Äôs suffering as a result of the ED.

However, at some point 6-7 years ago, I realized just how powerful the ending (of this memoir, obviously she‚Äôs still doing amazing things) was, and I instituted a rule that said if I decided to read it, which I did, often, I had to read it all the way through to the last page. 

I realized if I did that, it even took some of the triggering power away from the previous passages I‚Äôd reread countless times for that purpose.

But I‚Äôm 34. I‚Äôve had this disorder for 20 years, and have avoided getting a DEXA scan since the one I got in 2004. And I now know why.

Because today, I was informed I have full-blown osteoporosis. At 34. And that‚Äôs one of the only irreversible conditions/effects of this disorder. If I were younger, under 30, even, I would have a better chance at rebuilding bone mineral density.

But now‚Ä¶the best I can hope for is first and foremost trying to keep aiming for nutritional rehabilitation, and taking meds as a second line defense to halt further bone density loss. I can‚Äôt get it back. 

I can‚Äôt get 20 years of my life back. I can‚Äôt get back my ability to do the things I love the most (sports like ice skating and skateboarding) without major danger. I can‚Äôt get back the years in which I probably would have been able to have my own children.

I‚Äôm 34 years old, and I feel stupid for being this upset at this news, but also‚Ä¶I‚Äôm just 34. It feels suffocating to think about the reality of this not getting better, and the best case scenario just being pausing the damage that‚Äôs been done.

Fuck these disorders. Fuck EDs for not letting us see how much danger we‚Äôre in. Fuck the ED denial that tells us we‚Äôre the one person who won‚Äôt have [problem X]. And most of all, fuck me for not finding a way to break free for 2 freaking decades, until this damage was done.

I‚Äôm sorry for the tone, I‚Äôm just lying here on my bed in tears, beating myself up for this extremely real wake/up call of a physical issue as a result of this mental freaking illness and it all feels so‚Ä¶exhaustingly overwhelming. I‚Äôm so mad that I relapsed majorly last year without realizing until it was too late. And I hate myself for not being able to keep this from happening.

My doctor did say there was a possibility that we could arrest the progress and keep it where it is for many, many years, but I know the practice she is with is on the front lines of the field in the research for bone density (I‚Äôm seeing them in a scholarship/grand I was granted after applying a few months ago, otherwise I would probably still be in the dark on this), especially in regards to SE-AN, so I am pretty sure she at least has some ideas to try, on the off chance they can actually improve and help me get any of my BMD back, I think she just didn‚Äôt feel like she could promise that since there‚Äôs no guarantee.

And the eating disordered part of your brain (‚ÄúED‚Äù) is freaking terrified‚Äìbut it‚Äôs coming out as anger because that‚Äôs an easier emotion to feel than the terror, especially when you‚Äôre in a situation like being inpatient.

AND, I want to echo a little of what others have said, while also holding space for the valid emotions you‚Äôre experiencing. This is a mental illness, and one that requires weight monitoring, especially in an inpatient setting. 

If you‚Äôre getting inpatient care, it means you need that care. No EDU is admitting patients who don‚Äôt need the level care, because insurance wouldn‚Äôt cover it. Most outpatient providers can‚Äôt ethically work with someone who is medically unsafe, and again, that‚Äôs likely why you‚Äôre inpatient right now. 

As much as it sucks, it IS also just part of how treatment works. Especially when going through nutritional rehabilitation and/or weight restoration. It‚Äôs extremely common for blind weights to be the norm, and I‚Äôm not sure any ED-specific facility would let an adolescent see it, even if they allow adults the choice (some do‚Äìbut definitely not all‚Äìand some that do only really show you a range/trend). I don‚Äôt know how old you are, OP, but if you‚Äôre under 18 (or even under 21, with close family involvement), that can play a factor. But even if you‚Äôre an adult, this can be distressing‚Ä¶and in some places may be policy.

Again, it sucks, and as much as your brain is fighting against it (because that‚Äôs what the disordered brain does), it‚Äôs also for your long term benefit. And the cruel part of this illness is that a malnourished brain isn‚Äôt capable of accurately perceiving the fact that the body it‚Äôs attached to is, in fact, in danger‚Ä¶not until we are nutritionally stable can we even begin to recognize the very real danger, and it‚Äôs hard, because the body has to do a lot of recovery much sooner than the mind can follow. 

However, the only way for the mind to be able to truly follow and heal is to keep pushing through the physical suckiness and trusting the process (or radically accepting it, if you‚Äôre not the one making treatment decisions) so your mind has a chance.",,,,LoveThatForYouBebe,,-1,-6.3096094,-0.45882446

Now, nearly 2 and a half decades into this, I‚Äôm more than ever convinced that while full recovery can be possible, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a life where I‚Äôm ever truly free from all aspects of this disorder, mentally or physically.

But that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm a fan of harm reduction done on an individual level. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúgiving up,‚Äù it‚Äôs a team/provider meeting you where you are and working on quality of life improvements and incremental steps forward in that way, that may hopefully lead to pursuing further ED recovery, but not given up on if that doesn‚Äôt happen. There‚Äôs usually a contingency of ED behavior at least being somewhat reduced or managed/monitored, but I‚Äôve seen a lot of people able to enjoy life again without the pressure of choosing between ‚Äúyou have to recover 100%‚Äù (which feels impossible for many at various points) or ‚Äúyou have to be super sick and utterly miserable 100% of the time.‚Äù",,,,LoveThatForYouBebe,,-1,-6.467175,1.1771798

What‚Äôs worse, therapist pointed out what I was eating and laughed saying I can‚Äôt have that it‚Äôs too much or it was a dinner food.

From personal experience doctors are nicer than ED ones. Or maybe because it was my age they were nice. But I think it‚Äôs cause you don‚Äôt want them to be scared of doctors and make it feel like you can always go to them. Therapy is 100% effort, it only works if you try.........

I started taking laxatives a little over 2 years ago and became really obsessed. I went off to college and at the time I was taking around 8 per day. Beyond suffering from anorexia, my roommates were god awful and made me out to be like some heroine addict and accused me of doing something illegal and tried to get me kicked out of my apartment (which didn‚Äôt work, cause they were like.. um these are just poo pills from CVS). Anyways I became more addicted and weaker, eventually not being able to do much without worrying about my GI tract. I threw up during a final once (I do not force myself to vomit. Laxatives have ruined the lining of my esophagus leaving me with severe GERD and Barrett‚Äôs esophagus) so I vomit unintentionally. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night, vomiting in my sleep, choking. The other night I took some laxatives and thought nothing of it. Than, I spent 30 + hours vomiting and having diarrhea. There was blood in my diarrhea and esophagus. I called myself an ambulance and my blood pressure was 64/50 which is DEADLY. I was also so dehydrated that in a 2 day hospital stay I had to get over 40 needles because my veins kept bursting snd collapsing which is excruciating and my mom couldn‚Äôt visit me because of COVID. On top of that, not having access to laxatives meant I gained 5 lbs of water weight due to intense swelling in my ankles, and swelling in my arms. Luckily, I am able to have bowel movements without them which I am very lucky. But this is because the GI was kind enough to understand and provided me with SAFE GI medications that could help my stomach properly empty to avoid more buildup which could hurt my esophagus more. Because of laxatives, I have colitis which doesn‚Äôt go away and means I get ulcers on my colon. I have a tear in my esophagus and am at increased risk for esophageal cancer. I‚Äôm 21 years old. I‚Äôve barely lived. My GI system is a mess and they only make you feel empty. They‚Äôre an illusion. Don‚Äôt let them fool you, please",,,,makeupyourworld,,-1,-4.0572805,-0.018177725

her body is not nearly recovered enough. it's been less than a year and this us a dangerous time. i do not think it is a good idea despite the fact that for your healthy brain, numbers are a great progress tracker- for her they are not. 

you should not be out loud agreeing with her desire to lose weight as it affirms her current insecurities. the low end of healthy is not the only healthy weight or body fat percentage. she sounds to be in a healthy range at this moment and disrupting that and risking a relapse is not worth it. 

in addition, the comment ""her anorexia didn't appear as severe as it can be for some individuals,"" is irrelevant here. people of ed's die at all different weights. some people with bulimia hide it for years and die of heart failure while being at a perfectly healthy bmi, because their muscle is so damaged from their ed behaviors. 

i was in the same position your gf was in a few years ago. i started recovery and was doing great, got a boyfriend who was health conscious and treated me kindly. i expressed that i wanted to lose weight despite being a healthy weight and he loved working out with me. -- i will not continue the story or blame him because the relapse was out of his hands, but within a few months i was about 66 pounds and unable to control my bowels anymore. i was a 19 year old who could not control my ability to pee or use the restroom the other way. 

it spirals so quickly and is such a dangerous disease. it sounds like you love her very much and losing these few pounds could put her in a lot of danger. i encourage you to support her through her continued nourishment and assurance that she is worthy and valuable no matter what she weighs or her body fat percentage. none of those numbers matter to you as much as she does. make sure she remembers that and best of luck to you both on health and happiness.",,,,makeupyourworld,,-1,-7.384103,-0.09594497

comment,2021-03-23 16:50:39,2021-03-23 16:50:39,bulimia,gry3z2r,"\*Warning long post\* This is extremely common and I find sugar to be a huge trigger for me too. I have completely stopped eating sugar because I get an immediate ED response to binge. There are some practical things you can do here in order to break this cycle. Structured Eating, Eat balanced Meals and Accept Delay Distract are from the book 'The Bulimia Help Method' by Ali Kerr & Richard Kerr. This book is a great resource and I highly recommend it.

1. **Reach out.** This is one of the most important parts of recovery. If you don't have a therapist, dietician or coach, I highly recommend seeking professional help. You can recover on your own but if you have support it makes the process so much easier and you feel less alone. If professional help isn't an option then lean on someone you trust who you can contact when you are feeling urges or when you are trying to distract yourself. I'm connecting with my Mom at meals so that I don't binge and purge and it's been very helpful.
2. **Remove the triggers**. If you find you are out of control around sugar, or any other triggering foods, it's ok to acknowledge this and temporarily stop eating/buying them. Keep them out of sight or better yet, don't buy them. If you order from food apps, delete those apps. Put as much friction between you and the behavior as possible. If you tend to drive to the store to buy binge food, put your keys in an obscure location so that you have to think about what you're doing before you act.
3. **Structured eating**. Three meals and three snacks a day, no more than three hours apart. Retrain your mind and body to expect food often and regularly. This stabilizes blood sugar and reduces instances of binge urges. When you are well nourished, your body and mind don't have to send out signals to binge. If you are worried about weight gain, keep in mind that eating regularly is one of the best things you can do to maintain a healthy weight as it is a massive boost to your metabolism.
4.  **Eat balanced meals**. Eat regular meals and snacks made up from fats, proteins and        complex carbohydrates. This will help to stabilize erratic blood sugar levels and in turn reducing those binge urges. I find sticking to whole, mostly unprocessed, low sugar, foods reduces my urge to binge. Nobody really wants to binge on strawberries but strawberry ice-cream is easy to binge on. Pick foods that feel safe to you and the least triggering.
5. **Accept Delay Distract.** We can't control the fact that we get binge urges because of how our brains are wired to do this behavior. We can control how we respond to those urges. Accept the urge and remind yourself that the binge urge cannot control you, it is not dangerous and does not have to be fought.Delay taking any action towards your urge for 10 minutes and allow the urge to rise and fall. Distract yourself for those 10 minutes. Go for a walk, go for a drive, have a bath, talk to a friend, listen to music, immerse yourself in a project, work or play on your computer. Anything to distract you from those urges will help.

I know how helpless and miserable you can feel in a binge/purge cycle. You are not alone and so many people are going through this right now. I hope even a little of this information was helpful and I'm sending lots of love and support your way ‚ù§Ô∏è",,,,esoterique87,,-1,-5.0416346,-0.8807894

I do hope you bring it up to your therapist, removing the shame and secrecy around your ED is an important step towards healing. Sometimes it helps to write down what you want to say if you are anxious about it.

A PhD is an amazing accomplishment! You should be so proud. I can see how binging and purging would feel disheartening to you. Even with all the education and knowledge you have, eating disorders are not rational. Binge urges are especially powerful, and it takes a lot of tools and practice to break them.

I found it especially addictive when I was ritualizing the behavior and going out to buy binge food, which is usually highly palatable, salty, sugary, fatty foods that give you a big dopamine hit. I've heard other people talk about having addictions and Eds and in a lot of cases ED's can be harder to treat because you can't abstain from food.

Are you able to seek treatment for your ED? If you are, I urge you to reach out. You do not have to suffer in silence and there are so many ways in which a therapist, coach, or counselor could help you. It is so important to have support because ED's thrive in isolation. Many people with EDs have struggled recently with the pandemic, especially if they were in quarantine or lock down. If you can't afford treatment then even reaching out to a friend or a loved one will help. 

Body image is so hard. I'm struggling with mine now as I'm going through recovery and gaining weight. Think of a few things that you can do for yourself that would make you feel even the tiniest bit better. You could buy yourself something cute to wear that feels good to you. If clothes are too triggering then maybe a cute pair of shoes or an accessory. I got really into nails, makeup and jewelry because clothes are problematic. It doesn't have to be related to your appearance either. You could do an activity or project, go somewhere, talk to someone, pet a puppy, anything that you would enjoy. Even the smallest thing can make a difference. Our eating disorders want us to punish ourselves but we do not have to. We can treat ourselves with love and kindness, even if we don't believe that it will work or that we deserve it.

Those people should not have said those things to you. You do not need to drink teas and you are a worthy human being regardless of what people are saying to you. Those thoughts of body hatred are coming from your ED. If a loved one came to you and said that they hated their body, how would you respond? You probably wouldn't say, ""you're right, you should hate your body."" You would  say something kind and supportive. You can treat yourself with the same kindness, even when the ED is loud and overwhelming. It does not have to run the show, you have the ability to respond to it and advocate for yourself. I'm sending you lots of love and support. 

If you are in the US, the national eating disorders association has a free hotline.

I lost weight because I wanted to feel safer in my body but unfortunately it turned into an ED. My bulimia kicked in hard around 2016 when my sister got married and I lost a lot of friends. I turned to bulimia because I felt so alone and I still really hated myself. I started my recovery four years ago, it's been a very slow process for me.

Reaching out and telling someone can really get the ball rolling. I also read books and consumed a lot of recovery content on YouTube. I really wanted to be free of bulimia but I couldn't do it on my own, no matter how many books I read or videos I watched. A YouTuber, who I really admired and related to, happened to also be a recovery coach so I reached out to her. I was lucky enough to get a spot and I have been making much better progress than I did on my own. 

Taking any steps, no matter how small, is a good thing. It could be reading books or telling someone or finding a therapist/coach, even coming on this forum. No matter what you decide to do, you will never feel 100% ready to recover. There is no perfect time or level of preparedness. You just have to make the decision and start taking steps.

Here are some of the resources I used/currently use in recovery.

comment,2021-05-12 15:47:08,2021-05-12 15:47:08,bulimia,gxv660q,"No trouble at all. I'm not personally a recovery coach but I am working with a coach at the moment. I like to come on this forum and try to help others and share some tools/tips that I've learned. I know how difficult recovery can be, especially if you don't have professional help. I can link you to a great video that my coach did about overshoot weight. You can find her video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHhOUivBCMo).

I definitely understand the temptation to go back to your ED and to lose weight. I relapsed last spring after gaining weight and not having the proper tools to help with body image. I went back to restriction which then led me back to bulimia and now I am climbing out of that relapse. Your ED is telling you that your body is the problem but in reality it's your eating disorder that is the problem. A big part of recovery is learning how to talk to yourself and how to accept your body. You don't always have to love it but you can accept it and treat yourself with kindness.

There is a great tool you can use to help with body image. Imagine a friend or a loved one who is in your position. They are in recovery and now they are struggling with their body image. What would you say to that person? I'm sure it would be something kind, compassionate and supportive right? That is your healthy self. When you are having ED thoughts about your body, try to respond to them in the way you would for another person. Your ED voice doesn't have to dominate your headspace, you have the ability to respond to it and to change the story you are telling yourself. I hope this helps! ‚ù§Ô∏è",,,,esoterique87,,-1,-5.8570476,-0.61797386
comment,2021-05-14 14:41:12,2021-05-14 14:41:12,bulimia,gy3s4t1,"I'm so sorry you're struggling, I definitely understand how you feel about food. Bulimia is very all or nothing, you're either restricting or you're binging and purging. I understand how hopeless you can feel and you wonder if you will ever be able to have a better relationship with food. I have a couple of suggestions that may help. 

If you have access to professional help, please seek it out. I say this to everyone in this forum because it is so important. I was in the same spot as you and I felt completely hopeless, now I have a coach and I have made amazing progress in my recovery. Professional help can provide you with the tools you need to combat this illness. You don't have to fight this alone, and it is so much easier when you have guidance.

If professional help isn't an option, do you have anyone who can sit with you while you eat? I was really struggling with eating normally too and now I have my Mom sit with me at most meals so I don't binge and purge. It can really help to have someone who is aware of your ED and who can sit with you for 60-90 minutes after a meal. If you don't have someone who can sit with you, is there someone you can call or reach out to? Connection is so important in recovery and having people who can support us goes such a long way. Most of us binge and purge in private so if we can reach out to people, it can prevent you from engaging in those behaviors.

If you don't have someone to reach out to, there is an amazing tool where you dialogue between your ED voice and your healthy voice. Write down the things your ED is telling you and respond to them. Your eating disorder does not have the final say, you can talk back to it and this really impacts your actions. If you start to keep track of the things your ED is saying, you can start to recognize its patterns, thoughts and beliefs and begin to challenge them. Here are a few examples;

**ED Thought**: I'm just going to binge and purge this food anyways, I might as well buy all my binge foods. 

**Healthy Self**: I don't have to binge and purge, and my eating disorder cannot predict the future. I am going to buy food with the intention of not binging and purging.

**ED Thought**: Even when I am at a healthy weight I will be miserable, so I might as well be thin and miserable than fat and miserable. 

**Healthy Self**: You can't predict how you will feel at a healthy weight because you have never been there long enough. All you know for sure is that you are absolutely miserable and alone when you are sickly thin. This is a known fact, whereas you don't know how you will feel if you gain weight and become healthy.

If you are buying food at the store and your ED is already telling you that you're going to binge and purge, it will most likely happen. If you talk back to it and reframe your intentions around the food, your actions are more likely to shift. You have a lot more power than you realize and your eating disorder does not get to have the final say. If you are having trouble getting in touch with your healthy voice, imagine what you would say to someone else. 

I hope some of this was helpful and I promise you that there is hope. I'm sending lots of support and love your way ‚ù§Ô∏è",,,,esoterique87,,-1,-5.4208603,-0.76316535

Some people can go cold turkey, but for a lot of people reducing instances of binging/purging over time and taking small steps will lead to lasting recovery.

comment,2021-05-22 15:28:54,2021-05-22 15:28:54,bulimia,gz2atv0,"This sounds like body dysmorphia which is very common in those with eating disorders. You can help yourself if you start reducing body checking behaviors. If you are aware that checking your body after eating triggers your eating disorder then try to avoid doing that. Especially avoid checking your stomach because yes, it will look bigger after you've eaten. It doesn't mean you are disgusting, it just means your stomach has food in it. I used to body check first thing in the morning and that would determine how the rest of my day was going to go. I found that once I stopped doing that, my eating disorder stopped showing up in the morning. 

Another great tool you can use are dialogues between your ED self and your Healthy self. We all have an ED self and it usually is abusive, negative, critical and cruel. We also have a Healthy Self that we are all born with and it usually shows up for other people. Whenever you have an ED thought about your body, write it down and respond to it. It helps to imagine what you would say to a loved one if they were having negative thoughts about their body. For example:

Ed Thought: Eating food makes me look disgusting

Healthy Self: You do not look disgusting, nothing has changed about your body just because you have eaten. Your body image cannot be trusted because it is warped. You deserve to eat and to treat yourself with kindness.

This is a very powerful tool that will help you identify what your eating disorder sounds like and what it's messages and beliefs are. Your eating disorder is going to keep telling you that your body is disgusting so that you will keep relying on it. Every time you challenge your ED, you weaken it.

You said you want to eat normally and not feel bad, you want to enjoy and have fun in life. Those are YOUR priorities. Your eating disorder is the thing that is scared of gaining weight and who just wants to be skinny. If you are at all interested in recovery, you need to start questioning these eating disorder beliefs. Some examples of questions that you could ask your eating disorder are;

Question: What do you think will happen if you gain weight? 

Answer: I will hate my body, I will be uncomfortable, I will be rejected by people, people will judge me.

The reality is, your eating disorder is doing all of those things. Your eating disorder is judging you, rejecting you, making you hate your body, making you uncomfortable. You need to look at the truth of what your eating disorder is actually giving you. Is it something you really want to hold onto?

Question: What could go well if I recovered and potentially gained weight?

Answer: I could feel better about myself, I could be healthier, I could have more time and energy for things that I enjoy, I could pursue my interests, I could try new things, I could deepen my existing relationships or form new ones, I could learn to accept myself, I could be happier, I could feel free.

Just some things to think about. Not everyone is at a stage where they are ready to look at these deeper issues. You might not be ready and that's ok. I hope you get to a place where you realize you deserve more than the shit your eating disorder makes you put up with. You deserve a happy and full life.

You think that anything must be better than living with bulimia. Anorexia is it's own hell, there are just slightly different demons to contend with. Wanting to trade in your bulimia for anorexia is a bit like wanting to swap one abusive partner for a different abusive partner. They both suck, they both make you miserable and you feel trapped. 

I totally know how it feels to want to recover but you're still holding on so tightly to your ED. Googling ana tips, looking at super thin models and what I eat in a day videos is not helping you. You are making things so much more difficult than you need to. Try broadening your interests outside of what you look like. Start exploring who you are, what you are interested in and your relationships to other people. Those are the things that truly matter in life.

In these situations you get tunnel vision and all that matters is how you look or how dissatisfied you are with how you look. For those in recovery it is really helpful to limit mirror time. I have my full length mirror covered so that I'm not constantly looking at myself and I am working on not body checking in the mirror. Human beings were not meant to be looking at ourselves as much as we do now. Whether it's in mirrors, pictures, social media or zoom, all of this is way too much time spent looking at ourselves, and criticizing how we look. For your own mental health, be aware of how much time you spend in the mirror or taking photos. Try to limit that time so that you don't end up spiraling.

There's a great tool to reframe how you feel about your body/appearance. Even if you don't have children or want children, this can still be helpful.

Imagine you have a daughter and she is your exact age, she looks identical to you, she is exactly where you are in your life right now. She is struggling with her body image and how she looks. She feels bad about herself, she obsesses, she spirals and cries. What would you say to her? What advice would you give her? How would you comfort her? Would you try and help her see the bigger picture? Would you tell her that she is right and she should feel bad about herself?

This kind of exercise should help you realize that you are deserving of the same compassion, love and care that you would give to your hypothetical daughter. You are so much more than how you look. You are a complex human being with so many amazing traits and your body is just a vehicle. It helps you live your life and do all the things that you want to do. Focus on all that you do have and what your body allows you to do instead of tearing it down. I promise if you keep trying to change the way you talk to yourself, you will start to see yourself in a whole new light. ‚ù§Ô∏è",,,,esoterique87,,-1,-6.1019306,-0.46206886

For a long time one of my favorite things to do was buy binge food, binge and watch Netflix, then purge. Then that became the only thing I wanted to do, all day, every day. Those were some of the worst days that eventually lead me to my rock bottom.   
I know what it feels like to want to escape your life, to feel good even just for a little while. It seems like it's all you have, and that is because you have made it your whole world. What is so bad in your life that you are seeking to numb or escape from? For me it was loneliness, feeling lost or without purpose, feeling left behind and feeling inadequate. I realized what I really wanted wasn't binging and purging. I wanted friends, I wanted to travel and experience things, I wanted a passion, I wanted connection and I wanted to let my creativity grow. When you look beyond the food and the temporary pleasure it gives, what do you really want out of your life? What is binging and purging taking the place of?

I have avoided the dentist for years because I was afraid of being judged or shamed. Ideally I would want my dentist to focus on addressing any current issues and how to take care of my teeth in the future. One thing that is helpful to know is after vomiting, teeth should not be brushed for at least an hour to allow the acid conditions created in the mouth to settle down. If the teeth are brushed immediately after vomiting, acid is brushed directly into the tooth surface causing further destruction. It's best to rinse your mouth with water, mouthwash or a water and baking soda solution immediately after vomiting. 

You can't stop someone from purging but you can treat immediate issues and help the person protect their teeth moving forward. Thanks for being so compassionate! ‚ù§Ô∏è",,,,esoterique87,,-1,-4.4877844,-0.21769577

Do not let it convince you that you can't recover. You 100% can recover.

Try to focus on what's been going well. What are some wins that you have experienced lately? Is there an area where you are making progress? Did you use to binge more often?

I had an eating disorder for over 15 years and it can be incredibly difficult for long time sufferers to recover. I can relate to a lot of your story and you are definitely not the only one who has gone through this. I've been in recovery for 4 years and it's been a journey. Recovery is incredibly difficult but infinitely worth it. I feel like I recovered my true self, the person I was before I ever got sick, the little girl who was always on her own side.

You mentioned ""cutting down in a healthy way"" which is a bit concerning. When I first went into recovery, after about six months, I had gained weight. The weight gain was torturous to my eating disorder, which was still present in my thoughts even though my behaviors were gone. I went on a diet in order to lose it the weight and I told myself I was doing it in a ""healthy way."" I ended up relapsing and it took me over a year to climb out of that relapse. I urge you to be careful because this kind of thinking can be a very slippery slope. I'm not saying this will happen to you, I just want you to be aware that your eating disorder can still be active in your thoughts and use the guise of ""getting healthy"" in order to weasel its way back into your life.

Just to clarify, I'm 4 years in recovery but not 4 years without purging. I'm more like 1 year without purging. Recovery has been quite a journey for me and definitely not linear.

At the beginning of recovery my digestion was really bad and I would get severe bloating/pain. Luckily that didn't last for more than a few weeks and it drastically improved. I was extremely emotional during recovery and my moods were all over the place. After having numbed myself for so many years, suddenly I was no longer numb and I was feeling everything. This was actually good even though it was difficult. Tolerating difficult emotions is a life skill and I'm forever grateful that I have this ability. 

I have a bit of acid reflux but its getting better all the time. I need to make a dental appointment which I've been putting off. I'm not experiencing any tooth pain or issues but I know it's a good idea to get checked out. The body is amazing at healing itself and I've been very lucky that my physical health is good.

I would sometimes go months without showering (not an exaggeration.) That was probably the worst year of my life and I didn't leave the house for nearly an entire year. 

A lot the reasoning behind this was 1. Complete lack of motivation and energy to care for myself, 2. Wanting to avoid my body and feeling disgusted with myself and 3. I wanted to punish myself. 

I can definitely relate to the perfectionism and the black and white thinking. I often had thoughts like ""If I can't be perfect, why bother trying at all?"" or ""I'm disgusting, useless and a failure, I deserve to live in my own filth."" or ""I'm already beyond help, I will just make things worse for myself."" I definitely wanted to avoid people and places and self neglect was one way I could do that.

Some practical tips might be things like, showering with the lights off or low light, limiting the amount of time you spend in the shower or setting a time limit, covering mirrors (my mirrors are all covered) and limiting time spent in front of mirrors in general, having some fun music playing to distract you and buying yourself a really nice smelling shampoo or soap.

I really hope you are able to find a better therapist because this is something you can absolutely overcome. The most important piece of the puzzle is how you talk to yourself and that is something you can work on with a therapist. I had the most horribly abusive voice in my head and with the help of therapy and a recovery coach, I have completely changed how I speak to myself and how I see myself.

I was also obsessed with the mirror and how I looked. I started covering my mirrors last year to help with my eating disorder recovery. Every encounter with the mirror gave the eating disorder a reason to show up and criticize every part of me. Humans were not meant to look at ourselves as much as we do now with multiple mirrors in every room, social media, Zoom, it's endless! It's amazing how much of a difference not looking at myself all the time has made. It was a really hard habit to break at first but I'm so glad I did.

Whoever is telling you to ""grow out of it"" is ignorant about what eating disorders actually are. Some people are lucky enough to have early intervention and recover not long after their eating disorder develops. Statistically, early intervention has a high success rate in terms of making a full recovery. People don't realize that in those instances, it doesn't mean it was just a phase, it just means they caught it early and recovered sooner.

I know people who have fully recovered from their eating disorder so I disagree that you can't fully recover. There are many people who have fully recovered, some people partially recover, and some people don't recover. It's very individual and there is a broad range of where you might fall on the recovery spectrum. 

I agree that you need to have self compassion in recovery and that nobody should expect themselves to have a ""perfect"" recovery. Beating yourself up for not being ""recovered"" yet isn't going to help.

You don't know that you won't fully recover! You are assuming things cannot change but what if they do? Your experience now might not be your experience in a few years. Nobody who makes a full recovery does it overnight. Some people need 10 years to recover but they still do it. For some, it takes time.

I definitely experienced extreme hunger and mine lasted for several months. I'm currently working with a recovery coach who is an incredible resource and knows a lot about recovery and eating disorders. Here is a link to a video of hers where she discusses extreme hunger.

I tried ""all in recovery"" but I ended up relapsing after a year and that method did not work for me.

I want you to know that the knowledge, experience, confidence and progress you have made isn't lost. All of those things are yours forever, not even a relapse can take them away from you. 

I had a bad relapse back in 2020 after over a year with no behaviors and have since fully recovered. For me, my body image was the wall I hit that allowed my eating disorder back in. And it turns out that my body image issues were tied to trauma I experienced as a teenager. Sometimes we think we have recovered but there are stones that we haven't unturned or things we haven't fully addressed. Eating disorders can be alarm systems for something inside that hasn't been resolved. If you can think of anything at all that might have triggered this relapse, it could be really helpful in moving forward in your recovery. 

In my experience, letting go of the shame, feelings of failure and reaching out for help was the best way to pull me out of my relapse. If you have access to help, I strongly recommend working with someone who specializes in eating disorders. Sometimes we don't know how deep these things go until we have the guidance of a professional. If you don't have the ability to seek support, return to what was working before.

It's so important to acknowledge the pain and confusion behind this thought process, but let‚Äôs gently challenge some of the disordered logic here:

**ED**: ""Anorexia made me feel in control.""  

**Reality**: Anorexia creates an illusion of control, but it‚Äôs the disorder controlling you‚Äînot the other way around. The choices, rituals, and restrictions are dictated by the eating disorder, often at the cost of your physical and mental well-being. True control comes from making decisions that align with your health and values, not a disorder's demands.

**ED**: ""Anorexia made me feel clean, and bulimia makes me feel dirty and disgusting.""  

**Reality**: These are moral judgments that eating disorders impose on behaviors, but eating or even purging doesn't determine your worth or cleanliness. These feelings often stem from shame and guilt, which are perpetuated by the disorder itself. Your inherent worth is not tied to your body or your behaviors.

**ED**: ""I miss my sick body and the strength it gave me to not eat.""  

**Reality**: That ""sick body"" was not a sign of strength but of suffering. Your body deserves nourishment, care, and compassion. Missing the ""sick body"" is common because the eating disorder distorts your mind to equate thinness with value, but thinness is not synonymous with health, happiness, or worthiness.

Acknowledging these thoughts takes courage, and it‚Äôs okay to sit with the confusion and conflicting emotions. These feelings are a reflection of how much the eating disorder has taken over and how deeply it can distort your perspective. But you are more than the disorder‚Äôs demands or definitions. There‚Äôs a world beyond these thoughts‚Äîa world full of possibility, connection, and self-discovery, waiting for you to explore it in your own time and way. Whatever step feels right for you right now, know that you‚Äôre not alone. ‚ù§Ô∏è",,,,esoterique87,,-1,-5.912563,-0.6999567

It‚Äôs such a brave step to recognize those distortions for what they are, and even just questioning them shows so much strength and self-awareness. Be gentle with yourself as you process all of this‚Äîit‚Äôs not easy, but every small realization is a step toward clarity and self-compassion. You‚Äôre doing an incredible job just by engaging with these thoughts in this way.",,,,esoterique87,,-1,-5.6537113,1.5867581

I'm recovered so that means I no longer have disordered thoughts or behaviors. Being here doesn‚Äôt trigger me.

It‚Äôs important to acknowledge that the desire to recover often exists alongside fear, uncertainty, and resistance‚Äîthat‚Äôs the nature of eating disorders. Comments like this dismiss the possibility of recovery and the effort so many here are putting into their journeys, no matter where they are on the path. Even if someone isn‚Äôt ready to fully commit to recovery, being here, reading posts, or seeking connection shows a part of them is searching for something better.

I recognize that this comment may come from a place of hurt or discouragement. However, judging others for where they are in their recovery is not helpful and undermines the hope and support this space is meant to provide.",,,,esoterique87,,-1,-5.509996,0.052695487

I‚Äôm genuinely so happy for you and proud that you‚Äôve found something that helped quiet the noise after so many years. That‚Äôs no small thing. Thank you for being brave enough to share this, especially knowing how controversial it can be.

I understand why some people might be uncomfortable with this ‚Äî it‚Äôs a complex topic, and the idea of using medication in recovery challenges a lot of deeply held beliefs. But that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs irresponsible to talk about. Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness, and for many people, traditional treatment alone isn‚Äôt enough. We¬†*have*¬†to be open to conversations about what actually helps people survive ‚Äî and ultimately, recover.

Semaglutide and similar meds are tools, and for some people, they can be life-changing¬†*when*¬†used responsibly and thoughtfully, like you‚Äôve done. I 100% agree they deserve a place in the conversation because we obviously cannot ignore such a powerful option. You deserve to live a life that isn‚Äôt ruled by ED thoughts, and I hope this is just the beginning of so much more peace for you.‚ù§Ô∏è",,,,esoterique87,,-1,-5.777089,-0.50182104

Then, they'd encourage weight gain and say things about how thigh gaps aren't important (whilst still looking very thin, unfortunately it makes me question if they are really in recovery). 

I don't know, it just makes me feel like I can't gain weight or eat more if I never got as skinny as they did (never got a thigh gap, never restricted to the x amount of calories they ate, never got to x amount of steps or worked out for x amount of time for x amount of days). 

It's hard to get past these thoughts, but it's most helpful when I find other accounts that are actually encouraging. The bottom line is that these numbers don't mean shit. Eating disorders look different for people but recovery is relatively the same. You deserve to eat and you deserve to do it unconditionally because your body and your mind needs it.

1. I gained weight, but I'm okay with it.
2. I lied, I'm sad because I gained weight.

post,2022-01-09 19:16:13,2022-01-09 19:16:13,ARFID,rzz1vm,"As with a lot of us, I have a plethora of comorbidities. Autism, ADHD, generalized anxiety disorder, possibly depression...

But never, EVER, for any of those have I received the same level of vitriolic hatred I get about my ARFID.

I am extremely open about all my diagnoses. They're in my bio on every website I'm on, including my Tiktok account which also has a video explaining that ovaltine chocolate milk is my most important safe-food and is basically carrying the team when it comes to getting a liveable amount of nutrients into my body. I eventually ended up privating that video. Why? Because *people were weaponizing it*. When I'd get into a disagreement with someone, they'd look through my profile, find that video, then go back to wherever I said something that pissed them off and reply along the lines of ""I hope you become allergic to chocolate milk.""

...I don't think I need to explain to other ARFID people everything that's wrong with that.

May I mention, this wasn't a one-off asshole; this happened multiple times to the point of privating the video because it just wasn't worth it anymore.

But the absolute worst tend to be the militant vegans. You know the type- meat is murder, abolish the meat industry, everyone should be vegan, all of that. Sometimes I try to educate them on why veganism isn't feasible for people like me, and today I got quite the doozy in response:

>We need to continue factory farming animals because you will have panic attacks without access to cheap meat? r/unpopularopinion \- you deserve panic attacks.

I've had several other militant vegans come at me for my stances, but this is the first time I've been explicitly told I deserve the suffering. I've been overlooked as collateral damage to save the animals, I've been told ""just go get treatment it's not that hard"", but I've never had one of these people so blatantly wish harm on me. But something that is consistent with these types of people is the aforementioned viewing me as collateral damage. Not caring if I die, if it gets their goal met. I tell them I'd literally die of starvation if I cut the meat products from my diet, and I get told ""too bad"". Implying that my life is meaningless, not worth saving, because I have a crippling disorder.

There was also a post on r/unpopularopinion a while back where someone said adult picky eaters deserve to be publicly shamed. If someone said what they said in that post about people with autism or something, they would have been *crucified*. The post would have been removed and everyone would've been calling it what it is: ableism.

For all the disorders I have, ARFID is the only one I've explicitly had harm wished upon me for. People want me *dead* for my ARFID. People want me publicly shamed, people want me in pain, people want me to suffer for existing with this condition. In a way I've never experienced with any other disorder I have.

So, why does no one ever talk about that? Does mental health not matter when it's a disorder no one's heard of? Does mental health not matter when it's us?",,,,ITriedSoHard419-68,Ableism against ARFID,-1,-3.3723726,-3.4674401

And I think something a lot of people don't realize with your chocolate shard situation is the obsession with ""contamination"" that some people with ARFID have. It doesn't matter if you remove the chocolate, brain will still say ""ew there's 3 molecules of chocolate left in there the whole icecream is contaminated"" and not let them eat it.

post,2022-07-10 12:07:02,2022-07-10 12:07:02,ARFID,vvq3af,"I'm honestly really pissed.

The idea that only children are picky eaters and that ARFID symptoms are somehow ""childish"" is not only blatantly false, but actively *harmful*. I can't even count the number of times I've seen people with ARFID be told to ""grow up"" and being mocked for suffering a legitimate and serious *eating disorder,* all because people have it in their heads that it's a children's thing. These kinds of ideas are why ARFID flew under the radar in the medical community for years until it was finally recognized as a disorder in 2013. And why, even today, ARFID is so underprioritized compared to other eating disorders. People have possibly *died* due to these effects.

While it's not the kind of thing anyone should be banned over, Reddit should be paying attention to the kind of users and communities who spout these harmful, unscientific statements.

I was banned mere minutes after putting in the report. Permanent suspension on that account. No prior warnings, no reaching out for clarification. I doubt they really read it through or put any thought into it.

And it can get even more limited than that. For me, I *exclusively* have barbecue sauce. And it has to be a specific kind of barbecue sauce. There are 2 kinds of barbecue sauce I'll have: the BBQ sauce from Dairy Queen, and the BBQ sauce from Red Robin. And both HAVE to be with their respective chicken strips; Dairy Queen sauce for Dairy Queen chicken, Red Robin sauce for Red Robin chicken. And those chicken strips HAVE to have their barbecue sauce, if I have to eat plain I'll just throw it out sobbing regardless of how hungry I am.

>I‚Äôm making an effort to eat more fruit but it‚Äôs just so hard. The texture/lack of flavor in most is just so unappealing.

This is me with watermelon. It has such a weird grainy texture to me, and the taste is so mild it doesn't even begin to cover it up (usually I distract myself from textures with strong-flavored foods).

If you have this problem but want to try fruit, I'd recommend pineapple. It isn't called ""nature's candy"" for nothing. It's extremely sweet, so it's one of the only fruits I eat since the taste covers up the texture for me. But always look for the really vibrant yellow pieces; if it's only a pastel yellow/off white it's not as ripe yet and will have a tougher texture and taste more bland.

>And it‚Äôs truly humiliating to explain this to people constantly.

Exactly. Especially running the risk of being called ""childish"" for it.

But to me it's not even just about the humiliation aspect of it. This kind of ridiculing, downplaying, and straight up denial of this disorder *actively hurts people*. It's probably why ARFID flew under the radar of the medical community for such a long time, only being made an official diagnosis in 2013.  And as a result of both its late recognition and this kind of downplaying, ARFID is still severely underprioritized compared to other eating disorders. It‚Äôs very possible people have died due to rhetoric like this. Hell, there's a case of a 19 year old who *permanently lost his eyesight* due to a ""picky"" diet from ARFID.

I have to avoid all items with certain sauces that's the main problem. I can eat most vegatables if cooked until mushy.

comment,2020-09-19 03:07:57,2020-09-19 03:07:57,AnorexiaNervosa,g5rz9ge,"I will be putting up a vote-post. However, understand this: while we don't endourage or condone pro-ed behaviors, and do our best by removing rule 10 breaks, this isn't JUST a recovery subreddit for only those in recovery. We're a support subreddit for most everyone with this eating disorder or similar, and thus I feel that showing the stages of recovery are necessary for some people. 

I may implement a clause that says you have to post timeline posts as multiple photos, and with the fully recovered one first while making it OBVIOUS that that is you while recovered, and not a ""before ed"" photo. This way people can still have timeline photos but those that find them triggering have the choice between swiping through or not, and won't see it outright. 

While I understand that it may be harder not to swipe to the next picture, we try not to baby people on this subreddit. It should ultimately be your own choice and not everything remotely triggering should have to be taken away or completely censored. 

Sorry if this makes no sense - I guess this is the prelude to the upcoming post.",,,,Shadowed-Heart,,-1,-7.8335104,-0.82255906

It's [mostly 90%] my fault that these posts aren't getting taken down as quickly as they should be. I have been relying heavily on the new mods to moderate this place, but while they're doing an amazing job from what I can see, they don't have the 2? years of experience on this sub that I do. (I'm by NO means shitting on them. They are amazing people, and are doing amazing things for this subreddit. I am shit at wording things.) 

I'm sorry that these posts are more frequent now. I have a lot to deal with schoolwise, but over break I'm hoping to regain some motivation, kick depression's ass a bit, and try to moderate more and try and do some changes to get this sub back to where it should be. I'm so sorry to anyone who has experienced triggering things here. This should be a safe space. I'm sorry we're not accomplishing that goal right now. 

If you see a post or comment breaking the rules, report it immediately, downvote it so it's less likely to gain traction, and make a *modmail* message to the subreddit asking for it to be taken down. Please don't message me or another mod individually. 

Thank you for being understanding, and I hope I'm able to pick myself up a bit in the upcoming days/weeks and up my activity a bit, hopefully permanently.",,,,Shadowed-Heart,,-1,-4.0003695,1.1919188

post,2023-05-24 18:39:47,2023-05-24 18:39:47,AnorexiaNervosa,13qttgg,"This is a post dedicated to all those that think vent posts are pro-ana, bragging, unnecessary, stupid, or otherwise unsavory, and feel the need to belittle, ostracize, insult, ""harsh truth"", and be dicks about it. 

First off, you're wrong. Venting is encouraged and welcomed here, and does not break the subreddit's rules (unless it does). This is a fucking horrible disease where everyone experiences some of the same things, but also a lot of different things than someone else does. Those experiences aren't pleasant, they're probably not SFW, they're triggering. Amd that's okay, because people are allowed to vent about their problems, even if they don't want help. 

If you don't like someone's vent, don't comment. If you want to comment because you don't like someone's vent, but are going to give them ""harsh truth advice"", mock them, belittle them, insult them, invalidate them, or anything else that is otherwise unsupportive, don't fucking comment. 

This ENTIRE subreddit is under a trigger warning. It always has been, it always will be. Anorexia is a triggering subject. If you can't handle seeing triggering vents from people in the thick of it, ignore it and move on. If you can't handle seeing vents and can't control your urges to comment hate-filled, nonproductive, unsupportive things, this isn't the place for you and I'll escort you to the permanently closed door myself. 

I'm sick of it, and I'm not the only one. This is a support community. The amount of arguments, insults, unsupportive and outright *mean* comments I've had to remove just last night is unacceptable. This is not who we are as a community and I refuse to let this place go to the freaking dogs because a couple of you can't keep your unsympathetic mouths shut. 

While I can't control what people upvote or downvote, I DO control what gets removed and who gets permanently banned. Upvoting someone who's being an asshole makes YOU also an asshole, and downvoting those that come here for support and relatablity makes you a dick. 

Guys, this isn't highschool. The mean girls don't rule the school. The assholes are in the minority here, and the supportive community is in the majority. Don't stop posting here because of the people that decide they want to be dicks. The moderators have your back. If you see someone being a dick, report it. If you respond, make sure you're not breaking the rules or insulting them back, or your comment will be removed along with theirs. We can band together and *change*. We can drive out the people that aren't here to be supportive. We've done it before in the past, we can do it now. 

If you don't have anything nice to say, shut the fuck up and don't say anything at all. If people start arguing in the comments, I'll lock the post and they can redirect their arguments into modmail where I'll be happy to converse with them.

If I didn't already have the knowledge of what you're sharing I wouldn't believe you since you didn't bother finding a source to corroborate your information. Your credentials don't matter to me or anyone else on this subreddit, per rule eight. 

Obviously organs don't go missing because they were eaten. I only used the term ""cannibalize"" because you and OP did, instead of using medical terminology that most people on this subreddit wouldn't understand outright. 

The only point I was trying to make, and what you seemed to argue against in your first comment, is that the organs *are* damaged through anorexic behaviors. It's not just the body's fat and protein stores that are reabsorbed for the sake of keeping the body basically functioning well enough for the heart.

As we are a support subreddit, we do not feel comfortable, morally, going dark. Going private for 48h would deprive our users of the emotional support this comnunity offers, overall being detrimental to many. A protest isn't worth the mental health of our community members. 

Hypothetically, we could close the subreddit and open the Discord. However, I am the one working on the Discord server. I have been on vacation the past week and have been unable to make progress on it in that time, and still have much to do. While it will probably be open by the 12th, I do not want to push myself when I have things to do offline during that time. 

However, we fully support the communities that *are* going dark, and can only hope that Reddit listens to us and comes to understand that their decisions are detrimental to the Reddit communtiy as a whole.

We take down timeline posts ONLY if they do not follow the protocol - unrecovered to recovered, NOT healthy wait to unhealthy, and they MUST be spoiled. This post does not break any of our rules so it's not been removed. We've allowed countless timeline photos from both women and men, and yes we've removed some, but only if they don't conform to the rules exactly due to the danger not doing so may pose to some members of our community. 

There is a slight sexism here though, but not due to the mods. The last time a woman posted a timeline photo, she got hardly any positive comments and people yelled at her and us mods for ""allowing"" her to post her recovered and happy body. We did not take that post down because it did not break the rules. If you wish to do your research, you can probably find the comments where I was defending the OP and saying that her post would not be removed in my comments history. It was fairly recently, maybe the beginning of this month or late last month? 

I don't agree with people yelling at others for posting rule-conforming timeline photos. I think that these posts hold a great potential for positive interactions, but some people are dickheads and ruin that by being dickheads. 

And if you don't like timeline photos, that's fine. They're required to be spoiled and if they included numbers or were healthy->unhealthy and not unhealthy->healthy, they would be removed regardless of OP's gender. As they're spoiled, people are free to just scroll past and not open up the photos or the post at all if they don't wish to see that sort of content. It's not up to us to cater to everyone's triggers. You must cater to yourself.

Because timeline posts don't break the rules if they're following the correct protocol as this one does. Seeing someone ""glow-up"" from unhealthy to healthy and happy can be recovery-motivating for many. Since we only allow unhealthy->healthy and NOT healthy->unhealthy deterioration, and require timeline photos to be spoiled, those that know that these posts are triggers for them are free to scroll by without being forced to see the photos.

If we amended the rule to only allow recovered bodies, not only would there still be people yelling at us (again, not you), but there would also be very little way for us to tell if the person is ACTUALLY recovered or just showing their UW body and calling it recovered. That would definitely end up being a problem. 

I've been modding this place for many years now and it's only relatively recently that these posts have been deemed as a ""problem."" I've seen countless people say on timeline posts that the OP inspired them to start recovery. And as most of the comments in this post say, people express their happiness for OP - not only maybe encouraging themselves and others to recover, but to inspire the OP to continue on their recovery journey and not give up and go back to how they were before (which is emphasized as disordered, horrible, and unhappy, vs. recovered, happy, inspiring). 

The rules are a balance. What can we ban, what can we allow, without seriously endangering our community? Timeline photos are on the threshold but in my opinion as the mod that brought this place from a pro-ana cesspool to where it is now, they shouldn't be outright banned. We've amended their guidelines many times, the most recently to require spoiling. I don't believe that banning the pre-recovery photos would do that much good in the long-run due to the aforementioned reasons, just as I don't think banning all timeline photos would do more good. 

Yes, there are subreddits dedicated to timeline posts, and we're not one of them. But we're also a space that tries to allow as many kinds of posts as we can that fall within the rules because there is a wide variety when it comes to our community's members. Timeline posts are rare here, anyways. We've gone months without them, then sometimes there are two in 1-2wks. There are people that benefit positively from timeline photos. There are people that benefit negatively from them. It's a balance. 

Sorry to see that you're unsubscribing, but hope that you're able to find what you're looking for elsewhere. Our rules aren't for everyone and we understand that, but right now they're not going to change.

post,2024-07-28 05:35:27,2024-07-28 05:35:27,AnorexiaNervosa,1ee09um,"Hi everyone. I'm sure that some of you have noticed that we have an increase in trolls coming into our community and saying awful things to our members. As a result of this, we have set a minimum karma requirement for comments. This means that everyone that does not meet our threshold minimum will have their comments removed by automod. It is our hope that this action will prevent the vast majority of comments from these trolls, because as of right now they have been exclusively using brand new accounts and burning them after a few dozen messages, just to come back with a new one. 

Unfortunately, this action *will* prevent some well-meaning new users from being able to comment. However, hopefully (if I've coded it properly) this won't prevent them from making their own posts. We've added a note in the removal message that any users that require support while they grow their karma (it is a low amount, but larger than 0) should join the subreddit's affiliated Discord server (https://discord.gg/4jyQ7Zfr9P). 

If some of these trolls slip past the new requirement, then the best thing that you can do is to immediately ***report*** the offending comment, and moderators will remove it as soon as we are able. Do not engage with the trolls. Not only will it only fuel their pathetic fire, but it will also cause more of a delay in us removing the comment as we then have more to read through. Don't engage, don't fight back. Just remember that they're pathetic no-lifes and don't deserve your attention. ***Report and move on.*** 

It is an unfortunate reality of the internet that trolls are everywhere and are unending. Thankfully, new technology has led to us being better equipped to handle them more efficiently and effectively. Report troll posts and comments, and also any rule-breaking posts or comments, and we'll take care of the rest. 

If trolls start to DM you, then report them to us through modmail and then report their harassing DMs to Reddit admins so they stand a chance of getting their accounts suspended or banned. 

Thanks for reading. If you have any questions, comments or concerns, then please feel free to comment them under this post or modmail them to us and we will address them as soon as we are able.

Rule 1: participating in pro-ED behaviors. Rule 3: Anyone is welcome here - aka, you were being rude or threatening. And rule 6: glorifying the eating disorder, or glorifying other unsafe and harmful practices. 

So as a recap, considering I doubt you read the reasons behind why your posts/comments were removed. Rule one is pretty self-explanatory as to why it was enacted. Participating in pro-ED behaviors means that you were either encouraging that other vulnerable people continue to slowly kill themselves, or asking for others to encourage you to do so. Rule three was enacted so we don't have a subreddit full of unrestrained dicks insulting, harassing, or threatening our community - and also so we don't have members invalidating others for whatever no-good reason. Rule six was enacted so we don't have people coming here and being further encouraged into their ED because all they see are posts and comments praising the eating disorder, claiming that it's the next best thing since sliced bread. 

Now, I'm sure that not all of your removed additions were meant to harm our community maliciously. However, the fact of the matter is that they were going to, so we removed them not to censor you, but to *protect this community.* It's understandable that a lot of people don't quite understand the reasons behind why we remove posts but trust me that there *are* nuances for many of our rules and we take them into consideration. We know what we're doing. 

No one is holding a gun to your own, or your *friends'* heads. You're free to just not participate if you don't like our community. I won't miss removing your pro-ED, rude, or glorifying posts - those are the ones I despise the most, because they're just reminders that not only are some people incapable of following the rules, but some people are just bad people.

ARFID is a very common eating disorder that can be treated effectively and efficiently with a strategic and sound approach. I know how difficult it can be to work through - what questions do you have for me?

comment,2022-04-18 17:56:37,2022-04-18 17:56:37,ARFID,i58ia3l,"ARFID has just a few different etiologies. Most people who struggle with ARFID have some sort of sensory sensitivity. Why this occurs can be important for an individual‚Äôs curiosity, but doesn‚Äôt seem to be particularly important for recovery. 

I believe it helps a lot to be ‚Äústrategic‚Äù around the approach, and that‚Äôs where someone like a dietitian (who has experience in ARFID) can help a lot. 

However, the work boils down to the avoidant behavior being the limiting factor to progress. We work through two phases typically 1. Food trials which start at very low intensity such as bringing back foods that were ‚Äúdropped‚Äù (used to eat), or even just changing the presentation of a food (such as sandwiches that are typically cut in half, try uncut). These increase in difficulty until the person feels comfortable working with heavily feared foods. Phase 2. Is incorporation. Taking the foods that were less aversive and working them into the diet frequently. Food being unappealing or having low appetite is often a complicating factor, but improves as a persons nutritional status improves and as consistency in eating improves. Our body is very rhythmic, so hunger cues will self regulation to our behaviors. If eating sporadically, hunger cues typically fade or we just don‚Äôt get the same impact from them. Sometimes phone reminders can be nice to just remind the person to eat -something- and keep their body consistent.

Almost everyone I‚Äôve worked with makes really fast progress in the world of eating disorders. 20-30 sessions can yield enough progress to fix many nutritional deficiencies and reduce anxiety around eating so that the client can continue the work outside of guidance. Many people make huge improvement in just one month of consistent effort, and this month benchmark is often a good indicator for future progress in recovery.  6-8 months is the typical amount of time I‚Äôd work with someone, but it can vary a lot depending on many different factors",,,,EDRD621,,-1,-2.9453375,-3.8441985

The problem with bone density is that we stop building stores for this in our early 20s, and the job then becomes maintaining that density through healthy behaviors. 

For appetite - it can often improve with consistency due to your hunger hormones becoming more regular. If someone has been consistently eating and sees no improvement we would often look at ways to reduce for most meals. Some will seek treatment and be told to eat challenging meals frequently, but this will backfire often. Look at the meal experience as a whole - are you in a comfortable environment? Meals that you eat should be preferred unless you‚Äôre specifically working on 1 or 2 foods to incorporate during that meal. Are there other things in life that might be worked on to help with the baseline anxiety and/or depression? Connection to others, sense of meaning, etc - these can be topics discussed with a therapist and often do come up as significant behaviors for eating so the RD might touch upon these. If you‚Äôre undernourished, getting nourished is the primary goal because malnourishment will breed anxiety and often will lead to poor appetite. If that‚Äôs the case, often you‚Äôd want to distract yourself at meals as opposed to being mindful. Television, phone, music, etc. These can be helpful in the pursuit of nutritional restoration. 

Often those who struggle with ARFID lack intake of omega-3 fatty acids which can really exacerbate poor mood and anxiety. It‚Äôs smart to start getting more of these if general mood is a concern.",,,,EDRD621,,-1,-3.0277817,-3.865317
comment,2022-04-18 19:16:11,2022-04-18 19:16:11,ARFID,i58u66r,"First, I always try to explain that anxiety is inherently functional. It‚Äôs somewhat normal that our brain‚Äôs neurological pathways have associated aspects of fear and anxiety with food. 

Our brains are actively learning every single time we eat. As someone with a passion in the subject, I‚Äôm still amazed by the degree to which people of all ages subconsciously learn during eating. 

Of course the problem is that we don‚Äôt have a filter on that learning. Food aversions are created just as easily as preferred foods. Food situations, especially the social situations you mentioned, can be as fulfilling as they can be detrimental.

The specifics of what will help you will be individual, but the process is ultimately consistent for everyone. You need to create more positive food-centric social situations. That strategy of how this is done is really the key, but someone who is introspective could do this on their own. Start as small as you need to, these challenges should be challenging without seeming impossible. If eating in front of ANYONE produces anxiety - have a tea party with your dog or cat. Seriously. If you can tolerate a few close friends or family, practice that. 

You want a surmountable challenge, you do not want to be practicing at some grand feast. The problem typically is that people start with challenges far too hard and/or avoid challenges all together. The work is meant to induce this anxiety, and you need to work through it, but it needs to be an appropriately tailored challenge so that you can almost guarantee success.

Furthermore, practicing in controlling our inward focus (are they watching me? What do I look like? Are they judging the foods I‚Äôm eating?) with meditation is totally invaluable. Meditation is the skill of consciousness, NOT an activity that is done to reduce stress. Practice observing without judgement.

To be very clear, ARFIDs defining characteristics contradict the characteristics of Anorexia. If Anorexia is suspected then you‚Äôll have more success exploring that avenue. I‚Äôve worked with clients who have Anorexia who do have sensory based aversions, and wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see ARFID like behaviors grow into Anorexia like behaviors. The etiologies are very different though, so approach to treatment is different. 

If there‚Äôs concern about body image it‚Äôs more Anorexic. Fear regarding treatment is usually Anorexia as well because to someone struggling with ARFID the idea of treatment usually promotes a feeling of relief rather than anxiety.

comment,2022-04-18 20:09:58,2022-04-18 20:09:58,ARFID,i59267a,"Definitely a good question. 

I guess it comes down to why is the person engaging (or limited to) such a restricted diet? Someone who chooses to be vegan or vegetarian is typically making a cultural or spiritual choice that supersedes other potential desires or needs. This is fine, but people are often dishonest about their intentions and when it comes to self-care, you have to be honest with yourself.

Restrictive diets get repetitive, and often lead to food fatigue. Food fatigue is a real experience, and usually leads to weight loss and nutritional deficiency. Someone might be fine eating the same foods on repeat for a few years‚Ä¶but a few decades? It‚Äôs worth considering if that‚Äôs acceptable for the person.


There‚Äôs also the fact that food is such a big part of our lives, and we cannot change human nature. So if someone is feeling that they can‚Äôt go to events without some emergency food plan, or food decisions are active and consistent thoughts I would reckon there is a problem.  When food is not enjoyable, a very deep psychological issue can develop as abstinence from the sources of natural pleasures has been studied deeply. We do need to engage with these pleasures and have moderation around them. 


Just be honest with yourself. No one can be honest for you. They can offer suggestions and guidance, and an honest decision should take all information into account.

Your logic makes sense, you'd like to ensure that you're nutritionally sound. I think that's great. But the logic is rooted in the thought that you will always be a little 'stuck in your ways' when it comes to eating. So you're looking for alternatives to 'make due', to some extent. Clients that I've worked with improve significantly - a full recovery is possible. Of course, one's perspective on foods will always be considering past experiences so it's not like they just 'forgot' about dealing with ARFID. 

&#x200B;

I dislike the idea of replacing meals with a drink. It's what I'd call an avoidance behavior, or a management behavior in certain cases. If you're REALLY struggling, a meal replacement will be preferable to not eating. But even attempting a meal is progress. During the recovery from something like ARFID, you will be physically changing the contents of your mind as you work through some of this anxiety. It's very difficult to imagine a state of recovery, so sometimes I suggest not getting tripped up in this. Trust the process. Set small realistic goals that provide a little bit of a challenge. Ideally, you want to go into food situations/trials pretty confident that you'll be able to complete whatever the task is. For example, if eating in social situations is very difficult - try specific challenges where you eat in front of close friends/family/ or as suggested above even in front of pets/animals! Every time you engage with food, and create a positive experience, the brain starts learning that the anxiety response is unnecessary. Over time, the anxiety response disappears - but it does take continued effort and persistence. People do often get stuck in avoiding the situations that make them feel uncomfortable, but that only perpetuates the problem. The brain then starts learning 'well I deal with this problem by avoiding it', and this isn't a realistic or healthy solution. You need the brain to recognize that whatever aversion it has picked up, is irrational.",,,,EDRD621,,-1,-2.9601543,-3.7626486

There are some really interesting dynamics with autism, nutrition, and ARFID. All of which are relatively new fields to study, so we probably won't have concrete research for many decades. I'm under the impression that ARFID is often caused (at least in part) by lack of sensory exposure to foods at a young age. Why would this be the case? Well...a few different reasons. You simply might not have had exposure, and parents never made an effort for whatever reason. You might have had a traumatic food event (like choking) which never really was worked through and this can cause self regulating avoidance behaviors which cause limited sensory exposure. Or you might just have a predisposition, such as the 'super taster' gene which makes foods a little more intense and this can cause avoidance.

What's interesting is that autism is showing connections to our gut microbiome. So an underdeveloped gut microbiome is connected to Autism, but that's really the extent of what science knows so far. Poor gut microbiome is usually a result of limited exposure to bacteria, but especially bacteria in the food we eat. So it becomes an interesting question of what comes first? Is it that Autism being more connected with restricted food intake = poor microbiota? Or is it the microbiome leading, which is impacted by a more hygienically fixated society?

&#x200B;

I think the best thing you can do is understand that ARFID is, at the core, restriction driven by an anxiety response which is typically out of the control of the person working through it. Rationale, logical decision making, and even physical functioning are somewhat thrown out the window during a period of high anxiety. It's not that these people are choosing this, or just dislike certain foods. It's a lot more than that, and loved ones not understanding this is a common frustration shared by those with ARFID.

How you approach definitely depends on where he's at in recovery. I've had clients whose BF/GF are super helpful in assisting with new foods and challenging them. But I've also had clients who just aren't ready for that. The best you can do is communicate, and support him wherever he's at. As long as you come from a place of wanting to understand, I don't think you should worry about discussing food and eating. Of course, not everyone is ready to 'get better' and that can be difficult for a significant other to accept as well.",,,,EDRD621,,-1,-2.8750484,-3.6669104

comment,2022-04-19 04:45:34,2022-04-19 04:45:34,ARFID,i5ayz40,"Good question. There's two ways people often go about life with an ED, in my opinion. 

1. They manage the situation and deal with it. There's distress and it's uncomfortable, but it's almost 'accepted' as ""I get this is a big obstacle in my life... but this is just me"".  
2. They are actively working on treatment and recovery.

Many people flip flop in between these two as well. The dilemma is that in treatment for ARFID the client is required to work through significant anxiety and discomfort. It doesn't feel good. There's very little reward for completing the task, and when compared to the avoidance techniques developed to cope with the issue (distraction for example) it's hard to consistently feel like you're in the place to challenge these behaviors. Doubled down by the fact that you need food to live, so there's this dichotomy muddying the water as well.   


The brain needs this persistence though. With ARFID the brain really needs to understand food and the sensations that come with it. I always remove the 'self' from the explanation because it's not a fault of the person that this has happened, as our behaviors are dictated significantly by experiences and observations. But it's the client's goal to start noticing the sensations that come with the experience of eating, which is technically mindfulness. The forces the brain to adapt. Eating consistently is a fairly good recommendation as well because our hunger hormones (and a lot of our biology) is rhythmic. 

&#x200B;

So, yes - you would feel better not being mindful. And in many cases, this is a good route to get someone nourished. But it's not actually working on the issue as much as it is avoidance behavior as interpreted by the brain. The brain learns that distracting is the solution, as opposed to adapting to the sensations the come with food. A good approach would utilize distraction at most meals to start, and then gradually bring in a small amount of hyper mindful eating. A snack a day or a snack a week even is helpful.",,,,EDRD621,,-1,-3.0247755,-3.739554

The work IS super stressful. Sometimes people will have to take a medical leave. The best way to manage the stress is to start ridiculously small. Food chaining is a fairly advanced strategy. Some people have to start with just being in the same room as a feared food. And as one person mentioned, distraction can be used to help navigate the 'getting enough nutrition' part of eating.  Set small small goals that you know you'll achieve, and don't push very fast. The point is that you should be feeling success with each challenge, despite the hopefully mild stress that accompanies that challenge.

Part of the reason why I do the work that I do is that I love helping and seeing people go from that feeling of despair to hope. There's hope for everyone - don't let negative thoughts convince you otherwise.

&#x200B;

I don't know of any other treatments for ARFID. Exposure is really the main way because it forces the brain to adapt. Some people confuse that statement with 'It forces you to deal with it' - not exactly true. The brain and body will eventually decrease the anxiety response, but it does take time and hard work. 

&#x200B;

A feeding tube wouldn't be a relief. A relief would be freedom with food, eating when you are hungry, having your health, being able to do to things you want to do, etc. Living off products like that isn't *ideal*. Fruits and vegetables contain small compounds called phytochemicals that cannot be synthesized or extracted from foods. These compounds do a lot - strong anti inflammatory, anti chronic disease, etc. You would miss out on these which can be a problem. Given their elusivity, it would also be an impossible thing to 'prove' that you're not getting enough. Those on tube feedings usually  have a lot of GI symptoms, which can get old. 

&#x200B;

ARFID is recognized in some treatment centers, and if not they usually have connections to people who do this work. I don't know of any services on cooking classes, but I'm sure there is something! I'd also caution the thinking that some behaviors are 'part of the OCD' and some aren't. We have one brain and mind, and mental health diagnoses are just someone's best guess at what defining criteria you fit in. Other thoughts and behaviors that don't fit within that exact criteria don't mean they are a different problem or won't improve with the work that is done in general therapy/treatment.

The fact is there are real downsides.

started binging daily to cope ... then purging more and more
I eventually ended up on the street cuz 
My purging fucked up my relations to whatever  friend i stayed with ... my binging were people ok with but not the purging ...
and when I was homeless I had my own room with a toilet at nights in the shelter and the train station toilet in the day... 
But I needed that coping mechanism ...
and the high from a purge...
it got addictive . .
the people im staying with now dont know i purge (im better at hiding it) but i am really afeaid they will find out and throw me out ...

In 2019 my health anxiety around food (orthorexia?) got so bad that I started fasting more and more and eating less and less and started to loose a lot of weight by it.
I was never underweight, but almost, my BMI was exactly  above the limit between ""underweight"" and ""normal"" .

There was something about this that I liked.
I felt like I was in control somehow.
Which is the total opposite from bulimia where I felt i had NO control. I cant control binge eating, I cant control purging, im scared for my teeth, im dizzy, im shaky, I guilty, I gain weight, I just feel like shit all the time.

And when you eat less you save money, binge eat and wow your wallet is not happy. I am actually in debt because of it. And I have been thrown out by friends that I have stayed with more than once for binge eating.

My anorexia... It's been years and shit, I'm like 23...

It's normal, it feels natural, and although I talk about it a lot, in reality I genuinely barely think about anything ED related in a day, it's all so mundane that my mind barely registers it Al

Its comfortable, I benefit to some degree from the routine, the rules, all that shit, it brings me some degree of comfort, which I likewise barely perceive 

I guess at this point, this is kinda just how I live?

Yes I'm making the lifestyle comparison, and no not any of that pro ana cringe, no I don't mean it like that... it's just, it feels so much like just a way of being, it's crazy how something so serious and deadly can become normal to someone

Honestly if I'm gonna be honest, I even get some amount of joy from behaviours, hitting goals, I am actually not fat for the first time in 12 years, how can I not be happy? How the fuck am I ever supposed to get better when...

It all feels so normal? Like nothings wrong...

It‚Äôs not the same as anorexia or bulimia, but it effects our lives similarly. People without eating disorders will not understand that. People who are not neurodivergent will not understand that. I refuse to feel bad for having an eating disorder, especially because I try to find something I can eat everywhere I‚Äôm taken out to eat, and I make my own safe foods at home if everyone is having a meal I don‚Äôt want. I will not feel bad for being different. 

You should not feel bad for being different. None of us should. Those commenters do not understand what it‚Äôs like to be viscerally disgusted by the taste, texture, look, or smell of certain foods. Lucky them. That‚Äôs why we can‚Äôt take the shit they say to heart. Because unless they meet someone with ARFID and take the time to understand it, they will never care and always see us as ‚Äúpicky eaters‚Äù with the ‚Äúpalate of a toddler,‚Äù no matter what we do or don‚Äôt eat. I have even replied to AITA posts like that one speaking up about ARFID, and I just get downvoted. So fuck those people. They are in denial that ARFID exists and is a valid medical diagnosis. 

We can‚Äôt give a shit about what they say, they‚Äôre ignorant. What we struggle with is real, and I know this subreddit, we‚Äôre all trying our best. We‚Äôre here to have each other‚Äôs backs and try to overcome. I see so many posts about y‚Äôall trying new foods, or starting treatment, or looking for resources to help yourself. Fuck those people.

The people who post all the time about how they used to have an ED and what they eat now are not recovered.  If you're recovered you move on.  You don't keep reliving your ED. The only real accounts are those that ended with the person saying they are not posting anymore because they don't identify with their ED self anymore.

One is that anorexics think they're fat when they are emaciated. I know very well when I am too thin, and don't think I'm fat, quite the opposite.  The problem is I am addicted to restricting.

The other is that anorexics should be able to ""just eat"". I wish it were so simple.

As a kid I would only eat a fixed set of ""neutral"" foods prepared by my mom, and would refuse to try new things.  When I was going through puberty at age 13, I gained a lot of weight and became ow. I started learning about calories and nutrition, and took it too far basically, as I became addicted to restricting.  So I developed anorexia.  I never got treatment for it because my mother didn't believe in it but I was forced to ""recover"" which led to going from severely uw to obese in about 1.5 years.  I had about 4 normal years in high school/college but relapsed with anorexia eventually.  I have controlled food and exercise for my whole adult life.
