TW >!I wasn’t even very underweight clinically- everyone told me I looked great, not sick!< and they were confused as to why I had a diagnosis... until I showed them my labs. \n\nKeep in mind I’m 21. My kidneys were failing, creatinine levels super high. Really bad iron deficient anemia, I couldn’t even walk up a flight of stairs without taking a break. I went to the doctor after exercising because I started feeling chest pain and palpitations all the time and he said I could have gone into cardiac arrest. I had swelling in my legs because my kidneys couldn’t filter the water and my circulation wasn’t strong enough to pump all the blood against gravity. My hair was falling out, my eyes had constant dark circles under them. I was freezing all the time and for *seven months* after weight restoration, I had severe night sweats and hot flashes every single night because my metabolism was just so messed up and trying to regulate. My EKG showed how hard my heart was trying to work to keep me alive. I’ve fainted in so many awful places: in the shower, at school, work, doctor’s office, *almost* while driving on the freeway. I’ve gotten mild concussions and cut my eye from fainting in inconvenient places. You can’t plan it. And fainting isn’t fun. My body shakes violently when I wake up and I’m numb and I can’t stop crying and it’s really scary. \n\nI also have nearly constant UTIs (but that might be from my awful water drinking habits, which is connected to my ED) and the antibiotics cause yeast infections so it’s a fun back and forth between the two. I was in a wheelchair for three months after being admitted to treatment, even though I didn’t feel sick or thin enough in any way. \n\nSLIGHT NSFW >!My reproductive system had shut down. Unfortunately, that also meant no sex because I couldn’t get lubricated. That was hard, I felt broken as a woman without my period but when it started up again during treatment, there was constant vaginal discharge from trying to catch up.!< I’ve seen people with permanent infertility or *permanent* gastroparesis (paralyzed stomach). My best friend went into cardiac arrest and was barely resuscitated in time, she’s also had seizures from her ED. \n\nMentally? It was *all I could think or talk about.* I didn’t have a real relationship with my now-husband and that got me into recovery. Everything I thought about lead back to the eating disorder. I couldn’t study or have any hobbies. *I did not have friends.* None. My whole life was my eating disorder, with my boyfriend on the side. Looking back at last year, even in treatment, everything was a blur because my brain wasn’t working properly. I don’t remember so much of what happened because my memory is so bad. My husband (bf at the time) had to hold his arms out *every time* I stood up because I would fall so often. I slept under 6 blankets and still wasn’t warm. I slept all day. I’d come home from work and school and just sleep in my free time, not study or have fun or do anything. \n\nWhat my husband says about my eating disorder days: hair was falling out, kidneys and heart were failing, bags under my eyes, almost passed out every time I stood up, sleeping all the time, my irritability (I was grumpy all the time), it was all I could think about, I had no friends. That’s what he took away from this and it was really hard on him, especially trying to keep me alive when my doctor told him I could die. \n\nI know I’m not unique and I don’t even feel like I was ever sick. Like “I could go back and do it again but safely and not have all the bad things happen”. But that’s not true, there is no “careful” with eating disorders. It’s a slippery slope you have no control over. I really really hope you can get the support you need from this, because you deserve it and I don’t want anyone to go through the hell of an eating disorder.", "parent_id": null, "link_id": null, "context": null}

It’s not exactly the same of course, but it may prove helpful in figuring out how to treat the ED if someone feels their ED is an addiction. I feel mine is a coping mechanism because it dulls emotions and gives me a “high,” similar to how drugs/alcohol/other maladaptive coping skills do. Of course, they ARE bad coping mechanisms, and it may feel insensitive to both ED sufferers and those who suffer from addictions to compare the two\n\nBut your feelings are so so valid because “food addict” is literally disgusting.
