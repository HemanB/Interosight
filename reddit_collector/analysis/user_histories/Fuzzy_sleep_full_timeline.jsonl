Let me give you context. Also TW for describing some of their stupid comments.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was looking through body positivity and ED recovery posts on Instagram. People were posting about loving yourself at every size, eat how you like and not how others tell you to, benefits of recovery etc. A good majority of comments are all from actually intelligent people, commenting more positivity and spreading the love. That’s great! But THEN come the grown ass men with “you shouldn’t be promoting obesity!”,  “as long as you’re eating healthy you’re fine!”, “fat isnt healthy!”, “she’s so unhealthy why does everyone look up to her!” Ok, you get the picture.   \n\n\nIts not just that. In real life too, I get comments about giving into extreme hunger from my Dad and male Friends. “Stop eating so much junk, it’s not healthy” and “maybe try eating fruit and veg instead if you’re so hungry” and they make jokes about how much I’m eating. GRRR!! I also used to get comments when I was really ill a while ago “you look fine to me”.  It’s always men! Ok, some women do say dumb things too but it’s 90% men. I also read posts on here about how peoples boyfriends make comments about their body and it triggers them, and I just think, grrrrrrrr.\n\nWhy are men so blind when it comes to ED’s, the body positivity movement and any topics related to that? I just wish they’d shut up and educate themselves before ranting on like idiots. They just think theyre so entitled to give their shitty opinion all the time. Fuck them. This is why I’m gay.", "title": "Grown men annoy me when it comes to ED’s and body positivity", "context": null}

A girl was having a meal replacement bar, some fruit and a chocolate bar for her lunch. She even said before hand that she had ran out of bread so she was having that instead for her lunch. It was totally fine, it didn’t even concern me. Another classmate turned to her and was like, “wow, you’re so skinny! Is that what you eat for lunch? I wish I was like you!” My friend just explained that she didn’t have any bread in (she has a sandwich everyday and she’s naturally just a petite build) and the classmate responded “u literally eat nothing, I actually wish sometimes I had an ED so I could look good!!” \n\ni was absolutely….. fuming!!?? Baffled!!! I decided not to even say anything since it’s best to ignore f\\*cking idiots like that in those situations. But oh my god, I was so pissed off. I can’t believe someone actually thought and said those words out loud!?It’s like my struggles meant nothing. I’m so much better now so before this would have triggered a relapse. But I could have thrown the entire lunch table at them.   \n\n\nBut it’s other things I hear too. It’s when people pretend they have mental illnesses when they don’t that honestly makes me so angry. I’m diagnosed with Borderline personality disorder and psychosis, BPD is one of the most misunderstood disorders ever. People are like, “oh, I get so sad when my friends don’t respond I must have BPD!” Or “I feel sad this morning omg I have depression haha I wanna die lol!” Or “Im so delusional haha omg I think the weirdest things I’m schizo omggf watch out I’m crazyyy!!”   \nWill people shut tf up!!

I didn’t think “perfect woman” and “overweight” would go hand in hand, but fuck yeah, here we are. \n* All my family and family friends have told me how much better I look and how much happier I am. When I was thin, I was miserable. I’m happy now. That makes a massive difference obviously.\n* I’m so much more confident now. Confidence is a big thing, and when I was in my ED, I was always so worried about my appearance and what I looked like that it defeated the whole point of “thinner equals confidence“, so there’s more proof it’s bullshit.\n* Speaking of confidence, my boobs have come back, which to me is a huge win. I can now show a bit of cheeky cleavage, which for me makes me feel more confident and better about myself. That’s me personally, I like big boobs. Now I have them.\n* One of my friends said to me after not seeing me since I’ve started recovering, “wow, you’re hot now”\n\nIdk the full point of this post tbh, it’s just proof that thinner doesn’t mean beautiful. I feel more beautiful now than I did before, and I’ve had more attention in that way I guess? Hopefully it helps u guys feel a bit better about recovery. If you think that gaining weight will make you unattractive, you’re wrong. Trust me :)", "title": "Here’s proof that thinner doesn’t equal beautiful/hot/whatever", "context": null}
