I started taking laxatives a little over 2 years ago and became really obsessed. I went off to college and at the time I was taking around 8 per day. Beyond suffering from anorexia, my roommates were god awful and made me out to be like some heroine addict and accused me of doing something illegal and tried to get me kicked out of my apartment (which didn‚Äôt work, cause they were like.. um these are just poo pills from CVS). Anyways I became more addicted and weaker, eventually not being able to do much without worrying about my GI tract. I threw up during a final once (I do not force myself to vomit. Laxatives have ruined the lining of my esophagus leaving me with severe GERD and Barrett‚Äôs esophagus) so I vomit unintentionally. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night, vomiting in my sleep, choking. The other night I took some laxatives and thought nothing of it. Than, I spent 30 + hours vomiting and having diarrhea. There was blood in my diarrhea and esophagus. I called myself an ambulance and my blood pressure was 64/50 which is DEADLY. I was also so dehydrated that in a 2 day hospital stay I had to get over 40 needles because my veins kept bursting snd collapsing which is excruciating and my mom couldn‚Äôt visit me because of COVID. On top of that, not having access to laxatives meant I gained 5 lbs of water weight due to intense swelling in my ankles, and swelling in my arms. Luckily, I am able to have bowel movements without them which I am very lucky. But this is because the GI was kind enough to understand and provided me with SAFE GI medications that could help my stomach properly empty to avoid more buildup which could hurt my esophagus more. Because of laxatives, I have colitis which doesn‚Äôt go away and means I get ulcers on my colon. I have a tear in my esophagus and am at increased risk for esophageal cancer. I‚Äôm 21 years old. I‚Äôve barely lived. My GI system is a mess and they only make you feel empty. They‚Äôre an illusion. Don‚Äôt let them fool you, please", "parent_id": null, "link_id": null, "context": null}

It was after the sepsis last july. I was using about 200 a day. Of dulcolax. I'm down to 36 a day, which is way better. I really hate my body and still count calories, but its really nice to not vomit and poop blood all day. I also really try to eat a lot of fiber. Naturally i get hungry now which i have to remind myself is normal and means i'm a human being. \n\nGI system still gets extreme bloating and I can definitely look \"heavier\" than people the same weight due to swelling in my stomach, calves, and face. I wear loose clothes, make my own food, and another thing that helps me is verbalizing my anxiety. Saying out loud \"i feel fat and disgusting. Eating this is hard,\" helps. But you have to counteract it with like \"yeah this cheese has fat, but the spinach has a lot of fiber and is nutritious,\" \"the starbucks barista would not sabotage me by adding cream to my drink cause she doesn't care enough to do that,\" and \"you can't work tomorrow if you take 100 laxatives tonight, cause you'll be vomiting.\"", "parent_id": null, "link_id": null, "context": null}
