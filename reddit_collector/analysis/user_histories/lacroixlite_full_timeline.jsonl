I'm sure you are absolutely beautiful and you deserve to be treated well.\n\nThe struggle is painfully real, and it was the primary factor in me developing my ED. My first boyfriend ever was suuuuper into porn. We'd watch it together and he'd ask me if my butt had ever looked like the actors, if my hair had always been the way it was, etc. Comparing me to all these impossibly beautiful, submissive women. \n\nWe'd be in the same room, sitting not 4ft apart and he'd be watching cam girls while half-heartedly talking to me. When I caught him, he started hiding and lying about it, and eventually even intended to cheat on my with some other guy (he was bisexual). \n\nThe sad part wasn't even his addiction to it. It was the fact that he was hiding it from me. Like, you can't trust or have a healthy relationship with someone who lies to you.\n\nHis indiscretions definitely led to me restricting and b/ping full stop. I was so tired of him comparing me, so tired of him watching other girls on the street and expecting our sex to be constantly evolving to be closer to porn... that I finally just went online to find a diet and dove completely into the proana community. It was so hurtful and I felt so trapped.\n\nEventually I realized he was never going to change without therapy (to which he would not go) so I dumped his ass. But it's taken me like 8 years to finally understand that people's interest in porn over reality isn't about me.\n\nSORRY I JUST DUMPED ALL THIS HERE I have a lot of feelings about EDs and porn. üòî", "parent_id": null, "link_id": null, "context": null}

Please don't take this the wrong way, I honestly just have a lot of feelings about the way porn relates to EDs. Feel free to delete or ignore this if it's unhelpful! Though I do hope it helps!\n\nFirst I want to say that I 100% relate. I just made another comment about my ex's porn obsession and it was agony. So you're so not alone, queenie. I feel you. We all feel you, for real.\n\nThe thing is (and I hope this is helpful for you because you do NOT deserve to suffer or have your self-worth debased),  porn isn't actually the issue. It's the replacement of real intimacy with quick, physical pleasure. Anyone, male or female, who would rather look at porn or who wishes YOU were more like a pornstar, cannot have a healthy relationship with you because they don't want one. \n\nI repeat: The problem is NOT YOU.\n\nThe problem is fear of intimacy and an insecure attachment style. People look to porn because they don't want to risk investing in what is real. They don't want to get hurt, and denying their partner for something that is predictable and cannot hurt them (like porn) gives them the boost that they need to feel better about themselves. Porn will never abandon them, reject them, or find someone new. They can control porn. What they can't control is you.\n\nI don't mean to invalidate your feelings, because they're totally valid. But I get the feeling that you blame yourself for not being attractive to your partners - even the ugly ones, lol. When the truth is, queen, that you could be a model and your partners would still look elsewhere because they have an insecure attachment to real people.\n\nI was at a seminar yesterday about this, and the speaker reiterated the fact that those without healthy attachment are bound to treat us like shit. And it sounds to me like you were treated like shit. I could be totally wrong and if I am, please correct me. But the men who were in your life were not looking for a real relationship. They don't know how to have one.\n\nAgain, your experiences are valid and I know how you feel. This might not help at all, but I at least want to reassure you that *not all men are like this*. I've seen friends find healthy relationships after experiences like this and it *is* possible. But you have to stop hating yourself for not being perfect. Anyone who's asking for perfection is asking for the impossible, and trust me when I say that you don't want that.\n\nI'm sorry if this is too long or if I've overstepped boundaries. I just remember SO vividly how I felt about porn in my relationships AND outside of them, and it hurt really deeply. \n\nI don't want you to hurt, queen. ‚ù§Ô∏è You deserve better.", "parent_id": null, "link_id": null, "context": null}

You don‚Äôt need the people you‚Äôre related to to give a shit about you to know you matter.\n\nYou matter. If I were there I‚Äôd make you some soup. Even one spoonful would be enough. \n\nI say this as someone whose family couldn‚Äôt care less about what happens to me. It isn‚Äôt wrong to expect or even want a favorable response even if you‚Äôre not willing to recover. You don‚Äôt have to be eating or to be well to expect others to WANT you to eat. You shouldn‚Äôt have to *earn* empathy and compassion with any kind of action on your part. It‚Äôs *implict* that the people who claim to love us express that in observable ways. \n\nAnd even if you DID want their attention just for the sake of it? Who *gives* a fuck? Human beings need attention. It isn‚Äôt a goddamn crime to want the people we care about to pay us notice. The postmodern aversion to ‚Äúwanting attention‚Äù is fucking absurd and based in a scarcity mindset: ‚Äú*I* don‚Äôt get any attention and I don‚Äôt expect any so you shouldn‚Äôt either!!‚Äù Like, please.\n\nTo prove the point, in my case, it isn‚Äôt even just anorexia. I was in the ER a few months ago for unrelated issues and not a single member of my immediate family blinked twice. \n\nIt‚Äôs not you. You‚Äôre not wrong. You deserve better.\n\nBut the fact that you aren‚Äôt getting the love and concern you deserve doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt deserve it. It only means that your circumstances suck and that it has nothing to do with you. The ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt want to push you or fight you‚Äù excuse only goes so far. Maybe they don‚Äôt want a conflict, but that‚Äôs still about them and not you. It means they‚Äôre unable to cope with the emotional consequences of forcing somebody to do something that‚Äôs good for them.\n\nSo fuck em. You matter and you don‚Äôt need them to believe it for it to be true.\n\nTake care of yourself. I care. I want you to live. I‚Äôm not gonna force you to recover, but please don‚Äôt die at the very least.", "parent_id": null, "link_id": null, "context": null}
