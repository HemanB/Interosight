I donâ€™t know what else to do as I donâ€™t know my own weight. And I need to be outpatient for probation UAs, at least until my birthday.

Itâ€™s almost like a systematic thing thatâ€™s in place right now and itâ€™s because of the bad choices I made. The methadone made me gain weight. I couldnâ€™t lose no matter what I did.

Itâ€™s a present for myself but I donâ€™t want my bf to know).\n     It seems that almost all the people Iâ€™ve talked to on here with anorexia or any ED have that aspect as well, the control piece. Itâ€™s so huge and so unfair. Iâ€™m sorry youâ€™re struggling with that too. Itâ€™s just how this disorder works. Itâ€™s like how can we control what controls us every single day? \nDo you also find that itâ€™s competitive? Like a competition against yourself to a certain level? \n     Like Iâ€™m barely able to keep up. And I know itâ€™s a losing battle but itâ€™s barely worth it at this point but I do feel that itâ€™s all I have now.\nIâ€™ve lost so much. Friends, family. Peace, trust. \n     I have literally 3 therapists at this point and itâ€™s so much f***ing work. And Iâ€™ve already been through too much trauma. Itâ€™s like my whole identity right now. \nThanks for your time and understanding. I hope youâ€™re doing ok today. \nTodayâ€™s my birthday, Iâ€™m turning 29.
