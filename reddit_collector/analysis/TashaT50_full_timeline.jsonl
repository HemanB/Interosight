By 57 I‚Äôve gotten used to being the major problem when it comes to meal time. A few months ago when I learned about ARFID it was a relief to know I have an ED. \n\nI‚Äôve always been the pickiest eater anyone knows. As a kid I learned to bring food for myself any time we went anywhere. I learned to cook at an early age and took over cooking for the family as a preteen including doing menu planning and grocery shopping with mom. I‚Äôm the one who makes other people feel better about their picky eating kids. Typical ‚Äúpicky eaters‚Äù feel so much better after meeting me because they aren‚Äôt ‚Äúthat bad.‚Äù \n\nHaving lived with this for so long I‚Äôve learned how to deal with family, friends, restaurants, bosses, and explaining why I probably won‚Äôt be able to eat food cooked at peoples houses. For many years I had a handy list of safe foods and at the top it stated only specific brands, cooked exactly right so better to let me cook it there or bring to reheat, and a number of other factors so no food was a a given until right before it was time to eat although certain packaged snacks and cheese (unless I was having dairy issues which come and go) were safer than anything cooked. \n\nThe foods I can eat have expanded over the years. Some of my safe foods are the same from childhood. Other safe foods from childhood no longer are safe. \n\nI hope you all find ways to get over your sense of shame as well as add additional foods to your safe list.", "parent_id": null, "link_id": null, "context": null}

It is always interesting to see how different peoples safe foods are. I still think of myself as ‚Äúmost unique super duper pickiest person in the universe‚Äù. I hadn‚Äôt written down a safe food list in many, many years. Sometime in the last week or two I did a safe food list on a thread here and was shocked at how few things had ‚Äúspecific brand, cooked only one exact way, only if I‚Äôm in right mood, changes frequently over a couple hours‚Äù. My safe food list in ~2004 almost every one of the 15-20 items had that next to it. \n\nI prefer grape tomatoes cut exactly in half to cherry tomatoes as cherry are a little too big for my mouth. I can eat cherry cut into fourths and regular tomatoes if that‚Äôs what‚Äôs available.\n\nSalad is fairly new safe food. It was a rare thing for me to eat until some time in my mid/late 30s. Prior to that I‚Äôd occasionally pick out the tomatoes and cucumbers if they didn‚Äôt have dressing and eat them plain. I had a low blood pressure problem in my mid-20s/early-30s and doctors insisted I eat more salt which is when I forced myself to add salt to things I used to prefer plain. Now I prefer with salt or Italian dressing (able to eat most brands)\n\nI cut all gristle and fat off my steak as well as any meat touching them. So I understand why you don‚Äôt like it. I prefer to get lean cuts and cook on grill or under broiler so less greasy. I‚Äôve been known to pat with paper towels to degrease. LOL\n\nFor mashed foods they must be perfectly mashed, no lumps. Same with gravy, no lumps. I don‚Äôt actually like potatoes much but I love my homemade super duper too much garlic mashed potatoes with gravy or sour cream - the potatoes are simply an acceptable delivery for those. Like one thin layer of potatoes and 2x of gravy, eat with spoon. ü§£\n\nOne of the cooking tricks that has helped increase the number of safe foods for me is to use tons of seasoning to drown out taste of foods I don‚Äôt care for. I didn‚Äôt realize that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done for most of my life until I heard about ARFID and was reading various ways people use to make an unsafe food safe and a lightbulb went off. In many cases where a recipe calls for a teaspoon of this, a 1/2 teaspoon of that, I multiple each by 4. Recipe calls for 4 garlic cloves I use a head of garlic. I don‚Äôt automatically increase as above. Each time I cook something I increase a little until it smells and taste right. I cook based on smell because I‚Äôm not eating food that is gross and then not able to eat dinner. Plus since I cooked different food for my family than I did for me I had to learn how to know it was right as no way was I getting it anywhere near my mouth. \n\nProcessed food is reliable. Always same shape, texture, smell, taste. Many of us with ARFID are wedded to specific brands or restaurants because it exactly the same every time.\n\nBeing able to cook is probably going to help you a lot in increasing your safe foods over time. Especially since you are able to cook foods you won‚Äôt eat. It has for a number of us. \n\nIt can be difficult to say ewwww gross respectfully - your doing a great job of that. I commend you.", "parent_id": null, "link_id": null, "context": null}

I‚Äôm excited with you finding an awesome apple to munch on for that crunch craving. Did you know you can sprinkle a little salt on apples to get that salty crunch? If you like nut butter or cheese both go well with apples. I like hard cheddar pre-cut snack pieces or cheese fondue. Nut butter can be done as a dip or spread on each slice. Any of my suggestions might be a sensory issue but I thought I‚Äôd mention them.\n\nBaby carrots are great for dipping or just sprinkle a little salt for that salty crunch craving. If you like yogurt to get more protein you can make a number of dips - onion soup, dill, ranch, etc. If you are having problems getting enough calories daily I love sour cream dip especially Lipton onion soup. Lots of mixes and recipes for veggie dips out there to try. I love wishbone robusto Italian salad dressing so I‚Äôll pour a little in small dipping bowls and dip the carrots in that.\n\nGiven you like the hardness of cosmic crisp apples, if you haven‚Äôt tried them yet, you might like red delicious apples - just make sure they feel hard and aren‚Äôt on their final week. As apples age they get mushier so squeeze them when shopping to make sure they feel super hard.\n\nSo exciting you found a fruit to love.

If possible try snacking more as I found that helped. Dry cereal works if you can‚Äôt manage anything else. I always kept snacks on me and had a few bites between classes and at my desk at work.

Ask a doctor to do a full blood work up to figure out what supplements you need/where your deficiencies are. If you‚Äôre like many of us and find taking pills difficult try using a straw. \n\nTry to find a protein drink or meal supplement drink you can tolerate and have 1-2 a day to make up for missed meals. Many people like Fairlife as well as various Ensure options. It‚Äôs not easy finding one that works but it‚Äôll help you feel better. I went through some 5-10 protein drinks and powders before I found one that worked for me. Use a straw as it helps with the taste. Don‚Äôt throw out what you can‚Äôt finish. Put it in the fridge and drink more an hour later. It‚Äôs fine if it takes 3 hours to drink a single bottle. Add extra sugar or a packet of carnation essential chocolate or strawberry to help with the taste and getting more calories.

It‚Äôs also much easier now that menus are online so I can figure out what I‚Äôm going to order, make notes in my phone, and am prepared for the rare freeze moments where I‚Äôll show the waitstaff my notes because I‚Äôm tongue tied.\n\nI was a waitress for a few years. The only thing I cared about my customers orders was getting them right. No judgments on the food. \n\nTips from 50 years of ordering off menu\n* Look at online menus and pick 2-3 options in case they are out of your #1 \n* Look at children‚Äôs and lunch menus as those are smaller portions and frequently have fewer ingredients - talk to a manager if waitstaff says no you can‚Äôt order off those and explain your making this request due to food restrictions/smaller appetite for medical reasons. I‚Äôll offer to pay more for the kids menu if I sense this is the issue.\n* I find it can be easier to create something new based off of ingredients so instead of asking for menu item X but having them remove 10 things I‚Äôll ask can they make me a grilled chicken with garlic with a side of mashed potatoes with only butter. \n* Write down what you‚Äôve decided to order in a note on your phone so if you have a brain fart you can remember what you decided & can even show it to waitstaff if your having a hard time speaking due to anxiety \n* Don‚Äôt be afraid to ask to talk to the chef if you‚Äôre at a fancy/very expensive restaurant as they are frequently willing to work with you based on your safe food restrictions - calling ahead at a quieter hour (ex. 10-11:30am & 2-5pm on weekdays) as someone else mentioned may be easier \n* Order a drink and an appetizer or drink and dessert if that‚Äôs the only thing on the menu you feel confident eating. I‚Äôm including soda, lemonade, tea, and coffee as drinks no matter the time of day.\n* I joke with the waitstaff that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be the complicated order in our party are you ready?‚Äù it ‚Äúdisarms‚Äù anyone I‚Äôm eating with - kinda hard to give me a hard time when I‚Äôm joking and laughing about my food restrictions \n* It‚Äôs ok to request a complete list of all ingredients including all seasonings - just say you‚Äôre sensitive to a lot of ingredients and it‚Äôs easier to see a recipe list than carry around pages of ingredients that your unable to enjoy", "parent_id": null, "link_id": null, "context": null}

Not to the extreme where everything taste amazing but I can eat them and over time I get more and more enjoyment doing so. But during times of crisis or high stress my restrictions come back.\n\nI hope this will be encouraging for you. I‚Äôve found when the high stress/crisis lessens it takes very little for my to add the newer safe foods back in.

I consider myself fairly recovered during good times but during crisis and times of great stress various of my food restrictions reappear but not as severe as they were. \n\nMy mom started me on cooking with her at 3 - somewhat age appropriate as I grew up. This helped in many ways.\n* I got over much of my gag reflex from touching or being around unsafe/gross foods. I wash my hands a lot when cooking and go through many paper towels so I can throw them away as soon as I‚Äôve used them. \n* It increased my ability to eat around most foods I found gross, not all, fish/seafood still had a ‚Äúcannot eat anything for up to 6 hours if I smell it at eating times‚Äù. \n* Having control over cooking and learning to modify recipes expanded my safe foods. More so when I got older than as a minor living at home but even as a kid. I‚Äôd sometimes be distracted and lick my fingers which led to finding recipes I wanted to modify because what we were making was interesting but not to my taste.  Learned doubling and tripling seasonings I liked could increase the chances I‚Äôd eat something which made a huge difference in the number of chicken, pasta, beef, and pork dishes I can eat - instead of having a single dish or brand I could eat 10-20 dishes by my teen years\n* My knowledge of recipes made it easier to order off menu in restaurants as I knew what ingredients they had on hand based on the menu and I knew what quick easy dishes they could make with those ingredients \n\nImportant dinners: Check menu beforehand to see if there is anything you can eat. If not eat beforehand hand. If possible have bread, something to drink, if you eat salad or some of the salad vegetables eat those (ask for no dressing). At events I‚Äôve always said the smell of food is making me nauseous and kicking off a headache due to one of my various chronic illnesses but otherwise I‚Äôm fine and no I don‚Äôt have something anyone needs to worry is catching.\n\nYou may find cooking in school helps with your ARFID but see about wearing gloves and a mask (keep in mind these may help with ARFID but cause social issues), maybe getting an anti-anxiety med just for that class, sitting down with your parents and the teacher to explain ARFID, your particular issues, and why you may need to walk out of class sometimes. You may want to start trying this at home to see what works for you (gloves, mask) and what doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not going to be easy but it likely will help you in the long run. You can start out at home just sitting in the room close to foods/ingredients you expect will be part of the class. \n\nHow do we not die? Thankfully we live in a modern world and for many of us we have access to our safe foods, meal replacement drinks and bars, and feeding tubes if things get really bad. That said it‚Äôs important to take supplements, expand our safe food list, get regular checkups and blood test, as lack of good nutrition can cause a number health issues some which may not show up until later in life.", "parent_id": null, "link_id": null, "context": null}
