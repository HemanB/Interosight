## Development Progress Log

### Phase 1 - Application Foundation (COMPLETED)
**Goals:**
- Clean rebuild of application with modern web stack
- Implement wireframe versions of 3 core screens
- Establish solid development foundation
- Set up proper tooling and configuration

**Completed:**
- **Complete Application Rebuild:**
  - Removed old React Native/Expo structure
  - Created fresh Vite + React + TypeScript application
  - Integrated Tailwind CSS with custom design system
  - Preserved and restored Firebase configuration
  - Set up React Router for client-side navigation
  - Added Lucide React for icons

- **3 Core Screen Wireframes:**
  - **HomeScreen:** Tabbed interface for journaling and logging with basic forms
  - **AnalyticsScreen:** Data visualization cards and basic charts with mock data
  - **SettingsScreen:** Tabbed settings interface with profile, preferences, privacy, and data management

- **Design System Implementation:**
  - Custom Tailwind configuration with primary blue color scheme
  - Inter font family integration
  - Responsive grid layouts
  - Custom component classes (btn-primary, btn-secondary, card, input-field)
  - Desktop-first sidebar navigation layout

- **Development Environment:**
  - Vite development server running on localhost:5173
  - Hot module replacement working
  - TypeScript compilation configured
  - Modern build tooling setup

**Current State:**
- Application successfully running with wireframe functionality
- All screens accessible and navigable
- Clean, professional UI foundation established
- Ready for functionality implementation

**Next Phase:**
- Implement real functionality for each screen
- Add data persistence with Firebase
- Integrate authentication system
- Build out core features (journaling, logging, analytics)

## Technical Debt & Issues
- ~~Tailwind CSS configuration issues~~ ✅ RESOLVED
- Need to implement real data persistence
- Need to add form validation and error handling
- Need to integrate Firebase authentication
- Need to add proper loading states and feedback

## Key Decisions Made
- **Technology Stack:** Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS for modern, fast development
- **Design Approach:** Wireframe-first to establish UX flow before adding complexity
- **Architecture:** Desktop-first with sidebar navigation for professional feel
- **Development Strategy:** Build functional wireframes first, then add real functionality
- **Firebase Integration:** Preserved existing configuration for seamless backend integration

## Current Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Routing:** React Router DOM
- **Icons:** Lucide React
- **Backend:** Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Storage) - configured but not yet integrated
- **Development:** Vite dev server with HMR

## Current Status
**✅ Application Status:** RUNNING (Wireframe Stage)
- **URL:** http://localhost:5173
- **Build System:** Vite 7.0.6
- **State:** Wireframe implementation complete
- **Next:** Functionality implementation
