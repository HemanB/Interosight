# Interosight MVP - Product Requirements Document

## Problem Statement

Individuals with eating disorders often struggle with fragmented, inconsistent recovery journeys due to:
- Lack of structured, longitudinal self-reflection tools that adapt to their unique recovery trajectory
- Difficulty tracking behavioral patterns and triggers over time in a way that reveals meaningful insights
- Absence of data-driven insights to inform recovery decisions between therapy sessions
- Limited access to personalized recovery guidance outside of therapy sessions
- Existing tools often feel clinical, judgmental, or too rigid for the fluid nature of recovery

Current solutions are either too generic, lack meaning-making opportunities, lack data-driven insights, or don't provide the continuous engagement needed for sustained recovery progress. Most apps focus on symptom tracking without addressing the deeper identity and meaning-making work that sustains long-term recovery.

**For Reddit Demo Context:** The eating disorder recovery community on Reddit actively seeks tools that can help them track patterns, reflect meaningfully, and gain insights into their recovery journey. They want something that feels personal, non-judgmental, and actually helpful rather than just another tracking app.
