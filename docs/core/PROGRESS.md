### Phase 3 - Backend Integration (CURRENT ðŸ”„)
**Goals:**
- Integrate Firebase services for data persistence
- Implement real authentication system
- Add form validation and error handling
- Connect UI to backend services

**In Progress:**
- **Firebase Integration:**
  - Firebase configuration preserved and ready
  - Need to initialize Firebase services in application
  - Need to set up Firestore database connection
  - Need to configure Firebase Authentication

- **Authentication System:**
  - AuthScreen UI complete with all required forms
  - Need to connect to Firebase Auth
  - Need to implement protected route navigation
  - Need to add user profile management

- **Data Persistence:**
  - Need to define TypeScript interfaces for all data types
  - Need to implement Firestore document structures
  - Need to create data service layer for CRUD operations
  - Need to add local state management with React Context

**Next Steps:**
1. Initialize Firebase in the application
2. Connect AuthScreen to Firebase Auth
3. Implement real data storage for journaling and logging
4. Add form validation to all input forms

## Technical Debt & Issues
- ~~Tailwind CSS configuration issues~~ RESOLVED
- ~~Tailwind CSS v4 PostCSS compatibility~~ RESOLVED (clean reinstall â†’ v3.4.17)
- ~~Navigation system implementation~~ RESOLVED
- ~~Module screen functionality~~ RESOLVED
- Need to implement real data persistence with Firebase
- Need to add form validation and error handling
- Need to integrate Firebase authentication
- Need to add proper loading states and feedback

## Key Decisions Made
- **Technology Stack:** Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS for modern, fast development
- **Design Approach:** Wireframe-first to establish UX flow before adding complexity
- **Architecture:** Desktop-first with sidebar navigation for professional feel
- **Development Strategy:** Build functional wireframes first, then add real functionality
- **Firebase Integration:** Preserved existing configuration for seamless backend integration
- **Navigation System:** Implemented functional navigation before backend integration
- **Fresh Account Experience:** Clean slate approach for new users

## Current Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Routing:** React Router DOM
- **Icons:** Lucide React
- **State Management:** React Context + local state
- **Backend:** Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Storage) - configured but not yet integrated
- **Development:** Vite dev server with HMR

## Current Status
**Application Status:** FULLY FUNCTIONAL (Navigation Complete)
- **URL:** http://localhost:5173
- **Build System:** Vite 7.0.6
- **State:** All core screens implemented with working navigation
- **Next:** Firebase integration and real functionality implementation
