# InteroSight On-Device LLM Guide

## Overview
This guide covers the on-device LLM implementation for InteroSight, designed to work without external APIs and provide immediate, privacy-focused responses.

## 🎯 Current Implementation: Smart Fallback System

### What It Is
A sophisticated pattern-matching system that provides intelligent, context-aware responses without requiring a full language model.

### Key Features
- **Pattern Recognition**: 8 different response categories (meals, body image, anxiety, recovery, etc.)
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Multiple response variations for each pattern
- **Crisis Detection**: Automatic detection and appropriate crisis responses
- **Response Caching**: 30-minute cache for repeated conversations
- **Confidence Scoring**: Each response has a confidence level (0.6-0.8)

### Response Categories
1. **Meal-related** (eating, food, hunger)
2. **Body Image** (appearance, weight, self-image)
3. **Anxiety** (stress, worry, panic)
4. **Recovery** (healing, progress, journey)
5. **Relationships** (support, connection, loneliness)
6. **Self-compassion** (self-judgment, worth, kindness)
7. **Triggers** (urges, coping, management)
8. **General Support** (help, listening, empathy)

### Example Responses
```
User: "I'm feeling really anxious about eating today"
Response: "I hear that meal times can be challenging. Remember that every meal is a step toward healing, no matter how small it feels. What's making this meal particularly difficult for you right now?"
Pattern: meal
Confidence: 0.8
```

## 🚀 Future Implementation: TensorFlow Lite Integration

### Llama 3.2 1B Instruct On-Device
When you're ready to implement the full model:

#### Requirements
- **Model Size**: ~2GB (compressed)
- **Memory**: ~4GB RAM during inference
- **Performance**: 2-5 seconds per response
- **Quality**: Comparable to API-based models

#### Implementation Steps
1. **Convert Model**: Convert Llama 3.2 1B to TensorFlow Lite format
2. **Optimize**: Quantize for mobile performance
3. **Integrate**: Use TensorFlow Lite React Native
4. **Test**: Validate performance and quality

#### Benefits
- **No API Costs**: Completely free to use
- **Privacy**: All processing on device
- **Offline**: Works without internet
- **No Rate Limits**: Unlimited usage

## 📱 Current Usage

### Testing the Smart Fallback System
```bash
cd app
npm run test:smart-fallback
```

### Integration in App
The smart fallback system is already integrated into the ReflectScreen and provides:
- Immediate responses (<100ms)
- Context-aware support
- Crisis detection
- Cached responses for efficiency

### Configuration
```typescript
// In app/lib/smart-fallback-llm.ts
const config = {
  cacheExpiryMinutes: 30,
  patterns: [
    // Custom patterns can be added here
  ]
};
```

|---------|----------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Response Time** | <100ms | 2-5s | 1-3s |
| **Cost** | $0 | $0 | $1-12/month |
| **Privacy** | 100% | 100% | API logs |
| **Offline** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Quality** | Good | Excellent | Excellent |
| **Setup** | ✅ Ready | 🔄 Future | ✅ Ready |

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Smart Fallback Architecture
```
User Input → Pattern Matching → Context Selection → Response Generation → Caching
```

### Pattern Matching Algorithm
1. **Keyword Detection**: Find matching keywords in user input
2. **Pattern Scoring**: Score patterns by match count and confidence
3. **Response Selection**: Choose best pattern and random response variation
4. **Caching**: Store response for future similar inputs

### Crisis Detection
- **Keywords**: suicide, purge, binge, restrict, etc.
- **Response**: Immediate crisis resources and support
- **Priority**: Highest priority over all other patterns

## 🎉 Benefits for Reddit Beta
