# InteroSight Roadmap

## Project Direction

InteroSight is an mHealth application for eating disorder recovery, centered on a data-driven, time-series embedding system that learns from users' lived experiences. The application leverages structured journaling, comprehensive metadata capture, and behavioral logs to create personalized, reflective insights for eating disorder recovery. The long-term goal is to enable self-referential learning, especially valuable for egosyntonic conditions like eating disorders.

## Core Vision: Time-Series Embedding System

### Data-Driven Personalization
- **Longitudinal Data Collection**: Structured journaling with tags, timestamps, and emotional tone analysis
- **Comprehensive Metadata Capture**: Time of day, frequency, completion patterns, interaction behaviors
- **Behavioral Tracking**: User engagement patterns, log completion rates, feature usage analytics
- **Self-Referential Learning**: System learns from each user's unique recovery journey

### MVP Strategy: Rule-Based Foundation
To break the cold-start problem, we're shipping a rule-based, insight-driven MVP that provides immediate value while collecting the longitudinal data needed for future ML models.
