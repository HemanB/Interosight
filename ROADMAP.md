# InteroSight Roadmap

## Project Direction

InteroSight is a clinical-grade digital platform for eating disorder recovery, centered on a data-driven, adaptive reflection module system. The application leverages user-generated data, semantic modeling, and guided reflection to facilitate self-understanding and longitudinal insight. The core value proposition is not static education, but the facilitation of meaningful, structured self-reflection through adaptive, evidence-informed modules.

## Product Architecture

### 1. Home - Progress Tracking
- Progress dashboard visualizing reflective engagement and insight trends
- Streak and engagement tracking
- Achievement and milestone recognition
- Daily goals and progress analytics

### 2. Logging - Adaptive Experience Capture
- Single input for free-form reflection, triggers, and behaviors
- Full metadata capture (time, location, mood, context, physiological data)
- Semantic tagging and pattern recognition
- Historical and calendar-based review

### 3. Reflective Modules - Adaptive Guided Reflection
- Data-driven, adaptive module system
- Each module scaffolds user reflection, not didactic content
- Prompt flows adapt to user data, history, and semantic context
- Session management and longitudinal tracking
- Context-aware, memory-augmented LLM guidance

### 4. Resources - Regulation and Crisis Tools
- Evidence-based emotional regulation and grounding tools
- Crisis resources and emergency contacts
- Safety planning and professional resource links

### 5. Settings
- Account and privacy management
- Notification and crisis settings
- App preferences and accessibility options
- Data export and deletion

## Core System Architecture

### Reflective Module Engine
- Modules are defined as data-driven scaffolds for reflection, not static lessons
- All module content, prompt flows, and progression are dynamically loaded from configuration
- User data, semantic embeddings, and memory are injected into all reflective flows

### Data and Memory Layer
- Persistent user memory with summarized insights and frequent topics
- All reflection and log entries are embedded and indexed for semantic search and analytics
- Contextual data is used to adapt prompts and module progression

### Clinical Safety and Privacy
- Crisis keyword detection and appropriate response
- Risk assessment using validated proxy measures
- Secure, privacy-first data handling and user control

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Set up new 5-tab navigation structure
- Implement Reflective Module Engine with initial module
- Create basic logging with semantic tagging
- Set up embedding pipeline
- Implement user memory system

### Phase 2: Core Features
- Expand reflective module system with additional modules
- Implement adaptive prompt flows and session management
- Add physiological data integration
- Create progress analytics dashboard
- Build crisis detection and response

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Implement advanced risk assessment and pattern recognition
- Add advanced analytics and insights
- Build professional reporting tools

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement
- Frequency and depth of reflective engagement
- Module progression and completion rates
- Logging and session consistency

### Clinical Outcomes
- Risk score trends and crisis intervention effectiveness
- User-reported insight and qualitative growth
- Professional treatment engagement

### Technical Performance
- Application stability and reliability
- Response time for LLM interactions
- Data synchronization and privacy compliance

This roadmap reflects a commitment to a clinically grounded, data-driven, and adaptive approach to supporting eating disorder recovery through structured reflection and insight generation.
