# Interosight Roadmap

## MVP Focus & Next Steps

Interosight is currently focused on building a robust MVP that lays the groundwork for future machine learning and advanced features. The immediate priorities are:

### 1. Data Collection Prong
- Implement Reddit data collection pipeline using PRAW
- Collect and store raw Reddit data from major subreddits
- Organize and stratify data by user and timestamp
- Prepare datasets for downstream analysis and modeling

### 2. Data Analysis Prong (Insight Engine)
- Develop data processing and vectorization pipeline
- Explore and prototype methods for converting user data into event vectors
- Begin preliminary analysis of time-series data for behavioral patterns
- Define requirements and design for the future ML model
- Build reporting and feedback modules for MVP insights

### 3. Frontend & App Development Prong
- Build core screens and modules for journaling, logging, and review
- Integrate with backend data and insight APIs
- Ensure secure, efficient database integration (Firebase/Firestore)
- Prioritize usability and reliability for MVP launch

## Success Metrics (MVP)
- Volume and quality of Reddit/user data collected
- Number and quality of insights generated for users
- User engagement with journaling and logging features
- Technical stability and privacy compliance
