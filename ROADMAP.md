# InteroSight Roadmap

## Project Direction

InteroSight is a clinical-grade digital platform for eating disorder recovery, centered on a data-driven, adaptive reflection module system. The application leverages user-generated data, semantic modeling, and guided reflection to facilitate self-understanding and longitudinal insight. The core value proposition is not static education, but the facilitation of meaningful, structured self-reflection through adaptive, evidence-informed modules that evolve based on user data and engagement patterns.

## Product Architecture

### 1. Home - Journey-Based Progress Tracking
- Duolingo-style pathway interface showing reflective modules as a journey
- 5 structured starter modules exploring user identity, relationships, and life fulfillment
- Dynamic module generation based on user data and previous responses
- Interactive journaling with semantic analysis for engagement quality
- Progress visualization and achievement tracking
- Streak and engagement metrics

### 2. Logging - Dynamic Multi-Modal Capture
- **Freeform Journaling**: Open-ended reflection with semantic tagging
- **Meal Logging**: Food intake tracking with behavioral context
- **Behavior Logging**: Eating disorder behaviors and triggers
- **Dynamic Tagging**: Automatic categorization using contextual analysis
- **Metadata Capture**: Heart rate, step count, geolocation, temporal data
- **Pattern Recognition**: Cross-referencing behaviors with physiological data

### 3. Analytics - Rich Data Visualization
- Interactive graphs and charts leveraging all available data
- Behavioral pattern analysis and correlation discovery
- Physiological data integration and trend analysis
- User-friendly insights for self-reflection and awareness
- Longitudinal progress tracking and milestone visualization

### 4. Connect - Clinical and Community Integration
- Clinician oversight and interaction capabilities
- Community features for peer support (future development)
- Professional resource integration
- Crisis intervention and safety planning

### 5. Settings - App Configuration
- Account and privacy management
- Notification preferences and crisis settings
- App accessibility and customization options
- Data export and deletion controls

## Core System Architecture

### Reflective Module Engine
- **Starter Modules**: 5 formulaic, structured modules exploring user identity and relationships
- **Dynamic Generation**: AI-powered module creation based on user data and themes
- **Engagement Quality**: Semantic analysis to ensure thoughtful responses
- **Adaptive Progression**: Module flows that adapt to user history and context

### Data and Memory Layer
- Persistent user memory with summarized insights and frequent topics
- All reflection and log entries are embedded and indexed for semantic search
- Cross-modal data correlation (behavioral + physiological + contextual)
- Contextual data injection into all reflective flows

### Clinical Safety and Privacy
- Crisis keyword detection and appropriate response
- Risk assessment using validated proxy measures
- Secure, privacy-first data handling and user control
- Professional oversight integration capabilities

## Development Phases

- Implement basic Home screen with Duolingo-style pathway wireframe
- Create 5 structured starter modules with interactive journaling
- Implement semantic analysis for engagement quality assessment
- Set up basic logging system with freeform journaling
- Create Analytics wireframe
- Set up Connect tab wireframe for future development
- Implement basic Settings functionality

### Phase 2: Core Features (v0.3.0 - v0.5.0)
- Expand logging system with meal and behavior logging
- Implement dynamic tagging system using contextual analysis
- Add metadata capture (heart rate, step count, geolocation)
- Create pattern recognition system for cross-modal data correlation
- Build rich analytics platform with interactive visualizations
- Implement dynamic module generation based on user themes
- Add physiological data integration and trend analysis
- Create crisis detection and response system

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (v0.6.0 - v1.0.0)
