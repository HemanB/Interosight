# InteroSight Roadmap

## Project Direction

InteroSight is an mHealth application for eating disorder recovery, centered on a data-driven, adaptive reflection module system. The application leverages user-generated data, semantic modeling, and guided reflection to facilitate self-understanding and longitudinal insight. The core value proposition is not static education, but the facilitation of meaningful, structured self-reflection through adaptive, evidence-informed modules that evolve based on user data and engagement patterns.

## Product Architecture

### 1. Home - Journey-Based Progress & Analytics
- Duolingo-style pathway interface showing reflective modules as a journey
- 5 structured starter modules exploring user identity, relationships, and life fulfillment
- Dynamic module generation based on user data and previous responses
- Interactive journaling with semantic analysis for engagement quality
- Progress visualization and achievement tracking
- Integrated analytics insights and data visualization
- Streak and engagement metrics

### 2. Connect - Clinical and Community Integration
- Clinician oversight and interaction capabilities
- Community features for peer support (future development)
- Professional resource integration
- Crisis intervention and safety planning

### 3. Logging - Dynamic Multi-Modal Capture
- **Freeform Journaling**: Open-ended reflection with semantic tagging
- **Meal Logging**: Food intake tracking with behavioral context
- **Behavior Logging**: Eating disorder behaviors and triggers
- **Dynamic Tagging**: Automatic categorization using contextual analysis
- **Metadata Capture**: Heart rate, step count, geolocation, temporal data
- **Pattern Recognition**: Cross-referencing behaviors with physiological data

### 4. Resources - Regulation and Crisis Tools
- **Emergency & Crisis**: Emergency contacts, crisis hotlines, safety planning
- **Therapeutic Tools**: DBT tools, grounding exercises, coping strategies
- **Professional Support**: Therapist finder, treatment centers, support groups
- **Education & Wellness**: Educational resources, self-care tools

### 5. Settings - App Configuration
- Account and privacy management
- Notification preferences and crisis settings
- App accessibility and customization options
- Data export and deletion controls

## Core System Architecture

### Reflective Module Engine
- **Starter Modules**: 5 formulaic, structured modules exploring user identity and relationships
- **Dynamic Generation**: AI-powered module creation based on user data and themes
- **Engagement Quality**: Semantic analysis to ensure thoughtful responses
- **Adaptive Progression**: Module flows that adapt to user history and context

### Data and Memory Layer
- Persistent user memory with summarized insights and frequent topics
- All reflection and log entries are embedded and indexed for semantic search
- Cross-modal data correlation (behavioral + physiological + contextual)
- Contextual data injection into all reflective flows

### Clinical Safety and Privacy
- Crisis keyword detection and appropriate response
- Risk assessment using validated proxy measures
- Secure, privacy-first data handling and user control
- Professional oversight integration capabilities

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Set up new 5-tab navigation structure (Home, Connect, Logging, Resources, Settings)
- Implement basic Home screen with Duolingo-style pathway wireframe
- Create 5 structured starter modules with interactive journaling
- Implement semantic analysis for engagement quality assessment
- Set up basic logging system with freeform journaling
- Integrate analytics insights into Home screen
- Set up Connect tab wireframe for future development
- Implement basic Settings functionality

### Phase 2: Core Features
- Expand logging system with meal and behavior logging
- Implement dynamic tagging system using contextual analysis
- Add metadata capture (heart rate, step count, geolocation)
- Create pattern recognition system for cross-modal data correlation
- Build rich analytics platform with interactive visualizations in Home
- Implement dynamic module generation based on user themes
- Add physiological data integration and trend analysis
- Create crisis detection and response system

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Implement advanced risk assessment and pattern recognition
- Add clinician oversight capabilities in Connect tab
- Build professional reporting tools
- Create community features for peer support
- Implement advanced analytics and insights in Home
- Add longitudinal progress tracking and milestone visualization

## Success Metrics

- Risk score trends and crisis intervention effectiveness
- User-reported insight and qualitative growth
- Professional treatment engagement
- Behavioral pattern recognition accuracy

### Technical Performance
- Application stability and reliability
- Response time for LLM interactions
- Data synchronization and privacy compliance
- Cross-modal data correlation accuracy

This roadmap reflects a commitment to a clinically grounded, data-driven, and adaptive approach to supporting eating disorder recovery through structured reflection and insight generation, with a focus on creating meaningful user engagement through personalized, evolving content.
